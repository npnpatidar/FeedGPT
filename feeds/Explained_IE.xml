            <title>Jharkhand launches drive to grant land titles under FRA: Why now, challenges</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-land-titles-fra-9017751/</link>
            <description>The Jharkhand government has launched a special drive called Abua Bir Dishom Abhiyan to provide land title certificates to individuals and communities under the Forests Rights Act. The act grants self-cultivation and habitation rights to Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers. The drive has been initiated after nine years and aims to address the low number of land title distributions in the state compared to Chhattisgarh. The government is setting up a dedicated website and mobile application to streamline the claims generation and distribution process. However, there are challenges such as the need for policy-level implementation and a hierarchical problem in the verification process. The government is working with knowledge and technology partners to overcome these challenges.</description>

            <title>Trump ahead of Biden in key US states, finds survey: What it means, why it matters</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/doanld-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-support-explained-9017695/</link>
            <description>A recent survey conducted by Siena College and The New York Times shows that former US President Donald Trump is leading current President Joe Biden in five out of six crucial swing states for the 2024 US Presidential elections. These swing states include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The survey, which polled more than 3,662 voters, found that 48% of respondents would vote for Trump in the next election, while 44% supported Biden's reelection bid. Additionally, 59% of respondents disapproved of Biden's handling of his job as president, while 38% approved. The survey also revealed that 67% of respondents believed the country was headed in the wrong direction. However, despite Trump's unfavorable reputation, voters believed he could do a better job than Biden in areas such as the economy, immigration, national security, and the Israel-Palestine issue. The survey also highlighted that the traditional support base for the Democratic Party, including women, younger people, and people of color, seemed less supportive of Biden in these swing states. The article also clarifies the significance of swing states in the US election process and notes that pre-election polls have been known to be inaccurate in the past. It also mentions that Biden's approval rating has declined from 53% in January 2021 to around 38%.</description>

            <title>10 things Delhi-NCR needs to do to tackle air pollution: What an IIT Kanpur study said</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ten-things-delhi-ncr-needs-tackle-air-pollution-9017406/</link>
            <description>The Supreme Court has reprimanded the governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan for allowing farmers to burn stubble, contributing to the poor air quality in the Delhi-NCR region. The court also directed the Delhi government to ensure that municipal solid waste is not burned in the city. These comments come after the Delhi government announced the implementation of the odd-even scheme for cars to reduce vehicular emissions.

While these measures may temporarily reduce pollution levels, a comprehensive study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur suggests that more preventive steps need to be taken to significantly improve air quality in Delhi and its surrounding areas. The study recommends ten measures to control air pollution, including stopping the use of coal in hotels and restaurants, providing access to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for cooking, and eliminating the burning of municipal solid waste.

Other measures include covering construction materials at construction sites, using windbreakers and telescopic chutes during concrete batching, promoting the use of electric and BS-VI vehicles, installing De-SOx-ing and De-NOx-ing systems at power plants, and implementing vapour recovery systems at petrol pumps. The study also emphasizes the need to limit biomass burning and tackle fly ash, which is a major contributor to PM10 pollution during summers.

Implementing these measures is expected to bring down PM2.5 and PM10 levels to acceptable standards. It is crucial for all stakeholders to work together to address the air pollution crisis and protect the health and well-being of the residents of Delhi and its neighboring regions.</description>

    <item><title>A daily glass of goat milk? Hereâ€™s what you need to know.</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goat-milk-gujarat-9017201/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Agriculture Minister of Gujarat, Raghavji Patel, has proposed branding and marketing goat milk, which is currently sold informally. A meeting was held with representatives from various organizations to discuss the potential for goat milk in the state. According to a survey by the Gujarat Animal Husbandry Directorate, the state's goat population is estimated to be 50.55 lakh in 2021-22, with a milk production of 3.39 lakh tonnes. This accounts for around 2% of the state's total milk production. Amul, the Gujarat State Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, expressed interest in processing and marketing goat milk if the Surendranagar District Co-operative Milk Producers' Union agrees to take up the job of collection. Procurement by Amul could benefit goat and sheep herders, as it would create better returns for pastoralists and make goat milk available in a potentially large market. However, goats may not be viable as solely milch animals due to the low quantity of milk they produce daily. Pastoralists rear goats for both milk and meat, and some goats will still end up in slaughterhouses to maintain herd viability. Goat milk has health benefits, including being similar to breast milk in fat content and being easily digestible for humans. Doctors also prescribe goat milk for neonates and lactose-intolerant individuals.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 09:43:12 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/goat-milk.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/goat-milk.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>PM 2.5, Sulphur Dioxide, and more: What are the pollutants in our air, and how they impact health</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/air-pollution-aqi-source-health-impact-explained-9016879/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the rising pollution levels in North India and the focus on the Air Quality Index (AQI) score as a measure of air pollution. Delhi recently recorded a severe AQI score of over 400, indicating a state of at least moderate pollution. The AQI combines data on various pollutants, including PM 10, PM 2.5, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon, and more. It explains what each of these pollutants is, where they come from, and how they can impact human health. For example, PM 2.5 particles are extremely fine and can easily enter the circulatory system, leading to chronic diseases such as asthma, heart attacks, and respiratory problems. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fuel and can aggravate respiratory diseases and contribute to the development of asthma. Ozone, while present in the upper atmosphere, becomes a significant air pollutant at surface levels and can increase the risk of hospital admissions for certain diseases. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is emitted by burning fossil fuels and can harm the cardiovascular system and cause respiratory illnesses. Ammonia (NH3), largely from fertilizer use and livestock waste in India, can contribute to aerosol pollution and harm air and water quality. Lead (Pb) is a naturally occurring toxic metal that becomes dangerous in increased quantities, particularly for children who may experience permanent intellectual disability and other disorders. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas given off when carbon-containing fuels are burned, and high levels can be fatal while long-term exposure increases the risk of heart disease.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 06:20:34 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/ch1796529.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/ch1796529.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Can Delhiâ€™s odd-even policy help in preventing health issues? Hereâ€™s what experts, studies say</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/delhi-odd-even-policy-health-impact-pollution-explained-9016616/</link><description>Hmm, based on the provided text, there is evidence that the odd-even vehicle policy in Delhi can lead to a decrease in particulate matter levels, although the reduction achieved may not be sufficient to address health-related impacts. The reduction in emissions doesn't always result in a proportional reduction in pollutant concentration due to factors like wind speed. The studies mentioned in the article show a decrease of around 5 to 10% in particulate matter levels during the implementation of the odd-even scheme. However, it is important to note that long-term exposure to pollution can still have harmful effects on health, even with a small reduction in pollution levels. To address the issue of air pollution in the long term, measures such as phasing out BS-IV vehicles, promoting electric vehicles, and implementing regional solutions are suggested.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 03:17:09 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/ch1091847.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/ch1091847.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Odd-even scheme back in Delhi: Has it helped bring down air pollution in the past?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odd-even-scheme-delhi-pollution-impact-explained-9016587/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi government has announced the implementation of the odd-even road apportioning scheme for a week after Diwali due to the worsening air pollution. The average air quality index (AQI) in Delhi has been consistently above 450, categorized as "severe" and "severe plus." The odd-even scheme allows cars to ply on alternate days based on their registration number, with the aim of reducing the number of vehicles on the road. This will be the fourth time the scheme is implemented in Delhi. The details of the new scheme are yet to be announced.

The odd-even scheme was previously tried in 2016 and 2019, with exemptions for certain categories of vehicles such as taxis, electric and hybrid vehicles, and two-wheelers. There are an estimated 75 lakh active Delhi-registered vehicles, and around 12.5 lakh cars could potentially go off the roads each day during the scheme. Additionally, approximately 20 lakh vehicles registered in the NCR cities or elsewhere also ply in Delhi.

Delhi faces multiple factors contributing to its air pollution crisis. Its geographical position traps pollutants easily, combined with falling temperatures and slow wind speeds that prevent dissipation. The burning of stubble in Punjab and Haryana adds to the smog during this time, acting as a force multiplier. Farm fires have contributed up to 40% of the PM 2.5 concentration in the past. Vehicles are another significant source, contributing up to 30% of the city's annual PM 2.5 concentration.

The efficacy of the odd-even scheme in reducing air pollution has been debated. An analysis of the 2019 scheme showed a significant decrease in average AQI in Delhi compared to neighboring cities where the scheme wasn't implemented. However, experts mention that determining the exact impact of individual measures on air pollution is challenging, as air quality depends on various factors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 02:49:56 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/delhi-odd-even.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/delhi-odd-even.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Delhi odd-even scheme: Its impact on vehicular pollution levels, and why it is not a silver bullet</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-pollution-odd-even-scheme-no-silver-bullet-given-the-exemptions-but-cuts-toxic-emissions-9016425/</link><description>The article discusses the limitations of reducing the number of vehicles on the road as a solution to air pollution. While this action can help reduce peak pollution levels, it is not a comprehensive solution because two-wheelers and taxis, which contribute significantly to emissions, are exempted. Transport is the top contributor to pollutants, and it cannot be ignored when air quality is severe. Experts argue that it is difficult to estimate exactly how much pollution would come down with this scheme due to various factors such as exemptions and the effectiveness of the intervention. A study on a previous odd-even scheme implemented in Delhi showed that it had failed to mitigate air pollution effectively. The article emphasizes that emergency actions like reducing vehicles on the road are not a silver bullet for improving air quality and should be seen as part of a larger set of measures. The transport sector is a major contributor to pollutants in Delhi, and all vehicles should be included in such interventions for them to make a significant difference.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 23:10:18 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Traffic-on-the-Delhi-Gurgaon-Expressway-on-Monday-morning.-Air-quality-in-Delhi-continued-to-remain-in-â€˜severe-category-for-the-fifth-consecutive-day.-PTI.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Traffic-on-the-Delhi-Gurgaon-Expressway-on-Monday-morning.-Air-quality-in-Delhi-continued-to-remain-in-â€˜severe-category-for-the-fifth-consecutive-day.-PTI.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Expert Explains: What is a National Security Strategy and why India must have one</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-national-security-strategy-9016083/</link><description>India is in the process of drafting its first written National Security Strategy (NSS), according to a report in The Indian Express. The debate on whether such a document is needed has been ongoing for the past two decades. The NSS would encompass all aspects of security, including military, economic, internal, diplomatic, human, climate, food, and water security. It would require wide consultations and multiple iterations before being considered by the Cabinet Committee on Security. There would be two versions of the NSS, one for public release and one strictly classified. The rising stature of India in global affairs and its growth projections make the NSS an important exercise with ownership and approval at the highest levels of government. The NSS should be based on guiding principles derived from India's Constitution and should serve as a doctrine that guides lower-level doctrines and strategies. The drafting process should not be rushed, but rather take time to refine and adapt as circumstances change. A reasonable timeframe for completion could be two years from now.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 13:32:36 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/security-strategy.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/security-strategy.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>How did the watermelon become a symbol of the Palestine cause?

Its use stems from the fact that when sliced, the colors of the watermelon resemble the Palestinian flag. In Israel, displaying the Palestinian flag is often restricted, leading people to use watermelon as a substitute symbol. This practice gained popularity during the First Intifada, a period of resistance against Israeli occupation. However, there is debate about the true origins of using watermelon as a political statement. The use of watermelon as a symbol of resistance is not mentioned in literature related to the First Intifada, and some claim it is a contemporary myth propagated on social media. Despite the uncertainty surrounding its origin, the watermelon is widely accepted today as a symbol of Palestinian resistance.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 13:13:33 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/palestine-watermelon-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/palestine-watermelon-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>â€˜Deepfakeâ€™ video showing Rashmika Mandanna: How to identify fake videos</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/deepfake-video-rashmika-mandanna-how-identify-9015867/</link><description>The article discusses a controversial video that went viral, supposedly showing actress Rashmika Mandanna entering an elevator. However, it is revealed that the video is a 'deepfake' - a manipulated video where the actress's face was inserted onto the body of British Indian girl Zara Patel. The Union Minister for Electronics &amp; Technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, expressed concerns about deepfakes being a dangerous form of misinformation and called for their regulation on social media platforms.

With advancements in artificial intelligence, deepfakes have become more common on the internet. The article provides tips on how to spot deepfakes, including unnatural eye movements, mismatches in color and lighting, comparing audio quality with visual content, strange body shape or movement, artificial facial movements, unnatural positioning of facial features, awkward posture or physique, and running a reverse image search to check the source of the video.

Overall, the article highlights the growing issue of deepfakes and the need for vigilance when consuming online content.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 11:28:59 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/rashmika-1600-fb.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/rashmika-1600-fb.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Sri Lankaâ€™s batter Angelo Mathews timed out: What is the rule?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/sri-lanka-angelo-mathews-timed-out-9015903/</link><description>During a World Cup match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Sri Lankan player Angelo Mathews became the first player in international cricket to be timed out.

GRAP is a set of emergency measures that are implemented when the air quality reaches a certain threshold. Stage 4 is activated when the Air Quality Index (AQI) rises to the 'Severe+' category (AQI &gt;450). As part of the measures, the use of diesel four-wheelers that are not BS-VI compliant and the entry of trucks in Delhi are prohibited. Construction and demolition activities are also banned, and state governments may decide to discontinue physical classes and allow employees to work from home. The Delhi government has directed schools to suspend physical classes, except for classes 10 and 12, until November 10, and will reintroduce the odd-even scheme from November 13-20.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 11:11:09 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/GRAP-STAGE-4.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/GRAP-STAGE-4.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Bhutan Kingâ€™s India visit: Recalling Operation All Clear, which Bhutan launched against Assamâ€™s insurgent groups</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bhutan-king-visit-india-recalling-operation-all-clear-9015464/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:39:07 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Choerten_am_Dochu-La-Pass_in_Bhutan.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Choerten_am_Dochu-La-Pass_in_Bhutan.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - NFSA and PMâ€™s promise of free foodgrains for five years: what it means and entails</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/nfsa-free-foodgrains-five-years-modi-9015523/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 07:08:19 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Narendra-Modi.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Narendra-Modi.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>The double-whammy from Indiaâ€™s falling farm exports</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-double-whammy-from-falling-farm-exports-9015094/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India's agricultural exports have declined by 11.6% in April-September compared to the previous year, mainly due to government-imposed bans and restrictions on various commodities. The value of farm commodity exports during this period was $23.6 billion, lower than the $26.7 billion recorded in the same period last year. Import values also decreased from $19.3 billion to $16.2 billion, resulting in a slight decline in the agricultural trade surplus. 

In recent years, India experienced a declining trend in agricultural exports, which reversed in 2021-22 and 2022-23 when record highs of $50.2 billion and $53.2 billion were reached, respectively. However, both exports and imports are expected to decrease in 2023-24 due to easing global prices and improved supply chains after the Russia-Ukraine war. 

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Price Index (FPI) shows a strong correlation with India's agricultural exports, as they tend to follow movements in global prices. The FPI rose significantly in 2021-22 and 2022-23 but has averaged lower in the current fiscal year. 

Apart from global price fluctuations, government restrictions on exports have contributed to the decline in farm exports. Bans and duties were imposed on wheat, rice, and sugar shipments, affecting their export quantities. Consequently, wheat exports have reduced significantly, non-basmati rice exports have declined by 15.9%, and sugar exports have more than halved in the current fiscal year.

The decline in international prices not only affects the competitiveness of India's agricultural exports but also makes its farmers vulnerable to import competition. This is evident in the cotton and edible oil sectors, where falling prices have led to a decrease in cotton exports and an increase in imports. Similarly, the value of edible oil imports has doubled between 2019-20 and 2022-23 due to soaring global prices, although prices have since collapsed.

The Modi government's focus on controlling food inflation and prioritizing consumer interests over producers has resulted in continued imports of edible oil and pulses, along with export restrictions on cereals, sugar, and onions. This situation poses a double challenge for farmers in India.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 02:30:35 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/farmers-exports.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/farmers-exports.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>A political history of Chhattisgarh: From Ajit Jogi to Bhupesh Baghel</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/bhupesh-baghel-political-history-of-chhattisgarh-ajit-jogi-raman-singh-creation-of-a-new-state-9015135/</link><description>The article provides a summary of the political history of Chhattisgarh, a mineral-rich state in India.

The visit has raised concerns in India as Bhutan made declarations about seeking a quick settlement of the border dispute and establishing diplomatic relations with China. India was caught off guard by these statements. The border talks between Bhutan and China had been unsuccessful in the past, and the 25th round of talks was held after a seven-year gap following the Doklam standoff in 2017. The severity of the border conflict led to the suspension of talks, which were further disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

China had reacted with shock and alarm to the Doklam standoff, and the Galwan clash in 2020 was seen as an attempt to avenge the crisis and solidify Chinese control in the region. China also blames India for the failure of its border talks with Bhutan. Only Bhutan and India among China's 14 neighboring countries have a disputed boundary. China has accused India of obstructing progress in resolving the border issue and preventing Bhutan from establishing diplomatic relations with China.

During the seven-year period, Bhutan and China maintained active engagement, and a three-step roadmap to advance the border talks was signed in 2021. Bhutan aims to gain diplomatic, economic, and political benefits by normalizing relations with China, including establishing diplomatic ties with a P5 country and expanding its diplomatic missions beyond its current limited scope.

India's main concern regarding Bhutan's relations with China is the strategic implications. India is worried that China may pressure Bhutan to give away access or control over the Doklam plateau, which is close to India's strategic Siliguri Corridor. The speed with which China and Bhutan have made progress in their border talks has raised alarms in India. Chinese scholars and analysts view the success with Bhutan as a major diplomatic breakthrough in South Asia and believe that China could use Bhutan as leverage against India.

In summary, the recent visit of the King of Bhutan to India has raised concerns as Bhutan seeks to normalize relations with China and resolve its border dispute. India is worried about the strategic implications and potential loss of control over the Doklam plateau. China sees its success with Bhutan as a significant diplomatic breakthrough.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 15:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Bhutan-India-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Bhutan-India-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Jammu-Poonch highway upgradation: Security significance of the project, and the milestone BRO achieved recently</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jammu-poonch-highway-upgradation-security-significance-9014634/</link><description>The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has achieved a breakthrough in a tunnel along the National Highway 144A in Jammu and Kashmir. This tunnel is part of a project to upgrade the highway from two lanes to four lanes, providing better road connectivity to border districts and reducing travel time. The project is being executed by the National Highway and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) and the Border Roads Organisation. The work on the Akhnoor to Poonch stretch includes the construction of four tunnels and is divided into eight packages.

The exact timeline for the strategy's completion is unknown, but multiple ministries have already submitted their inputs. This will be India's first national security strategy document, which will outline the country's security objectives and ways to achieve them, while also addressing traditional and non-traditional threats. The strategy will guide military and defense reforms and provide a comprehensive view of national security. It is expected to encompass various challenges and threats, including financial and economic security, information warfare, and vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure. Many developed countries, including the US, UK, Russia, China, and Pakistan, already have national security strategies in place. The need for an Indian strategy has been discussed for years, and the recent urgency stems from rising geopolitical tensions and growing uncertainties. Experts have emphasized that military reforms should ideally stem from a national security strategy, and three past attempts to develop one have failed. Some believe hesitations at the political level may have contributed to the delay.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 11:13:29 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/PTI10_29_2023_000408B.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/PTI10_29_2023_000408B.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Despite govtâ€™s efforts, why onion prices remain high</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/despite-govts-efforts-why-onion-prices-remain-high-9014412/</link><description>Despite efforts by the Indian government to control onion prices, they continue to rise. The government imposed an export duty and a minimum export price, and also created a buffer stock of onions. However, these measures have not been effective in cooling down the price of onions. The late arrival of the monsoon and extensive damage to the harvested crop earlier in the year are the main reasons for the high prices. The delayed monsoon also caused a delay in the transplanting of the kharif crop, further contributing to the supply chain mismatch. The arrival of the new onion crop is too small to make a significant impact on prices, and traders and farmers do not expect a change in the trend anytime soon.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 10:32:56 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/onions-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/onions-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Pakistanâ€™s complicated relationship with the two Talibans</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistans-relationship-taliban-ttp-9014085/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Pakistani forces have successfully thwarted a terrorist attack on the Mianwali Training Air Base of the Pakistan Air Force. The Tehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan (TJP), an affiliate of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attack. This comes at a time when Pakistan is forcibly expelling Afghan refugees, drawing criticism from the UN and rights groups. Militant and terrorist activity in Pakistan has surged in recent years, with the TTP becoming the largest militant organization fighting against the Pakistani state. The rise of the TTP can be traced back to Pakistan's support of Islamic fundamentalism and its delicate balancing act between supporting the Taliban and appeasing the US. Despite friendly relations with the Afghan Taliban, they have not helped Pakistan deal with the TTP, leading to increased attacks on military installations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:50:33 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Taliban.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Taliban.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Can a trans woman invoke the Domestic Violence Act?

The study emphasizes the importance of local decision-making to ensure ongoing care for hypertension patients. The national data shows that a large proportion of those with hypertension do not get diagnosed, treated, or have their blood pressure under control. At the state level, the prevalence of hypertension in the southern states was higher than the national average, but the proportion of people on treatment and with controlled blood pressure was also higher in these states. Additionally, there were significant variations within districts, with different proportions of diagnosed and treated individuals. Age, gender, education, and socio-economic conditions also influenced the levels of care received. The district-level data can help state governments allocate resources more effectively. The researchers recommend adjusting healthcare systems to address the specific needs of chronic conditions like hypertension and ensuring regular access to medications. The report also highlights the need for active screening, easy accessibility to treatment, and follow-up care to control hypertension in India.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 14:17:41 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/hypertension.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/hypertension.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Elvish Yadav case: How is snake venom used as a recreational drug?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/elvish-yadav-snake-venom-recreational-drug-9013339/</link><description>Elvish Yadav, the winner of reality television show Bigg Boss OTT and a popular YouTuber, has been booked by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police for his alleged involvement in the sale of snake venom at rave parties in the National Capital Region. The police recovered a significant amount of snake venom and various snakes from Yadav. Snake venom is often used as a recreational drug, and its smuggling is a lucrative illicit industry. However, there is a lack of scientific studies on the recreational use of snake venom. In India, snake venom is typically consumed by deliberately getting bitten by snakes, such as cobras and Indian kraits. The effects of snake venom on the human body include jerky movements, blurred vision, blackout, heightened arousal, and a sense of well-being. However, after the effects wear off, users may experience irritation, lethargy, and drug cravings. Snake venom may give a high due to its neurotoxin nature, which causes analgesia and binds to receptors in the brain associated with euphoria. The recreational use of snake venom is dangerous as it can lead to addiction and potentially fatal consequences.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 11:42:30 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/snake-venom.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/snake-venom.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>UNESCO declares Gwalior the â€˜city of musicâ€™: a look at its illustrious musical tradition</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/unesco-gwalior-music-history-9013053/</link><description>GPT-3.5: Gwalior, a city in Madhya Pradesh, has been added to UNESCO's Creative Cities Network for its strong commitment to culture and creativity. The city has a rich musical past, with the Gwalior gharana being the oldest musical gharana in Indian music history. The gharana flourished under the patronage of Raja Man Singh Tomar during the 15th century. The gharana's influence can be seen in the emergence of khayal singing, which incorporated elements of qawwali. Notable musicians from the Gwalior gharana include Mian Tansen and Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan. The gharana's techniques and nuances continue to be taught and practiced in Hindustani classical music today.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 08:44:32 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/tansen.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/tansen.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - What is the Advocate-on-Record system in the Supreme Court?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/advocate-on-record-supreme-court-9013055/</link><description>The Supreme Court recently dismissed a public interest litigation filed by an Advocate-on-Record (AoR) and criticized the lawyer for treating AoR as merely a "signing authority." The Court called for a comprehensive plan to reform the AoR system in collaboration with the Bar. AoRs are a category of elite lawyers based in Delhi who have the exclusive right to file cases before the Supreme Court. They act as the link between litigants and the highest court in the country. To become an AoR, advocates must meet certain eligibility criteria and pass a challenging examination set by the Court. Around 200-250 lawyers clear the exam each year. An AoR must have an office within a 16-kilometer radius of the Supreme Court and employ a registered clerk. While any lawyer can practice before any court or tribunal in the country under the Advocates Act, Article 145 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to make rules and regulate its own procedure. The AoR system is similar to the British practice of barristers and solicitors, where barristers argue cases while solicitors handle clients. In India, senior advocates are designated by the Court and are briefed by other lawyers, such as AoRs.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 07:55:46 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1748154.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1748154.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Operation Cactus: When India prevented a coup in Maldives</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/operation-cactus-india-prevented-coup-maldives-9012435/</link><description>The article discusses India's intervention in the 1988 coup attempt in the Maldives, known as Operation Cactus. The coup was led by Maldivian businessman Abdullah Luthufee and Ahmed "Sagaru" Nasir, with support from Uma Maheswaran, the leader of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). They arrived in the capital city of MalÃ© with a group of fighters and successfully captured important infrastructure, while President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom sought refuge.

India became involved in the coup after receiving SOS messages, and a crisis committee meeting was held. The Indian army's 50th Independent Parachute Brigade, led by Brigadier Farukh Bulsara, was activated, and the operation was designated to Colonel Subhash C Joshi. Indian soldiers, along with the High Commissioner Arun Bannerjee, were flown to the Maldives and landed at HulhulÃ©. The landing caused the rebels to overestimate the Indian troops' strength, leading them to abandon their mission and flee.

Indian paratroopers secured the airport and then proceeded to rescue President Gayoom on the neighboring island of MalÃ©. Some rebels hijacked a merchant vessel to escape, but they were pursued by the Indian Navy. After negotiations, the rebels surrendered, and they were taken aboard an Indian ship.

The attempted coup resulted in the deaths of 19 people, and the captured rebels were arrested, interrogated, and put on trial. Some were sentenced to death, but this was later commuted at the request of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

Despite rising anti-India sentiments in the Maldives, the memories of India's intervention in the 1988 coup are still remembered with gratitude and fondness. The relationship between India and the Maldives has remained strong, and even President-elect Mohamed Muizzu has expressed his intent to enhance bilateral relations with India after his election win.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 02:37:47 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Rajiv-Gayoom.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Rajiv-Gayoom.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Israel-Hamas war: Is Russia benefiting from the conflict?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-russia-benefit-9012443/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Russia officially blames the US for the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel, as well as tensions across the wider Middle East. However, experts believe that Russia's interests actually diverge from its official stance. Russian experts argue that Russia benefits from the conflict and wants it to drag on, as it harms its adversary, the US. They also suggest that Russia is pleased with the shift in global attention from Ukraine to the Middle East. These experts believe that Russian propaganda may take advantage of the conflict to frighten the Russian population and imply that the West is to blame for a potential larger war. Additionally, Russia may use the conflict to showcase its close ties with the Islamic world, despite a lack of tangible influence in the region. There are disagreements about whether Russia will face internal turmoil as a result of the conflict. While some believe recent anti-Semitic attacks in Muslim-majority Russian regions pose a problem, others argue that the conflict will have a negative impact on Russia politically. Economically, Russia will not benefit either, as oil prices are temporarily falling due to a lack of support from oil-producing countries for the Palestinians. Russia's recent contacts with Hamas are seen as serving different goals, such as Putin's personal offense against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not siding with Russia in the war against Ukraine. However, this approach could harm Russia's standing in Israel, where a significant population speaks Russian and has ties to the country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 01:30:18 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Putin.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Putin.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Experts Explain: How to fix Mumbaiâ€™sÂ air</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/experts-explain-how-to-fix-mumbais-air-9012581/</link><description>The article discusses the poor air quality in Mumbai, with 66 instances of a poor Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded in 16 areas of the city between October 1 and 30. Sion had the highest number of bad air days followed by Andheri and Mazagaon. On some days, Mumbai's AQI readings were worse than Delhi's. Last winter, the AQI in Mumbai was poor or worse for 66 days between November 2022 and January 2023. Despite being surrounded by the sea, Mumbai's air quality is affected by a combination of natural and man-made factors. The calm air after the monsoon season and a lack of wind reversal contribute to the poor air quality. Experts believe that the problem is temporary and will improve once construction projects are completed and dust mitigation measures are implemented. The article suggests the need for denser air quality monitoring using sensor-based AQI monitoring units that provide hyperlocal data. The author also proposes the establishment of an independent commission for managing AQI and involving academic institutions in finding solutions. Delays in traffic congestion and emissions studies are also highlighted as areas that need attention. The article mentions the success of similar initiatives in Delhi and London, and the need for a larger network of monitoring stations in Mumbai. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of involving engineers, scientists, health experts, and legal advisers in addressing air pollution. The experts mentioned in the article are Dr. Gufran Beig and Dr. Sachchida Nand Tripathi, who are renowned air pollution experts in India.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 01:22:45 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/air-pollution-in-Mumbai-2.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/air-pollution-in-Mumbai-2.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Farm fires and weather behind choke; respite likely in 4 days</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/farm-fires-and-weather-behind-choke-respite-likely-in-4-days-9012568/</link><description>The article discusses the increase in agricultural waste burning in Punjab and its impact on the smog and haze situation in Delhi. The burning usually lasts for about two weeks, but this year it started on October 31st and is expected to continue for some time. The article highlights that the only hope for improvement in air quality is a change in meteorological conditions. Currently, the anti-cyclonic circulation is preventing pollutant particles from escaping and keeping them near the surface. The article also mentions that nearly 40% of all burning events in Punjab have occurred in the first three days of November. The main culprits for the pollution are emissions from Punjab and meteorological factors that push pollutants into Delhi. The article explains that the boundary layer, which helps disperse pollutants upwards, has become shallower, reducing the ability to push pollutants away. The article concludes that respite could come from better wind speed or rainfall, but neither is currently forecasted. However, there is hope that a western disturbance event expected around November 7th could change the wind systems and result in the dispersion of pollutants. The article notes that the air quality early warning system predicts an improvement in the situation by November 8th.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 22:35:14 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/exP1-Pollution-5col.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/exP1-Pollution-5col.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Delhi chokes on pollution: Will masks protect you?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/masks-protect-delhi-air-pollution-9012318/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Air pollution is a growing problem in cities in India, with masks becoming a common winter accessory. However, most cloth and surgical masks are ineffective against the small pollution particles that can enter the lungs and bloodstream. A report published in The Lancet states that around 1.67 million deaths in India in 2019 were attributed to air pollution, accounting for 17.8% of total deaths. Deaths due to household air pollution have decreased, but deaths due to ambient air pollution have increased. While N-95 masks can offer some protection against particulate matter when worn properly, they are impractical for constant use. A study from the USA shows that an N-95 mask may reduce exposure to particulate matter by a factor of 14, while a study from Vietnam shows a 60% reduction in exposure to ultra-fine particles. However, proper fit and minimal air leakage are crucial for effectiveness. Masks cannot protect against gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Surgical and cloth masks should be avoided, and N-95 or N-99 masks with a good fit and adjustable straps should be selected. It is important to ensure a proper seal by covering the nose and mouth, pinching the metal pin on the nose, and changing the mask frequently. Cracked or wet masks are not effective.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:02:07 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Masks.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Masks.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Delhiâ€™s air pollution steadily worsening since 2021: Four key findings of a new air quality study</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-air-pollution-pm-level-study-9012253/</link><description>Hmm, based on the provided text, the study conducted by Respirer Reports analyzed the PM 2.5 levels in major Indian cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Bengaluru, and Chennai.

The Reserve Bank of India's Department of Economic and Policy Research warns that up to 4.5% of India's GDP could be at risk by 2030 due to lost labor hours from climate change issues. Additionally, a World Bank paper highlights the macro-level effects of air pollution on GDP, while a Lancet study shows large economic losses in low per-capita GDP states. The costs of poor air quality include lower labor productivity, reduced consumer footfall, decreased asset productivity, increased health expenses, welfare losses, and premature mortality. A report estimates that air pollution costs Indian businesses about $95 billion annually, equivalent to 3% of the country's GDP. The challenge for India is urgent as it is home to over 20 of the world's 30 most polluted cities. Air pollution also affects indoor jobs such as call centers, with studies showing decreased worker productivity in polluted environments. This is particularly concerning for India, where the services sector accounts for over 50% of GDP.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 11:49:16 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Mumbai-air-pollution-6.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Mumbai-air-pollution-6.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Delhi chokes on pollution: What is AQI â€” and how is it measured?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-aqi-9011917/</link><description>The air pollution in Delhi-NCR and surrounding areas has worsened for the second day, bringing the Air Quality Index (AQI) back into focus. AQI is a measure of air quality, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. On Friday, the AQI in Delhi was an average of 471, while the previous day it reached the "severe" category, breaching the 400 mark. The AQI index was launched in India in 2014 and has six categories ranging from "good" to "severe". The AQI is calculated by transforming complex air quality data of pollutants into a single number and color code. Harmful pollutants include particulate matter (PM) 2.5, which can cause respiratory problems, reduced visibility, and chronic diseases. The AQI influences government policies and measures to combat pollution. In response to the severe AQI levels, the government of Delhi implemented the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), restricting the use of non-compliant diesel vehicles and trucks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 09:22:53 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/India_Air_Pollution_79189-82489.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/India_Air_Pollution_79189-82489.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What happens if you ignore a summons by the ED?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/ignore-ed-summons-arvind-kejriwal-9011774/</link><description>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has declined to appear before the Enforcement Directorate for questioning in regards to the Delhi excise policy case.

The Enforcement Directorate has summoned Kejriwal under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and he is legally bound to attend. The agency had previously filed a preliminary complaint stating that Kejriwal had spoken with one of the main accused in the case and asked him to continue working with another accused, who was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party. Kejriwal has asked the investigation officer to recall the vague summons, but the agency is likely to issue a fresh notice.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent sentencing of eight Indian nationals to death on charges of espionage in Qatar. This came as a shock to the Indian government, as Qatar rarely imposes death sentences. The charges against the Indians were not made public by Qatari authorities, but according to a report, they were accused of spying for Israel. The men were employees of Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services, a defense services provider company. They had been working in Qatar for several years and were involved in overseeing the induction of Italian submarines. The Indian Embassy in Doha was informed about their arrests in mid-September, and since then, the government has been providing consular and legal assistance to the detainees. The Ministry of External Affairs expressed shock at the death sentence and stated that they are exploring all legal options. The case is currently in the Court of First Instance, and India plans to challenge the verdict in higher courts and seek reprieve from the death penalty. The families of the convicted individuals have also filed a mercy plea with the Emir of Qatar. India's diplomatic efforts will be crucial in resolving the situation, given its multifaceted ties with Qatar. The two countries have strong economic and defense ties, and the Indian immigrants in Qatar are seen as law-abiding, which may help leverage goodwill within the country. However, the allegation of spying for Israel poses a challenge, considering the geopolitical sensitivities in the region.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 01:46:09 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/INDIAN-NAVY.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/INDIAN-NAVY.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Electoral bond scheme: Six years in limbo to six sessions over three days</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/electoral-bond-scheme-six-years-in-limbo-to-six-sessions-over-three-days-9011256/</link><description>The Supreme Court of India has declined to stay the electoral bonds scheme on two occasions, despite facing petitions challenging its legality.

A five-judge Constitution Bench heard the case and reserved its verdict after six sessions spread over three days. The court also emphasized that repeated applications seeking the same relief should not be entertained due to periodic intervals. The delay in addressing crucial cases involving the government has been criticized as "judicial evasion." The question of whether the law could have been introduced as a money Bill, which would impact various legislations including Aadhaar and amendments to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, remains pending before another 7-judge Constitution Bench.

Around 24,000 Afghans crossed the Torkham crossing into Afghanistan on Wednesday, and over 128,000 have left since the government's order. The government has faced appeals from the United Nations, rights groups, and western embassies to reconsider the decision. However, Pakistan maintains that these migrants are a burden on its resources and accuses them of being involved in terror attacks and crimes. The deportation order has triggered criticism within Pakistan, with some politicians and rights activists filing a petition against it. The Taliban has criticized the deportations, but they have also offered to help the returnees find jobs. Due to the fragile situation in Afghanistan, with issues like a collapsed economy, natural disasters, and human rights violations, the timing of the deportations is seen as unfavorable.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 14:31:45 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/afghan-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/afghan-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Bletchley Park: Where â€˜computersâ€™ helped the Allies win WWII, now hosting the worldâ€™s first AI summit</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bletchley-park-computers-ai-summit-wwii-9010886/</link><description>Bletchley Park, an English country house considered the birthplace of modern computing, is hosting the world's first global summit on artificial intelligence (AI). During World War II, Bletchley Park played a crucial role by decoding intercepted enemy messages, most notably breaking the supposedly unbreakable Enigma code. Alan Turing's Turing Bombe and Tommy Flowers' Colossus were key machines developed at Bletchley Park for this purpose. The efforts at Bletchley Park provided vital intelligence to the Allies, contributing significantly to their success in the war. The work done at Bletchley Park not only impacted history but also left behind a technological legacy that continues to influence modern computing and AI. Despite their invaluable contributions, the women who formed the majority of Bletchley Park's workforce were often overlooked and underpaid.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in India has released its annual report titled "Road Accidents in India - 2022." The report reveals that there were a total of 461,312 road accidents reported during the year, resulting in 168,491 deaths and 443,366 injuries. These numbers represent an increase of 11.9% in accidents, 9.4% in fatalities, and 15.3% in injuries compared to the previous year.

The report highlights several key findings, including the fact that over-speeding accounted for 72.3% of total road accidents, 71.2% of total deaths, and 72.8% of total injuries in 2022. Driving on the wrong side was the second-highest cause of accidents, accounting for 4.9% of all accidents.

Furthermore, the majority of accidents (67%) occurred on straight roads, surpassing the number of accidents on curved roads, roads with potholes, and roads with steep gradients combined. The most common type of collision was classified as 'hit from back,' which accounted for over 21% of all collisions, followed by 'head-on collisions' at 16.9%.

Weather conditions also played a role, with nearly three-fourths of all accidents and fatalities taking place under sunny or clear weather. Accidents occurring in adverse weather conditions, such as rain, fog, and hail, accounted for only about 16.6% of total road accidents in 2022.

Two-wheelers were involved in the highest number of accidents, with a total of 63,115 incidents reported, resulting in 25,228 deaths. Cars and pedestrians were the next most affected, with 29,005 accidents (10,174 deaths) and 20,513 accidents (10,160 deaths) respectively.

The report also introduced the concept of fatality rate, which measures road accidents relative to the vehicular population in a given location. Sikkim reported the highest fatality rate at 17, while Ladakh and Daman &amp; Diu had the lowest fatality rate at 0. The national fatality rate stood at 5.2.

Finally, Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of total accidents with 64,105 cases, representing a 15.1% increase from the previous year. This accounted for over 13% of all accidents reported in India. Madhya Pradesh followed closely behind, reporting 54,432 accidents.

It's important to note that the data presented in the report is based on reported cases, and the actual number of accidents and fatalities may be higher.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 08:48:13 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Road-Accident.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Road-Accident.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - AI Summit: Why new global pact on tackling Artificial Intelligence risks is a big deal</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/new-global-pact-artificial-intelligence-risks-9010265/</link><description>The world's first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Summit was held at Bletchley Park, the former top-secret base of codebreakers during World War II. The summit resulted in the Bletchley Park Declaration, with 28 major countries agreeing to address the risks of frontier AI models. The declaration acknowledged the potential for severe harm from AI misuse or control issues and emphasized the need for international cooperation. Additionally, US President Joe Biden issued an executive order to safeguard against AI threats and establish safety benchmarks. Different countries have varying approaches to AI regulation, with the EU proposing a new AI Act, the UK adopting a "light-touch" approach, and China implementing its own measures. The summit attendees discussed the weaponization of social media and the importance of ensuring AI represents safety and trust. India has been progressively pushing for AI regulation, calling for a global framework on ethical AI tools and considering risk-based regulations. This shift is reflected in consultation papers and upcoming legislation in the country.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 06:18:27 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Untitled-design-5.png" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Untitled-design-5.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - A â€˜land bridgeâ€™ across Thailandâ€™s Kra Isthmus: What is this centuries-old idea, resurrected again?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/land-bridge-thailand-kra-isthmus-9009594/</link><description>The Prime Minister of Thailand, Srettha Thavisin, is proposing a "land bridge" project called the Thai Land Bridge to connect the Indian Ocean Region and the waters of East Asia. This project aims to reduce sailing distances and provide an alternative to the congested shipping route through the Strait of Malacca. The land bridge would cut across the Isthmus of Kra, with two large-capacity ports or shipping terminals on either side, and include an east-west economic corridor with an oil pipeline.

The idea of connecting the two seas dates back to 1677 when King Narai the Great of the Ayutthaya Kingdom envisioned a canal across the Isthmus of Kra for rapid troop movement. However, previous attempts to bring this idea to fruition faced financial constraints. The current proposal estimates the project could cost around $27.44 billion and the Thai government is seeking investment from China.

If realized, the land bridge could save transportation costs, reduce piracy risks, and ease the strain on the Strait of Malacca. It is expected to create jobs and boost economic growth in the southern provinces of Thailand. However, there are challenges such as securing financing and potential concerns over deepening ties with China, which could impact relations with other countries like the United States, Japan, and India. There are also concerns about environmental damage and the impact on marine ecology and tourism.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 02:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Kra.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Kra.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>In Tripura-Bangladesh railway link, new opportunities and old connect</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-tripura-bangladesh-railway-link-new-opportunities-and-old-connect-9009936/</link><description>The Agartala-Akhaura rail link, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina, will connect Northeast India with Bangladesh.

This therapy, developed by ImmunoACT, a company incubated by IIT Bombay, is expected to be commercially available in India at a significantly lower cost compared to abroad. CAR-T therapy is a revolutionary treatment that modifies immune cells, specifically T-cells, to fight cancer cells. It is particularly effective in blood cancers like leukemia and lymphomas. The therapy involves genetically modifying T-cells to target cancer cells carrying the CD19 protein. The patient's journey starts with a doctor's prescription, followed by blood donation, genetic modification of T-cells in the lab, and reinfusion of the modified cells back into the patient. The therapy has shown promising results, with approximately 70% of patients responding to the treatment. The therapy also minimizes drug-related toxicities such as neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome. ImmunoACT is in the process of obtaining licenses and onboarding hospitals to make CAR-T therapy accessible to more people. The cost of the therapy is currently around Rs 30-40 lakh, but the goal is to bring it down to Rs 10-20 lakh in the future. The extent of coverage and accessibility to insurance may vary, and discussions with insurers and the government are ongoing to clarify this further.</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 01:37:51 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/CART.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/CART.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why Yemeni Houthisâ€™ attack on Israel has many worried</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/yemeni-houthi-attack-israel-iran-saudi-arabia-9009521/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

While the Houthi attacks may not pose a direct threat to Israel, the incidents have raised concerns in the region. The Houthi movement, supported by Iran, is part of an anti-Israel and anti-West coalition led by Iran known as the "axis of resistance." The civil war in Yemen is seen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Houthi attack is part of a series of attacks by members of the axis on Israel and the US, who are Israel's allies. While the Houthi attacks are more about sending a message than a genuine military threat, they have the potential to escalate tensions in the Middle East. The situation puts Saudi Arabia in a difficult position as they do not want to be seen as supporting Israel but also don't want to side with the Houthis, who are backed by Iran. If Saudi Arabia becomes directly involved in the conflict, it could lead to further escalation and potentially a wider war in the region.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 14:20:55 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Houthi.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Houthi.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt partially opens: What is the crossing and why is it significant?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/rafah-border-crossing-egypt-gaza-9009527/</link><description>The Rafah border crossing is the main entrance and exit point between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.

This is the second-highest level since the rollout of GST in July 2017. The rise can be attributed to increased consumption, economic activity, and the resolution of disputes by businesses following notices from GST authorities. From April to October 2023, GST revenue collections averaged Rs 1.66 lakh crore per month, an 11.4% increase compared to the same period in 2022. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu showed the highest growth rates in GST revenues, while Manipur and Himachal Pradesh experienced declines. Settlements between the central and state governments also contributed to the overall revenue figures. The surge in GST collections is expected to support the government's fiscal health, especially considering potential shortfalls in disinvestment receipts and direct tax revenue growth.

According to official records, there have been over 15,000 dengue cases and 59 deaths, which are the highest numbers in at least five years. The rise in cases can be attributed to the delayed monsoon season, which created stagnant pools of water where mosquitoes thrived. Additionally, the continued use of water coolers and a lack of sanitation measures have contributed to the spread of dengue. Doctors have also observed new symptoms such as liver and lung infections among patients. The demand for platelets has also increased, with doctors administering them as a precautionary measure. In the last five years, Bihar experienced a spike in dengue cases in 2019, followed by a decline in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2022, there was a resurgence of dengue cases, with 13,972 reported and 32 deaths.

However, critics argue that it was the Israeli government's support for Hamas that helped strengthen the group in order to undermine Fatah, the more internationally accepted Palestinian political party.

Fatah, founded in 1959 by Yasser Arafat, aimed for Palestinian national liberation through negotiations instead of violence. The Oslo Accords signed in the 1990s recognized both Israel and Palestine for the first time. Although Fatah was recognized by Western countries and provided with aid money, many Palestinians felt that their lives were still affected by Israeli control, leading to disillusionment with the negotiations.

Hamas, an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, was founded in 1987 and believes in armed resistance against Israel. It initially refused to recognize Israel but later expressed willingness to accept a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders. With its strong Islamic ideology and uncompromising stance against Israel, Hamas gained popularity among Palestinians. However, it has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries.

In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, which had been occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. That same year, Hamas participated in Palestinian public life as a political party and defeated Fatah in legislative elections held in 2006. Unable to reach a power-sharing agreement, Hamas took over Gaza amid violence. Israel and the West refused to acknowledge the Hamas government until it met certain conditions, including giving up violence and recognizing Israel.

Experts suggest that Israel may have wanted to strengthen Hamas to maintain a divided Palestinian leadership, preventing progress in peace negotiations. By dealing with Fatah, Israel had to demonstrate a genuine commitment to Palestinian statehood, while a violent Islamic faction like Hamas made it easier to blame Palestinians for hindering peace.

There is evidence, both direct and indirect, of Israel's involvement with Hamas. Indirectly, critics claim that by not fully implementing previous agreements with Fatah, such as the Oslo Accords, Israel weakened Fatah and strengthened hardline groups like Hamas. Direct evidence includes Israel allowing Qatari money to reach Hamas and comments made by Israeli leaders.

The 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, seen as a step towards peace, was questioned by some who believed it was not genuinely intended to promote a political process with the Palestinians. Israel maintained economic control over Gaza after the withdrawal, leading to disillusionment among Palestinians and contributing to Hamas' election victory.

Comments attributed to Netanyahu imply that supporting the separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, appealing to those who oppose such a state.

Overall, critics argue that Israel's support for Hamas was aimed at undermining Fatah and maintaining a divided Palestinian leadership, making it easier to avoid progress in peace negotiations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 07:56:42 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Gaza-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Gaza-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Story of Mamata and Nano: Why Tata can claim Rs 766 crore plus interest from Bengal Govt</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/story-of-mamata-and-nano-why-tata-can-claim-rs-766-crore-9007996/</link><description>Tata Motors has been awarded a sum of INR 765.78 crore ($115 million) by an arbitration tribunal, to be recovered from the government of West Bengal as compensation for capital investment losses in the Singur manufacturing plant.

The dispute over land acquisition in Singur began in 2006 and continued until 2016 when the Supreme Court ruled that the land should be returned to its owners. Tata Motors then entered into arbitration proceedings with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (WBIDC) to claim compensation for their losses.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 03:11:12 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/singur-mamata-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/singur-mamata-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why a â€˜normalâ€™ monsoon isnâ€™t normal anymore for India</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-a-normal-monsoon-hides-9008385/</link><description>The monsoon season in India this year had an overall rainfall of 94%, marking the eighth consecutive year that seasonal rainfall has been within the normal range. However, there have been significant variations in the distribution of rainfall, with some days experiencing heavy rainfall and prolonged periods of dryness. Only 6% of district rain-days were found to have normal daily rainfall, while over 60% showed deficits of over 60% or no rain at all. Climate change is believed to be a contributing factor to this increasing rainfall variability. At the regional level, there were also large variations in rainfall, with the northwest and central parts of the country receiving more than 100% rains, while the eastern and northeastern regions received barely 80%. The southern part of the country also experienced large deficits for most of the monsoon season. The analysis suggests that climate change has introduced greater uncertainty in weather events, and better preparedness is needed to cope with these unpredictable events.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 01:50:58 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/monsoon-feat.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/monsoon-feat.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Maratha quota protest heats up: What SC, Bombay HC have ruled on it, what steps state govt is taking</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/maratha-quota-what-sc-bombay-hc-have-said-9007855/</link><description>The Maharashtra state government has formed a panel of three former high court judges to provide advice on the legal battle over the Maratha quota issue in the Supreme Court. Activist Manoj Jarange-Patil has begun a fast-unto-death protest to demand Maratha reservation, putting pressure on the state government. The Marathas make up approximately 33% of the state's population and consist of various castes, including peasants and landowners. The first protest for Maratha reservation took place 32 years ago. In 2019, the Bombay High Court upheld the constitutional validity of the Maratha quota but reduced it to 12% in education and 13% in government jobs. The court relied on findings from the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, which showed the social, economic, and educational backwardness of the Maratha community. However, in May 2021, the Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota, citing the 50% reservation ceiling set in a previous judgment. The Maharashtra government has formed a new committee to study the procedure of giving Kunbi (OBC) certificates to Marathas. The state plans to file a curative petition in the Supreme Court. The current reservation in Maharashtra includes quotas for various groups, such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, and Economically Weaker Sections. Communities like Dhangar, Lingayats, and Muslims have also raised demands for reservation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 13:27:27 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/maratha-protest-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/maratha-protest-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Politician held for â€˜using Nazi symbolsâ€™: what German law says on things linked to Hitlerâ€™s party</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/german-politician-afd-arrested-nazi-9007693/</link><description>A 22-year-old politician from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been arrested in Germany for charges of incitement and using symbols associated with unconstitutional organizations, allegedly connected to the Nazi party. The politician, Daniel Halemba, was elected to the Bavarian state parliament and was arrested before the start of the state legislature's session. Halemba was the youngest member to be elected to the Bavarian parliament. He was also a member of a student fraternity that was raided by authorities last month due to suspicions of Nazi symbolism. Four other fraternity members are currently under investigation. Additionally, neighbors have complained about hearing fraternity members shouting Nazi slogans. Displaying symbols of unconstitutional organizations, such as the swastika, is illegal in Germany. However, there are varying interpretations and exceptions to this law. Halemba's lawyer denies the allegations of his client's association with these symbols. The AfD party, founded in 2013, has expressed opposition to the European Union and recently gained popularity by advocating against immigration. The party argues that Germany is being "Islamified" and presents itself as a defender of traditional Christian values. Critics have accused the AfD party of having neo-Nazi sympathies. Despite this, the party's popularity has been on the rise in Germany, especially due to concerns about immigration and the economy. Nationally, the party is polling at around 20 percent.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:37:50 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-31T090906Z_679125051_RC2L34A3UMCO_RTRMADP_5_GERMANY-POLITICS-BAVARIA.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-31T090906Z_679125051_RC2L34A3UMCO_RTRMADP_5_GERMANY-POLITICS-BAVARIA.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Recalling Pegasus, the last time phones of Oppn leaders were allegedly targeted by spyware</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/recalling-pegasus-oppn-leaders-targeted-9007516/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 10:36:28 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Pegasus-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Pegasus-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why the Goa government is in the dock over notifying a tiger reserve</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/goa-mhadei-tiger-reserve-wildlife-notification-explained-9005598/</link><description>The Goa bench of the Bombay High Court has directed the Goa government to establish a tiger reserve in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and other contiguous areas within three months. The court also instructed the state to settle the rights and claims of Scheduled Tribes and forest dwellers within a year. The Goa Foundation, an environmental NGO, had filed a public interest litigation seeking the formation of a tiger reserve in accordance with the recommendations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The Goa government had sought a stay on the High Court's judgment but was denied. As the deadline passed, the Chief Minister of Goa filed an application seeking more time to implement the court order. In response, the Goa Foundation filed a contempt petition against the government for non-compliance. The background of the case involves reports from the NTCA stating that Goa has a persistent tiger presence with about three to five tigers. The NTCA recommended the establishment of a tiger reserve in the Cotigao-Mhadei forest complex. However, the proposal faced obstacles due to encroachment by villagers and alleged pressures from mining interests. The demand for a tiger reserve gained momentum after a tigress and its cubs were found dead in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in 2020. An NTCA expert team suggested upgrading the sanctuary's legal status to that of a tiger reserve to ensure better protection. The Goa government argued in court that further studies and settlement of forest dwellers' rights were necessary before declaring the area a tiger reserve. However, the court ruled that the government's failure to settle these claims should not be used as an excuse to avoid creating the tiger reserve.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 09:42:21 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/mhadei-goa-wildlife-sanctuary.jpeg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/mhadei-goa-wildlife-sanctuary.jpeg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is Appleâ€™s â€˜state-sponsored attackersâ€™ alert, received by multiple Opposition leaders?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/apple-state-sponsored-attackers-alert-opposition-explained-9007362/</link><description>Apple has been sending out automated notifications to opposition leaders and journalists about potential state-sponsored attackers attempting to compromise their iPhones. The company has been issuing these notifications since late 2021 and has notified individuals in 150 countries. While Apple does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific attacker, it acknowledges that state-sponsored attackers are well-funded, sophisticated, and evolve over time. These attacks target specific individuals based on their identity or activities and aim to exploit vulnerabilities that may not be known to the public.

Apple's threat notifications serve as an alert system for users targeted by state-sponsored attackers. The company has developed a system to detect activity that matches certain patterns and sends "Threat Notifications" via email and iMessage to affected users. The notifications include advice on steps users can take to protect their devices and privacy, such as updating software, setting passcodes, enabling two-factor authentication, using strong passwords, and avoiding unknown links or attachments. Apple also recommends activating Lockdown Mode, a high-security state that restricts certain functions to prevent attackers from accessing personal information. Lockdown Mode is available on specific devices running the latest software versions.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, was assassinated on October 31, 1984, by two of her bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh. The assassination was a purported act of revenge for the humiliation of Sikhs and the desecration of the Golden Temple during Operation Blue Star in June of that year. Indira's death led to widespread communal violence, with approximately 3,350 Sikhs being massacred in just three days, with 2,800 of them in the national capital, Delhi.

Before her assassination, Indira Gandhi had a sense of foreboding about her impending demise. She spoke about death frequently to her family and close friends, expressing a preoccupation with it. Despite increased security measures following Operation Blue Star, she refused to remove Sikhs from her protection team, emphasizing her commitment to secularism.

On the day of the assassination, Indira Gandhi left her official residence accompanied by her security detail. Sub-Inspector Beant Singh approached her and shot her at close range, followed by Constable Satwant Singh firing multiple shots. Indira collapsed, and both assailants were overpowered soon after. She was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead after undergoing surgery.

Following the assassination, the capital city erupted in communal violence. Mobs targeted innocent Sikhs, leading to widespread killings, burnings, and rape. The violence lasted for three days until the army was called in to restore peace. However, the wounds inflicted during this period remained, and even though inquiries were conducted, few were held accountable for the atrocities committed.

Indira's son, Rajiv Gandhi, succeeded her as Prime Minister and addressed the nation amid the chaos. He promised to face the tragedy with strength and wisdom. Nevertheless, the vengeful sentiment among certain groups continued to simmer, leaving lasting scars on society.

The population size is highlighted as an important factor, with Israel having almost double the population of the West Bank and Gaza. In terms of nominal GDP, Israel's economy is far larger, estimated at $522 billion in 2023, while the combined GDP of the West Bank and Gaza was just above $18 billion in 2021 and projected to be $20 billion in 2023. This means that Israel's GDP is more than 26 times that of Palestine's.

The article also examines the GDP per capita, indicating that the average income level in Israel is almost 15 times higher than in Palestine. Inflation rates have been similar for both economies, with Israel experiencing a slightly higher rate. However, when it comes to real GDP growth rate, Palestine has shown greater fluctuations, suggesting a less stable economy. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Israel's real GDP contracted by 1.5%, while the West Bank and Gaza experienced a contraction of over 11%.

The unemployment rate is significantly higher in Palestine, with a rate of 24.2% compared to Israel's 3.5%. The article acknowledges the challenges faced by the Palestinian economy, citing systemic restrictions imposed by the Government of Israel, particularly affecting economic activity in Gaza. The World Bank assessment mentioned in the article predicts continued hindrances and limited economic development due to Israeli restrictions, internal divisions, and a lack of conclusive reforms on the Palestinian Authority side.

In conclusion, the article portrays a significant disparity between the economies of Israel and Palestine, with Israel enjoying higher GDP, GDP per capita, lower inflation, and unemployment rates. The challenges faced by Palestine are attributed to various factors, including political and economic uncertainties, restrictions on movement and trade, and a lack of momentum in reform efforts.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 03:29:24 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/udit.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/udit.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - What are electoral bonds, how has govt defended them, what Supreme Court has to decide</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-electoral-bonds-hearing-explained-9006289/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 13:43:34 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sc-electoral-bonds.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sc-electoral-bonds.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What the rapid ice melt in West Antarctica means</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ice-sheet-melt-west-antarctica-9006179/</link><description>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that the rapid melting of West Antarctica's ice sheet is now inevitable, regardless of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. This melting process, driven by warm waters surrounding the ice sheet, will continue even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The consequences of losing the entire ice sheet would include a rise in global mean sea level by 5.3 meters (17.4 feet), posing a significant threat to coastal cities worldwide, including those in India.

The research, titled "Unavoidable future increase in West Antarctic ice-shelf melting over the twenty-first century," was conducted by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey and Northumbria University. The study emphasizes that as ice sheets lose mass, they contribute to a rise in global sea levels. Ice shelves, which stabilize land-based glaciers, play a crucial role; when they thin or disappear, the glaciers accelerate, leading to sea level rise.

The focus of the study is the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica, where ice shelves have been depleting for decades, resulting in faster glacier flow and ice sheet shrinkage. High-resolution computer models were used to analyze warming trends in the region and simulate various scenarios until the year 2100. Regardless of the trajectory of fossil fuel burning, all simulations demonstrated significant warming and increased ice shelf melting, with similar outcomes up to 2045.

The researchers emphasize that the findings should not discourage efforts to mitigate climate change impacts. Although substantial ice loss in West Antarctica may be unavoidable, there are still opportunities to limit other impacts such as the loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, heatwaves, droughts, and extreme rainfall. It is crucial to recognize that climate change is a multifaceted issue, and addressing its different aspects remains essential.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 13:01:43 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/West-Antarctica.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/West-Antarctica.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Rajnath Singh talks about â€˜prisonerâ€™s dilemmaâ€™ in international relations: What is this concept</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/rajnath-singh-prisoners-dilemma-9006097/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

Lewis argued that a growing manufacturing sector could absorb the surplus labor from agriculture and other subsistence sectors by offering higher wages. However, the model has not played out as expected in India. While the share of employment in agriculture has decreased, it has not been replaced by significant growth in manufacturing. Instead, most new jobs have been created in low-paid services and construction. The movement of labor has mainly occurred within subsistence sectors rather than a shift to capitalist sectors. The exception is Gujarat, where a significant proportion of the workforce is employed in manufacturing. However, even in Gujarat, the proportion of workers in agriculture is still high compared to other states. The article suggests that the traditional model of labor transition from agriculture to industry needs to be rethought due to increasing capital-intensive manufacturing and technological advancements. NITI Aayog, an Indian government think tank, is exploring new economic development models that focus on creating remunerative jobs related to agriculture but outside the farm, such as in processing, packaging, transportation, and retailing of agricultural produce or supplying inputs and services to farmers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 01:45:00 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/lewis-model.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/lewis-model.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>From 2016 to present, how Maratha morcha changed its stance, modes of protest over reservation demand</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/2016-2023-how-maratha-morcha-changed-its-stance-modes-of-protest-9005099/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Former head of Hamas, Khaled Mashal, virtually addressed a pro-Palestine rally in Kerala's Malappuram, calling for unity for Gaza. He spoke about the ongoing conflict in the region and criticized Israel for demolishing houses, churches, temples, universities, and UN institutions. Mashal was born in the West Bank town of Silwad in 1956 and became a member of Hamas, a militant organization that used violence for the cause of Palestine. He headed Hamas's Politburo from 1996 to 2017 and currently leads the group's 'external' politburo based in Qatar. Mashal echoed Hamas's opposition to Israel but stated in a 2017 document that they accepted the idea of a Palestinian state within the territories occupied by Israel in the Six-day War of 1967. He also discussed the possibility of negotiating with Israel when they are strong enough to create a reality that forces Israel to reconsider its positions. Mashal has called for unity against Israel following recent attacks and counter-attacks between Hamas and Israel. He was targeted in an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997, which led to a crisis between Jordan and Israel.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 13:49:26 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Khaled_Meshaal.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Khaled_Meshaal.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - India bans exports of some rice varieties: How this has impacted prices globally, in the country</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-bans-exports-of-some-rice-explained-9004685/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 12:40:04 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/rice-paddy-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/rice-paddy-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Why new tax filing data shows better compliance, upward mobility in higher-income slabs</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-new-tax-filing-data-shows-9004515/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 10:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/black-rectangle.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/black-rectangle.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - An Expert Explains | 10 years of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative: The project, its aims and where it stands now</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-10-years-chinas-bri-xi-jinping-status-explained-9004356/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 09:40:47 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/AP10_17_2023_000166B.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/AP10_17_2023_000166B.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Kerala blast: Who are Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-blast-kills-one-who-are-jehovahs-witnesses-9004346/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Two people were killed and several others were injured in a series of blasts at a Jehovah's Witnesses prayer convention near Kochi, India. The incident took place at the Zamra International Convention and Exhibition Centre during a gathering of approximately 2,500 worshippers. A former member of the sect named Dominic Martin, who is now in police custody, claimed responsibility for the attack in a video posted on social media. He cited disagreements with the sect's beliefs, stating that they hold anti-national views and indoctrinate children with harmful ideologies.

Jehovah's Witnesses, a Christian sect, do not believe in the Holy Trinity and worship Jehovah as the one true God. They base their beliefs solely on the Bible and refrain from celebrating Christmas and Easter due to their pagan origins. Known for their evangelical work, they believe in the imminent end of the world and the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth. The sect has millions of followers worldwide, with thousands of ministers in India alone.

The origins of Jehovah's Witnesses can be traced back to the Bible Student movement initiated by Charles Taze Russell in the late 19th century. The governing body of the sect is currently located in Warwick, New York, and their doctrines are disseminated through the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.

Jehovah's Witnesses generally maintain distance from other religious groups and remain politically neutral. They have legal protection in India and have faced legal battles regarding their practices and beliefs. In a landmark case, the Supreme Court of India ruled in 1986 that forcing Jehovah's Witnesses children to sing the national anthem violated their right to religious freedom.

The article also mentions a recent case where a Jehovah's Witness from Nigeria underwent a liver transplant in Bengaluru without the use of blood or blood products to respect his religious beliefs. The Supreme Court referred to various international cases to emphasize the peculiar beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses, highlighting their clashes with governments and their commitment to religious freedom.

Overall, the article provides an overview of the recent attack on a Jehovah's Witnesses prayer convention, the beliefs and practices of the sect, their legal status in India, and notable cases involving them.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 07:55:46 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/India_Explosion_47951-f18f0.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/India_Explosion_47951-f18f0.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Israel-Hamas war: Where the conflict goes from here, and how it could affect the global economy</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-war-what-happens-now-impact-global-economy-explained-9004262/</link><description>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have announced that they are expanding their ground activity and forces in the Gaza Strip as part of their plan to destroy Hamas, the ruling party in the region. However, there is uncertainty about how Israel will handle the post-conflict phase if Hamas is eliminated. Analysts believe that Israel is unlikely to take on an administrative role in Gaza again, given that they voluntarily left the area in 2005. General David Petraeus, a former CIA director, warned Israel about the importance of planning for the post-conflict phase and having a vision for the future of Gaza and the Palestinian people. He cited the mistakes made by the US in Iraq, where insufficient planning led to a destabilized country. Petraeus also cautioned against a major land invasion of Gaza, comparing it to the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia portrayed in the film Black Hawk Down.
The article also discusses the potential economic consequences of the conflict. While the impact may not be as severe as in previous Arab-Israeli wars, a prolonged conflict and worsened humanitarian crisis could have serious economic implications. Three scenarios are outlined: a limited conflict confined to Gaza, a regional conflict involving Iran-backed militants in Lebanon and Syria, and a full-scale war between Israel and Iran that could escalate with involvement from other countries. The last scenario poses the highest risk to the global economy due to the potential disruption of oil supplies from West Asia. If Iran were to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, crude oil prices could rise significantly, leading to higher global inflation and slower economic growth. The article concludes by noting that the most likely scenario is that the conflict remains confined to Gaza, causing a terrible human toll but limited impact on the global economy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 07:02:05 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-29T161932Z_876148021_RC2A24AVCYRC_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-29T161932Z_876148021_RC2A24AVCYRC_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, G20, Gaza: Over deep faultlines, New Delhi walks diplomatic tightrope again</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ukraine-g20-gaza-over-deep-faultlines-new-delhi-walks-diplomatic-tightrope-again-9003867/</link><description>India abstained from voting on a UN General Assembly resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The resolution received 120 votes in favor and 14 against. Before the vote, an amendment proposed by Canada to name Hamas was rejected. India voted in favor of this amendment along with 86 other nations. India's abstention reflects its balancing act in the Gaza Strip conflict. Four key takeaways include India joining countries like Australia, Canada, and the UK in abstaining from the resolution. Additionally, India supported the amendment to name Hamas, which was ultimately rejected. Unlike resolutions from the UN Security Council, UNGA resolutions are not legally binding. India's balanced position is similar to its approach in other conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war. India emphasized the need for dialogue, condemned terror attacks, and called for the release of hostages. It expressed concern over civilian casualties and urged de-escalation and a two-state solution.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 22:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/unga-india.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/unga-india.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is the â€˜SIM swap scamâ€™ â€” and how can you protect yourself?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/sim-sawp-scam-9003615/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the SIM swap scam, a fraudulent technique used by cybercriminals to steal money from victims' bank accounts. The scam involves fraudsters obtaining personal information through phishing or vishing techniques and then visiting a mobile operator's retail outlet to report a fake theft of the victim's SIM card. By doing so, they acquire a duplicate SIM that allows them to receive banking authorization messages and OTPs (one-time passwords). The victims often receive multiple missed calls from the fraudsters, who use this tactic to make the victims ignore their phones and leave them unattended.

Once the fraudsters have control over the victim's SIM card, they log into the victim's bank portals using the stolen information and generate OTPs to withdraw money from the victim's account. They can successfully carry out these transactions because all the OTPs go to the fraudsters' SIM card instead of the victim's. The fraudsters find their victims by purchasing data from hackers involved in data breaches or online portals where private companies' customer data has been compromised.

Despite several cases of SIM swap scams, no arrests have been made thus far. The fraudsters discard the duplicate SIMs immediately after the scam, making it difficult for law enforcement to trace them. Additionally, the stolen money is often converted into cryptocurrency, which further complicates tracking.

To protect oneself from this scam, individuals are advised to be cautious of phishing attempts, regularly check their banking alerts, and report any suspicious activities immediately.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 13:49:48 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sim-swapping-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sim-swapping-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Swiss womanâ€™s murder in Delhi: How the police deals with the murder of foreign nationals</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/swiss-woman-murder-delhi-foreign-nationals-police-murder-9003430/</link><description>A week ago, the decomposing body of Nina Berger, a Swiss national, was found behind a school in West Delhi. The body had chains on its hands and legs, as well as bruises all over. Gurpreet, a businessman from Janakpuri who was believed to be Berger's scorned lover, has been arrested for the crime. However, the victim's family in Zurich has not yet physically identified the body, complicating the case as the burden of evidence falls solely on Gurpreet. The family has given consent for a postmortem to be conducted in their absence, which the Delhi Police has been waiting for. A team at the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital will carry out the autopsy.

When a foreign national is murdered, involved in an accident, or commits suicide in India, the state police verifies the victim's identity through their passport. They then inform the victim's next of kin through the respective country's embassy. The embassy communicates with the family, who are usually asked to come to India, identify the body, and consent to a postmortem. The embassy issues a Consular Report of Death Abroad containing the original death certificate, postmortem report, burial/cremation certificates, and the police case file.

If the body remains unidentified, the police wait for a few weeks, putting up notices for identification before disposing of it according to standard procedure in the presence of an investigating officer. In this case, Nina Berger's parents have stated that they have a child named Nina Berger but refuse to come to Delhi to identify the body and cooperate with the investigation.

In such cases, family members typically provide circumstantial evidence to assist in the investigation. However, in this situation, the only identification of Nina Berger has been made by Gurpreet, who has been inconsistent with his explanations regarding the motive behind the crime. DNA testing is one option to identify the body by comparing samples with Nina's kin. Alternatively, the police may travel to Switzerland for further investigation if the family continues to be uncooperative.

Physical identification is crucial in building a case, but in the absence of it, strong circumstantial evidence such as electronic records, travel tickets, immigration details, and identification through the embassy and passport can be used. Non-cooperation from the deceased's family could work against the police, so they rely on other collected evidence to confirm the identity and build a solid case. If Nina's family decides to join the probe or repatriate her remains, they would be handed over a piece of cloth, or in the case of cremation, the ashes would be given to them.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:38:05 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Delhi-Police-10.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Delhi-Police-10.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Whatâ€™s behind the current J&amp;K power crisis â€” and how the administration plans to address it</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jammu-kashmir-power-crisis-9003414/</link><description>The Jammu &amp; Kashmir administration is facing a power crisis due to a dry spell in the summer, leading to a decrease in electricity generation from its power projects. Currently, J&amp;K generates only 3,263 MW of electricity, which is significantly less than its requirement of about 2,600 MW. The deficit has led to the purchase of additional expensive electricity from the central power exchange. The dry spell has affected power generation from hydropower projects, particularly the Baglihar project. The state also suffers from transmission losses and a lack of metering systems in many areas, resulting in billing issues and electricity theft. The administration is taking steps to address the problem, including installing smart meters and promoting the use of ad cables to prevent theft. They aim to reduce transmission losses to under 20% through structural reforms. Additionally, a green energy corridor project has been approved to provide solar and wind power to J&amp;K and reduce its dependence on hydropower.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 11:28:47 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/JK-power.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/JK-power.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why Jharkhand govt has approved a new Rs 16,000 crore housing scheme</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-govt-abua-awas-yojana-housing-9003294/</link><description>The Jharkhand cabinet has approved the 'Abua Awas Yojna' (AAY) housing scheme, which aims to provide eight lakh pucca houses to the homeless in the state. The scheme has a total budget of Rs 16,320 crore and will be implemented in three phases. The first phase targets two lakh houses in the current financial year. The second phase targets 3.5 lakh houses by FY 2024-25, and the third phase targets 2.5 lakh houses by FY 2025-26. The scheme was needed because existing housing schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Rural and Ambedkar Awas Yojna were unable to cover all eligible beneficiaries. The Jharkhand government found discrepancies in the data used to identify beneficiaries and requested the central government to include the eligible people left out. However, their requests were not heeded, prompting the state to create its own housing scheme. Under the AAY scheme, beneficiaries will receive a three-room and one kitchen house with a total area of 31 sq m. The government has allocated Rs 2 lakh per beneficiary, to be disbursed in four installments. Additionally, beneficiaries can work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and earn wages for building the house. A provision is also made to add a toilet to the house construction using funds from the Swachh Bharat Mission or other available schemes. Notably, all houses built under the AAY scheme will be registered in the name of the women in beneficiary families. The scheme will benefit people belonging to six specific categories, and a list of prospective beneficiaries will be prepared considering various criteria.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:12:15 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Hemant-Soren.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Hemant-Soren.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - The United Nations General Assembly vote on Gaza war, and why India abstained</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/unga-vote-gaza-war-india-abstained-9003225/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

Qatar, a close ally of the United States, has been crucial to its military strategy in the region. However, Qatar also has close ties with Hamas, making it an ideal intermediary for hostage releases. The article explains how Qatar's position in the Middle East has evolved over time. In the 1990s, Qatar experienced an economic boom due to the discovery of massive natural gas reserves, which changed its geopolitical dynamics. Qatar also developed closer ties with the United States, signing a defense cooperation deal and hosting the largest American base in the Middle East. Additionally, Sheikh Hamad's ascension to power led to a focus on boosting Qatar's soft power through media and sports, with Al Jazeera becoming a prominent export. Qatar has asserted its independence in the international arena by maintaining good relations with Iran and supporting actors against Arab governments during the Arab Spring. The country is known for offering sanctuary to dissidents and terrorists and has faced an embargo from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt due to allegations of supporting terrorism and interfering in other nations' affairs. Despite this mistrust, Qatar remains a key player in mediating conflicts and acting as a proxy for Western countries when they cannot directly engage. Its position may be impacted by the recent conflict in Gaza, but as long as it controls significant natural gas reserves and hosts important US assets, it will continue charting its own course.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 15:52:16 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/AP10_28_2023_000007B-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/AP10_28_2023_000007B-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>How natural gas is central to ties between India and Qatar</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/natural-gas-lng-india-qatar-relations-9002396/</link><description>The recent death sentence given to eight former Indian Navy personnel by a court in Qatar poses a significant challenge to the friendly relationship between India and Qatar. The imbalance in trade between the two countries, with Qatar exporting more to India than India does to Qatar, gives Qatar significant leverage. This is particularly important because a large portion of India's imports from Qatar is liquefied natural gas (LNG), which accounts for almost 50% of India's overall imports from Qatar. India's dependency on gas imports is expected to increase as the government aims to increase natural gas consumption. However, the case of the retired navy personnel presents a sensitive challenge for Indian diplomacy given India's energy security concerns. In the fiscal year 2022-23, India imported $16.81 billion worth of goods from Qatar, with $8.32 billion of that being LNG imports. On the other hand, India's exports to Qatar were only valued at $1.97 billion during the same period. While Indian LNG importers are trying to diversify their sourcing, reducing reliance on Qatar may take years. The global LNG market is currently a seller's market due to disruptions in Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. This has increased the importance of long-term contracts for securing stable prices. Qatar, as the world's largest exporter of LNG, is in a strong position. India's long-term contract with Qatari gas supplier Petronet LNG is set to expire in 2028, and negotiations for an extension are ongoing. India is also looking to sign more long-term LNG contracts. While analysts predict that the global LNG market may shift to a buyer's market in the future, this is still a few years away and Qatar is expected to continue playing a significant role in LNG exports.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 14:29:21 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/qatar-lng.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/qatar-lng.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - What is West Bengalâ€™s alleged PDS scam, in which ED has arrested TMC Minister Jyotipriya Mallick?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/west-bengal-pds-scam-explained-arrest-tmc-jyotipriya-mallick-9002334/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 13:44:44 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch765760.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch765760.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Li Keqiang was once tipped to be President of China.

He was known for his academic background and ability to communicate in English, as well as his interest in economic policy. Li's tenure saw the decline of his power base, the communist youth league, and he faced criticism for his handling of issues such as major fires and an HIV AIDS epidemic during his governorships. Although Li had proposed economic reforms, the concentration of power under Xi limited his capabilities as premier.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has instructed credit information companies (CICs) to notify customers via SMS or email when their credit information report (CIR) is accessed by banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). In addition, banks and NBFCs must send alerts to customers when they submit default or days past due (DPD) information to CICs. These new rules will be implemented within six months.

CICs are responsible for maintaining and analyzing credit information for individuals and businesses in India, provided by banks and NBFCs. Based on this information, CICs calculate credit scores for individuals and credit ranks for companies. A high credit score can help customers secure loans at favorable rates, while a low score may lead to loan and credit card denials. However, credit scores are not the sole factor in loan approval.

CICs such as TransUnion CIBIL Ltd, Equifax India, and CRIF High Mark are prominent in India, scoring individuals on a scale of 300 to 850, with 700 generally considered good. Typically, customers have to pay for their credit scores, but the RBI has addressed this by stating that CICs must provide individuals with a free full credit report (FFCR) once a year. The FFCR, including the credit score, should be easily accessible on the CIC's website.

If customers find incorrect data in their report, there is a process to apply for correction. The RBI has instructed banks and NBFCs to inform customers of the reasons for data correction rejections. CICs should circulate a list of rejection reasons to all credit institutions, and these reasons should be used during the grievance redress process.

CICs are also required to review their search and match logic algorithm, used to generate borrowers' CIR, at least twice a year.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, highlighting the impact on Israeli society and the region as a whole. The author shares their experiences traveling to various locations in Israel and speaking with residents of Gaza. The attacks have resulted in a high number of casualties and widespread destruction. Israelis are shaken by the brutality of the attacks, which have targeted women, children, and the elderly. Many believe that former ISIS fighters joined Hamas in these assaults. The situation has led to a large number of hostages being held by Hamas, posing a challenge for Israeli authorities. The article also emphasizes the dire conditions in Gaza, where essential supplies are running low and people are without power. The Israeli government's response to the crisis has drawn criticism, leading to calls for political accountability, including calls for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. The future remains uncertain, and there are concerns about what will happen after Hamas is potentially destroyed. The article suggests that an Arab coalition, possibly led by Jordan, could play a role in the aftermath. The conflict has also impacted regional dynamics, including the normalization process between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The peace process, as well as India's diplomatic position, will be significant factors affecting the Indian diaspora in the region and India's energy security.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 01:40:21 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/palestine-israel-air-strike.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/palestine-israel-air-strike.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Qatar court sentences 8 Indian Navy veterans to death: A timeline of the case</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/qatar-indian-navy-death-penalty-timeline-9000941/</link><description>Eight former personnel of the Indian Navy, who were working for a private company, Dahra Global, in Qatar, have been sentenced to death by a Qatari court.

Legend has it that Baba Farid, a Sufi saint from Punjab, spent time in deep meditation at this place, and Indian Muslims visiting Mecca started visiting Jerusalem to pray at this spot. Over time, the place transformed into a shrine and a hospice for travelers from India. The lodge within the hospice, known as Zawiya Al-Hindiya, has retained its association with India despite changing hands over the centuries. The lodge has undergone renovations and rebuilding efforts, with support from Muslim patrons worldwide, including the Muslim princely states in British India. After India gained independence, the lodge received official recognition from the Indian embassy in Egypt, solidifying its Indian identity. Today, the Indian Hospice continues to serve as a sanctuary for travelers and pilgrims from India, and it also hosts the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and the Jerusalem Health Centre. The property is owned by the Waqf Board of India and is accessible only to individuals of Indian citizenship or heritage.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:37:23 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/jerusalem-hospice-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/jerusalem-hospice-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Who are the 8 Indian Navy veterans sentenced to death by a court in Qatar, and what is the case against them?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/qatar-death-penalty-indian-navy-personnel-9000611/</link><description>I apologize, but as a customer support agent for Chatbase, I am only able to provide information and assistance related to Chatbase. If you have any questions or requests regarding Chatbase, I'll be happy to help.Eight former Indian Navy personnel have been sentenced to death by a court in Qatar after being arrested on August 30, 2022. The Ministry of External Affairs expressed shock at the verdict and stated that they were awaiting the detailed judgment while exploring all legal options. The reasons for their long custody and the specific charges against them are unknown to the public. The case poses a diplomatic challenge for the Indian government.

The eight individuals were working at Al Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services, a defense services provider company owned by an Omani national. The company's website previously mentioned its connection to the Qatari Emiri Naval Force (QENF) but no longer does so. One of the accused, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, had received an award for his contributions to the bilateral relationship between India and Qatar.

The men were arrested by the Qatari intelligence agency and were initially held in solitary confinement. The Indian Embassy was informed about the arrests in mid-September, and consular access was granted over a month later. Speculation suggests that the solitary confinement indicates a connection to a security-related offense.

India and Qatar have historically maintained friendly relations, with significant visits and trade ties between the two countries. Defense cooperation has been an essential aspect of their relationship, including training programs and joint naval exercises. However, recent challenges, such as derogatory remarks made by a BJP spokesperson and the sentencing of the ex-Navy personnel, have strained the relationship.

The news of the death penalty for the former Indian Navy personnel comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East due to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. Qatar, known for its support of Palestinians, has been involved in mediating hostage releases and acting as a regional mediator in the crisis.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 12:27:09 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Modi-Qatar.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Modi-Qatar.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why have 33 US states sued Meta?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/33-us-states-sued-meta-mental-health-social-media-9000258/</link><description>Instagram and its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook) are facing a lawsuit from 33 U.S. states, including California and New York, alleging that the tech giant contributed to the youth mental health crisis through its addictive social media platforms. The states' attorneys general argue that Meta repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and intentionally encouraged addictive social media use among young children and teenagers. The lawsuit follows whistleblower Frances Haugen's claims that Meta targeted vulnerable young people to boost profits. Haugen revealed an internal study at Instagram showing that many young girls using the app suffered from depression and anxiety related to body-image issues. The lawsuit mentions features such as likes, alerts, and filters, which are said to promote body dysmorphia among young users. Meta has denied the allegations and expressed disappointment in the attorneys general choosing legal action instead of working collaboratively with the industry to establish age-appropriate standards. Haugen's testimony to Congress and internal documents from Meta have been cited in the lawsuit, including a survey revealing that Instagram made 32% of teen girls feel worse about their bodies. The survey also showed connections between Instagram usage and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts among users. Research has consistently shown that social media use can have negative effects on mental health, with passive use linked to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 08:08:10 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/META1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/META1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Three reasons why Israel has still not launched its ground offensive into Gaza</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/reasons-israel-not-launched-ground-offensive-gaza-9000202/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has stated that the country will launch a ground offensive in Gaza following an air offensive. However, there are several reasons why Israel has not yet initiated a full-scale ground invasion. One reason is that the US has reportedly advised Israel to delay the invasion to allow for more time for hostage negotiations and to strategize to minimize civilian casualties. The US has also requested preparations for a broader conflict, including the deployment of air defense systems and an aircraft carrier in the Gulf region. Additionally, Israel faces challenges in rescuing over 200 hostages held in unknown locations in Gaza, as it has never dealt with such a large number of hostages simultaneously. There is speculation that Israel may be delaying the ground offensive to negotiate for more hostage releases. Furthermore, Gaza's extensive network of underground tunnels poses a significant challenge for Israeli forces, as these tunnels house Hamas command centers and serve as rocket launch sites. Bombing attempts in the past have not been successful, and there are concerns that striking these tunnels could endanger the safety of hostages. The IDF's challenge in Gaza is considered tougher than previous operations due to the underground tunnel network and Hamas' long preparation for a fight. Eliminating Hamas' infrastructure in Gaza is not an easy task, and there are doubts about whether the IDF is fully prepared for a conventional ground battle against a determined adversary. Another concern is the possibility of Hezbollah opening a front in southern Lebanon, which would require Israel to allocate resources and manpower for a two-front engagement. The prospect of extended military conflict in Gaza could also lead to Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, requiring further resources from Israel. Finally, even if Israel succeeds in eliminating Hamas from Gaza, it would be challenging to administer the territory indefinitely, and any successor group could be more radical and extremist.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:31:11 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-26T133501Z_1971082299_RC2D04AKY3JO_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-ISRAEL-ARMY.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-26T133501Z_1971082299_RC2D04AKY3JO_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-ISRAEL-ARMY.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is the â€˜One nation, One Student IDâ€™ initiative of the Union govt?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-nation-one-student-id-apaar-explained-9000086/</link><description>Last week, state governments in India requested schools to seek parental consent for the creation of a new student identity card called the Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR). This initiative is part of the 'One Nation, One Student ID' program, which stems from the new National Education Policy of 2020. APAAR is envisioned as a special ID system for all students in India, starting from childhood. It aims to make education hassle-free by reducing the need for physical documents and allows students to store their important academic records digitally using Digilocker. The goal behind introducing APAAR is to track academic progress, reduce fraud, and provide a trusted reference for educational institutions. Each individual will have a unique APAAR ID, linked to the Academic Bank Credit, which stores information on credits earned throughout a student's learning journey. The registration for creating an APAAR ID is voluntary, not mandatory, and the government assures that the shared information will be kept confidential and only used for educational purposes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 06:26:02 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1775898.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1775898.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Who is Nasiruddin Ansari of Baap of Chart, and why has SEBI barred him from the markets?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/nasiruddin-ansari-baap-of-chart-finfluencer-sebi-markets-9000002/</link><description>SEBI, the markets regulator in India, has taken action against Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari, the owner of 'Baap of Chart', for providing stock recommendations and misleading investors through social media platforms.

The allegations are based on information provided by Dehadrai, confirmed by real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani through a sworn affidavit stating that Moitra gave him her Parliament login and password to post questions on her behalf.

The question at hand is whether an MP is asking questions in exchange for consideration and involving illegal gratification. If proven, it would be a serious issue. Such cases should be referred to the Privileges Committee, as it has the mandate to investigate breaches of privilege and contempt of the House. The Ethics Committee typically deals with less serious matters related to propriety.

In the past, special committees have been formed to handle serious cases such as violations of The Passports Act, leading to expulsion from the House. However, there are currently no specific rules regarding online submission of questions, which could have included safeguards against violations.

The Ethics Committee will call all involved parties, including the complainant, witnesses, and the Member accused, allowing cross-examination. The duration of the Committee's proceedings depends on the complexity of the case and can be extended if necessary. While the Committee can recommend suspension, it does not have executive powers and cannot directly punish the Member. Its recommendations are presented to the House for a final decision.

Expelled Members have the option to challenge the decision if they believe there were irregularities, unconstitutionality, or denial of natural justice during the committee's process. However, the scope for legal challenge is limited to these grounds.

Parliamentary Committees function in a non-political manner, rising above party considerations, and are expected to address issues impartially and objectively. The ruling party usually holds a majority in all Committees, including the Ethics Committee. Ultimately, the House has the authority to accept or modify the Committee's recommendations and determine the appropriate punishment.

P.D.T Achary, a former Secretary General of the Lok Sabha, provided insights into the parliamentary procedures and emphasized the importance of upholding natural justice in these proceedings.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 01:40:13 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/PTI10_26_2023_000006B.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/PTI10_26_2023_000006B.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Lok Sabhaâ€™s Ethics Committee: its history, constitution and members</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ls-ethics-committee-its-constitution-members-8999613/</link><description>The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee, an ad hoc entity established over two decades ago, has convened to address a complaint against Mahua Moitra filed by Nishikant Dubey. The committee, appointed by the Speaker for a one-year term, is currently chaired by BJP's Vinod Kumar Sonkar and consists of members from various political parties. The concept of ethics panels for both houses was proposed during a Presiding Officers' Conference in 1996. The Rajya Sabha Ethics Committee was established in March 1997, followed by the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee in 2015. In 2005, motions were passed in both houses to expel MPs involved in asking questions in exchange for money. The Bansal Committee report related to this issue was demanded by the BJP to be sent to the Privileges Committee. Complaints against MPs can be lodged by any person through another Lok Sabha MP, accompanied by evidence and an affidavit. The Ethics Committee conducts a preliminary inquiry before examining a complaint and makes recommendations based on its evaluation. The report is presented to the Speaker, who decides whether it should be considered by the House. The Ethics Committee deals with cases of misconduct involving MPs, while more serious allegations are typically referred to the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee aims to protect the freedom, authority, and dignity of Parliament. It can examine MPs and non-MPs for breach of privilege that affects the authority and dignity of the House.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 01:40:03 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/nishikant-dubey-2colex.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/nishikant-dubey-2colex.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is Cubism â€” and how Braque and Picasso created it</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/what-is-cubism-braque-picasso-8999424/</link><description>Pablo Picasso, a renowned Spanish artist, was born on October 25, 1881. He is known for his extensive body of work, which includes paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics. Picasso, along with French painter George Braque, pioneered the art movement called Cubism. Cubism was a revolutionary approach to art that emerged in 1907 and lasted until 1914. It involved artists depicting objects from multiple viewpoints, breaking away from traditional artistic techniques. Cubism had a significant influence on non-representational art movements like Surrealism and inspired artists such as Marcel Duchamp. Picasso and Braque's approach to Cubism involved deconstructing objects and representing them on a flat plane, showcasing different perspectives simultaneously. This technique aimed to provide a more precise representation of how people perceive objects. Cubism also reflected the scientific and technological advancements of the early 20th century, with artists like Picasso and Braque engaging in discussions about concepts like the fourth dimension and the discoveries of the atom. The Cubist movement can be divided into two phases: analytical cubism (1907-1912) and synthetic cubism (1912-1914). Analytical cubism focused on depicting objects from multiple viewpoints using muted tones, while synthetic cubism incorporated simpler shapes, brighter colors, and real-life objects like wallpapers and newspaper cuttings. This incorporation of everyday objects aimed to elevate their status and challenge traditional notions of art.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 14:51:14 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Picasso.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Picasso.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>The story of the Osage Indiansâ€™ murders, subject of Martin Scorseseâ€™s â€˜Killers of the Flower Moonâ€™</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/osage-indians-murders-killers-of-the-flower-moon-8999410/</link><description>The article discusses the historical events surrounding the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe in Oklahoma, during the 1920s. The Osage had become extremely wealthy after oil was discovered on their land. However, this newfound wealth led to a series of murders targeting members of the tribe. These killings exposed the exploitation and greed of white settlers who sought to gain control over the land and resources of Native Americans.

The article mentions Martin Scorsese's film, "Killers of the Flower Moon," which is based on David Grann's book about the so-called Reign of Terror experienced by the Osage during this period. It highlights how the FBI was established as a result of these crimes and the subsequent investigation. The Osage were initially forced to give up their land and relocate to Kansas before being allocated a reservation in northeastern Oklahoma. The reservation happened to sit above significant oil deposits, leading to immense wealth for the Osage people.

While the Osage enjoyed unprecedented wealth, they were not fully in control of their finances or the oil rights. The government implemented laws that required financial guardianship for many Osage individuals, restricting their access to their own funds. This system left them vulnerable to exploitation.

The article focuses on the story of Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose family members were targeted and killed. The official death toll during this period is stated to be 24, but it is believed that the actual number of murders may have been much higher. A lack of progress in local investigations prompted the involvement of the FBI, which gradually unraveled the intricate web of crimes linked to Mollie's family and William K Hale, a powerful settler.

The article concludes by noting that scholars and investigators estimate the death toll to be in the scores, if not hundreds. The Osage community suffered greatly due to the headrights associated with the oil deposits, with nearly every family losing at least one member. The FBI's involvement eventually led to changes in legislation, preventing non-Osage individuals from inheriting headrights.

Overall, the article highlights the historical atrocities committed against the Osage Nation and sheds light on the systemic racism and exploitation faced by Native Americans during this time.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 14:11:10 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/killers-of-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/killers-of-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>NCERT panel suggests replacing â€˜Indiaâ€™ with â€˜Bharatâ€™: A brief history of the nationâ€™s names</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/ncert-textbooks-replace-india-with-bharat-8999272/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The 2022 Social Science committee of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in India has suggested that the country should be called "Bharat" in all Social Science textbooks up to Class 12. The committee's chairman, Prof CI Issac, stated that they hope this change will be implemented in the next academic year. This proposal comes amidst an ongoing debate about the nation's name, which gained attention during the G20 Summit when the invitation mentioned "The President of Bharat" instead of "President of India." The name "Bharat" has roots in ancient literature and legends, such as the Mahabharata. It is associated with the land between the southern sea and the northern snow-covered regions. The name "India" itself has a history derived from the Persian term "Hindu" and the Sanskrit word "Sindhu," referring to the lower Indus basin. Over time, the name "India" came to represent the region beyond the Indus. The article also explores the debates within the Constituent Assembly on naming the country, with some advocating for "Bharat" due to its historical and cultural significance.

Kaur was found dead on October 21, and a suicide note blamed disputes at her home, as well as state education minister Harjot Singh Bains for the stress caused by not getting a job despite being selected. Kaur was part of a union of unemployed teachers protesting against the AAP government, and farmer unions and Opposition parties have joined their cause, demanding Bains's arrest. The police have booked Kaur's husband and father-in-law for mental cruelty and abetment to suicide. 

The controversy arises from appointments made under the previous Charanjit Singh Channi government, which were later declared unconstitutional by the High Court. The new recruitment process for teaching positions in government colleges was announced in October 2021, and candidates were shortlisted through written tests. However, issues were raised regarding the haste of the process and alleged violations of University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines and Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) approval. Despite these concerns, appointment letters were issued to 607 candidates, but 483 were never given postings.

Several petitions were filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court challenging the recruitment process, leading to the court quashing the entire process due to a disregard for the rule of law. The protesters are now demanding justice for Balwinder Kaur, the arrest of Harjot Bains, and immediate postings for the remaining candidates. The government has challenged the High Court order, and the next hearing is scheduled for November 29. The AAP has responded by criticizing the opposition for spreading false narratives and engaging in character assassination.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 13:03:15 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/kaur-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/kaur-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - The benefits that Agniveers get, compared with those of regular soldiers</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/agniveers-regular-soldiers-benefits-agnipath-8999008/</link><description>The article discusses the death of a 22-year-old Agniveer named Akshay Laxman Gawte, who was deployed on the Siachen glacier. This incident has drawn attention to the Agnipath contractual scheme for recruitment into the armed forces and the benefits provided under it. Another Agniveer, Amritpal Singh, from Punjab's Mansa district, died by suicide while on sentry duty in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri sector.

In response to Gawte's death, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticized the lack of gratuity and other benefits during service for Agniveers, as well as the absence of pensionary benefits for their families. The Agnipath scheme was introduced last year to recruit individuals for the Army, Navy, and Indian Air Force (IAF) on four-year contracts, including training.

At the end of four years, up to 25% of recruits can apply to join the services on a regular basis, based on merit and organizational requirements. The scheme aimed to address the suspension of recruitment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and enable women to be recruited as Agniveers in the IAF and Navy.

The government stated that the scheme would create a youthful profile for the armed forces, transform them into a tech-savvy and modern fighting force, and provide disciplined and skilled youth from various backgrounds to civil society after their retirement. One of the motivations behind the scheme was also to reduce the overall defense pension bill.

Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveers receive a monthly remuneration of Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000, along with risk and hardship allowances. They also contribute 30% of their monthly emoluments to a Seva Nidhi package, which is matched by the government. Upon completion of four years, they receive around Rs 11.71 lakh (with interest) from the package, exempt from income tax.

In the event of death on duty, Agniveers receive over Rs 1 crore, including the Seva Nidhi package and full pay for the period they could not serve. In case of disability attributed to or aggravated by military service, they can receive up to Rs 44 lakh, depending on the extent of the disability.

The key difference between a regular soldier and an Agniveer serving for four years is that the former receives a pension post-retirement, while an Agniveer does not. However, the 25% of Agniveers absorbed into the forces after four years become eligible for pension after retirement.

Regular soldiers also receive additional benefits such as gratuity, insurance cover, children's education allowance, and liberalized family pension for life in the event of a battle casualty. These benefits are not available to Agniveers. The starting salary of a regular soldier is higher than that of an Agniveer.

Overall, the article highlights the debate surrounding the Agnipath scheme and the differences in benefits between regular soldiers and Agniveers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:41:32 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Agniveer-2.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Agniveer-2.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why the IDF will struggle to â€˜neutraliseâ€™ Gazaâ€™s tunnels</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/idf-neutralise-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-8998837/</link><description>An article discusses the challenges and significance of the labyrinth of tunnels controlled by Hamas in Gaza. The tunnels, estimated to be around 500 kilometers long and up to 70 meters underground, play a crucial role for Gazans by serving as a lifeline for essential items and smuggling goods from Egypt. Hamas also uses the tunnels to smuggle weapons and for military operations against Israel. The tunnels pose a significant challenge for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) due to their scale, complexity, and strategic importance. Locating and eliminating the tunnels is difficult, as they are often found through human detective work rather than advanced surveillance technology. In addition, fighting in tunnels favors Hamas militants and poses risks of collateral damage. Although the IDF is highly trained for tunnel warfare, neutralizing the extensive tunnel network will be time-consuming and come at a significant human cost. It is unlikely that the entire network will be destroyed, even with Israel's efforts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 10:57:49 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/MIDEAST_GAZA_2.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/MIDEAST_GAZA_2.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>The new made-in-India EV charging standard for bikes and scooters: hereâ€™s why it matters</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/india-new-national-ev-charging-standard-8998587/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has approved a new charging connector standard for light electric vehicles (LEVs) in India. The standard, called ISI7017, is the first in the world to combine both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) charging for LEVs such as scooters, bikes, and rickshaws. This standard was developed through collaboration among various government and industry stakeholders, including NITI Aayog, the Department of Science and Technology, and electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy. 

The need for a national standard in India arises from the fact that EV makers in the country currently use different charging connector standards, similar to how Apple and Android phones used different connectors in the past. This lack of standardization makes it difficult for public charging stations to cater to all types of EVs, leading to range anxiety. While the new approved standard addresses the issue of different AC and DC charging standards by creating a combined standard, it does not mandate EV makers to use a uniform standard for their vehicles. 

In contrast, other countries have implemented national or regional charging standards. China, the largest market for electric cars, uses a national standard called GB/T. The United States does not have a national standard, but EV makers like Ford and General Motors are adopting the North American Charging Standard (NACS) developed by Tesla. In Europe, the Combined Charging System (CCS) is the predominant standard and is also required for EV charging networks by the European Union. Japan has its own standard called CHAdeMO, although it is being phased out in North America.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:52:46 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1559035.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1559035.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Telanganaâ€™s law under scanner: How preventive detention works</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/telanganas-law-under-scanner-how-preventive-detention-works-8998057/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Telangana government's use of its stringent preventive detention law is being questioned as the state gears up for assembly polls. The Supreme Court has expressed concerns about the "pernicious trend prevalent in the state of Telangana." Preventive detention allows the state to detain a person without trial or conviction, based on suspicion. The Indian Constitution permits preventive detention under Article 22, which is a part of the fundamental rights section. Several states in India also have their own preventive detention legislation. The process involves the issuance of a detention order by the state, and if the detention is for more than three months, it requires approval from an advisory board. The detainee must be informed of the grounds for detention and given an opportunity to make a representation against the order. However, judicial review in such cases is narrow and limited to the advisory board's consideration of material facts and the absence of obvious malafide intentions by the state. The court cannot check the veracity of the facts mentioned in the grounds of detention.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 01:42:38 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/gavel-759aaa.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/gavel-759aaa.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why Mumbai is witnessing more poor air quality days</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-mumbai-is-witnessing-more-poor-air-quality-days-8998070/</link><description>Mumbai's air quality during winter has been deteriorating, similar to Delhi. Previously, Mumbai was considered less affected by air pollution due to its coastal location and strong sea breezes that would blow away dust and particles. However, in the last two years, this geographical advantage has proven unreliable. Last year, Mumbai experienced a prolonged period of poor air quality, even surpassing Delhi on some days. Adverse meteorological conditions and a consistent decline in air quality have contributed to this issue. Mumbai's air quality is influenced by the direction and strength of winds. While the city generates pollutants similar to Delhi, the coastal winds usually help in cleansing the air. However, disruptions in wind patterns, such as longer intervals between wind direction changes, can impact air quality. Last year's disruptions may have been influenced by La Nina, a weather phenomenon. Currently, Mumbai experienced a dip in air quality due to calmer winds and a temperature gradient that brought dust from nearby construction projects. Overall, Mumbai's air quality has been declining due to increased economic activity, vehicles, construction, and emissions without sufficient mitigation efforts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 01:30:48 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Mumbai-air-pollution-3.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Mumbai-air-pollution-3.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Iceland PM joins womenâ€™s strike: Why the â€˜worldâ€™s most gender-equal countryâ€™ is protesting inequality</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iceland-pm-joins-womens-strike-why-8997923/</link><description>Women in Iceland, known for being the most gender-equal country, went on strike to protest against gender discrimination.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In his Vijaydashami speech in Nagpur, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat criticized "cultural Marxists or woke" individuals, referring to them as deceitful and destructive forces in India. He accused these forces of disguising their true intentions while taking control of the media and academia to create confusion, chaos, and corruption in education, culture, politics, and society. The term 'woke' originated in the United States and has been the subject of cultural debate. Initially used within Black communities to denote awareness and activism, it gained momentum during the civil rights movement. Over time, it was incorporated into music and popularized further in 2014 following incidents of police brutality and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement. The word has now entered the global lexicon, with conservative politicians in Europe and Australia deriding inclusivity as 'woke' and associating it with issues like gender equality and environmental conservation. Critics argue that its widespread usage has divorced it from its activist roots, allowing powerful individuals to use it superficially for political correctness without meaningful action. Some companies also employ 'woke' in ad campaigns for publicity. The empty usage of the term has garnered criticism from both progressive and conservative perspectives. Indian-origin US Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, a potential candidate for the 2024 Presidential elections, has written a book titled 'Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,' which critiques the concept of stakeholder capitalism. Conservatives see 'woke' as an identity-driven approach that challenges ideas of liberalism and capitalism, while others debate the necessity and strength of remaining vigilant.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:58:25 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/PTI10_24_2023_000075A.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/PTI10_24_2023_000075A.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Bhagwat praises Ambedkar: How the RSS came to embrace the father of Indiaâ€™s constitution</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bhagwat-ambedkar-rss-8997717/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

This is part of the RSS's long-standing practice of praising Ambedkar, especially since the BJP came to power in 2014. However, this raises questions about how the exclusivist Hindu nationalism of the RSS aligns with the republican ideals of Ambedkar, who embraced Buddhism after leaving the Hindu fold. Historically, the RSS criticized Ambedkar and his work, opposing reforms of Hindu personal laws. However, since the 1980s, after incidents involving conversions to Islam, the RSS has invoked Ambedkar and Dalits to promote Hindu unity. They organized events and built on the symbolism of celebrating both Ambedkar and Hedgewar's birthdays. In 2015, Bhagwat emphasized the importance of Hindu unity and in the following year, the RSS's organiser published articles praising Ambedkar.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:02:19 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/RSS-Ambedkar.jpeg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/RSS-Ambedkar.jpeg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>How the United Nations was born on this day in 1945, and how it has evolved</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/united-nations-founded-history-1945-evolution-explained-8997530/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

The UN replaced the League of Nations, which had failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. The idea for the UN was first discussed by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1941, and it was officially established with the signing of the UN Declaration by representatives of 51 nations in 1945. The UN has since grown to include 193 member states and has expanded its scope to address various global issues such as health, environment, and human rights. It has achieved significant milestones, including the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948 and the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002. However, it has also faced criticism for its failures, such as its inability to prevent genocides in Rwanda and sexual misconduct allegations against its peacekeeping missions.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent rise in bond yields, particularly focusing on the increase in 10-year government bond yields in the US and India. The US 10-year bond yield reached its highest level since July 2007, touching 5.02%. This surge is attributed to various factors, including expectations that the US Federal Reserve will maintain high interest rates for longer due to concerns over inflation caused by high energy prices.

In India, the yield on 10-year government bonds rose to 7.38%, a 24 basis points increase within a month. The hardening of bond yields globally has been influenced by factors such as rising crude oil prices, inflation risks, signals from the US Federal Reserve regarding interest rates, and increased government borrowing.

Investors are also concerned about the US government's significant borrowing plans and robust economic data that suggests the Federal Reserve may keep rates higher for an extended period. These factors, along with inflation concerns related to energy prices and global uncertainties like the Israel-Hamas conflict, have led investors to demand higher yields on their bond investments.

US Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that below-trend growth and softening labor market conditions are necessary for inflation to reach the target of 2%. Any evidence of above-trend growth or tightness in the labor market could put progress on inflation at risk, potentially leading to further tightening of monetary policy and pushing up bond yields.

The rise in bond yields indicates that the cost of funds in the financial system is increasing, signaling an upswing in interest rates. This has implications for the government, as it would have to pay more as yield to investors, resulting in higher borrowing costs. Overall, this can put upward pressure on interest rates in the banking system.

Rising yields suggest expectations of higher inflation and the possibility of a rate hike or status quo on interest rates. They can also trigger a shift of capital from bank fixed deposits to sovereign guaranteed bonds when the yield differential widens. Debt investors are likely to be affected by this rise in yields, as bond prices decline and net asset values of debt funds holding government securities decrease.

The article emphasizes that bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. As bond prices fall when yields rise, it can have a negative impact on the net asset values of debt funds and corporate bonds priced higher than government bonds. The overall rise in bond yields could also have a cascading negative effect on equities.

In summary, the increase in bond yields indicates rising interest rate expectations, leading to selling pressure on bond papers. This, in turn, affects the financial system, increases borrowing costs, impacts debt funds and corporate bonds, and may have a negative influence on equity markets.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:16:39 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Financial_Markets-Treasury_Yields_90735-fcd1a.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Financial_Markets-Treasury_Yields_90735-fcd1a.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>China to build the worldâ€™s largest â€˜ghost particleâ€™ detector: What are neutrinos and why do they need to be detected?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/china-largest-ghost-particle-detector-neutrinos-explained-8997219/</link><description>China is constructing a large telescope in the western Pacific Ocean to detect neutrinos, also known as "ghost particles".

The government has been focusing on equal distribution of medical colleges across the country, and a new regulation by the National Medical Commission (NMC) has put a hold on new medical colleges and expansion of existing colleges in states with more than 100 medical education seats per million population. This regulation has caused anger among southern states, as they are now ineligible for additional medical education seats. The NMC argues that these guidelines will reduce regional disparities in doctor availability and ensure quality education for all. The article also provides a table showing the distribution of medical college seats among states, revealing that several states have exceeded the NMC's recommended population-to-seats ratio. Meghalaya, Bihar, and Jharkhand are highlighted as states with the most significant deficiency of medical college seats. Despite efforts from the government to increase seat numbers, there are still shortages, and critics argue that this has affected the quality of education. The NMC's argument of rationalizing the distribution of medical colleges is supported by experts, who stress the need to balance the concentration of colleges in certain areas. However, concerns are raised about the shortage of faculty in these colleges. The NMC states that the ratio will only apply to new medical colleges or increased seats from the 2024-25 batch onward, and it aims to reduce regional disparities and improve the quality of education.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 02:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1753180.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1753180.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>How Ramleela reached Trinidad and became a representation of â€˜Indiannessâ€™</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/ramleela-trinidad-indentured-labour-8996443/</link><description>Ramleela, a traditional folk theatre performance in India, has made its way to Trinidad through the Indian diaspora. In the early 19th century, Trinidad turned to indentured labor from India after slavery was abolished. The first boatload of indentured Indians arrived in Trinidad in 1845, bringing with them their culture and the Ramcharitmanas, a Hindu text. Ramleela became popular among the Indian community in Trinidad, but its popularity declined as formal education spread and younger generations became less familiar with the Manas. Migration to urban areas and exposure to other cultural influences also contributed to the decline. However, Ramleela has undergone innovation and adaptation to appeal to younger audiences, with increased financial backing leading to higher production values. Despite these changes, the essence of the story and performance remains the same, serving as an anchor for the Indian community in Trinidad and representing their Indianness.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 14:13:41 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/RamLeelaTrinidad.jpeg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/RamLeelaTrinidad.jpeg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Hand, Lotus, noodle bowl, charger and more: How are symbols allotted to political parties in India?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/hand-lotus-how-political-parties-allotted-symbols-explained-8996390/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has rejected a petition filed by the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) party in Telangana, challenging the allotment of election symbols to two other parties. The BRS argued that the symbols of 'road roller' and 'chapatti roller' allocated to the Yuga Thulasi Party and the Alliance of Democratic Reforms Party respectively, were too similar to their own symbol of a car. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that voters are intelligent enough to differentiate between the symbols.

The article explains how symbols are allotted to political parties in India. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for this process under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968. Symbols can either be reserved exclusively for recognized political parties or be 'free' symbols available for unrecognised registered parties. The EC publishes lists of parties and their symbols through a notification in the Gazette of India.

The ECI records show that symbols were initially sketched by a retiree draughtsman in September 1992, and the common man's identification with daily objects influenced their selection. Now, a list of 'free' symbols includes objects like a bowl of noodles and a mobile charger.

Political parties have the opportunity to state their preferences. Unregistered parties must provide the names of ten symbols in order of preference from the list of free symbols notified by the commission. Parties can propose three new symbols of their choice, but they must not resemble existing reserved symbols or free symbols, or have religious or communal connotations.

When a recognised political party splits, the EC decides on symbol allocation. For instance, in the case of the Congress party, the symbol of two bulls was initially used in the 1952 elections, but splits led to the current symbol of a hand.

In recent instances, the EC allowed one faction of the Shiv Sena party to retain its traditional bow and arrow symbol, while another faction was given a flaming torch symbol. Requests for symbols with religious connotations were rejected.

Overall, the article explains the process of symbol allotment to political parties in India and the role of the Election Commission in ensuring fairness and differentiation among symbols.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 13:24:23 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Untitled-design-101.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Untitled-design-101.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Israel wants civilians to flee northern Gaza: Why thatâ€™s not an option for many</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-war-civilians-to-flee-8996405/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

The Israeli military dropped leaflets calling for people to move south, warning that those who don't may be considered accomplices to terrorism. However, the danger of airstrikes on the road has made travel expensive, with drivers charging between $200 and $300 for a family trip south, compared to $3 per person before the conflict. Limited resources, including food and water, exacerbate the dire situation in Gaza. More than half of the enclave's 2 million residents have been displaced since Israel's retaliatory airstrikes began. The Israeli military denies considering those who haven't evacuated as members of armed Palestinian groups and claims to treat civilians appropriately.

Imran claims that the cable is evidence of a US conspiracy to push the Pakistani military to remove him from power in a parliamentary vote. However, he denies publicly revealing its contents and suggests that news outlets obtained the document from other sources.

The controversial document describes a meeting between US State Department officials and the Pakistani ambassador, which took place on March 7, 2022. It expresses displeasure with Imran's neutrality on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The cable, labeled "Secret," was sent to Islamabad by the ambassador. Shortly after the meeting, Imran's political rivals moved forward with a no-confidence vote, leading to his ouster as prime minister.

Imran first mentioned the secret document in March 2022, claiming it as proof of an international conspiracy against him. He continued to reference the classified cable after his removal from office. In response, the government accused him of exposing an official secret document, which harmed Pakistan's foreign relations. Imran was subsequently convicted and sentenced to three years in prison in another case, with his imprisonment pending the court ruling on the cypher case.

Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest carmaker, has reported sales of a million automatic vehicles, with close to 1 lakh automatic cars sold in the current financial year. One reason for this trend is the ease of driving an automatic in stop-start traffic in congested Indian cities. Additionally, advancements in technology have allowed manufacturers to offer automatic transmissions across various price points, narrowing the mileage gap between manuals and automatics.

Maruti Suzuki now offers automatic transmission variants across almost all its models, with non-manual variants accounting for more than 12% of sales in FY23, up from under 10% in FY21. Hyundai Motor India and Volkswagen Passenger Cars India also report significant proportions of automatic sales, with automatics making up more than 25% and 60% of their overall sales, respectively.

According to data from JATO Dynamics, automatic variants constitute over 28% of total passenger vehicle sales, up from around 15% in 2018. Maruti Suzuki's automatic sales are dominated by customers from Delhi-NCR, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Kerala.

Different types of automatic transmissions are available in India, including AMTs (Automated Manual Transmission), iMTs (Intelligent Manual Transmission), CVTs (Continuously Variable Transmissions), DCTs (Dual-Clutch Transmissions), torque converters, and e-CVTs (Electric Continuously Variable Transmissions). Each type has its advantages and disadvantages.

AMT is the most common type, offering a similar experience to manual transmission but with sensors and actuators handling clutch and gear shifts. Maruti Suzuki, Renault, Tata Motors, and Hyundai are among the companies offering AMTs in their vehicles.

iMT is a clutchless manual transmission that requires manual operation of the gear lever but eliminates the need for clutch operation. Hyundai and Kia have incorporated iMT transmissions in their turbo-petrol variants.

Torque converters, the most common automatic transmission globally, provide good performance, fuel efficiency, reliability, and are cost-effective to produce. Maruti Suzuki offers this type of transmission in several models.

CVTs feature a single-speed auto gearbox with two cone-shaped pulleys connected by a drive belt. They offer smooth and fuel-efficient performance but may exhibit a disconnect between engine revs and acceleration. Toyota, Honda, and Nissan utilize CVTs in some of their vehicles.

DCTs use two clutch packs to enable quick gear shifts without interrupting power flow. Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, and Skoda include DCT gearboxes in select models.

e-CVTs, used in hybrid vehicles, employ electric motor-generators connected to a planetary gearbox. This mechanism allows for electric-only drive and regenerative braking. Toyota utilizes e-CVT in its hybrid models.

Overall, the increasing popularity of automatic transmissions in India can be attributed to factors such as driving convenience, advancements in technology, and a wider range of options across different price points.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 12:15:40 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/e-vehicles-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/e-vehicles-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why VFS clarification brings some relief to Indiaâ€™s Canada visa applicants</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/vfs-canada-visa-applicants-services-centres-8995815/</link><description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli warplanes struck parts of Gaza and two airports in Syria on October 22, roughly two weeks after Hamas struck Israel. The attack on Syria is believed to be linked to preventing another front of the fighting from opening up towards Israel's north. It is speculated that the strikes are aimed at attacking Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant organization that has threatened to open a front of attacks towards Israel's north. Hezbollah has historically opposed Israel and Western influence in West Asia and is supported by Iran. Syria has also opposed Israel since its formation in 1948 and has fought wars against it, including the Six-Day War of 1967. The relationship between Hezbollah and Syria has shifted over the years due to changing external influences. Israeli airstrikes have targeted international airports in Damascus and Aleppo, causing damage and casualties. Concerns arise over a potential ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces and the potential spillover effects caused by actors like Hezbollah, which could widen the conflict in West Asia.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 15:22:26 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-20T132026Z_1546105495_RC2DW3ARTQYN_RTRMADP_5_ISRAEL-PALESTINANS-SYRIA-PROTEST.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-20T132026Z_1546105495_RC2DW3ARTQYN_RTRMADP_5_ISRAEL-PALESTINANS-SYRIA-PROTEST.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - This Quote Means: Tolkienâ€™s â€˜not all those who wander are lostâ€™</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-tolkiens-not-all-those-who-wander-are-lost-8995097/</link><description>The article discusses the meaning and importance of the quote "not all those who wander are lost" from JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

The Gaza Strip has been facing shortages of medicine, fuel, and food since Israel cut off electricity following the attack. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that four of the trucks contained health supplies, including trauma medicines and supplies, medicines for chronic diseases, and basic medical supplies. The Palestinian Red Crescent and the Egyptian Red Crescent are working with WHO to ensure safe delivery of the aid. However, the WHO emphasized that the aid provided only addresses a small portion of the growing health needs in Gaza and called for a larger, protected aid operation. The Gaza Strip is densely populated, with 41% of its population under the age of 15. Over 1.4 million Gazans have been internally displaced due to the recent conflict, and the territory's 13 hospitals are only partially operational due to supply shortages and fuel rationing. The Gaza Strip has one power plant, generating far less electricity than is needed, and Gazans have been receiving an average of 13 hours of electricity per day this year. The unemployment rate in Gaza is over 45%, and over 80% of Gazans rely on humanitarian assistance. Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007, severely restricting people's movements in and out of the area. The Rafah crossing to Egypt is currently the only route for food, aid, and other items into Gaza.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 08:52:08 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-21T125758Z_1437444738_RC2YW3AYFPEH_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-21T125758Z_1437444738_RC2YW3AYFPEH_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is â€˜Visa Shoppingâ€™ and why is it being done to enter countries in Europe</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/visa-shopping-immigration-europe-schengen-explained-8994712/</link><description>The practice of "visa shopping" is gaining popularity in several Indian states, including Punjab. Visa shopping refers to obtaining visas for countries that individuals may or may not visit during the granted visa period. People engage in this practice to enter their preferred countries, especially in Europe, even if they already have a visa for another European nation. Some individuals also purchase visas for countries they have no immediate plans to visit in order to increase their chances of obtaining visas for countries of their choice in the future. The Schengen visa, which allows travelers to explore many European countries without separate visas, is a popular example of visa shopping. This practice is legal as long as individuals follow the proper norms and guidelines of the visa process and have valid permission to stay in the country they enter. However, repeated engagement in visa shopping may raise suspicions and could lead to consequences such as visa refusal or being offloaded from a plane.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 08:25:22 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/europe-1264062_1920.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/europe-1264062_1920.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Who are the Bedouin Arabs in the Israeli army?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bedouin-arabs-israeli-army-8993875/</link><description>The article discusses the involvement of Bedouin soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and their contributions in defending against Hamas fighters. Bedouins are a nomadic Muslim Arab people living in the Negev desert in southern Israel. In the past, they were pastoralists, but they began settling into a sedentary lifestyle during the Ottoman rule. Before the formation of Israel, Bedouins were employed by early Jewish settlers to protect their communities. During the Arab-Israeli war in 1948-49, Bedouins provided valuable support to Jewish militias and the IDF. Israel recognized many Bedouins as citizens in the 1950s and created settlements for them in the Negev. Bedouins continued to serve in the IDF, primarily in scouting and tracking units. Specialized search and rescue units comprised mainly of Bedouins were also established. Training is optional for Bedouins, but a significant number choose to volunteer. In 2021, a record number of around 600 Bedouins voluntarily enlisted in the IDF. The article highlights the coexistence of Bedouins with Jewish and Arab communities in regions like Shibli. The Bedouin population in Israel currently numbers 210,000 individuals. The Israeli government has launched Operation Negev Shield to help Bedouin communities integrate into society and discourage criminal activity through educational programs. The article also mentions notable figures such as the first Bedouin ambassador to Israel and a Bedouin co-founder of a high-tech company in Israel.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 12:44:15 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Bedouin.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Bedouin.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Nawaz Sharif back in Pakistan: What this means for the former PM, his country, and Imran Khan</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nawaz-sharif-returns-pakistan-8993870/</link><description>Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has returned to Pakistan after four years of voluntary exile in London. Sharif, who left Pakistan in 2019 for medical treatment while serving a prison sentence for corruption, landed in Islamabad and will travel to Lahore to hold a gathering of his supporters. His return is seen as a signal that the military is willing to give him another chance and help thwart Imran Khan and his party from coming to power. Sharif's downfall came after he lost support from the military and was accused of corruption. He was disqualified from office and later banned from politics. The military had previously supported Khan but their relationship soured, leading to Khan's ouster as prime minister. Sharif remains popular and the military hopes his return will help defeat Khan's party in the upcoming general elections. However, Sharif must have his corruption-related convictions overturned in order to run for office again.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 12:33:06 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Nawaz.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Nawaz.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Israel missiles hit Gazaâ€™s oldest church: What you need to know about the Church of Saint Porphyrius</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-missiles-hit-gazas-oldest-church-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-church-of-saint-porphyrius-8993651/</link><description>An Israeli airstrike on a building near the Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza has caused significant damage.

The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem has condemned the attack, labeling it a war crime. The church, located in Gaza's old city, dates back to 425 CE and is of significant historical and religious importance. It has served as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims during times of conflict.

The ongoing conflict in Israel and the complex geopolitics of the West Asian region have further complicated the project. The IMEC's design includes multiple nations with different political dynamics and historical tensions, making diplomatic cooperation even more difficult. The US backing was seen as crucial, but the recent fighting between Israel and Hamas threatens to disrupt the project. The timing of the announcement of the project was deemed premature, lacking implementation details and funding information. However, it is believed that using the land route in the Arabian Peninsula could provide logistical advantages by bypassing the congested Suez Canal. The project involves close coordination between various departments and ministries across multiple countries. The current tensions in the region may derail the diplomatic outreach between Israel and Saudi Arabia, potentially impacting the project. Turkey has also announced its own counter-project to the IMEC due to feeling bypassed. The IMEC was part of a US-led initiative called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment, and discussions on the project began in early 2023. The corridor's alignment stretches from Western India to Europe, passing through ports such as Haifa in Israel and Dubai. It aims to provide a reliable and cost-effective transit network for goods and services between India and Europe, including options for electricity, digital connectivity, and clean hydrogen export pipelines.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 08:24:06 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/biden-saudi-modi.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/biden-saudi-modi.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Affidavit, approver: What Mahua, Hiranandani are talking about</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/affidavit-approver-mahua-hiranandani-8993467/</link><description>Darshan Hiranandani, CEO of the Hiranandani Group, has submitted a sworn affidavit to the Ethics Committee of Lok Sabha, making allegations against TMC MP Mahua Moitra and others.

According to Indian law, an affidavit is a sworn statement made before a notary or officer of the court outside of the court. The Supreme Court has ruled that an affidavit must be made on oath or affirmation before a person authorized to administer it. Affidavits are commonly used in legal proceedings and trials, as well as for other purposes such as property registration or declaring legal heirs.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has welcomed the opportunity to answer questions from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee regarding allegations of involvement in a "cash for query" scheme. This comes after Darshan Hiranandani, CEO of the Hiranandani Group, claimed in an affidavit to the Ethics Committee that Moitra provided him with her Parliament login and password to post questions on her behalf. 

The article explains the procedure for asking questions in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament. MPs must give notice to the Secretary-General of the Lok Sabha, including details such as the text of the question, the relevant minister, and the preferred date for the answer. Generally, MPs are allowed to submit up to five notices per day. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha reviews the submitted questions and determines their admissibility.

There are different types of questions, including starred and unstarred questions, short-notice questions, and questions addressed to private Members. Starred questions are orally answered by the minister and allow supplementary questions, while unstarred questions receive written replies and do not have follow-up questions. Short-notice questions pertain to urgent matters and can be asked with less notice, followed by supplementary questions. Questions addressed to private Members are related to bills, resolutions, or matters for which the MP is responsible.

Asking questions in the Lok Sabha is considered an important parliamentary right that allows MPs to practice legislative control over executive actions. It enables them to obtain information, criticize government policies, shed light on government lapses, and encourage ministers to take action for the public good. Similarly, the government can gauge public opinion through these questions and may initiate further actions based on the responses received.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 15:23:55 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/mahua-moita-explained.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/mahua-moita-explained.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Israel-Palestine conflict: How international humanitarian law views forced displacement and human shields</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/international-humanitarian-law-forced-displacement-human-shields-8992746/</link><description>In this article, United States President Joe Biden accuses Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, of using innocent Palestinians as human shields. Israel has also long accused Hamas of this practice. Protests against the forced displacement of Gazans and other Palestinians by Israel are ongoing in the Arab world and beyond. Arab leaders are concerned that this displacement will lead to a refugee influx in neighboring countries and permanently solidify Israeli occupation in the Holy Land.

The article explains that the term "human shields" refers to civilians or protected persons whose presence or movement is intended to render military targets immune from attack. It is not necessary for them to physically shield against bullets; even forcing them to remain near military targets or placing military targets in civilian areas is considered using human shields. International Humanitarian Law (IHL) protects not only civilians but also the sick, wounded, shipwrecked, prisoners of war, and other detained persons during times of war.

Using human shields is considered a war crime and is prohibited under IHL. However, it is also not allowed to target or attack human shields. The only exception to the immunity of protected persons is if they directly participate in hostilities. In the case of Gaza, the population density complicates matters as there is no place for Hamas combatants to exist without endangering civilians. Regardless of intent, it would be illegal for Israel to attack civilian homes used for military purposes.

The article mentions that Israel recently ordered hundreds of thousands of civilians to evacuate northern Gaza within 24 hours, potentially ahead of a planned ground invasion. According to the Statute of the International Criminal Court, ordering the displacement of civilians for reasons related to the conflict constitutes forcible displacement. This order was deemed unlawful by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Norwegian Refugee Council.

While warning civilians of legitimate military operations that may endanger them is necessary, threatening people to leave is illegal. Displacement of civilians must be temporary and for their benefit, and there should be guarantees of safety and the right to return. The article concludes by highlighting that the difference between evacuation and forced transfer depends on whether the act genuinely benefits the security of the civilians involved.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 15:21:32 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Palestinian-Civilian.jpeg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Palestinian-Civilian.jpeg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why the Indian Army is embracing AI</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/indian-army-artificial-intelligence-8992606/</link><description>Hmm, based on the provided article, the Indian Army has been deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) surveillance systems along its borders with Pakistan and China. These systems include high-resolution cameras, sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and radar feeds. The AI technology is used to detect intrusions at borders and classify targets. Additionally, AI-based real-time monitoring software has been deployed for generating intelligence in counter-terrorist operations. The Indian military is also exploring the potential of AI in defense, as evidenced by the launch of AI technologies and the use of AI-powered drones and robots for border patrol. However, it is important to note that even with advanced surveillance systems, human intelligence and interpretation are still crucial in analyzing data and making informed decisions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 13:28:07 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ai-indian-military.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ai-indian-military.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Canada visa services now available only in Delhi: How will Indian visa seekers, including students, be impacted?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/canada-visa-services-delhi-india-students-impact-explained-8992540/</link><description>Canada has stopped offering visa and consular services at its consulates in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru and will now only provide these services at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi. This decision comes after Canada withdrew 41 diplomats from India following New Delhi's announcement of revoking their diplomatic immunity. The diplomatic dispute between the two countries originated from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claim that India may have been involved in the killing of a Khalistani separatist in Canada. 

The expected fallout of this situation is a significant slowdown in Indian visa applications for Canada. A large number of these applications come from Indian students seeking to study in Canadian universities. As of December 31, 2022, there were 319,130 Indian students registered in Canada, making up 39.5% of the international student population. Canada is the second-largest destination for Indian students after the United States.

The slowdown in visa processing could have economic implications as Indian students contribute to the Canadian economy through tuition fees and living expenses. Indian students are estimated to contribute around Canadian $10 billion annually to the education sector in Canada. Additionally, international students, including Indian students, filled approximately 370,000 jobs in Canada.

The reduction in visa processing staff in India may lead to a potential backlog of 17,500 decisions on visa applications from India. However, third-party-operated visa application centers will not be impacted, and the majority of visa applications from India are processed outside the country through the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada's global network. The remaining staff will focus on urgent cases, visa printing, and working with visa application centers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 12:27:21 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1076483.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ch1076483.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>The colonial â€” and anti-colonial â€” roots of Durga Puja</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/history-durga-puja-bengal-company-8992370/</link><description>Durga Puja is a religious and festive occasion celebrated by Bengalis in Bengal and eastern India. It has a rich history that emerged under colonial rule. One popular origin story is set after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, where Robert Clive, after defeating Nawab Siraj ud Daula, wanted to hold a grand ceremony to thank God for his fortune. Unable to use a church that had been destroyed, Clive was advised by Nabakishan Deb, his Persian translator, to make offerings to Goddess Durga instead. This marked the beginning of Calcutta's first Durga Puja. However, the accuracy of this story is questionable. Despite that, it symbolizes the sociological origins of Durga Puja in Calcutta, which can be attributed to the relationship between Bengali zamindars, merchants, and the East India Company. With Company rule came social and economic changes, including the rise of powerful zamindars and wealthy Bengali merchants. Durga Puja became an occasion for displaying wealth and socializing with the British elites. Over time, feelings of nationalism emerged, and Durga Puja became part of the nascent nationalist project. After Lord Curzon's decision to Partition Bengal in 1905, Durga Puja took on a greater significance as a symbol of resistance against foreign rule. Public Pujas started to emerge in the 1920s, making the festival more inclusive and accessible to everyone. These public Pujas were organized by locality and open to all, regardless of caste or residence. Temporary temples called pandals were constructed in public spaces. Durga Puja became a celebration of both religious devotion and collective consciousness.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 11:11:17 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Prinsep-Pujo.jpeg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Prinsep-Pujo.jpeg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why is the Rafah border crossing so important for Gaza?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-rafah-border-crossing-important-gaza-explained-8991949/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the current situation at the Rafah crossing, the only land border point not controlled by Israel where civilians can enter and leave the Gaza Strip. Egypt has sealed the crossing since October 10th, causing pressure to open it as Israel prepares for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. Living conditions in Gaza have deteriorated rapidly due to Israeli airstrikes, some of which have also hit the crossing. President Joe Biden has urged Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and Israel stated that it would not block deliveries from Egypt. The article describes the appearance of the crossing and the restrictions on movement imposed by both Israel and Egypt. It also mentions that the crossing has been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, and on Monday, foreign passport holders were evacuated after the crossing was struck. Efforts to broker a deal for foreigners to leave and aid to enter Gaza have so far failed, leaving many American citizens and others stranded near the border without proper access to power, communication, medicine, water, and food. Truckloads of aid from various countries are waiting for permission to cross into Gaza from Egypt.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 06:21:48 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/GAZA-BORDER-EXPLAINER-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/GAZA-BORDER-EXPLAINER-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>PM Modi flags off RRTS: What is this mass transport system, how it can benefit NCR</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-to-flag-off-rrts-what-is-this-mass-transport-system-how-it-can-benefit-ncr-8991437/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the first leg of India's Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), marking the country's first mass rapid system dedicated to regional connectivity. The trains on this section will eventually reduce travel time between Delhi and Meerut to less than an hour. The RRTS is an integrated mass transit network aimed at promoting balanced and sustainable urban development in the National Capital Region (NCR). The project was initially proposed in 1998-99 by the Indian Railways, and later taken up by the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) in their transport plan for 2032. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), a joint venture of the Central government and the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, is responsible for implementing the RRTS project across the NCR. The RRTS is designed to provide faster transportation over longer distances compared to metros and average railway coaches. It draws inspiration from rapid transit systems in Paris, Germany, Austria, and the United States. Apart from enhancing multi-modal connectivity and reducing congestion, the RRTS aims to boost employment generation and facilitate economic activity in the region. The project is expected to increase economic productivity and promote business participation without the need for physical relocation. The RRTS trains will operate at speeds of up to 180 km/hour, significantly faster than the Delhi Metro, allowing for shorter travel times. Eight corridors are planned for development, three of which are currently under construction and set to be completed by 2025. The Sarai Kale Khan station in Delhi will serve as the main hub connecting all three corridors being constructed in phase one.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 01:37:57 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/RRTS-3cole.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/RRTS-3cole.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is the first test on Gaganyaan journey, to be held on Saturday</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-the-first-test-on-gaganyaan-journey-to-be-held-on-saturday-8991441/</link><description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to conduct the Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) on Saturday, as part of its preparations for launching an Indian astronaut into space. The test will demonstrate the performance of the Crew Escape System of the Gaganyaan project, which allows the crew to leave the spacecraft in an emergency. The rocket will reach an altitude of almost 17 km before triggering an abort signal, leading to the separation of the crew module and its descent using a parachute. The test mission will last 532 seconds and will check the functioning of systems for crew module separation and astronaut escape. ISRO has developed a low-cost Test Vehicle specifically for this purpose, which uses existing liquid propulsion technology.

It aims to fill vacancies in government schools by appointing teachers on a contractual basis until regular appointments are completed. The scheme is based on the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasizes the need for teachers with interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary skillsets. The Gyan Sahayak Scheme is applicable to government and grant-in-aid schools, including Mission Schools of Excellence. The salary for Gyan Sahayaks ranges from Rs 21,000 to Rs 26,000 per month, depending on the level of schooling. The scheme has faced opposition and protests from various groups, including student organizations and political parties. The appointments are made through a merit-cum-preference basis, and the contract period is automatically canceled after 11 months. The scheme aims to address the shortage of teachers and ensure uninterrupted education for students.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:43:05 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/teachse.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/teachse.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Vladimir Putin seen with â€˜nuclear briefcaseâ€™ in China: Its history, what it contains</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/vladimir-putin-nuclear-briefcase-explained-8991091/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.During a recent visit to China, Russian President Vladimir Putin was seen with officers carrying what is known as the "nuclear briefcase." The briefcase, also called the 'Cheget,' is part of a system for authorizing nuclear strikes and is used to convey orders to Russia's rocket forces. Apart from the president, the defense minister and the chief of general staff also have their own briefcases, and they are expected to coordinate in the event of a potential strike order. 

The first known instance of a nuclear briefcase being opened during a crisis occurred in 1995 when Russian officers mistook a research rocket launched by the US and Norway as a hostile missile. The incident lasted only a few minutes before the nature of the launch became clear, and the attack was averted. The system works through a network of radar operators, electronic command-and-control networks, and communication between the leaders holding the briefcases.

Similar to Russia, the American president has a nuclear briefcase officially called the Presidential Emergency Satchel, often referred to as the 'football.' It contains information on retaliatory options, classified site locations, and an authentication card with codes. The US vice president also carries a similar briefcase in case the president is incapacitated or deceased. There have been instances in the past where the codes were misplaced or lost temporarily, highlighting the need for stringent safety protocols around these briefcases.

Overall, these briefcases play a crucial role in ensuring the authorization and coordination of nuclear strikes, providing a mechanism for quick decision-making and response in potentially critical situations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:01:33 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-18T091916Z_908814147_RC2Q3X92LHTB_RTRMADP_5_CHINA-RUSSIA-PUTIN-NUCLEAR.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-18T091916Z_908814147_RC2Q3X92LHTB_RTRMADP_5_CHINA-RUSSIA-PUTIN-NUCLEAR.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Row over Jagannath templeâ€™s treasure room: Why has it not been unlocked in 38 years, why demands to open now</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/jagannath-temples-treasure-room-why-has-it-not-been-opened-8991140/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The demand to open the Ratna Bhandar (treasure room) of the Puri Jagannath Temple in Odisha, India is growing louder as elections approach. The treasure room has not been unlocked for three decades. The BJP and Congress parties have both raised the issue and demanded its opening. The Ratna Bhandar stores precious ornaments given by devotees and kings over centuries. The outer chamber is opened regularly for rituals, but the inner chamber has not been opened in 38 years. The demand to open the Ratna Bhandar has gained strength due to concerns about cracks in its walls that could endanger the stored ornaments. The last inventory of the Ratna Bhandar was made in 1978, and attempts to open it in 2018 were unsuccessful due to missing keys. A judicial inquiry was ordered to investigate the loss of the keys, and a report was submitted to the government in 2018. In August 2022, the ASI requested permission to inspect the inner chamber again, but it is yet to be granted. The temple managing committee has recommended opening the Ratna Bhandar during the annual Rath Yatra in 2024. A PIL was filed in the Orissa HC over the issue, and the court directed the government to form a high-level committee for inventory-making of the valuables.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 13:49:44 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Jagannath_Temple-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Jagannath_Temple-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Who are the Palestinians?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/who-are-palestinians-israel-hamas-8990440/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 08:29:59 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Betlehem_woman_dancing.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Betlehem_woman_dancing.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why Egypt and other Arab countries are unwilling to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/egypt-arab-countries-palestine-refugees-gaza-explained-8990382/</link><description>Egypt and Jordan have refused to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza, fearing that Israel wants to permanently expel Palestinians into their countries and nullify Palestinian demands for statehood.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new suspected Banksy mural has appeared near the Edgware Road Underground station in London. The artwork depicts robotic arms being pulled by three individuals and bears the words "Another World is Possible." While Banksy has not taken ownership of the mural yet, visitors are flocking to see it. Interpretations vary, with some perceiving it as a warning against the dangers of artificial intelligence, while others believe it references the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.

Banksy has been active in Palestine since the early 2000s, creating pieces such as the famous artwork on the West Bank Wall. He also owns a hotel next to Israel's separation wall in Bethlehem. One of his notable statements on the Israel-Palestine conflict is a 2015 video sarcastically promoting tourism in Gaza. The video showcases the devastation in Gaza caused by the conflict and highlights the restrictions faced by its residents.

In 2017, Banksy opened the Walled Off Hotel near the West Bank wall. The hotel features art by Banksy and other artists, Palestinian artworks in the gallery, and a museum showcasing audio-visual presentations. It gained popularity, receiving a five-star rating on TripAdvisor.

Banksy's earlier works in the region include the renowned Flower Thrower mural in Jerusalem, which symbolizes peace and beauty. Other murals depict provocative scenes involving Palestinian and Israeli figures. In 2005, Banksy painted large murals on the segregation wall, including images of children playing on a beach and the iconic Girl With Balloon.

Banksy's involvement in Palestine reflects his concern for the region's challenges. He has criticized the treatment of Palestinians and highlighted the hardships they face. Overall, his artworks in the area serve as powerful statements against oppression and inequality.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 15:02:05 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Banksy_The_Armoured_Dove-1600.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Banksy_The_Armoured_Dove-1600.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Severe drought grips the Amazon rainforest: The impact, cause and grim future</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/drought-amazon-rainforest-8989382/</link><description>The Amazon rainforest is currently facing an intense drought, causing numerous rivers to dry up. This has resulted in a lack of water, food, and medicine in Indigenous communities living in the area. The Rio Negro, one of the largest rivers in the world, has reached a record low level. This drought is considered the worst in history, according to the governor of Amazonas. The situation has led to stranded boats, wildfires, and the death of fish and river dolphins. The lack of water has also affected the operations of a major hydropower dam and left many people in remote villages without access to necessary supplies. The dry conditions have increased the risk of wildfires, leading to poor air quality in the city of Manaus. The drought is attributed to a combination of El Nino and high sea surface temperatures, which have hindered cloud formation and reduced rainfall. Studies suggest that with rising global temperatures, the Amazon will experience longer and more frequent droughts, potentially leading to irreversible damage. It is crucial to address deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions to protect the Amazon and mitigate the impact on the planet.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 14:20:48 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Amazon-rainforest-drought-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Amazon-rainforest-drought-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Scriptures may be copyright-free, but adaptations are protected: What HC has said</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/scriptures-copyright-free-adaptations-are-protected-8989236/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi High Court has ruled that there is "large-scale infringement" of copyrighted works belonging to the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, which publishes books and commentaries on Indian religious philosophy. The trust has been granted permission to approach tech companies like Google and Meta (owners of YouTube and Instagram) to issue takedown orders against those reproducing copyrighted material from the Srimad Bhagavad Gita.

The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, established in 1970 by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, holds the copyrights to various books and scriptures. Although religious scriptures are generally in the public domain and not protected by copyright, new creative works based on these scriptures, such as modern translations, can be copyright-protected.

In India, copyright law protects original works created by an author and grants them exclusive rights to use, reproduce, distribute, perform, and display their work. Transformative works that significantly modify or build upon existing material also receive protection under copyright law.

The petitioner, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, claimed that certain websites, mobile apps, and Instagram handles were reproducing their copyrighted works without permission. The court agreed that the reproduction of the text itself is permissible but stated that copyright protection applies to the original parts that explain, interpret, or teach the scripture.

Since Srila Prabhupada had transferred the copyrights to the trust, the court held that the works cannot be reproduced without authorization. The court found evidence of the defendant entities reproducing shlokas (verses), translations, and interpretations from Prabhupada's books, acknowledging that such piracy would cause immense financial losses to the trust.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 13:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Delhi-high-Court-2.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Delhi-high-Court-2.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>How can the West deal with Moscow and Pyongyang?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-can-the-west-deal-with-moscow-and-pyongyang-8989113/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

South Korea is considering additional measures against North Korea, but analysts suggest there are few options left for exerting pressure on the country. North Korea has managed to bypass international sanctions through alliances with Russia and China. The South Korean Foreign Ministry stated that any weapons exchanges between North Korea and Russia are a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and a threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Both Russia and North Korea have denied these allegations. Experts believe that Russia and North Korea's collaboration could last a long time as both countries have grievances against the West and desire to overturn the international order. However, further sanctions from the US or South Korea may not significantly impact North Korea's regime, as Russia has indicated it will not support additional UN pressure on North Korea. It is also suggested that North Korea may be willing to teach Russia some of its survival tactics in return for nuclear weapons and missile technology.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 12:14:29 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Kim-and-Putin-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Kim-and-Putin-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Israel using white phosphorus in Gaza? 5 things about the controversial weapon</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-white-phosphorus-gaza-5-things-8988938/</link><description>Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of using white phosphorus munitions in Gaza and Lebanon, violating International Humanitarian Law. Both organizations cited eyewitness accounts and video evidence to support their claim that Israel's use of these munitions in densely populated areas poses long-term risks to civilians. The IDF, however, denies these allegations. Here are five key things to know about white phosphorus munitions:

1. White phosphorus is a pyrophoric substance that ignites when exposed to oxygen, producing thick smoke and intense heat.

2. It falls under the category of "Pyrophoric solids, category 1" according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, which includes chemicals that catch fire spontaneously when in contact with air. It is one of the most unstable pyrophoric substances.

3. White phosphorus is primarily used as a smokescreen to conceal troop movement on the ground, as it acts as a visual obscurant. It also interferes with infrared optics and weapons tracking systems, protecting forces from guided missiles.

4. Apart from its use as a smokescreen, white phosphorus can also be used as an incendiary weapon. US forces reportedly used it during the second battle of Fallujah in Iraq in 2004 to force combatants to abandon their positions.

5. Exposure to white phosphorus can cause severe burns, damage to internal organs, respiratory issues, and harm to infrastructure, property, crops, and livestock. Even a small percentage of burns on the body can be fatal.

White phosphorus munitions have been used in conflicts worldwide throughout history, including World War I, World War II, and more recent events like the invasion of Iraq and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. While these munitions are not completely banned, their use is regulated under International Humanitarian Law, specifically Protocol III of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW). However, there are loopholes in the protocol that restrict its effectiveness in preventing civilian harm. Efforts have been made to strengthen the CCW and close these loopholes over the years.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 10:30:53 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/White-Phosphorus.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/White-Phosphorus.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What DA hike means for govt employees, the exchequer</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/festive-bonus-what-da-hikes-mean-for-govt-employees-the-exchequer-8988977/</link><description>The Union Cabinet has approved a 4 percentage point increase in dearness allowance (DA) and dearness relief for central government employees and pensioners.

The decision could potentially lead to a tax burden of around $1 billion for older telcos like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in the current fiscal year. Instead of deducting the entire expenditure at once, the companies will need to deduct a portion of the total fee each year for tax purposes. The court also overturned a Delhi High Court order that classified license fees before and after July 31, 1999, differently as capital and revenue expenses respectively. This change in accounting treatment could affect cash flow for telecom companies. While the judgment is expected to increase EBITDA/PBT (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization/profit before tax), it may initially result in higher tax outgo and lower cash flow.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Dutch cricket team has made history by defeating South Africa in a rain-truncated game in Dharamshala. This victory marks their first win in 50 over World Cups. Cricket was introduced to the Netherlands in the 18th century through British traders and spread through elite Dutch schools. The first written reference of the game being played in the Netherlands dates back to 1845. However, cricket in the Netherlands developed differently from British colonies, with different clubs following their own rules and ideas of the game. This lack of standardization led to embarrassing losses for the Dutch team against proper English sides. In 1884, the Nederlandsche Cricket Board (NCB) was founded to ensure proper administration of the game, making it the second international cricket association in the world after MCC. World War I brought an influx of talent to Dutch leagues, and cricket continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1930s. Despite World War II, cricket did not stop being played in the Netherlands and was seen as a demonstration of defiance against Nazi occupation. The professionalization of Dutch football in 1954 made it more accessible than cricket, leading to its decline as a popular sport. Additionally, the exclusionary policies of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which only granted Test status to England, Australia, and South Africa, further hindered the development of cricket in the Netherlands. If ICC had been more inclusive, Netherlands could have enjoyed regular international matches and seen an increase in standards and performances.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 17:47:41 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Netherlands.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Netherlands.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - PMK says abolish All India Quota: The problem of vacant MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pmk-all-india-quota-vacant-mbbs-seats-tamil-nadu-8987644/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has called for the abolition of the All India Quota for MBBS seats due to a flawed allotment system. PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss highlighted that 16 MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu's government medical colleges remain unoccupied even after four rounds of counseling. The issue stems from the National Medical Commission's policy on student admissions, which increased counseling rounds to four. If seats remain unfilled after the fourth round, they go to waste, resulting in missed opportunities and financial losses for the state government. Last year, six MBBS seats remained unfilled, and this year, the number stands at 16. The situation has worsened despite efforts by the Medical Counselling Committee and the State Selection Committee. Tamil Nadu contributes over 800 seats to the All India Quota, and parents, students, and counselors are urging the state to appeal to the Supreme Court to prevent these high-demand seats from going unclaimed. Experts argue that the flawed admission policy by the central government is at the root of the problem. The Centre announced that it would no longer return any seat surrendered by state governments, leading Tamil Nadu to take legal measures to fill 24 government medical college seats after the admission deadline. Private medical colleges can admit students until the deadline, while state-run colleges with lower fees are left with vacant seats. PMK leader Ramadoss suggests scrapping the All India Quota since every state now has its own medical institutions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 13:56:23 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/MBBS-students-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/MBBS-students-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>An Expert Explains: Iranâ€™s role in the Israel-Hamas crisis</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-role-iran-israel-hamas-crisis-8987527/</link><description>US President Joe Biden is set to visit Israel and Jordan, following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visits to several Middle Eastern countries. However, there has been no outreach towards Iran, which is currently under US sanctions and is seen by many in the West as having enabled the recent Hamas assault on Israel. Iran has been raising concerns about the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and the humanitarian situation there, denying any involvement in the Hamas attack. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian is also touring the region, meeting with Iran's allies. The article highlights a significant diplomatic development: a phone call between Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the crisis in Gaza. This call marks the first communication between the leaders since diplomatic relations were resumed in 2023. Saudi Arabia has frozen its efforts to normalize relations with Israel due to events in Israel and Gaza, which Iran sees as contributing to its own security challenges. The article also discusses Iran's historical support for Palestine through organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as its ongoing confrontation with Israel. It notes that any regional escalation of the conflict would be detrimental to Iran's attempts to address its economic challenges under US-led sanctions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 12:30:23 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Iran_Israel_Palestinians_25109-e678c.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Iran_Israel_Palestinians_25109-e678c.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>How Keir Starmer dragged UKâ€™s Labour Party to the centre</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/keir-starmer-uk-labour-party-8987258/</link><description>Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, is positioned to become the next prime minister according to polls. He has positioned himself as a centrist and unity candidate, in contrast to his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer has marginalized the party's left-wing faction, criticized anti-Semitism within the party, and softened the language of reform while maintaining many of Corbyn's policy positions. Some have compared Starmer to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the party to power by departing from its socialist roots. However, there are concerns that Starmer's centrist approach may lead him to abandon principled positions in favor of pragmatism.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Vizhinjam International Seaport Project is a transshipment deepwater multipurpose seaport being built by Adani Ports and SEZ Private Limited in Kerala, India. The project, which has been in the works for years, aims to create a state-of-the-art port with the capacity to handle large container ships. The total investment for the project is Rs 7,600 crore, with Adani Group contributing Rs 2,454 crore and the state and central governments providing Rs 1,635 crore as viability gap funding.

A major point of contention between the ruling CPI(M) and the opposition Congress is the origin of the project. The BJP has criticized the reception given to the first cargo ship at the under-construction port, calling it a publicity stunt to create the impression that the project has been completed.

India currently lacks a mega-port and terminal infrastructure capable of handling ultra-large container ships, resulting in most of the country's transshipment cargo being handled at ports outside India. Developing a transshipment hub like Vizhinjam would bring significant benefits such as forex savings, increased economic activity at other Indian ports, and job opportunities.

Vizhinjam port stands out due to its natural depth of more than 18 meters, scalable up to 20 meters, allowing it to accommodate large vessels and mother ships. It is designed to cater to container transshipment, multi-purpose, and break-bulk cargo. The port's location, minimal littoral drift, and lack of maintenance dredging requirements make it an attractive option for international shipping traffic.

Despite facing missed deadlines and delays, progress on the project is at 65.46%. Construction of the breakwater, dredging, reclamation, and berth construction have achieved various levels of completion. The project faced setbacks due to factors such as the Ockhi cyclone in 2017, the COVID-19 pandemic, shortage of granite boulders, and fishermen's protests.

The first phase of the Vizhinjam International Seaport Project is now scheduled to be operational in December 2024. Once completed, it is expected to generate job opportunities, boost industrial development and cruise tourism, and provide state-of-the-art infrastructure for handling large container ships.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 09:07:34 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Vizhinjam-Port.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Vizhinjam-Port.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>5 takeaways from Supreme Courtâ€™s verdict on same-sex marriage</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-verdict-same-sex-marriage-lgbtq-explained-8987074/</link><description>A five-judge Constitution Bench in India has unanimously declined to recognize same-sex marriages and civil unions for non-heterosexual couples.

The judges also noted that striking down provisions of the Act would jeopardize the legal framework for interfaith and inter-caste couples. However, they acknowledged that a high-level Cabinet committee will look into rights that can be conferred on non-heterosexual couples, such as joint bank accounts and medical decision-making. The minority view by two judges struck down guidelines disallowing same-sex or unmarried couples from jointly adopting a child, stating that it is discriminatory to assume only married, heterosexual couples can provide a safe space for raising children.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 08:48:21 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sc-same-sex-marriage-verdict.jpeg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sc-same-sex-marriage-verdict.jpeg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Modi speaks to Googleâ€™s Pichai, why are Google manufacturing plans in India so important?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/google-chromebook-manufacturing-india-8986877/</link><description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (Google's parent company), had a discussion about Google's plan to establish an electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India.

This move puts Google among prominent companies looking to diversify their supply chains due to geopolitical uncertainties. The Chromebooks, which run on Google's Chrome operating system, are being manufactured in Chennai and will cater to the demand for affordable PCs in India's education sector. This step will help Google compete with Windows computers from companies like Dell, Lenovo, and Asus. India aims to become a trusted partner in global supply chains and reduce its dependence on China, which currently accounts for a substantial portion of India's electronic goods imports.

The ferry service is expected to benefit local traders on both shores and enhance connectivity, promote trade, and reinforce the longstanding bonds between the two nations. The service, operated by a High Speed Craft named 'Cheriyapani', runs from Nagapattinam to Kankesanthurai in approximately four hours. The resumption of ferry services has been in the works since the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka in 2009. The service is also expected to amplify religious tourism and boost regional commerce and trade.

The ED is contemplating charging AAP under Section 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which deals with offences by companies. Although a political party is not considered a company, the provision includes an explanation that could bring a political party under the anti-money laundering law. This would be the first instance of a political party being accused of money laundering if AAP is directly named as an accused. Political parties have previously been booked and investigated under the Income Tax Act, and trusts and NGOs are already within the ambit of the PMLA. The main allegation against AAP is that it was the recipient of the proceeds of crime in the excise scam. Even if cases involving individuals fall, the political party can still be prosecuted for money laundering separately. The ED is considering booking AAP under the PMLA to investigate it additionally with respect to vicarious liability.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 01:59:28 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sisodia-2.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/sisodia-2.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - SC verdict on same sex marriages soon: Complete summary of the arguments made during hearing</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-verdict-same-sex-marriages-summary-of-arguments-8986345/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 01:19:20 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/pride-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/pride-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Delhi excise policy case: What are the options for Election Commission if AAP is named as an accused?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-excise-policy-case-uncharted-area-poll-panel-faces-limited-options-if-aap-named-8986385/</link><description>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has proposed to name the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an accused in the Delhi excise policy case. This move puts the Election Commission (EC) in a challenging situation, as there are no clear guidelines on how to handle a political party accused of illegal activities.

Former officers of the poll panel have stated that the options available to the EC for punitive action against a party are limited. The EC can either suspend or withdraw a party's recognition under The Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order. However, this action can only be taken if the party violates the Model Code of Conduct or fails to follow the Commission's orders.

Accusations alone do not carry significant consequences, as MPs and MLAs are only disqualified when they are convicted of an offense. The second option for the Commission is to de-register a party, but this is a highly restricted choice. The Representation of the People Act allows the EC to register a party, but it can only review its decision under three exceptions: fraud in obtaining registration, loss of faith in the Indian Constitution or core principles, or being declared unlawful by the Union Government or a similar law.

The article raises questions about whether the AAP can be added as an accused under Section 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Since a political party is not considered a company, it is unclear how the AAP can be implicated under this section.

In conclusion, the article highlights the lack of clarity in electoral rules and laws regarding the actions to be taken when a political party is accused of illegality. The EC's options for punitive measures are limited, and the current case involving the AAP presents unique challenges.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 22:45:29 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/EC-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/EC-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Taylor Swift fan, conservative former CEO, and next PM of New Zealand: Meet Christopher Luxon</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/new-zealand-prime-minister-christopher-luxon-8986035/</link><description>Christopher Luxon, a former airline executive, is set to become the next prime minister of New Zealand.

The directive states that no verification is required for start-ups recognized by the DPIIT for cases related to Section 56 (2) (viib) of the Income-tax Act, which includes non-resident investors under the angel tax levy. This clarification comes after many start-ups raised concerns about receiving scrutiny notices for angel tax. The CBDT has outlined two scenarios: if a start-up is selected for scrutiny only on the issue of section 56 (2) (viib), no verification will be done, and if a start-up is selected for scrutiny with multiple issues including section 56 (2) (viib), the issue will not be pursued during assessment proceedings. Angel tax is levied when an unlisted company issues shares to an investor at a price higher than its fair market value. Previously, it was imposed only on investments made by resident investors, but it has now been extended to non-resident investors as well. The DPIIT-recognized start-ups were initially exempt from angel tax. In September, the Finance Ministry introduced final valuation rules for foreign and domestic investors in unlisted companies, addressing concerns raised by the industry. In May, the Finance Ministry exempted investors from certain countries from angel tax for non-resident investment in Indian start-ups. However, some key geographies for start-up funding were excluded from this list.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 08:12:04 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/START-UP.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/START-UP.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - ExplainSpeaking: How to read Indiaâ€™s latest employment data</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-latest-employment-data-plfs-8984873/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 02:50:32 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/employment-data.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/employment-data.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Chinaâ€™s envoy to visit Middle East: Beijingâ€™s position on Israel-Palestine conflict, and its changing role</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-israel-hamas-palestine-conflict-role-8984652/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

China has expressed its opposition to acts that harm civilians and called for a ceasefire and the establishment of an independent State of Palestine. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized Israel's actions and expressed support for the Palestinians' just cause. China's stance is rooted in its strategic and economic interests in West Asia and its initial opposition to Israel as a US ally. By aligning with Arab nations' support for Palestine, China seeks to secure regional allies and criticize Western powers' involvement. China has positioned itself as an alternative to the US through diplomatic engagement, brokering normalization agreements between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hosting Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas. China recognizes the PA as the representative of the Palestinian people and advocates for a two-state solution based on 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. China has made significant investments in infrastructure projects in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative.

South Africa's President, Cyril Ramaphosa, recently expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine amid the ongoing conflict with Israel. South Africa has a history of supporting Palestine due to its own experience with discrimination and disempowerment during the apartheid era. However, over time, some African nations, including South Africa, have softened their stance towards Israel, driven by economic and technological opportunities. Despite this, South Africa has remained steadfast in its support for Palestine, citing its deep links with anti-discrimination activism and a desire to resist Western influence. The country has previously called for Israel to be declared an apartheid state and downgraded its embassy in Israel.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 15:49:51 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/cyril_ramaphosa-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/cyril_ramaphosa-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Ground invasion imminent, what are the implications for Gaza, Hamas, and the Palestinian movement?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ground-invasion-gaza-hamas-palestine-explained-8984242/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 12:07:33 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Untitled-design-65.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Untitled-design-65.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>USS Dwight D Eisenhower: Why US Navyâ€™s â€˜finest 5-star aircraft carrierâ€™ has been sent to the Mediterranean</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/israel-hamas-conflict-us-navy-carrier-uss-dwight-eisenhower-deployment-8984087/</link><description>The US has directed the nuclear-powered USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to move to the Eastern Mediterranean, near the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The move is part of the US effort to deter hostile actions against Israel and prevent the war from escalating further. The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group has already arrived in the region. Israel is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza to destroy Hamas, while also carrying out airstrikes on the militant group's hideouts and infrastructure. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties, with criticism directed at both sides. The presence of two carriers in the region can provide options and act as a deterrent for other actors, such as Hezbollah, from joining the conflict. The carriers have various capabilities, including command and control operations, surveillance, intercepts or strikes, and humanitarian work. The USS Eisenhower is described as the "Navy's finest 5-star aircraft carrier" with flexible mission capabilities. The CSG includes a cruiser, destroyers, and a supply ship. The USS Ford CSG includes multiple ships as well. The US Air Force has also deployed fighter aircraft to the region.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 10:59:52 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Israel_Palestinians_17622-40e4d.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Israel_Palestinians_17622-40e4d.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>This Quote Means: â€˜Womenâ€¦ are fuelled by a will to surviveâ€™, from Iranâ€™s Nobel Peace Prize winner</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-nobel-peace-prize-2023-feminist-movement-iran-upsc-8983830/</link><description>The 2023 Nobel Prize for Peace has been awarded to Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian womenâ€™s rights activist, for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all. Mohammadi is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Iran for charges including spreading propaganda against the state. The Norwegian Nobel Committee also mentioned the 2022 protests in Iran following the killing of Mahsa Amini, stating that the protests' motto "Woman - Life - Freedom" reflects Mohammadi's dedication and work. Mohammadi's quote, "Women will not give up. We are fueled by a will to survive, whether we are inside prison or outside," emphasizes the strength and determination of women in their struggle against patriarchy. Born into a politically active family, Mohammadi has been involved in activism since the 1990s and has faced multiple arrests and convictions. She has campaigned against the death penalty and published a book on solitary confinement. The recent protests in Iran after Amini's death highlighted women's rights issues and defiance against conservative dress codes. Iranian women have a history of protesting and defying authority, and Mohammadi's activism continues this legacy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:38:16 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/iran-women-protest-nobel-.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/iran-women-protest-nobel-.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - How Jews first migrated to Palestine, and how Israel was born</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/how-jews-first-migrated-to-palestine-how-israel-was-born-8983611/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 03:43:10 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Gazaa-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Gazaa-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Why Putin has compared Israelâ€™s actions in Gaza to the Nazi siege of Leningrad</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/putin-israel-gaza-nazi-siege-leningrad-8983106/</link><description>Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Israel against besieging Gaza in a manner similar to the Nazi siege of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad, which lasted from 1941 to 1944, resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million people, mostly civilians. Some scholars have referred to it as genocide due to the systematic starvation and intentional destruction of the city's population. Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, led to devastating consequences for both sides. Leningrad, the former capital of Russia, was a strategically valuable target and the Soviets mobilized citizens and soldiers to defend it. The Germans laid siege instead, subjecting the city to constant shelling, famine-like conditions, and harsh weather. Approximately 650,000 people died in Leningrad in 1942 alone, with around 100,000 deaths per month during the peak winter. By the time the siege was broken, 1.5 million people had perished in Leningrad. Putin has a personal connection to the siege as his brother died during that time. The Germans targeted civilians by cutting off supplies, leading to widespread starvation and even cases of cannibalism. Putin's invocation of Leningrad serves as a reminder of the immense tragedy and loss experienced during that period.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 14:33:04 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Leningrad.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Leningrad.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What happens if Israel invades Gaza?

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israel is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to wipe out the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The country's military has told 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours and has deployed tens of thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery on the edge of the territory. Israel has been bombarding Gaza since Hamas attacked on October 7, dropping over 6,000 bombs so far. It has also mobilized 360,000 troops and enforced a naval blockade to cut off Hamas' weapons and supplies. If a large-scale invasion is ordered, Israel would likely divide Gaza in two and target Hamas leaders and infrastructure. However, urban warfare in densely populated Gaza poses a challenge for Israeli troops, as Hamas fighters are expected to hide among civilians. The implications of an invasion are uncertain for Israel, but it would be a catastrophe for Gaza's 2 million inhabitants who have nowhere to go.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 14:16:18 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ISRAEL-GAZA-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/ISRAEL-GAZA-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - After four sluggish months, why are corporate revenues seeing a pickup â€” and will this sustain?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-corporate-revenues-seeing-pickup-8982501/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 06:49:26 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Corporate-revenue-.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Corporate-revenue-.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - A to Z of the Israel-Palestine conflict</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-palestine-conflict-a-to-z-8982214/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 02:17:00 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Israel-Palestine-4.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Israel-Palestine-4.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What is â€˜foetal viabilityâ€™ in abortion, and do the rights of an unborn child matter?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-foetal-viability-unborn-chold-rights-abortion-8982030/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case involving a married woman who wants to terminate her 26-week pregnancy. This case has raised important questions about a woman's right to choose and the legislative framework surrounding abortion. The hearings have introduced two significant ideas: "foetal viability" and the rights of the unborn child, which are not commonly discussed in India. 

The woman in question is 27 years old and already has two sons. She argues that her current pregnancy was unplanned, and she lacks the financial resources and mental well-being to support another child. On October 9, a two-judge Bench allowed the termination of her pregnancy, stating that an unwanted pregnancy resulting from contraceptive failure is equivalent to a forced pregnancy, which is permissible for termination up to 24 weeks.

However, on October 10, a doctor from AIIMS, Delhi raised concerns about stopping the foetal heart before the termination procedure because the foetus was deemed viable with a strong possibility of survival. This led to a split decision within the same Supreme Court Bench, with one judge supporting the petitioner's decision to abort and the other judge refusing to accept the request based on their judicial conscience.

The case was then referred to a three-judge Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud. The Bench requested a fresh medical report to assess the health of the foetus and the woman. The case is scheduled to be heard again on October 16.

The article mentions previous cases where the court allowed late-term abortions, including one involving a rape survivor and another involving an unmarried woman in a consensual relationship. These cases highlight the evolving nature of Indian society and the need for legal flexibility.

The concept of "foetal viability" as a benchmark for allowing abortions is relatively new in India. In contrast, the landmark US Supreme Court decision in 'Roe v Wade' established the right to abortion until the point of foetal viability. The criticism is that defining foetal viability at 20 weeks is arbitrary, and the decision to terminate after this point rests with doctors rather than the woman.

The Indian legal framework generally prioritizes a woman's autonomy in reproductive decisions over the rights of the unborn child. However, legislation related to succession and banning sex-determination of foetuses acknowledges the rights of the unborn child. Overall, the case highlights the need for clarity and updates in India's laws regarding reproductive rights.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 02:15:44 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Explained-Premium-Overlay-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Explained-Premium-Overlay-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>What the 2023 Nobel Economics Prize winner says on womenâ€™s aspirations, role in workforce and pay gap</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/economics-laureates-book-charts-womens-aspirations-role-in-workforce-8982036/</link><description>The article discusses Claudia Goldin's book, "Career &amp; Family: Womenâ€™s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity," which examines the history and changes in aspirations and circumstances of college-educated women in the United States. Goldin identifies the persistent problem faced by women who feel short-changed in their careers compared to their husbands and male colleagues. She attributes this problem to systemic issues such as sex discrimination, gender bias, and the glass ceiling. Goldin emphasizes that solving these issues alone will not solve the problem itself.

The book categorizes college-educated women into five groups from the 1900s to the 1990s and tracks how their aspirations have evolved over time. Factors such as laws prohibiting women and married women from working, and later their relaxation after World War II and during the feminist movement, have influenced these aspirations. The introduction of the birth control pill led to greater enrollment in post-graduate courses and a shift towards long-term careers instead of solely focusing on jobs.

Goldin highlights the impact of women taking breaks for childbirth and caregiving on their career goals, leading to the "tug between care and work." This tug is related to the gender pay gap, which widens as men and women age, marry, and have children. Greedy work, referring to careers that require significant time and attention, exacerbates the problem. Such jobs often favor individuals who are available at all times, creating a conflict with family responsibilities.

The existing work and care structures are described as relics of the past, where only men could have both careers and families. Goldin proposes solutions such as making rewarding work more flexible and allowing for time-offs, citing examples like veterinary medicine and remote work during the pandemic. Men also play a crucial role by supporting colleagues on parental leave, advocating for childcare subsidies, and encouraging companies to change their work culture. Goldin advocates for reimagining work and care to enable both men and women to have fulfilling careers and family lives.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 01:45:35 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/xlit.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/xlit.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Why do terrorist groups like Hamas take people hostage?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hostage-taking-as-terror-tactic-8982037/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 01:37:41 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Explained-Premium-Overlay.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Explained-Premium-Overlay.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Timeline: Microsoft closes $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/timeline-microsoft-closes-activision-blizzard-deal-8981840/</link><description>Microsoft has successfully completed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company behind popular video game franchise "Call of Duty."

The Israeli air force has conducted massive airstrikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip, resulting in over 1,500 deaths. In an attempt to free hostages held by Hamas, Israel has imposed a siege on Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel from the Israeli-Lebanese border, and extremist settlers in Israel have killed Palestinian civilians. There are concerns that the conflict could lead to a broader war involving other countries in the region. International actors, including the US, European nations, Russia, and China, have expressed their willingness to help facilitate negotiations and establish a humanitarian corridor. However, it is emphasized that Middle Eastern countries should take the lead in resolving the conflict. Egypt, as a neighboring country, plays a crucial role due to its control over the Rafah border crossing, which is the only other exit for Gazans besides Israel. Egypt's stance is to provide humanitarian aid but not accept refugees. Jordan, another neighboring country, has historical involvement in the region and supports a two-state solution. Qatar, with close ties to Hamas, is leading the negotiations for hostage releases. Turkey, hosting Hamas offices, also offers mediation.

Hamas surprised Israel by breaching advanced border fencing mechanisms and intelligence systems. Two key questions arise from this conflict: the timing of Hamas' attack and the failure of Israel's renowned intelligence capabilities.

Hamas, founded in 1987 as a political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, holds significant influence in the Gaza Strip. Its armed wing, Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, has conducted rocket attacks on Israel, particularly in the southern region. Despite accepting a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders in 2017, Hamas still refuses to recognize Israel.

Hamas condemned the Israel-Egypt peace treaty in 1979 and disapproves of any normalization between Israel and other Middle Eastern countries. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the US and the European Union. Israel faces accusations of terrorism and war crimes from Palestinians due to civilian casualties and settlement activities.

The current conflict arises from internal, political, religious, and geopolitical reasons. There has been no progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, leading Palestinians to feel sidelined as Arab countries normalize relations with Israel. Additionally, Israel's hardline government has supported settlement expansion and annexation plans, further frustrating Palestinians.

Hamas launched its assault, codenamed "Al-Aqsa Flood," as retribution for perceived desecration of the Al-Aqsa mosque complex. Symbolically, it aimed to convey that Jerusalem is undividable. There is also a perception in Palestinian society that Israel's acceptance in the region is growing, including potential normalizations with Saudi Arabia.

The success of Hamas' well-orchestrated strikes raises questions about Israel's intelligence apparatus. Either Israeli warnings were ignored or underestimated, or Hamas has become skilled at evading surveillance. The protests against the Israeli government and differences between Netanyahu and security officials may have impacted coordination.

This episode will require Israel to reassess its counter-terrorism, counter-intelligence, surveillance, and intelligence collection strategies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 01:37:57 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/israel-gaza.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/israel-gaza.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - What war crimes laws apply to the Israel-Palestinian conflict?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-war-crimes-laws-apply-to-the-israel-palestinian-conflict-8980317/</link><description>The conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces has resulted in a high death toll on both sides. The laws that govern this conflict are internationally accepted rules of armed conflict, which emerged from the 1949 Geneva Conventions. These conventions have been ratified by all UN member states and supplemented by rulings at international war crimes tribunals. The treatment of civilians, soldiers, and prisoners of war is governed by a series of treaties collectively known as the "Law of Armed Conflict" or "International Humanitarian Law." This applies to government forces, organized armed groups, and Hamas militants.

If alleged perpetrators of atrocities in Israel or crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice domestically, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal body that can bring charges. Domestic courts can apply universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, but this would have limited scope. The ICC's mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict, and it continues to gather information.

The ICC is the world's permanent war crimes tribunal and has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by its nationals. However, major powers like China, the United States, Russia, India, and Egypt are not members. Palestine is recognized as a member state by the ICC, but Israel rejects its jurisdiction and does not engage with it formally. The ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases in various countries.

Human Rights Watch has cited deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, taking civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, and Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza as possible war crimes. Acts such as deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, murder, torture, and collective punishment are explicitly banned under the Geneva Conventions. Israel's response could also be subject to a war crimes investigation.

The Geneva Conventions apply if a siege targets civilians rather than being a legitimate means to undermine Hamas' military capabilities or if it is found to be disproportionate. Attacks on military objectives must be proportional under international law, meaning they should not result in excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects compared to the expected military advantage.

Nick Kaufman, an Israeli defense lawyer at the ICC, highlighted the gruesome killings by Hamas militants as a potential focus for a war crimes case.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 14:03:29 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/gaza-strip-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/gaza-strip-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Why China has assisted Sri Lanka over debt worth $4.2 billion</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-sri-lanka-debt-deal-imf-explained-8980203/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Sri Lanka has reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to cover $4.2 billion of its outstanding debt, as the country continues to grapple with an economic crisis. China is the largest bilateral creditor to Sri Lanka, having lent $7 billion of the country's total foreign debt of $42 billion. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka was caused by factors such as tax cuts, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on tourism, and fuel shortages due to the war in Ukraine. Sri Lanka has also sought assistance from India, including a $500 million credit line for fuel and a $1 billion credit line for importing essentials. In September 2022, Sri Lanka qualified for a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but this loan is contingent on securing financing assurances for debt sustainability from its creditors through negotiations and debt restructuring. Sri Lanka has asked for a 30% reduction in the value of its outstanding debt and hopes to reduce its overall debt by $16.9 billion through restructuring. Negotiations between Sri Lanka and countries including Japan, India, and France for a debt rework deal did not go through in September 2023. The agreement with China's EXIM Bank will help Sri Lanka secure the release of the second tranche of about $334 million from the IMF and provide fiscal space for implementing reform measures. China's assistance to Sri Lanka will be seen as another way it is deepening ties with the country, which has joined China's Belt and Road Initiative. India has concerns about China's increasing presence in its neighborhood and fears it could lead to increased Chinese military presence and surveillance in the region.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:20:45 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-11T120900Z_1803778987_RC2OLX9GTCEO_RTRMADP_3_SRI-LANKA-DEBT-IMF.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/2023-10-11T120900Z_1803778987_RC2OLX9GTCEO_RTRMADP_3_SRI-LANKA-DEBT-IMF.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - An Indian war hero in Italy: The glorious story of Naik Yeshwant Ghadge</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/italy-naik-yeshwant-ghadge-world-war-ii-8980197/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 13:12:58 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Yeshwant-Ghadge-Featured-Image.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Yeshwant-Ghadge-Featured-Image.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Not Summary - Why Odisha govtâ€™s new rural development scheme has triggered a controversy</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/odisha-govts-rural-development-scheme-controversy-8980142/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 12:26:50 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>False</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Naveen-Patnaik-1200.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/Naveen-Patnaik-1200.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Large ozone hole detected over Antarctica: Is it a matter of concern?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/large-ozone-hole-antarctica-explained-8979396/</link><description>The European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite detected a large ozone hole over Antarctica, measuring 26 million square kilometers in size. This is one of the biggest ozone holes ever observed. The ozone layer acts as a protective shield against harmful UV radiation, reducing the risk of skin cancer. The size of the ozone hole fluctuates each year, opening in August and closing in November or December. While this year's ozone hole may be influenced by volcanic eruptions and chemical reactions, human activities, such as the use of chlorofluorocarbons, have historically contributed to ozone depletion. The Montreal Protocol was established in 1987 to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances. Although ozone depletion is not a primary cause of global climate change, there are indications that rising global temperatures could impact ozone holes. Additionally, ozone holes may have effects on the progression of seasons.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 06:18:05 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/United_States_Israel_Palestinians_80799-4d095-1.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/United_States_Israel_Palestinians_80799-4d095-1.jpg" medium="image" /></item><item><title>In law change: a push for electric vehicles, less dependence on battery imports</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-new-royalty-rates-for-strategic-minerals-lithium-rees-can-help-cut-their-imports-8978912/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian government has amended a key law to specify competitive royalty rates for the mining of lithium, niobium, and rare earth elements (REEs). This move comes after the government removed these minerals from the list of 'specified' atomic minerals, allowing for private sector participation through auctioning of concessions. The changes aim to encourage domestic mining and reduce imports of these minerals, which are crucial for industries such as electric vehicles and energy storage. The new royalty rates for lithium and niobium will be 3% based on market prices, while REEs will have a royalty of 1% based on the ore's average sale price. These amendments align India's royalty rates with global benchmarks and pave the way for commercial exploitation of these minerals.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 01:37:30 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/All-Premium-overlays-3.jpg" /><ns0:content url="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/All-Premium-overlays-3.jpg" medium="image" /></item></channel>
