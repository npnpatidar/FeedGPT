			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/four-major-us-climate-policies-donald-trump-would-reverse-if-elected-9548868/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump, if elected again, plans to reverse numerous Biden administration clean energy policies. These include EPA regulations requiring power plants to capture emissions or shut down, as well as fuel efficiency standards for cars. Additionally, Trump aims to expedite approvals for energy projects and build new power plants. The Trump campaign also intends to repeal EV subsidies outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act and withdraw from the Paris Agreement.  Trump argues these policies are burdensome to consumers and hinder economic growth.</description>

			<title>Attacks and deaths in Bahraich: Why and when wolves turn on humans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/attacks-and-deaths-in-bahraich-why-and-when-wolves-turn-on-humans-9548857/</link>
			<description>In Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich district, seven deaths have been attributed to wolf attacks since March, with additional deaths under investigation. The local administration has captured four wolves and is searching for two more suspected to be involved. Throughout history, wolf attacks on humans in India have been documented, particularly in northern regions where competition for resources is prevalent. 

Past incidents, like the Astha killings in 1985-86 and the Hazaribagh attacks between 1993 and 1995, highlight the need for scientific investigation and targeted intervention rather than widespread panic. 

Experts emphasize the importance of understanding the triggers behind wolf attacks, such as habitat loss and prey scarcity, and suggest a combination of removal of habituated animals and long-term strategies to ensure coexistence between humans and wolves.</description>

			<title>Ayatollah Khamenei signals possible negotiations with the US: A brief history of Iran-US ties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/ayatollah-khamenei-us-iran-history-ties-9548190/</link>
			<description>Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, recently suggested that engaging with the United States on nuclear cooperation might be beneficial, despite past tensions. 

This comes after the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which had seen Iran agree to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The agreement fell apart when the United States withdrew under President Trump in 2018.

Relations between the two countries have been fraught for decades, marked by events like the 1953 coup in Iran, the Iran Hostage Crisis, and sanctions imposed by the US. 

The recent suggestion of dialogue follows a period of heightened tensions in the Middle East, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. While Iran has criticized US support for Israel, Khamenei's statement indicates a potential willingness to engage with Washington on nuclear issues.</description>

			<title>New study suggests existence of a dockyard at Lothal, Gujarat, during Harappan Civilisation: What are the findings?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/dockyard-lothal-gujarat-9548119/</link>
			<description>A new study suggests that a dockyard may have existed at the ancient Harappan site of Lothal in Gujarat. Researchers from IIT Gandhinagar analyzed satellite imagery and topographic maps, revealing that the Sabarmati River once flowed near Lothal, connecting it to trade routes via the Nal Sarovar wetland and the Little Rann to Dholavira. This finding supports the theory that Lothal served as a major port for trade during the Indus Valley Civilization.  

The study also suggests that traders likely traveled from the Gulf of Khambhat to Lothal,  procured materials, and then transported them to Mesopotamia. This supports previous evidence suggesting foreign trade from Lothal.  The research utilized advanced technology, enabling the researchers to study ancient river channels and understand geomorphic changes over time.</description>

			<title>Why is the far-right AfD party’s victory in a German regional election significant?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-afd-germany-significance-9547883/</link>
			<description>Germany's Alternative for Democracy (AfD) party achieved a historic victory in the Thuringia regional elections, becoming the first far-right party to win a regional election since World War II. The AfD's success can be attributed to several factors, including its  xenophobic and anti-Muslim messaging, which resonates with some voters, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions of east Germany.  The party has also capitalized on regional economic disparities and discontent with the central government's handling of issues like inflation and fuel costs. The AfD's rise has raised concerns about the growth of extremism in Germany and its potential impact on the political landscape.</description>

			<title>Why the Brazil Supreme Court took down X, amid a judge’s feud with Elon Musk</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/brazil-supreme-court-ban-x-elon-9547637/</link>
			<description>Brazil's Supreme Court upheld the shutdown of social media platform X due to its refusal to appoint a local legal representative as mandated by Brazilian law.  Elon Musk, X's owner, has clashed with Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the judge overseeing the case, who ordered X to block accounts spreading disinformation. Musk has criticized de Moraes, calling him "the dictator of Brazil," and accused him of targeting political opponents. 

Justice Moraes has accused Musk of obstructing Brazilian justice and inciting crime.  The ban on X follows an earlier case against Telegram, whose CEO was arrested over alleged child pornography content on the platform, highlighting tensions between governments and tech giants regarding online regulations. 

The shutdown impacts millions of X users in Brazil, X's fifth-largest market globally.</description>

			<title>Why Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan wants to change name of historic Ravenshaw College in Cuttack</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-union-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-wants-to-change-name-of-historic-ravenshaw-college-in-cuttack-9547121/</link>
			<description>There is a debate surrounding the renaming of Ravenshaw University in Cuttack.  Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan supports the change due to the university's namesake, Thomas Edward Ravenshaw's, role during the devastating 1866 famine in Odisha.  

Opponents of the renaming argue that Ravenshaw contributed to the growth of higher education and the Odia language in the region. They point to his support for establishing a degree college in Odisha, which ultimately led to the foundation of Ravenshaw College.  The college, established in 1868, has a rich history and produced many influential Odia personalities across various fields.</description>

			<title>500 days of the Sudan war: What is happening — and what happens next?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sudan-war-9546581/</link>
			<description>The war in Sudan, stemming from a power struggle between generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has raged for over 500 days.  The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths, widespread displacement, and a dire humanitarian crisis, with millions lacking access to basic necessities like food and healthcare. 

The situation is exacerbated by ongoing flooding, adding further strain on already stretched resources.  Experts warn that without a ceasefire, the war could escalate into a regional conflict, trigger mass migration to Europe, and potentially claim millions of lives through starvation.  Urgent international intervention is crucial to prevent a catastrophic outcome.</description>

			<description>Hvaldimir, a beluga whale known for wearing a harness with "Equipment St Petersburg" inscribed on it, was found dead in Norway. Speculation arose that Hvaldimir was a Russian spy due to the harness and camera mount. However, Marine biologist Sebastian Strand suggested that Hvaldimir had likely been held in captivity and was perhaps a therapy whale. 

Hvaldimir frequently interacted with people in Norwegian coastal waters, responding to hand signals and appearing comfortable around humans.  Despite the speculation, Hvaldimir's exact purpose remains unknown.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court pulled up AYUSH Ministey over Rule 170 of Drugs Act. Here’s what it says</title>

			<description>The Supreme Court is questioning the AYUSH ministry's July 1 notification instructing state licensing authorities to ignore Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. This rule, introduced in 2018, aims to prevent misleading advertisements of AYUSH products by requiring manufacturers to submit details about their products and obtain approval before advertising. The ministry's justification is based on amendments being considered in the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, which also addresses misleading advertisements. 

Rule 170 mandates that manufacturers provide evidence of safety, effectiveness, and quality, and prohibits certain types of advertisements, such as those using testimonials from celebrities or government officials or making exaggerated claims. However, the ministry's action has been criticized for potentially weakening regulations on AYUSH drug advertising.</description>

			<title>How Supreme Court has centred rights of the accused in recent PMLA cases</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/how-sc-has-centred-rights-of-the-accused-in-recent-pmla-cases-9545232/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has issued several rulings impacting the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), particularly regarding arrests, bail, and confession rights. 

The court has clarified that the grounds for arrest under PMLA must be provided in writing to the accused. It has also emphasized the application of Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for bail in PMLA cases, considering the length of pre-trial detention.

In recent judgments, the court has relaxed the stringent "twin conditions" for bail in PMLA cases for individuals facing prolonged pre-trial incarceration. It has also affirmed the exception for women under Section 45 of the PMLA, granting bail to BRS leader Kavitha while rejecting the High Court's reasoning based on her social standing.

Finally, the court has addressed the admissibility of confessions made to ED officers, ruling that such confessions, obtained under custodial interrogation, may violate the right against self-incrimination. Furthermore, the court has referred the issue of "need and necessity to arrest" under PMLA to a larger bench for consideration.</description>

			<title>Why rice-wheat need to be de-hyphenated</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-rice-wheat-need-to-be-de-hyphenated-9545216/</link>
			<description>While India typically considers wheat and rice as a combined surplus issue, their current situations differ greatly. Rice production exceeds domestic consumption, with record exports and mounting stockpiles.  

Conversely, wheat faces export decline due to reduced production and a government ban. This shortage is attributed to climate change impacting wheat cultivation, coupled with rising consumption, particularly in processed forms.  

Experts predict India may become a wheat importer in the near term. In contrast, rice surplus calls for export liberalization and removal of existing restrictions to prevent oversupply. Treating these grains separately is crucial as their challenges and future trajectories diverge.</description>

			<title>How Indians stand little chance of asylum but still manage to stay on</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-indians-stand-little-chance-of-asylum-but-still-manage-to-stay-on-9545276/</link>
			<description>The increasing number of Indian asylum seekers and walk-ins in the US and UK is straining immigration systems already burdened with backlogs. While the success rate for Indian asylum seekers is low in both countries, lengthy legal processes often allow them to remain.

In the UK, Indians have the lowest chance of securing asylum compared to other nationalities. Even when denied, appeals can take years, further delaying removals. The US, on the other hand, sees a rise in defensive asylum applications from Indians, though the success rate remains below 15%. Backlogs in immigration courts contribute to lengthy processing times, offering a window for migrants to work and potentially become eligible for amnesty programs.  Several factors contribute to this trend, including perceived religious and political persecution in India, along with the allure of economic opportunities in Western countries.</description>

			<title>What is the Munich Agreement and the role it played in starting World War II?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/explained-munich-agreement-role-world-war-ii-9544797/</link>
			<description>On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, marking the start of World War II. The invasion, a direct violation of the Munich Agreement signed the previous year, exposed the dangers of appeasement towards Hitler's aggressive regime.  The agreement had allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, a move intended to prevent war but ultimately emboldened Hitler. The Czechoslovak government, under pressure from Britain and France, was forced to accept the deal despite its own reservations. Six months later, Hitler reneged on his promises and occupied the entire country, paving the way for the devastating global conflict.</description>

			<title>How Telegram CEO Durov’s arrest in France could possibly upend ‘safe harbour’ protection</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/explained-telegram-durov-arrest-upend-safe-harbour-9544628/</link>
			<description>The arrest of Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, in France has significant implications for the tech industry. This unprecedented action against a high-ranking tech executive, alleging his platform facilitates illicit activities, challenges the legal concept of "safe harbour" which protects platforms from liability for user-generated content. This protection, enshrined in laws like Section 230 in the US and India's IT Act, is seen as crucial for enabling free speech online. Durov’s case, however, raises questions about the boundaries of this protection, particularly when platforms are accused of failing to adequately moderate harmful content.  Analysts view this as a warning to other tech companies regarding potential liability for content hosted on their platforms.</description>

			<title>Why does France not have a new prime minister nearly two months after its elections?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-france-polls-pm-two-months-9544437/</link>
			<description>French President Emmanuel Macron, facing a hung parliament after elections, has delayed appointing a new prime minister for nearly two months. The far-left France Unbowed party, which won the most seats, has criticized Macron's silence and called for his impeachment. 

Macron seeks to form a government with centrist parties but has not been successful. He has also ruled out a coalition with France Unbowed.  The delay comes as France Unbowed has nominated its candidate for prime minister and is arguing for the right to form the government. The political stalemate raises concerns about administrative friction and the stability of the French government.</description>

			<title>Why do oil prices remain subdued?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/oil-prices-subdued-libya-9544274/</link>
			<description>Oil prices have recently increased due to a political dispute in Libya that has cut production. Despite this, market prices remain relatively stable, hovering around $80 per barrel, and are below the average historical level. 

Global oil inventories are currently healthy, with demand growth being met by production increases from various nations, including Brazil, Canada, Guyana, and the United States.  The OPEC+ group is considering strategic increases in oil output, which could further impact prices. 

Although China's demand growth is slowing, analysts expect it to remain a key player in the oil market.  Market watchers are closely monitoring the situation in Libya, as its production losses could have a significant effect on global supply and prices.</description>

			<title>Why Namibia plans to kill hundreds of its majestic wild animals for meat</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/namibia-wild-animals-meat-drought-9543457/</link>
			<description>Namibia is undertaking a cull of hundreds of wild animals, including elephants and hippopotamuses, to address the worst drought in a century.  The drought, exacerbated by the El Nino weather pattern, has caused widespread crop failure, livestock deaths, and food shortages, impacting nearly half the country's population. The government aims to provide meat for its citizens and prevent human-wildlife conflict as animals migrate in search of resources.  

The cull, which has already seen over 150 animals killed, is intended to manage grazing pressure and water availability while ensuring sustainable practices and animal welfare.</description>

			<title>What is known about polio’s return to the Gaza Strip?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/polio-gaza-strip-9543106/</link>
			<description>The Gaza Strip has confirmed its first polio case in 25 years, prompting a mass vaccination campaign. The virus, a vaccine-derived strain, was likely introduced from Egypt and spread due to decreased routine vaccinations, hospital closures, and poor sanitation. Israel and Hamas agreed to three-day ceasefires in Gaza's zones to allow UN workers to administer vaccines to 640,000 children under 10. The World Health Organization emphasizes the need for at least 95% coverage to prevent further spread. 
 
This case is a setback for global polio eradication efforts, despite a 99% reduction in cases since 1988.  Poliovirus, highly infectious and spread through faecal-oral contact, can cause paralysis and death in young children.</description>

			<title>Tamil Nadu govt to nationalise Karunanidhi’s works: what does this mean</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/nationalise-karunanidhi-works-9543042/</link>
			<description>The Tamil Nadu government initiated a program to "nationalize" the literary works of prominent Tamil figures. This involves collaborating with the heirs of the authors to secure the copyright and make the works freely accessible to the public. 

The nationalized works are released under a CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication license, allowing for unrestricted use, modification, and distribution, even for commercial purposes.  Similar efforts were undertaken in Maharashtra with the collected works of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, resulting in a public domain collection of his writings. However, a dispute arose when Dr. Ambedkar's grandson contested the legality of the copyright lapse, highlighting the complexities surrounding copyright ownership and public access after an author's death.</description>

			<title>How does methane play a role in climate change?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/methane-climate-change-co2-9542004/</link>
			<description>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. While carbon dioxide is the main driver of climate change due to its longer lifespan, methane's short lifetime still contributes significantly to global warming. 

About 60% of methane emissions come from human activities, primarily agriculture, waste decomposition, and the energy sector. Oil and gas production is a major source, with leaks, flaring, and venting releasing significant amounts of methane.  

Solutions to reduce methane emissions include leak detection and repair, as well as stricter regulations on flaring and venting. The European Union recently implemented new regulations aimed at slashing methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry.</description>

			<title>India’s second nuclear sub</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indias-second-nuclear-sub-9542283/</link>
			<description>India recently commissioned its second nuclear submarine, INS Arighaat, strengthening its nuclear triad capabilities.  The submarine is equipped with indigenously built K-15 missiles and powered by nuclear reactors, allowing for prolonged underwater operation.  

The commissioning of INS Arighaat, more technologically advanced than its predecessor, INS Arihant, enhances India's  maritime strike capability as part of its nuclear deterrence strategy.  India maintains a "no first use" policy for nuclear weapons, but the submarine's ability to survive a nuclear attack and retaliate serves as a strong deterrent. 



The project involved extensive collaboration between private firms, the DRDO, and Russia, highlighting India's indigenously developed technological expertise. India now possesses two operational nuclear submarines, with two larger ones under construction.</description>

			<title>Who is Jagdish Tytler, and what was his alleged role 1984 anti-Sikh violence in Delhi?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/jagdish-tytler-1984-sikh-violence-9541946/</link>
			<description>Jagdish Tytler, a Congress leader, will be charged in connection with the 1984 anti-Sikh violence. The charges stem from his alleged role in the killing of three Sikh men at the Pul Bangash Gurdwara in Delhi. The CBI, which filed a charge sheet against Tytler last May, accused him of inciting and provoking the mob.  

The Nanavati Commission report, which investigated the 1984 violence, had found credible evidence against Tytler, stating he likely had a hand in organizing attacks on Sikhs. Tytler maintains his innocence, claiming he was at Indira Gandhi's residence when the violence occurred. The case, registered in 2005, saw a Special Investigation Team re-investigate Tytler's role before the charge sheet was filed last May.</description>

			<title>How drones can revolutionise pesticide and fertiliser application in Punjab fields</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/drones-revolutionise-pesticide-fertiliser-application-punjab-9541612/</link>
			<description>The use of drones in Punjab agriculture is rapidly increasing, with 93 out of 100 drones provided by IFFCO under the ‘NAMO Drone Didi’ scheme already operational.  Drones offer numerous advantages over traditional manual pesticide and fertiliser application. They are faster, more efficient, and reduce the risk of farmer exposure to harmful chemicals, leading to improved health outcomes. 

Drones also enable precise application of nano fertilisers, which are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Real-time imagery captured by drones allows farmers to monitor crop health and respond quickly to pest outbreaks.  Furthermore, drone technology can contribute to reducing water consumption and minimizing environmental pollution. However, challenges remain, including job displacement for agricultural labourers and the need for drone pilot training.</description>

			<description>The northern bald ibis, hunted to near extinction, is being revived in central Europe through reintroduction efforts.  Conservationists at Waldrappteam have successfully bred the birds and are teaching them to migrate using ultralight aircraft.  Young birds are raised by foster parents and then guided along historic migratory routes.  Climate change has forced the team to extend the migratory path from Italy to Spain to ensure the birds fly in safer weather conditions and can conserve energy.  The success of this project is seen as a model for conserving other migratory bird species threatened by climate change.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-assams-new-muslim-marriage-law-says-why-it-was-introduced-9540507/</link>
			<description>The Assam Legislative Assembly passed the Assam Compulsory Registration of Muslim Marriages and Divorces Bill, 2024, which aims to prevent child marriages and marriages without consent, as well as check polygamy.  This new law repeals the 89-year-old Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935.  The government argues the new law is needed to address child marriages, citing the previous Act's allowance for registration of marriages involving minors.  Under the new law, registration will be handled by government officers, not kazis, and several conditions must be met, including the bride being 18 years old and the groom 21.  The government emphasizes increased accountability through government registration. However, opposition members argue that simpler amendments to the old Act could have achieved the goal of preventing child marriages and criticize the complexity of the new process.</description>

The hijackers' demands included the release of several terrorists and the coffin of a militant leader. The plane flew to various locations, including Lahore, Kabul, and Kandahar, before the Indian government agreed to release the three terrorists in exchange for the passengers' safety.

The incident highlighted the involvement of Pakistan and militant organizations in terrorism against India.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jiu-jitsu-aikido-rahul-gandhi-bharat-jodo-nyay-yatra-9539835/</link>
			<description>During his Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi practiced jiu-jitsu daily, aiming to teach young people a blend of martial arts and non-violent conflict resolution. He described the experience as bringing people together and fostering a more compassionate society.  Gandhi mentioned a "Bharat Dojo Yatra" is coming soon. Jiu-jitsu, meaning "gentle art,"  originated in Japan during the samurai era as a grappling and self-defense technique. Its principles involve manipulating an opponent's energy rather than direct force.  Aikido, another martial art mentioned, focuses on harmonizing energy to resolve conflicts non-violently.  Rahul Gandhi holds a black belt in Aikido, demonstrating a high level of proficiency.</description>

			<title>What Australia’s new cap on number of international students means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australia-new-cap-number-international-students-9539540/</link>
			<description>Australia will limit new international student admissions to 270,000 in 2025, the lowest in five years.  This cap impacts various sectors, including vocational education and training, with publicly funded universities maintaining 2023 levels. Despite a record-high intake in the first half of 2024, likely exceeding 2023 figures, the government aims to control migration.  

The cap excludes certain categories like school students, research degree seekers, and those on government scholarships. This follows other recent policy changes, including increased IELTS score requirements and a new Genuine Student Test.  

Concerns have been raised, with the Group of Eight universities calling the cap "bad policy" and immigration consultants in India noting its potential impact on the business sector.</description>

			<description>ISRO's 2025 uncrewed Gaganyaan mission will feature Vyomitra, a female half-humanoid robot. Designed to assist astronauts with tasks like equipment repair and panel cleaning, Vyomitra will demonstrate its capabilities during the mission, including operating the crew console, monitoring systems, and communicating with Earth. 

Vyomitra's skull, made from a lightweight and heat-resistant aluminum alloy,  was 3D printed using additive manufacturing techniques. This design allows for strength and flexibility, crucial for withstanding the rigors of a space launch.  

ISRO will use data from the mission to evaluate the impacts of space travel on humans, paving the way for India's first crewed mission later in 2025.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/himachal-bill-raises-womens-marriage-age-what-happens-next-9538741/</link>
			<description>The Himachal Pradesh Assembly passed a Bill to raise the minimum marriage age for women from 18 to 21 years. The Bill amends the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act by,  removing the distinction of age between male and female "child" as defined in the Act and defining both as those who have not completed 21 years of age. It also gives overriding effect to the Act over any other law, custom, or practice, ensuring that the new marriage age applies to everyone. 

 Additionally, the Bill increases the time to file a petition to annul a child marriage from two to five years.  Since the Bill contradicts a central law, it needs the President's assent to come into force.</description>

			<title>Who are the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/who-are-the-jamaat-e-islami-bangladesh-9538726/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh’s interim government has lifted the ban on the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, allowing its return to active politics.  Previously, the party was labeled as a "militant and terrorist" organization and faced criminal charges for war crimes committed during the 1971 Liberation War. 


The Jamaat, which advocates for the implementation of Islamic law in Bangladesh, traces its roots back to a larger Islamic group established in Lahore in 1941. While it actively opposed the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, it played a significant role in supporting the Pakistani government during the Bangladesh Liberation War. 

The party was actively involved with organizations that carried out atrocities against the Bengali population. After Bangladesh's independence in 1971, the Jamaat was banned and its leaders faced prosecution. 

While the party was rehabilitated in later years, it was once again cracked down on by the Sheikh Hasina government, which used the International Crimes Tribunal Act to prosecute alleged war criminals. Several high-ranking Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned.</description>

			<description>The executive committee of the Association of Malayalam Movie Actors (AMMA), including its president Mohanlal, resigned following the release of the Justice K Hema Committee report. The report exposed rampant sexual harassment and misconduct in the Malayalam film industry, including allegations against AMMA officials like Siddique and Baburaj. 

The report detailed a culture of fear and abuse, with powerful men controlling the industry and women facing exploitation and threats.  It also criticized AMMA for its handling of the 2017 abduction and assault of a leading actress, particularly its reinstatement of actor Dileep, who was accused of involvement. The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), an advocacy group for women in the film industry, had been vocal in their criticism of AMMA and the industry's culture.</description>

			<title>How Canada’s policy of ‘reducing low-wage, temporary workers’ may impact Indians</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canada-policy-low-wage-temporary-workers-indians-9537877/</link>
			<description>Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a reduction in low-wage, temporary foreign workers in the country. This policy shift aims to decrease the proportion of such workers to 5% of the population in the next three years. 

The move is likely to impact various groups, including those on temporary work visas, international students, spouses of international students, and workers under Labour Market Impact Assessment contracts.  This policy could particularly affect Indians, who constitute a significant portion of Canada's temporary worker population.  

The Canadian government's intention is to encourage businesses to invest in Canadian workers. While the policy shift may limit opportunities for temporary workers, there is a possibility that it could also create pathways to permanent residency, integrating them more fully into the Canadian economy.  The ultimate direction of this policy will likely depend on political and economic considerations leading up to the next Canadian election.</description>

			<description>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) initially issued an advisory asking food businesses to stop marketing milk and milk products as A1 or A2. This decision was subsequently withdrawn after facing criticism. 

The FSSAI stated that its existing standards don't recognize A1 and A2 differentiation, despite growing consumer interest and global trends of marketing these types separately. The advisory was met with pushback, including a letter from an ICAR member urging its reconsideration and suggesting a high-level committee for further discussion. The FSSAI ultimately withdrew the advisory to allow for more consultation and engagement with stakeholders.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/govt-ban-fdc-drugs-cheston-cold-foracet-health-ministry-fever-allergies-aches-9536556/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has banned 156 fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs, marking the most significant crackdown since 2018. This brings the total number of banned FDCs to 499 since 2014. The government deemed these combinations irrational and lacking therapeutic benefits. 

The banned drugs include various combinations for gastrointestinal problems, skin conditions, migraines, and erectile dysfunction.  The move aims to address concerns about the overuse of antibiotics, the potential for harmful interactions between ingredients, and companies circumventing pricing controls by creating FDCs. 
 
While manufacturers have been ordered to halt production and sales, existing stock may remain available. The government hopes this action will contribute to a healthier and safer pharmaceutical market.</description>

Improvements in infrastructure, technology, and expertise have enabled the IMD to provide more accurate and detailed forecasts, particularly for cyclones. This has resulted in effective disaster response and reduced loss of life.  However, challenges remain in predicting hyper-local events and extreme weather events driven by climate change. The IMD aims to further enhance its capabilities by developing India-specific weather models that can better simulate the country's unique climatic conditions.</description>

			<description>In light of the shocking revelations about rampant sexual misconduct in the Malayalam film industry detailed in the Justice Hema Committee report, the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) has dissolved its 17-member executive committee.  AMMA, an influential body with jurisdiction over actors, directors, and junior artistes, has faced scrutiny for its alleged misuse of power. 
 
The report highlighted AMMA's involvement in issuing illegal bans, opposing the creation of an Internal Complaints Committee, and generally stifling dissent. It also criticized the association for its inaction following a 2017 rape case involving a leading actress within the industry.  
 

 AMMA's legacy is now deeply tarnished. Many see its disbandment as a necessary step towards reforming the industry and ensuring a safer environment for women.</description>

			<title>No penalties for refusing office calls or messages after hours: What is Australia’s ‘right to disconnect’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/australia-right-to-disconnect-debate-9536192/</link>
			<description>Australia implemented a “right to disconnect” law, allowing employees to refuse work-related contact outside working hours. This follows similar laws in countries like France, Italy, and Belgium, aimed at addressing the blurring of work-life boundaries due to technology and remote work. 

The Australian law requires companies with more than 15 employees to comply immediately, while smaller firms have until 2025.  Employers can still contact employees outside work hours under certain circumstances, such as emergencies or when reasonable compensation is provided.  The law aims to prevent employees from being penalized for not being constantly available and encourages a healthier work-life balance.</description>

			<description>NASA has announced that astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, currently aboard the International Space Station (ISS), will return to Earth in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon flight. Their original return on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft was delayed due to technical issues.  SpaceX is modifying Crew Dragon for the mission, including reconfiguring seats and adjusting cargo capacity. Crew Dragon, a reusable spacecraft, was developed by SpaceX to transport astronauts to the ISS for NASA. It consists of a reusable capsule and an expandable trunk module. The spacecraft launches on a Falcon 9 rocket and docks automatically with the ISS. For return missions, the trunk detaches and burns up in the atmosphere, while the capsule performs a de-orbit burn and splashes down in the ocean.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-k-kavitha-bail-9535660/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to BRS leader K Kavitha in the Delhi Excise policy case.  The court criticized the Delhi High Court's decision to deny Kavitha bail, stating the high court's reasoning could prevent any educated woman from receiving bail.  The  Supreme Court highlighted the exception for women under Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which allows for bail in certain circumstances. The Delhi High Court had earlier denied bail to Kavitha, arguing that she was not a "vulnerable" woman as she was educated and well-placed in society.  However, the Supreme Court emphasized that the law does not make distinctions based on a woman's profession or social status when considering bail applications under the exception for women.</description>

			<title>Explained: Supreme Court ruling on relaxing bail provision for first-time offenders to apply retrospectively</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-bail-undertrials-bnss-9535391/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that relaxed bail provisions under the new Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) will apply retroactively. This means first-time offenders detained in pending criminal cases, even those predating the BNSS, can be released on bail after serving one-third of the maximum imprisonment for their offense. 

This decision stems from the court's ongoing monitoring of prison conditions and recognizing the BNSS provision's potential to alleviate overcrowding. The court directed jail superintendents to process applications from eligible undertrial prisoners within three months.</description>

			<title>Two new US-India agreements: a short history of growing defence ties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/two-new-us-india-agreements-a-short-history-of-growing-defence-ties-9534655/</link>
			<description>India and the US further strengthened their defense and security cooperation through two new agreements. The Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) prioritises reciprocal support for goods and services essential for national defense, enabling both nations to address potential supply chain disruptions. The Memorandum of Agreement regarding the Assignment of Liaison Officers aims to enhance information sharing by posting Indian armed forces officers in key US strategic commands. 


 This development builds upon a decade of collaborative milestones, including foundational agreements on military information sharing, logistics, communications, and data exchange.  
The countries have also established frameworks for industrial cooperation, technological advancement, and defense trade, resulting in significant  procurement deals for  India, such as helicopters, rifles, howitzers, and jet engines.</description>

			<title>Why a new, homegrown missile can be a game-changer for Ukraine’s fight against Russia</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/homegrown-missile-game-changer-ukraine-fight-russia-9534340/</link>
			<description>Ukraine has unveiled a new long-range weapon called the Palianytsia, a missile-drone hybrid capable of striking 700 kilometers deep into Russian territory.  Developed in response to limitations imposed by Western allies on the use of long-range weapons, the Palianytsia will allow Ukraine to target areas previously out of reach.  

 Ukrainian officials believe the weapon will be a game-changer, enabling them to strike targets deep within Russia and exploit vulnerabilities in its defenses.  The Palianytsia is relatively inexpensive to produce, costing less than $1 million per unit.</description>

			<title>Who is Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov, and why did French authorities arrest him?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-arrest-france-9534303/</link>
			<description>Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, was arrested in France on charges related to alleged complicity in drug trafficking, terrorism support, and cyberstalking. French authorities believe Telegram's high level of user privacy has facilitated illegal activity. 

Durov denies these allegations, stating that Telegram does not actively condone or participate in such activities. He argues that the app should remain a neutral platform for free speech, even if it inadvertently becomes a tool for some users to engage in illegal acts. 

This arrest has drawn criticism from those who view it as an overreach by the French government, with some comparing it to similar actions taken against other tech giants by various governments worldwide.</description>

			<title>China-Philippines clash: What is the South China Sea dispute?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/south-china-sea-dispute-9534189/</link>
			<description>The South China Sea dispute centers around competing territorial claims in a strategically vital region. China asserts its claims based on historical maritime rights, encompassing 90% of the sea with its "nine-dash line," which has been contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.  

China has physically escalated its claim through island building and military installations, prompting US intervention with increased military presence and aid to opposing nations. The dispute carries immense economic significance due to oil and gas reserves, rich fishing grounds, and crucial trade routes. 

An international tribunal in 2016 largely rejected China's claims, but Beijing, which boycotted the proceedings, has refused to abide by the ruling.  


Despite attempts by ASEAN, a regional grouping, to resolve the conflict diplomatically, a peaceful solution remains elusive, raising fears of a potential global crisis.</description>

			<title>Why Baloch militants targeted Punjabi travellers in recent attack which killed 23</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/baloch-militants-targeted-punjabi-travellers-in-recent-attack-which-9534077/</link>
			<description>In Balochistan, armed men attacked vehicles, killing 23 individuals from Punjab after checking their identities. This attack is part of a pattern of violence against Punjabis in the region, attributed to Baloch militant groups. 

Balochistan has a long history of conflict with the Pakistani state, marked by insurrections and accusations of human rights abuses.  The targeting of Punjabis stems from a complex interplay of ethnic tensions and a sense of economic alienation felt by the Baloch people. Balochistan, despite its natural wealth, remains relatively impoverished, and many Baloch feel that the Punjabi-dominated Pakistani government exploits the province's resources without providing equitable benefits.</description>

			<title>RBI to launch Unified Lending Interface: What is it and how will it benefit borrowers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explained-rbi-unified-lending-interface-9533758/</link>
			<description>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das announced the upcoming nationwide launch of the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), a platform designed to streamline the lending process. Similar to UPI's revolution in retail payments, ULI aims to reduce costs, expedite loan disbursement, and enhance scalability. 

ULI will facilitate the seamless flow of digital information, including land records, from various data sources to lenders, simplifying credit appraisal, particularly for smaller and rural borrowers. The platform's standardized APIs will enable "plug and play" integration, reducing technical complexities and empowering borrowers with faster credit access.  Das believes ULI, alongside JAM and UPI, will significantly contribute to India's digital infrastructure, addressing the unmet credit demand across sectors, especially in agriculture and MSME.</description>

			<title>RHFL fraud: Why has Sebi fined Anil Ambani and banned him from the market?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rhfl-fraud-why-has-sebi-fined-anil-ambani-and-banned-him-from-the-market-9533010/</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed a five-year ban on Anil Ambani and 24 other entities from the securities market for diverting funds from Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL).  

Sebi's investigation revealed that RHFL, under the influence of Anil Ambani, disbursed large general purpose working capital (GPC) loans to entities with weak financial profiles and without proper security or collateral. This resulted in the erosion of RHFL's finances.

The regulator found that RHFL deviated from standard credit due diligence processes and that these loans were likely motivated by personal benefit for Anil Ambani and his associates. Sebi has imposed a total penalty of over Rs 625 crore on Ambani and the involved entities.</description>

			<title>What was the Great Moon Hoax, which claimed winged humans lived on the Moon?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/great-moon-hoax-9532908/</link>
			<description>In 1835, The New York Sun published a series of articles reporting on supposed astronomical discoveries made by Sir John Herschel, including the existence of life on the moon. The articles, filled with fantastical descriptions of  bison, beavers, single-horned goats, and even bat-winged humans, fooled many readers. 

The hoax, orchestrated by publisher Richard Adam Locke, aimed to satirize the trend of religion influencing scientific discoveries. The articles gained widespread attention and even praise from some publications, until The Sun finally confessed to the deception.  Despite the revelation,  The Sun's readership continued to grow.  The incident highlighted the public's gullibility and the powerful influence of the press at a time when reliable information was scarce.</description>

			<description>Following a money laundering scandal involving S$3 billion, Singapore authorities arrested two former bank relationship managers, accusing them of aiding wealthy foreign clients in laundering money through real estate and cryptocurrencies. Ten individuals of Chinese origin were initially arrested in the case, with investigations revealing connections to illegal online gambling and unlicensed lending operations. 

Seizures included properties, vehicles, cash, and assets. Major banks, property agents, and precious metal traders have been implicated, highlighting challenges for Singapore in balancing attracting investment with maintaining transparency. 

The scandal has impacted Singapore's reputation, further compounded by recent political scandals involving corruption allegations and alleged misuse of state-owned assets.</description>

			<title>Badlapur sexual abuse case: Can political parties exercise their right to protest to call for a bandh?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-badlapur-case-right-to-protest-bandh-9532741/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court revoked the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance's call for a state-wide 'bandh' in Maharashtra to protest sexual assault allegations against minors in Badlapur. The court cited the potential crippling impact on the economy, public services, and emergency services, particularly the vital Mumbai local trains. 

The High Court emphasized that bandhs, by their very nature, aim to bring all activities to a standstill, disrupting the rights of individuals and businesses. It relied on past Supreme Court and High Court rulings that deem bandhs unconstitutional and illegal, prioritizing the public order over the right to call for a state-wide shutdown.  

Despite arguments from legal experts that the right to call for a bandh falls under the ambit of freedom of speech and expression, the High Court maintained its stance, arguing that maintaining public order and upholding individual rights takes precedence.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/hezbollah-israel-military-capabilities-rockets-9532446/</link>
			<description>There was  recent exchange of fire between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah. The attack, which involved hundreds of rockets and drones launched by Hezbollah, was in retaliation for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander by Israel in July.  Hezbollah indicated they are not planning further strikes and Israel stated they do not seek a full-scale war. Hezbollah, meaning 'Party of God', is a heavily armed non-state actor  and considers itself the champion of the Palestinian cause, opposing both Israel and Western influence in the Middle East. 

The group's arsenal includes a vast number of rockets, some with precision guidance systems, as well as anti-tank missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Hezbollah gained prominence during the Lebanese Civil War, supported by Iran, and has played a significant role in Lebanese politics, presently holding seats in Parliament and forming part of the ruling government.</description>

			<title>Luxury yacht sinks off Sicily: what questions must investigators answer?</title>

			<description>The  $40 million sailing yacht Bayesian sank tragically off the coast of Sicily, resulting in seven deaths, including British billionaire Michael Lynch and his teenage daughter. 

The sinking occurred during a sudden and violent storm, although its exact nature remains unclear. Some speculate it could have been a downburst or waterspout. While the yacht's maker claims the vessel was "unsinkable,"  authorities are investigating potential factors like open hatches or doors allowing water to enter, contributing to the rapid sinking.  

A manslaughter investigation is underway, focusing on potential responsibilities of the captain, crew, manufacturer, and those monitoring the yacht.  Italian authorities are also examining emergency procedures and the captain's decision to leave the sinking vessel while passengers were still on board.</description>

			<description>A new study reveals that Chile’s Atacama salt flat is sinking at 1 to 2 centimeters per year due to lithium brine extraction. Researchers from the University of Chile analyzed satellite data and found the subsidence is most pronounced in areas where mining companies operate. This occurs because the brine pumping rate exceeds the aquifer recharge, causing the ground level to lower. The study highlights the environmental impact of lithium mining, such as water depletion and contamination, which threaten the region's biodiversity, including declining flamingo populations.</description>

			<title>In UPS, extra burden, but no pushing back of the reform needle</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-ups-extra-burden-but-no-pushing-back-of-the-reform-needle-9531518/</link>
			<description>The Union Government has introduced a new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) to address concerns among employees regarding lower pensions under the existing National Pension System. The UPS combines elements of both the old pension scheme (OPS) and NPS, offering an assured pension while maintaining a contributory, funded scheme structure.

Key features of the UPS include a minimum guaranteed pension, inflation indexation, family pension benefits, and an increased government contribution to 18.5% of the basic pay. The government anticipates increased expenditure, including arrears for retired employees, due to these enhancements. 


The move is seen as a political response to employee grievances and may influence state governments to adopt the UPS, potentially increasing their financial burden. Despite concerns raised by the Reserve Bank of India about the strain OPS can put on state finances, the government emphasizes the UPS as a fiscally prudent alternative.</description>

			<title>Centre announces Unified Pension Scheme: How will UPS differ from OPS, NPS?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/centre-announced-unified-pension-scheme-how-will-ups-differ-from-ops-nps-9531351/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has approved a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for its employees. This comes after widespread criticism of the New Pension Scheme (NPS), which was introduced in 2004 to replace the older, unfunded Old Pension Scheme (OPS).  The UPS, effective from April 1, 2025, provides a guaranteed pension amount to retirees, 50% of their average last 12 months' basic pay, with a minimum of Rs 10,000 per month for those with 10 years of service. It also includes inflation indexation and a lumpsum payment at retirement. 
 
The implementation of the UPS is seen as a significant move ahead of upcoming assembly elections in several states. It is intended to address concerns raised by government employees regarding the lack of guaranteed returns under the NPS and the need for an unfunded pension scheme. 
 
The UPS combines aspects of both OPS and NPS, offering a guaranteed pension while maintaining a contributory funded scheme structure.  It is expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 6,250 crores in its first year of implementation.</description>

			<title>Why do doctors want a central law to protect themselves from attacks and violence?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/doctors-central-law-protect-violence-9530964/</link>
			<description>Doctors in India have been protesting against violence, demanding a central law with stricter punishments. While a draft law was prepared in 2019, it was rejected by the Home Ministry. The government argues that existing state laws are sufficient and that systemic issues like security measures need to be addressed. Doctors point to the frequency of attacks and argue that the proposed central law would act as a stronger deterrent.  The 2019 draft law suggested prison sentences of up to five years and fines of up to Rs 5 lakh for violence against healthcare professionals.  Several private MPs have tried to introduce similar bills in recent years, but none have been passed.  Incidents of violence against doctors are widespread, with over 75% of medical professionals reporting some form of aggression.</description>

			<description>On August 24, 1991, Ukrainian Parliament declared the country's independence from Moscow. This pivotal moment was spearheaded by democratic forces, with Mykola Porovskyi playing a key role as a leader of the People’s Movement party. 

The declaration followed a failed coup in Moscow and was initiated by the democratic opposition's faction, the "People's Council." Despite initial resistance from the communist majority, Porovskyi and his colleagues convinced them with promises of protection and recognition of their past work. 

Thousands of Ukrainians celebrated the declaration, carrying a blue and yellow flag into the Parliament building, symbolizing the nation's new-found freedom.  Porovskyi  highlights the unity and courage of the people in the face of a powerful Soviet military presence, emphasizing their unwavering belief in a better future for Ukraine.</description>

			<title>Remembering Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451: why his pioneering critique of censorship remains relevant today</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/ray-bradburys-fahrenheit-451-censorship-9530771/</link>
			<description>Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, a dystopian novel about a society where books are banned, remains relevant today as censorship persists. The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman tasked with burning books, as he begins to question his role and the society he lives in. Bradbury's work critiques the dangers of mass conformity and the suppression of free thought. 

Throughout history, book burnings and censorship have been used by regimes to control information and silence dissent. From the Nazi book burnings of the 1930s to contemporary instances of banning books in schools and libraries, the threat to freedom of expression continues.  Bradbury's novel serves as a warning against the dangers of intellectual suppression and the importance of safeguarding the right to read and think critically.</description>

			<title>India adds 3 new Ramsar sites: What are wetlands, why do they matter for the environment?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-adds-3-new-ramsar-sites-what-are-wetlands-why-do-they-matter-for-the-environment-9529938/</link>
			<description>India has expanded its network of Ramsar sites, designated wetlands of international importance, to 85. The three newest additions are Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary and Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu, and Tawa Reservoir in Madhya Pradesh. These sites were chosen based on criteria like supporting critical habitats for plant and animal species, providing refuge during adverse conditions, and contributing to water management and biodiversity. 

Wetlands are crucial ecosystems that regulate climate conditions through carbon sequestration, purify water, and act as buffers against extreme weather events.  However, they face threats from human activities like encroachment, pollution, and urbanization. 

India has implemented policies and initiatives to protect its wetlands, but ongoing efforts are needed to conserve these valuable resources.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/tanager-satellite-methane-emissions-9529992/</link>
			<description>The Tanager-1 satellite, launched recently, is designed to track and measure methane and carbon dioxide emissions. Using imaging spectrometer technology, it can identify and quantify these emissions down to the level of individual facilities and equipment globally. 

Researchers emphasize the importance of tracking methane emissions because it is a potent greenhouse gas, 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Fossil fuel operations are a major source of methane, contributing to global warming and health issues like ground-level ozone formation.

			<title>Mandatory reporting under POCSO Act: Why FIR has named Badlapur school under Section 21 of the law to protect children</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/mandatory-reporting-under-pocso-act-why-fir-has-named-badlapur-school-under-section-21-of-the-law-to-protect-children-9529825/</link>
			<description>The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has named the management of a private school in Badlapur in an FIR for failing to report the alleged sexual assault of two four-year-old students.  The POCSO Act mandates reporting such incidents, and the school authorities were aware of the assault but did not inform the police. The FIR was only registered after the father of one of the victims reported the incident. 

The Bombay High Court, which took suo motu cognizance of the case, highlighted the school's failure to report the assault. The SIT added Section 21 of the POCSO Act against the school authorities, which carries a punishment of up to six months imprisonment or a fine. This case emphasizes the importance of mandatory reporting under the POCSO Act to protect children from sexual abuse.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/polio-vaccine-triggered-infection-child-meghalaya-9529759/</link>
			<description>A two-year-old in Meghalaya has tested positive for vaccine-derived polio. This type of polio occurs rarely in children with weakened immune systems who receive the oral polio vaccine. While the case does not affect India's polio-free status, health officials are vigilant to prevent its spread.  India last reported a wild polio case in 2011 and was declared polio-free in 2014. Vaccine-derived polio cases continue to be monitored. India uses both oral and injectable polio vaccines.</description>

			<title>Assessing Ukraine’s deep incursion into Russia’s Kursk oblast: why, what happens now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/assessing-ukraines-deep-incursion-into-russias-kursk-oblast-why-what-happens-now-9530045/</link>
			<description>Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk Oblast two weeks ago has resulted in the capture of significant territory by Ukrainian forces. Russia claims to have thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to seize land in the neighboring Bryansk Oblast. Ukraine’s objectives are believed to be multifaceted, including using the captured territory as a bargaining chip in future negotiations, boosting morale after recent setbacks, and forcing Russia to divert troops from other fronts. The incursion has resulted in the displacement of civilians and the capture of Russian soldiers by Ukrainian forces. 

While Ukraine has made notable gains, it remains uncertain if they can sustain them. The Ukrainian army faces a manpower shortage and has pulled troops from other battlefields, potentially leaving them vulnerable in the long term. Russia, meanwhile, has not yet significantly diverted forces from its eastern offensive, raising concerns about Ukraine’s ability to hold onto its gains.</description>

			<title>Were Bangladesh floods caused by India releasing water from dam? GoI says no</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/tripura-floods-ministry-of-external-affairs-eastern-bangladesh-flood-dumbur-dam-9529990/</link>
			<description>Heavy rainfall in Tripura, India, led to flooding in eastern Bangladesh impacting nearly 1.8 million people across six districts. Unverified social media reports claimed that the release of water from the Dumbur dam in Tripura caused the floods. However, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs clarified that the dam's flood gates were not opened and excess water from the Gumti reservoir spilled automatically due to heavy rainfall exceeding its capacity. The ministry emphasized that the floods in Bangladesh are primarily due to the heavy rainfall in the Gumti river catchment area downstream of the dam.</description>

			<description>Jerome Powell, head of the US Federal Reserve, indicated that interest rate adjustments are near, signaling a potential shift towards rate cuts. This statement, made at the annual Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, impacted global markets, with bond yields falling and stock indices rising. Powell emphasized that the Fed aims to balance inflation control with labor market conditions. His remarks suggest a priority on curbing unemployment, as markets anticipate an end to interest rate hikes and the commencement of a rate-cutting cycle.

The Jackson Hole symposium is a significant event for global policymakers and investors as it offers insights into the world economy's direction. The theme this year, "Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,"  focuses on the role of monetary policy in managing inflation and economic growth, particularly in light of recent global shocks.</description>

			<title>Getting India into power play, Modi tries to bring Kyiv, Moscow to table</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/getting-india-into-power-play-modi-tries-to-bring-kyiv-moscow-to-table-9530100/</link>
			<description>During his visit to Ukraine, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered India's support for any initiative aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. This marked the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since its independence. Modi's meetings with both President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine position India uniquely in mediating between the two sides. 

India has maintained a neutral stance, abstaining from UN resolutions and sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine. While not directly involved in the war effort, PM Modi emphasized the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. His call for direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy signifies India's willingness to facilitate a peaceful resolution.</description>

			<title>Why Modi’s visit to Ukraine marks three new roads: India in Europe, diplomatic space, and Delhi-Kyiv revival</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/modi-visit-ukraine-9529875/</link>
			<description>Narendra Modi's first visit to Kyiv since Ukraine's independence signifies three key developments. Firstly, it demonstrates India's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and its willingness to engage in peace efforts, providing a platform for Zelenskyy to articulate Ukraine's concerns. 

Secondly, Modi's trip signals India's active role in shaping the global geopolitical landscape amidst the war's repercussions, countering the perception of India as a passive bystander.

Lastly, the visit aims to revitalize the relationship between India and Ukraine, fostering economic, defense, and cultural ties after a period of neglect.   Modi's engagement with both Russia and Ukraine underscores India's strategic positioning and its commitment to safeguarding its interests in this evolving global order.</description>

			<description>The Polaris Dawn mission, slated for August 26, 2024, is a privately funded endeavor aiming to make history as the first non-government spacewalk at an unparalleled altitude of 700 kilometers. This surpasses the International Space Station's orbit and ventures into the Van Allen radiation belts, a crucial test for future human space travel, particularly to Mars. 

The four astronauts will wear new SpaceX suits designed to withstand the radiation and collect valuable data on its effects. The mission will also test laser communication systems provided by SpaceX's Starlink network. Data gathered from Polaris Dawn will contribute to NASA's future missions, including the Artemis program that aims to land astronauts on the moon and eventually Mars.</description>

			<description>Chicken Kiev, a dish of breaded chicken filled with butter sauce, is believed to have originated in Russia but gained its name and modern popularity in Ukraine. While its exact origins are debated, some trace it back to French Cordon Bleu influenced by Russian chefs in the 19th century. 

It was introduced to Western Europe and the United States by Russian aristocrats after the Russian Revolution and became popular in the mid-20th century, particularly among Russian immigrants.  The dish reached global fame in the late 20th century as a ready-to-eat meal and is now enjoyed in various forms worldwide as a testament to culinary cross-cultural influences.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine by train, a mode of transportation used by several world leaders since Ukraine closed its airspace following the Russian invasion in 2022.  This state-owned Ukrainian Railways train, nicknamed "Rail Force One", features luxurious compartments with amenities like king-size beds and wall-mounted TVs.  Foreign dignitaries, including Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, and Emmanuel Macron, have previously used this train to reach Kyiv. It began operating after the invasion, with the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic being the first to utilize it.  The train journey spans 700 kilometers from Przemyśl Główny station in Poland to Kyiv.

			<title>3 key takeaways from Kamala Harris’ speech at the Democratic Convention</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/3-key-takeaways-kamala-harris-speech-at-the-democratic-convention-9529292/</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris' speech delivered at the Democratic National Convention emphasized the stark contrast between her proposed “new way forward” and Donald Trump's “make America great again” agenda. She warned of the dangers of a second Trump term, highlighting his potential to erode democratic norms by employing the full force of the presidency for personal gain. Harris specifically criticized Trump's stance on reproductive rights, foreign policy, and economic policies, promising to protect abortion rights,  defend democracy, and prioritize the middle class. 

She also addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, balancing support for Israel's right to defend itself with recognition of the suffering in Gaza.  

However, Harris' speech faced criticism from some for not offering concrete solutions to address economic concerns and failing to fully appease those seeking more progressive stances on issues like Palestine.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: Why Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ukraine is significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-expert-explains-why-prime-minister-narendra-modis-visit-to-kyiv-is-significant-9528324/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi will become the first Indian prime minister to visit Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992. This visit follows Modi's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July, a visit that drew criticism from Ukraine and the United States. 

India's engagement with Ukraine has historically been less prominent than its relationship with Russia. However, the war has created an opportunity for India to strengthen ties with Kyiv.  Indian officials have engaged with Ukrainian counterparts at multiple levels, including ministerial level meetings and participation in peace initiatives. 

India views the visit as a way to restore bilateral cooperation and explore opportunities in areas such as post-war reconstruction and defense industrial cooperation. India maintains that its relationship with Ukraine is separate from its ties with Russia.</description>

			<description>A year after landing on the Moon, the Chandrayaan 3 rover's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) has provided insights into the lunar south pole's topsoil. The findings support the widely held lunar magma ocean hypothesis, suggesting the Moon's early crust was formed in layers.  The data reveals a surprisingly uniform surface near the landing site, unlike Earth's tectonically active terrain.  Additionally, APXS detected a higher-than-expected amount of minerals typically found in deeper crustal layers, possibly due to mixing caused by the ancient South Pole Aitken basin impact. This ground truth data is crucial for understanding the Moon's evolution and will aid in planning future missions.</description>

			<description>The CBI is conducting a psychological profile of Sanjay Roy, the accused in the Kolkata junior doctor's rape and murder case. This rare exercise aims to understand Roy's mental state and motivations behind the crime.  

By analyzing his responses and behavioral patterns, the investigators hope to uncover potential co-conspirators, determine if the act was premeditated, and shed light on the root cause of his violence.  

The profile, prepared by experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), will be used as evidence in court.  This technique is employed when the accused's statements are deemed incomplete or when cooperation is lacking.</description>

			<title>Does your LMV licence allow you to drive a tractor as well? Supreme Court will decide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/tractor-lmv-licence-supreme-court-9527796/</link>
			<description>In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that a person with a license to drive a light motor vehicle (LMV) can also drive vehicles like road rollers and tractors, as long as their unladen weight is up to 7,500 kg. The court reasoned that classifying "transport vehicles" separately would create absurd results.  

However, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance challenged this ruling, arguing that it overlooked key provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act. In 2022, the Supreme Court agreed and referred the case to a Constitution Bench.  The government initially indicated that it would evaluate the legal position and consider amendments to the Act.  After repeated postponements, the Supreme Court is now set to deliver its verdict on the matter.</description>

			<title>Hillary Clinton says Kamala Harris could break the ‘glass ceiling’ with her nomination. What does it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris-glass-ceiling-meaning-9527869/</link>
			<description>Hillary Clinton believes Vice President Kamala Harris's potential confirmation as the Democratic presidential nominee will help break the "glass ceiling," signifying the barriers women face in achieving high-level positions.  Clinton, who herself was the first woman presidential nominee from a major political party in 2016, has frequently used the term.  

The term "glass ceiling," coined by management consultant Marilyn Loden in the 1970s, describes invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing despite their qualifications. While laws have been implemented to combat gender discrimination, women remain underrepresented in leadership roles across various sectors. 
Efforts to address the issue have included investigations, like the Glass Ceiling Commission in 1991, and  books like Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean In," which suggested women need to be more assertive. Critics argue that the term focuses primarily on the experiences of affluent white women and overlooks the unique challenges faced by women of color and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Economist Claudia Goldin has proposed that the real barrier lies in the inflexibility of demanding senior-level jobs and the lack of supportive policies for both men and women.</description>

			<title>How soon could Antarctica’s ice sheet break away and disappear?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/antarcticas-ice-sheet-break-away-9527198/</link>
			<description>A new study suggests that the catastrophic ice cliff collapse scenario for West Antarctica's ice sheet may be less likely than previously thought. While the Antarctic ice sheet is still vulnerable to destruction, computer simulations indicate that the ice cliffs, even when exposed, may not become steep enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.  This slower disintegration would give coastal communities and ecosystems more time to adapt to rising sea levels. However, scientists emphasize the need for more research to understand the complexities of ice fracture and refine projections of sea-level rise.</description>

			<title>Could Karnataka Governor have given sanction to prosecute CM Siddaramaiah? The issues before High Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/karnataka-corruption-siddaramiah-hc-governor-9527001/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has temporarily halted the trial against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the alleged MUDA scam case. This follows Governor Tawar Chand Gehlot's approval for a police investigation based on complaints from anti-corruption activists. The activists allege that Siddaramaiah's wife received housing sites in exchange for a piece of land illegally acquired by MUDA.  Siddaramaiah's legal team argues that the Governor should have withdrawn the show-cause notice based on the Council of Ministers' resolution. They contend that the Governor's decision to grant sanction was not justified and overlooked the potential conflict of interest. 



The court will assess key issues: whether sanction can be given based on private complaints and whether Siddaramaiah was performing official duties when the alleged offenses occurred.</description>

It highlights issues like casting couch, harassment, and a male-dominated power structure.  The report's release was met with criticism over the delay, with allegations that the government was protecting influential figures.</description>

			<description>Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot has granted permission for investigations into Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption charges related to the allocation of housing sites to his wife. The allegations involve a land exchange scheme where Siddaramaiah's wife received 14 plots in exchange for 3.16 acres of land that the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) allegedly acquired illegally. Siddaramaiah and the Congress party have denied the allegations, stating that the land dealings predate their time in power. Activists contend that the CM's brother-in-law acquired the land even though MUDA had ostensibly taken it over, and that the land exchange scheme yielded significant financial benefit for the CM's wife compared to the official valuation.  The Karnataka High Court has temporarily halted any "precipitative action" based on the Governor's sanction pending a further hearing.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/malaysia-orangutan-diplomacy-9526229/</link>
			<description>Following strong criticism from wildlife conservationists, Malaysia's Plantation and Commodities Minister Johari Ghani revised his "orangutan diplomacy" proposal.  The original plan aimed to gift critically endangered orangutans to countries importing Malaysian palm oil, drawing comparisons to China's panda diplomacy.  

The plan faced backlash as it was seen as hypocritical,  considering the palm oil industry's role in orangutan habitat destruction. Critics argued that protecting forests, not gifting orangutans, was the critical step needed. 

The revised proposal offers importers the opportunity to "sponsor" orangutans, with funds directed towards conservation programs within Malaysia, ensuring the primates remain in their natural habitats.</description>

			<title>How South China Sea tensions pose a threat to international trade</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/south-china-sea-impact-global-trade-9525932/</link>
			<description>A third of global maritime trade passes through the South China Sea, a vital route for commerce between Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  

Tensions in the region have escalated due to China's territorial claims and military activities.  If the situation deteriorates, maritime trade could face significant disruptions, similar to those already caused by attacks in the Red Sea and potential blockades in the Malacca Strait. The South China Sea holds vast energy reserves and rare-earth minerals crucial for global technology, making its stability a critical concern for the world economy.</description>

			<title>Why has an international astronomical group joined calls for creating time standard for the Moon?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/time-standard-moon-9525462/</link>
			<description>The International Astronomical Union is proposing a time standard for the Moon.  Currently, each lunar mission uses its own timescale, which can lead to complications, especially as more spacecraft operate in lunar space. 

A unified lunar time standard is necessary due to the Moon's distinct gravitational pull, which affects the flow of time compared to Earth. This discrepancy, while small, can cause issues in spacecraft docking, data transfer, and navigation.

Similar to Earth, atomic clocks placed at various locations on the Moon could be used to establish a lunar time standard. These clocks would account for the Moon's rotation and local gravitational variations, ensuring accuracy. The standard would be linked to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for seamless communication with Earth.</description>

			<title>How will the upcoming US Presidential election impact climate change?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/us-election-and-climate-change-9524502/</link>
			<description>The selection of Tim Walz as the Democratic nominee for Vice President is being celebrated by the climate change community. His experience as Governor of Minnesota, where he enacted ambitious climate policies, suggests a continued commitment to environmental issues if the Democratic ticket wins.  Walz's record is seen as a strong contrast to the previous administration's stance on climate change.

While the choice of Walz signals a positive step, analysts remain cautious about expecting drastic changes in US climate policy. The US has historically lagged behind in addressing climate change, and even with Walz's involvement, it's unlikely the country will surpass the goals set by the Biden administration.</description>

			<title>Long before ‘lateral entry’, how Nehru government recruited bureaucrats from ‘open market’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/long-before-todays-lateral-entry-nehru-govt-recruited-from-open-market-9524505/</link>
			<description>A previous government in 1948 and 1956, under Jawaharlal Nehru, made appointments to the IAS and IPS from outside the civil service examinations.  This was done to address a shortage of officers after independence, and to bring in specialized skills. Open market recruitments were made from individuals over 25 years old who had the required qualifications. 

These recruitments involved open applications, exams, and interviews, and quotas were implemented for SC and ST candidates. These open market recruitments were controversial, with some critics arguing they favored the wealthy and skilled, while others supported the need to find experienced personnel quickly. They resulted in hundreds of officers joining the IAS and IPS, helping to build the foundations of India's administrative system.</description>

			<title>What is a waterspout, which may have sunk the luxury yacht off Sicily?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/waterspout-luxury-yacht-sicily-9524129/</link>
			<description>A luxury yacht carrying 22 people sank off the coast of Sicily after being struck by a storm that is believed to have been a tornadic waterspout. One man has been confirmed dead, and six people, including tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter, are still missing.  Waterspouts are weaker cousins of tornadoes, forming over water when there are high levels of humidity and warm water temperatures compared to the overlying air. They can last for several minutes and have wind speeds of around 100 kilometers per hour.  Experts suggest that, due to rising ocean temperatures, the frequency of waterspouts may be increasing.</description>

			<title>Who are the Dhangars of Maharashtra and why are they asking for ‘grazing corridors’ in forests?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dhangars-maharashtra-elections-caste-9524048/</link>
			<description>The Dhangars, a nomadic shepherd community in Maharashtra, are demanding "grazing corridors" to allow them to traverse their traditional routes with their livestock.  The community, which includes populations in several other states, has faced challenges as forest department restrictions have come into conflict with their ancestral grazing patterns. They argue that grazing by their small ruminants benefits the land and that they are essential stakeholders in forest ecosystems. The Dhangars also seek Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, a demand that faces opposition from existing ST communities. While the community has political clout and influence, there isn't a single issue currently uniting them politically.  They hope that the upcoming Assembly elections will offer an opportunity to gain traction on their demand for grazing rights.</description>

			<title>Before Siddaramiah, 4 alleged corruption cases where Karnataka Governor’s prosecution sanction was sought</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/siddaramiah-governor-corruption-sanction-9523838/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka Governor has granted sanction for the prosecution of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption allegations. The Congress party views this as a political move, highlighting pending sanction requests against other political figures, including former CM HD Kumaraswamy and BJP leaders Murugesh Nirani, Gali Janardhan Reddy, and Shashikala Jolle. 

The cases against these individuals involve alleged corruption related to illegal mining, inflated contracts, and bribery. 
Kumaraswamy maintains that a Supreme Court-appointed SIT was directed to complete its investigation years ago and questions the delay. The governor's sanction against  Nirani concerns a contract for an animated video, while Reddy faces allegations of amassing disproportionate assets during his ministerial tenure. Jolle is accused of seeking bribes for ensuring egg supply under a government scheme.</description>

			<title>What must NASA decide to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore home?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-sunita-williams-barry-stuck-return-9523319/</link>
			<description>American astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently stationed on the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. While the Starliner successfully docked with the ISS,  persistent issues with its propulsion system have delayed their return to Earth. NASA and Boeing are working to resolve these issues, considering two options:  repair the Starliner for a piloted return or bring the spacecraft back uncrewed, extending the astronauts’ stay to approximately eight months. Although there are health risks associated with prolonged space travel, Wilmore and Williams are highly experienced astronauts and their radiation exposure, while increased, remains relatively low compared to other astronauts. NASA is conducting a thorough review process to determine the safest course of action for the astronauts’ return.</description>

			<title>Hayflick limit: Why immortality remains out of humans’ reach</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/hayflick-limit-why-immortality-remains-out-of-humans-reach-9522701/</link>
			<description>Leonard Hayflick's discovery that normal somatic cells have a limited number of divisions before they stop (senesce) revolutionized our understanding of aging.  He proposed this "Hayflick limit" is a built-in cellular clock determining lifespan, estimated to be around 125 years for humans. Support for this came with the discovery of telomeres, DNA sequences that shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to senescence. However,  the exact relationship between telomere length and lifespan remains complex. Some argue that telomere shortening is a symptom, not a cause, of aging.  The discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that can produce new telomeres, suggests the possibility of overcoming the Hayflick limit, but practical applications are still far off.</description>

			<title>Scientists discover liquid water on Mars for the first time: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/liquid-water-mars-9522348/</link>
			<description>A new study suggests the presence of vast quantities of liquid water deep within the Martian crust.  Researchers analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, discovering waves that indicated the presence of a water-filled layer between 10 to 20 kilometers below the surface.  

This discovery, if representative of the entire planet, could equate to an ocean worth of water.  

The study authors believe this water likely seeped into the crust billions of years ago when Mars had a warmer, wetter climate. While the presence of water doesn't confirm life on Mars, it highlights the potential for habitable environments deep underground and fuels the search for evidence of past or present Martian life.</description>

			<title>Why the selection of 69,000 assistant teachers in Uttar Pradesh has been ordered afresh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/up-69000-assistant-teachers-exam-hc-9522223/</link>
			<description>The Allahabad High Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to prepare a new list of 69,000 assistant teachers following a legal challenge concerning the 2019 recruitment process. 

The court determined that the previous lists, issued in October 2020, did not adhere to reservation rules stipulated by the Indian constitution.  The initial lists came under scrutiny due to allegations of disproportionate representation of reserved category candidates and the misplacement of  "Meritorious Reserved Candidates".  The High Court directed authorities to rectify these issues within three months, ensuring proper adherence to reservation laws.  This decision has significant political implications as OBC reservation is a sensitive issue in Uttar Pradesh. The state government has affirmed its commitment to upholding reservation rights and has pledged to comply with the court's orders. Opposition parties, meanwhile, have criticized the government's handling of the recruitment process, accusing it of irregularities and injustice.</description>

			<title>Explained: Google’s ‘monopolist’ judgement in the US and its repercussions in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-google-monopolist-judgement-impact-india-9521974/</link>
			<description>A recent US court ruling declared Google a monopoly in online search, finding the company acted illegally to maintain its dominance. This landmark judgment could significantly impact the way digital businesses operate and has implications for India as well.  

Google faces similar antitrust challenges globally, accused of stifling competition and controlling a vast portion of the online market.  In India, concerns have been raised about Google's billing policies, commissions on its app store, and alleged dominance in online advertising. India is proposing a new digital competition law modelled after the EU's Digital Markets Act, aiming to curb anti-competitive practices by big tech companies. 
The proposed law includes provisions to prevent self-preferencing, use of data to benefit affiliated companies, and sets presumptive norms to address anti-competitive behavior.  The law aims to create a fairer digital landscape by enabling competition and preventing dominance by a few large tech giants.</description>

			<title>How Starbucks’ leadership change could impact customer experience in 3 ways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/starbucks-leadership-change-india-9521891/</link>
			<description>Starbucks' leadership transition is unlikely to significantly impact its Indian partnership, Tata Starbucks. However, there are potential changes in customer experience, such as streamlining operations and improving the mobile app due to issues with accuracy and long wait times. 

The new CEO, Brian Niccol, may prioritize these improvements based on his experience at Chipotle and  feedback from former CEO Howard Schultz.  

Another focus area could be expanding into growing segments like cold brew and energy drinks to better compete with other cafes and fast-food chains. 

Starbucks also faces the challenge of balancing its premium image with increasing price sensitivity among consumers.  A strategy shift towards value-driven offerings, similar to Chipotle, might be considered. The extent to which these strategy changes affect the Indian market remains to be seen.</description>

			<title>Super Blue Moon on Raksha Bandhan: What is it and how will it be different?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/super-blue-moon-raksha-bandhan-2024-9521732/</link>
			<description>Raksha Bandhan, celebrated on the full moon day in the month of Shravan, is unique this year as it coincides with a 'super blue moon'. This rare event, where the full moon is both a 'blue moon' and a 'super moon', happens due to the moon being closer to Earth in its elliptical orbit (perigee) and the occurrence of two full moons in a single month. The super blue moon will be visible in Delhi at 6:57 pm on August 19th, slightly later in Mumbai and an hour earlier in Kolkata. The term 'blue moon' doesn't refer to the moon's colour but is used to describe a second full moon in a calendar month or the third full moon in a season with four.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/elon-musk-x-brazil-shut-operations-9520939/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk's X platform has abruptly ceased operations in Brazil following a dispute with Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes. X alleges that Judge Moraes threatened their representative with arrest if they didn't comply with censorship orders, claiming these demands were overly strict and violated the law. 

The judge, known for his crackdown on disinformation and online threats, had ordered the blocking of certain X accounts and launched an investigation into Musk for allegedly obstructing Brazilian justice.  This stems from  X's resistance to obey court orders to remove content deemed harmful, contradicting Musk's self-proclaimed stance as a free speech advocate.</description>

			<title>Can Sheikh Hasina be extradited to Bangladesh? What are India’s options?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/india-options-sheikh-hasina-extradition-bangladesh-9520855/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's de facto foreign minister has stated that the country may seek the extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina  due to criminal charges filed against her.  A 2013 extradition treaty between India and Bangladesh, amended in 2016, facilitates the process. The treaty allows for extradition based on offenses carrying a minimum punishment of one year, including financial crimes.  Hasina faces charges including murder, enforced disappearance, and torture, some of which fall under the treaty's definition.  However, India has grounds to refuse extradition based on "good faith" or non-political motivations.  The decision is complex as it involves balancing India's strategic interests in Bangladesh, its relationship with the new government, and its historical ties with Hasina. Diplomatic engagement and factors like the political landscape and ongoing investigations will likely influence the final outcome.</description>

			<description>Paetongtarn Shinawatra has become Thailand's new Prime Minister, succeeding Srettha Thavisin who was ousted by a constitutional court. This marks the third time a Shinawatra family member has held the position, following Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra. Paetongtarn's election comes amidst ongoing political turmoil, with the previously largest party, Move Forward Party, facing dissolution due to its stance on lèse majesté laws. There are concerns about the fragility of Thailand's democracy, with the military and the monarchy continuing to exert influence.  Paetongtarn's inexperience and reliance on her father's legacy pose challenges, as does the need to address the country's economic stagnation.</description>

			<description>Odisha is planting 20 lakh palm trees to mitigate the risk of lightning strikes, a state-specific disaster that claims numerous lives annually.  The initiative aims to protect vulnerable populations, particularly those working in agriculture, as most lightning deaths occur during the peak farming season.  

Palm trees are considered effective lightning conductors due to their height, moisture content, and ability to absorb lightning strikes. The state government has allocated Rs 7 crore for the project, which will initially focus on planting trees along forest boundaries. Despite concerns raised by experts regarding the effectiveness and time required for palm trees to mature, the government remains committed to the plan.</description>

			<description>The World Health Organization has declared the mpox outbreaks in Congo and elsewhere in Africa a global emergency. While there have been imported cases of mpox in Europe, scientists believe the risk of widespread outbreaks is low. Unlike the coronavirus, mpox spreads primarily through close contact and does not spread as quickly. Vaccines and treatments for mpox are available, unlike in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Currently, most cases are in Africa, particularly Congo, where the health system is strained. Despite the WHO declaring a global emergency in 2022, Africa has received very few vaccines or treatments.  Experts emphasize the importance of prioritizing Africa to control the outbreak.</description>

			<description>The Indian government has withdrawn an advertisement for lateral recruitment of senior bureaucrats. The advertisement, which sought candidates from various sectors, including public and private, had excluded reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. 

Opposition parties and some NDA allies criticized the move, arguing it goes against constitutional provisions and weakens representational diversity. They pointed out that reservations are mandatory for appointments in the bureaucracy, stating that lateral entries circumvented this policy.

Proponents of lateral recruitment argue it allows the government to tap into specialized expertise, which career bureaucrats might lack.  They cite the need for fresh talent and the increase in manpower as reasons for lateral entry.</description>

			<title>Americans, Soviets or Israelis? Who killed Pakistan’s former President Zia ul-Haq?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-president-zia-ul-haq-9519589/</link>
			<description>The mysterious 1988 air crash that killed Pakistani president Zia ul-Haq remains unsolved.  Several theories abound, pointing to potential involvement from various parties. Murtaza Bhutto, son of Zia's predecessor, was a prime suspect due to his anti-Zia affiliations and previous assassination attempts.

Another theory implicated Zia's then vice-chief, General Aslam Beg,  who allegedly  manipulated the investigation. The Soviet Union was also considered a potential suspect given Zia's role in supporting Afghan mujahideen against them.  

The US, specifically the CIA, was suspected by some due to Zia's policies that arguably challenged US interests. Israeli involvement was also suggested, with some believing Mossad aimed to prevent Pakistan's nuclear development. Despite various investigations, no conclusive evidence has emerged, leaving the true cause of the crash and responsible parties a matter of speculation.</description>

			<title>Explained: The bitter dispute in the Namdhari sect, which has left 8 people injured in a violent clash</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/explained-dispute-namdhari-sect-9519265/</link>
			<description>A violent clash erupted between followers of two factions of the Namdhari religious sect in Rania, Haryana, leaving eight people injured. The dispute revolves around 11 acres of agricultural land at Jeewan Nagar village.  The factions led by brothers Sadguru Uday Singh and Thakur Dalip Singh are claiming ownership of the land.  The Dalip Singh faction claims a quasi-judicial court had ruled in their favor in 2019, while the Uday Singh faction asserts the land belongs to their sect.  Both sides have filed police complaints accusing the other of attacking their members.  This latest violence revives memories of the 2016 shooting of 88-year-old Chand Kaur, the sect matriarch,  an incident for which both brothers blamed each other.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ketamine-queen-jasveen-sangha-matthew-perry-9519154/</link>
			<description>Jasveen Sangha, also known as the "Ketamine Queen", is facing charges related to the death of actor Matthew Perry. Prosecutors allege she supplied him with ketamine, which led to his death. Sangha is accused of operating a drug distribution network from her home, where she allegedly packaged and sold various drugs, including ketamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and Xanax. 

Authorities claim Sangha  sold Perry 50 vials of ketamine for $11,000, and that this sale contributed to his death. She is also linked to another drug-related fatality in 2019. If convicted, Sangha faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.</description>

			<title>From kesri to basanti: history and politics around the colour of the holy Nishan Sahib</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/kesri-basanti-history-politics-colour-holy-nishan-sahib-9519057/</link>
			<description>The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has recently changed the color of the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag, from kesri (saffron) to basanti (a bright yellow). This move follows a yearlong debate and an order from the Akal Takht, the highest temporal authority in Sikhism. 

The change is rooted in historical arguments about the appropriate color, referencing the Sikh Code of Conduct that prescribes either basanti or greyish blue. While kesri gained popularity, some believe its association with Hindu symbolism and its rise during the militancy period in Punjab necessitates a return to basanti.  The SGPC's decision is being seen as a significant step towards clarifying the symbolism of the Nishan Sahib and potentially influencing other Sikh institutions and individuals to adopt the historical color.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: How James Webb Space Telescope has raised questions in cosmology</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-how-james-webb-space-telescope-has-raised-questions-in-cosmology-9518351/</link>
			<description>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided stunning images of the early universe but has also raised perplexing questions for astronomers.  Observations show fully formed galaxies in the universe's early stages, contradicting expectations of smaller, younger galaxies during that time.  Additionally, JWST's measurements of the universe's expansion rate differ from previous data, further challenging existing models.

This discrepancy has reignited debate about the reliability of different methods used to measure expansion. One method relies on early universe radiation, while the other uses local celestial objects like variable stars. JWST's findings seem to support the local method, suggesting a faster expansion rate. 

These surprises have led some astronomers to question the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of the universe.  The need for "dark matter" and "dark energy" to explain discrepancies between observations and predictions may indicate a deeper need for revision, much like the shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric model of the solar system. Only time will tell if the JWST's findings will lead to refinements or a complete overhaul of our understanding of cosmic history.</description>

			<title>Why national consumer commission directed Goibibo, not Jet Airways, to issued refund after flight cancellation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/national-consumer-commission-goibibo-jet-airways-refund-9518049/</link>
			<description>A family booked tickets to Canada through Goibibo for a Jet Airways flight. When Jet Airways went bankrupt, the family sought a refund from Goibibo. Goibibo argued they were just a facilitator and not responsible for the refund. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, however, ruled in favor of the family.  

The commission cited Goibibo's booking policy, which states that refunds should be processed through them, and Jet Airways' circular directing customers to contact their booking agents for refunds.  The commission concluded that while Goibibo might be an intermediary, they are also commission agents who bear responsibility for refunds in case of cancellations.</description>

			<title>All-night streetlights can make leaves inedible to insects: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/streetlights-leaves-inedible-insects-9518020/</link>
			<description>A new study has revealed that artificial lights, such as streetlights, can negatively impact urban ecosystems.  Researchers found that trees exposed to continuous light at night developed tougher leaves, making them less palatable to insects. This reduced herbivory could have a cascading effect on the food chain, potentially leading to a decline in populations of insect-eaters such as birds. 

The study suggests that artificial light may disrupt the natural cycles of trees, potentially causing stress due to extended photosynthesis.</description>

			<title>How an asteroid from beyond Jupiter ended the age of dinosaurs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/asteroid-beyond-jupiter-dinosaurs-extinction-9517927/</link>
			<description>A new study analyzed ruthenium isotopes from the Chicxulub crater, concluding that the asteroid responsible for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event originated from the outer Solar System. This finding suggests the extinction event was a consequence of early Solar System processes and differentiates the impactor from typical asteroids formed closer to the Sun. 

The study also refutes the theory that a comet caused the extinction. While the exact cause of the asteroid's trajectory change remains unclear, computer simulations propose possibilities like gravitational interactions or collisions with other bodies.</description>

			<title>The Americans or the Ukrainians? Who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nord-stream-gas-pipelines-explosion-9517908/</link>
			<description>Two years after the Nord Stream pipeline explosions, the culprit remains unknown. The Wall Street Journal alleges a small team of Ukrainian operatives, defying President Zelenskyy's orders, carried out the attack. The operation, funded by businessmen and overseen by a general, involved divers planting explosives on the pipelines. This account contradicts Seymour Hersh's reporting that the CIA, under White House direction, orchestrated the sabotage with help from Norway. 

German investigations suggest Ukrainian involvement, citing a yacht found near the site along with traces of underwater explosives.  An arrest warrant has been issued for a Ukrainian diver instructor suspected of planting the explosives, but he remains at large.</description>

			<title>You’ve lost weight taking new obesity drugs. What happens if you stop?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/weight-loss-drugs-stop-effects-9517770/</link>
			<description>Obesity medication is helping many people achieve weight loss, but concerns remain about long-term use. Studies suggest that stopping these drugs leads to weight regain and a return of related health issues. Doctors currently lack data to guide patients on how to safely reduce or stop their dosage. 

Experts recommend ongoing treatment for obesity as it is a chronic condition, similar to high blood pressure. While some patients experience side effects initially, these often decrease over time. However, restarting the medication after a break may bring these side effects back.  The discussion around long-term drug use highlights the ongoing challenges of managing a chronic condition and the need for further research on tapering strategies and long-term effects.</description>

			<description>The Bombay High Court ruled that an egg donor does not have parental rights over a child born through surrogacy. 
This case involved a woman seeking custody of her twin daughters,  who were in the joint custody of her estranged husband and her younger sister, the egg donor. The court clarified that the donor, as per Indian law and guidelines, relinquishes all parental rights. 

The court recognized the petitioner and her husband as the legitimate parents of the children,  based on their approval of the surrogacy agreement. Due to the separation of the parents, the mother was granted visiting rights over the weekends while the custody case is ongoing.</description>

			<title>ISRO launches SSLV: What is the aim behind developing Small Satellite Launch Vehicles?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/isro-sslv-launch-vehicle-features-9517682/</link>
			<description>ISRO successfully launched its third Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) mission, placing the EOS-08 earth observation satellite into orbit. This marks the completion of the SSLV development project, enabling NSIL and the Indian private space industry to produce SSLVs for commercial missions. 

Designed for low-cost launches with shorter turnaround times, the SSLV can carry up to 500kg of payload and accommodates multiple satellites. This addresses the need for dedicated launch options for smaller payloads, previously reliant on larger launch vehicles with limited availability. 


Compared to ISRO's other launch vehicles, the PSLV and GSLV, the SSLV is smaller and more cost-effective. The PSLV, a workhorse for low earth orbit launches, excels at delivering various satellites.  GSLVs, with their higher capacity, are primarily used to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbits.</description>

			<title>Remembering the ‘Great Calcutta Killings’: When Jinnah’s ‘direct action’ caused a bloodbath</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/remembering-great-calcutta-killings-jinnah-direct-action-9517614/</link>
			<description>The Great Calcutta Killings of August 1946 were the deadliest outbreak of communal violence preceding India's independence.  Political tensions between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, coupled with existing communal strife in the city, created a volatile atmosphere.  Huseyn Suhrawardy, the Chief Minister of Bengal,  is widely criticized for his inflammatory rhetoric and inaction in quelling the violence. His alleged tacit support for the mob, along with his reported restraint of police forces, fueled the bloodshed. The exact number of casualties remains uncertain but estimates range from 5,000 to 10,000 deaths, with thousands more injured. The savagery of the violence, including grotesque mutilation and the use of rape as a weapon, served as a grim foreshadowing of the horrors that would punctuate the Partition.</description>

			<title>Why the worst of food inflation may be over</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-the-worst-of-food-inflation-may-be-over-9516601/</link>
			<description>Although retail food inflation fell to 5.4% in July 2024, this decline is misleading, with a high base effect contributing to a statistically lower figure. The real story is a persisting food inflation problem, impacting households and hindering the RBI's ability to lower interest rates.

There are reasons for cautious optimism. The monsoon has been good, exceeding expectations in key areas and leading to a rise in the cultivation of crops like arhar and maize. This could ease inflation in pulses and animal proteins.  Low global food prices, particularly for wheat, make imports more feasible, which could further help control domestic prices. 

However, uncertainty remains as the harvest is still some time away.  Wheat stocks are low, and the full impact of the monsoon on food inflation is yet to be seen.</description>

			<description>Stonehenge's Altar Stone, a six-tonne sandstone slab in the monument's center, has been traced to the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, over 800km away. This discovery, through geochemical analysis, reveals a far more extensive collaborative effort in Stonehenge's construction than previously known. Prior to this, most of Stonehenge's stones were known to originate from Marlborough Downs and the Mynydd Preseli mountains in Wales, revealing the vast network and interconnectedness of Neolithic Britain. While the transportation method and the specific reason for bringing the Altar Stone to Stonehenge remain mysteries, the scale of the journey and its origins suggest a highly significant purpose and a level of social integration exceeding previous understanding.</description>

			<title>Why 44 and 60 could be two key ages in human aging, according to a new study</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/aging-44-and-60-new-study-9516477/</link>
			<description>A new study analyzing data from 108 participants has revealed substantial molecular changes linked to human aging at ages 44 and 60. The research, published in Nature Aging,  tracked participants over 1.7 years, collecting various bodily samples to analyze proteins, lipids, and microbiomes.  Key findings include shifts in immune regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and cardiovascular disease risks around these ages. Notably, the study also found alterations in caffeine metabolism at both 40 and 60.  While the study provides valuable insight into the non-linear nature of disease risk and points to potential therapeutic targets for age-related diseases, it acknowledges limitations such as a small sample size and short duration. Further research is needed to understand the underlying factors driving these changes.</description>

			<title>Right to abortion in US: which states will vote, what are the proposed measures?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/arizona-missouri-states-abortion-amendments-explained-9516155/</link>
			<description>At least seven states will have ballot measures regarding abortion rights in the upcoming November elections. This follows the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, leading to a wave of citizen-led initiatives.  

Arizona and Missouri recently qualified measures for their ballots, joining five other states that already announced similar ballot measures. These initiatives generally aim to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions, often allowing for abortions up to the point of fetal viability or later to safeguard a woman's health.  


The results from previous states where abortion rights were on the ballot since 2022 have consistently favored pro-abortion rights positions.</description>

			<title>Why is Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida resigning?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-japan-pm-fumio-kishida-resigns-9516199/</link>
			<description>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation, citing a need for a change in leadership following a series of scandals that have eroded public trust. Kishida's approval rating plummeted to 20%, largely due to revelations of slush funds and the LDP's ties to the controversial Unification Church.  

Kishida, who previously served as Japan's longest tenured foreign minister, led the push for a "new capitalism" to stimulate economic growth. However, his initiatives were largely overshadowed by economic challenges, including a weakening yen and rising inflation. Despite the LDP's historic control over Japanese politics, Kishida's departure signals a shift within the party as it searches for a new leader to address public concerns and revitalize their agenda.</description>

			<title>Why climate change poses an existential threat to Panama Canal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-existential-threat-panama-canal-9516055/</link>
			<description>The Panama Canal, a remarkable feat of engineering, is facing a significant threat from climate change. Its operation relies heavily on Lake Gatun, a large artificial reservoir. However, prolonged droughts, exacerbated by climate change, have led to  declining water levels in the lake, disrupting canal traffic. 

The canal necessitates vast amounts of fresh water to operate its intricate lock system, which lifts ships between the differing elevations of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Last year saw severe water shortages, forcing ships to reduce cargo and significantly impacting the canal's efficiency. While recent rainfall has alleviated the immediate crisis, experts warn that such droughts are becoming more frequent and could pose a long-term challenge.  

To address this issue, authorities propose constructing a new dam on the Rio Indio to provide a backup water source.  However, this plan faces opposition due to its potential to displace thousands of people. The Panama Canal, a crucial global shipping route, is caught in a complex dilemma between environmental challenges and socio-economic concerns.</description>

			<title>What is the process for designating senior advocates, how has it changed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/process-for-designating-senior-advocates-9515705/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has appointed 39 lawyers as senior advocates, including 10 women. This follows new guidelines established in May 2023, which aim to create a more transparent and objective process for granting the designation. The guidelines, which were introduced in response to concerns about nepotism and arbitrariness in the previous system, include a point-based evaluation system and a committee responsible for reviewing applications.  Applicants are assessed based on criteria such as years of legal practice, reported judgments, and legal publications,  with the new guidelines reducing the emphasis on publications. The designation of a senior advocate is considered a mark of excellence and comes with certain restrictions, including limitations on representing clients and engaging in drafting work.</description>

			<title>Telling Numbers: How many US Vice Presidents have gone on to become President</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/telling-numbers-how-many-us-vice-presidents-have-gone-on-to-become-president-9514738/</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris's bid for presidency continues a trend of US Vice Presidents seeking the top job.  Of the 49 individuals who have served as Vice President, 29 have run for president, with 10 ultimately succeeding. This trend has intensified since 1933, with 15 out of 18 Vice Presidents launching presidential campaigns in that period. Five of these ultimately won, including Harry Truman, Lyndon B Johnson, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and Joe Biden.  Several Vice Presidents have won their party's nomination but lost the general election, while others have failed to secure the nomination altogether.</description>

			<title>Microwave ovens host thriving communities of microbes: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/microwave-ovens-host-thriving-communities-of-microbes-what-a-new-study-says-9514737/</link>
			<description>A new study reveals that microwave ovens, despite containing radiation, harbor diverse communities of bacteria.  Researchers sampled 30 microwaves from homes, labs, and shared spaces and identified 747 genera of bacteria, including some potentially harmful to humans.  Though human skin bacteria were prevalent, lab microwaves contained more diverse species, including "extremophiles" capable of withstanding high radiation and temperatures. This study emphasizes the need to clean microwaves regularly with disinfectants, as they are not sterile environments.</description>

			<title>What is the role of campaign cash in the US presidential election?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-the-role-of-campaign-cash-in-the-us-presidential-election-9514338/</link>
			<description>US presidential campaigns are unbelievably expensive, with the 2020 election reaching a record $5.7 billion.  Both major party candidates this year, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, have already raised hundreds of millions of dollars. These funds come mainly from wealthy individuals and corporations, raising concerns about undue influence on policy.  Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations, are a major source of funding, adding to the already substantial sums. While donations can help with campaign operations and voter mobilization, there is debate over their actual impact on election outcomes.  

However, the high cost of campaigning raises concerns about the influence of big donors on politics, as they often secure access and influence after elections through appointments or other means. Public opinion favors campaign finance reform, but current legal frameworks and the nature of US political parties make such changes unlikely.</description>

			<title>What is the status of Hindus in Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-the-status-of-hindus-in-bangladesh-9514699/</link>
			<description>Following the fall of the Awami League government in Bangladesh, Hindu communities have faced over 200 attacks. This has resulted in at least five deaths and heightened fears within the minority group.  Bangladesh's Hindu population, estimated at 13.1 million according to the 2022 census, has historically been a significant portion of the country's demographics. However,  centuries-old demographic shifts have resulted in a steady decline in the Hindu population, particularly after the Partition of India in 1947. The reasons for this decline are multifaceted, including higher fertility rates among Muslims, historical socio-economic disparities, and periods of communal violence.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan celebrates Independence Day on August 14, and India on August 15</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/explained-pakistan-independence-day-9514028/</link>
			<description>The split of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947 was orchestrated by Lord Mountbatten, who set the independence date as August 15th. This decision was influenced by a desire for a quick transfer of power and a personal preference for a date marking a victory in World War II. 

While the Pakistani government initially recognized August 15th as Independence Day, a change to August 14th was made in 1948. This change coincided with the date of the official transfer of power ceremony held in Karachi and the significance of the 27th day of Ramadan.</description>

			<title>What were the first postage stamps of Independent India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/first-stamps-independent-india-9513918/</link>
			<description>India's first commemorative stamp was issued on November 21, 1947, depicting the Indian flag. Three stamps were released, all featuring "Jai Hind" and the date of independence. They were priced at 3.5 annas, 1.5 annas, and 12 annas, and depicted the national flag, the Lion Capital of Ashoka, and a Douglas DC-4 aircraft respectively. 

A formal postal system in India was established with the East India Company, starting with internal communication in the 1720s.  The first GPO was opened in Calcutta in 1774. In 1852, India became the first Asian country to issue its own postage stamps, the "Scinde Dawk," in Sindh district.  Uniform postage rates were introduced across India in 1854, along with Queen Victoria's portrait on stamps and the railway mail service.</description>

			<title>What is the drug Captagon, and how is it linked to Germany?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/drug-captagon-germany-link-explained-9513706/</link>
			<description>A recent trial in Germany involves four men accused of selling over €58 million worth of Captagon tablets. This bust highlights the growing concern that Captagon, known as the "poor man's cocaine", is more prevalent in Europe than previously believed.

Originally a prescription medication for attention deficit disorders, Captagon became illicitly manufactured in the early 2000s, particularly in Syria, which now produces an estimated 80% of the world's supply. The drug is highly addictive and can have serious negative health effects. 

 While Captagon's popularity soared in the Middle East, particularly among young people and in militias during the Syrian conflict, its reach is now expanding to Europe. This has sparked concerns over its increasing availability and potential for abuse across the continent. Europe faces the challenge of  tackling its production within its borders and preventing its use as a transshipment zone for Middle Eastern Captagon.</description>

			<title>Why is the Delhi HC hearing a plea against the exclusion of Section 377 from the new criminal laws?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/delhi-high-court-exclusion-section-377-criminal-laws-9513667/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to clarify its stance on non-consensual sexual offences against LGBTQIA+ individuals and men following the removal of Section 377 from the new Indian penal code, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.  Petitioners argue that while Section 377 was struck down for criminalising consensual homosexual acts, its removal leaves a gap in protecting men from such offences. The Centre, however, maintains that the court cannot direct the legislature on lawmaking.

The BNS, which replaced the Indian Penal Code, defines rape under Section 63 but in gendered terms, focusing on offences by men against women. Concerns have been raised that the lack of a specific provision addressing non-consensual sexual acts against men in the BNS risks leaving them vulnerable. 
 
While the BNS offers some protection under Sections 36 and 38 relating to the right of private defence, and Section 140 addressing kidnapping with the intention of "unnatural lust," the lack of clarity around "unnatural lust" raises further questions. The Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to respond by August 28th.</description>

			<title>How broiler chicken industry has become India’s most organised and vertically integrated agri-business</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/broiler-chicken-chhattisgarh-broiler-meat-poultry-farms-9512568/</link>
			<description>This article outlines the evolution of the chicken industry in India, focusing on the rise of contract farming models pioneered by companies like IB Group. It contrasts traditional backyard poultry keeping with modern, heavily integrated operations where companies like IB Group control everything from hatcheries and feed production to the marketing of the finished product.  

 The article highlights the success stories of farmers like Raghuvendra Verma and Digeshwar Sinha, who benefit from these integrated systems. While each farmer's approach differs, both demonstrate how these models offer a path to profit for even smallholders.  

The article also explores the future of the Indian chicken industry, emphasizing the need for greater forward integration, such as branded sales of chicken products, as a way to fully realize the potential of this sector.</description>

			<description>The Opposition is demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate allegations against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, while the BJP has rejected the demand. 

A JPC is a parliamentary body comprising members from both houses of Parliament, formed to investigate a specific matter. It can examine documents and officials of concerned institutions.

The government is not obligated to implement JPC recommendations, but must report on the follow-up action taken.  Previous JPCs have investigated cases like the 2G spectrum scam, the Ketan Parekh share market scam, and the Harshad Mehta securities scandal.</description>

			<description>Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd), Pakistan's former Director General of the ISI, is facing court martial proceedings on charges of corruption during and after his service. 

The proceedings stem from allegations made by the owner of a real estate company, Moeez Ahmed Khan, who accused Hameed and associates of extortion in 2017.  

The Supreme Court of Pakistan had directed an inquiry following the allegations, which the Army conducted, ultimately leading to the court martial. Hameed, considered close to former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has been placed under arrest in an army officers' mess.</description>

			<title>What is Bangladesh’s St Martin’s Island, under spotlight after Sheikh Hasina’s resignation?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-st-martin-island-9511920/</link>
			<description>Sajeeb Wazed, son of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, refuted a fabricated news report claiming Hasina had allegedly stated she could have remained in power if she had ceded St. Martin's Island and the Bay of Bengal to the United States. Wazed clarified that the statement was a distortion of a 2023 speech where Hasina accused the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of wanting to sell the island. Hasina did not mention any specific country in her speech. 


St. Martin's Island, Bangladesh's only coral island, is a popular tourist destination and a breeding ground for sea turtles.  Its history dates back thousands of years, with early settlements by Arab merchants. The island was annexed by British India in 1900 and  became part of Bangladesh after the 1971 Liberation War.</description>

			<title>Why the withdrawal of the draft Broadcast Bill raises more questions than it answers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/withdrawal-draft-broadcast-bill-more-questions-explained-9511684/</link>
			<description>The Indian government withdrew a draft broadcast bill that sparked controversy due to concerns about increased control over online content.  The draft, circulated privately, proposed regulating independent creators on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and X,  raising fears of government overreach.  

The government cited differing opinions within its bureaucracy about the Bill's scope as a reason for its withdrawal. They announced consultations on a previous version of the bill, released in 2023, while omitting mention of the  withdrawn 2024 draft. 

This has caused confusion among stakeholders as the 2024 draft  significantly expanded the Bill's remit to include social media accounts and online video creators, requiring prior registration and adherence to program codes. Large tech companies and independent content creators voiced concerns about the 2024 draft, prompting the government's  decision to withdraw it and revert to public consultations on the 2023 version.</description>

			<description>One of the 33 crest gates at the Tungabhadra dam in Karnataka was washed away on August 10, 2024, due to high water flow. The gate's chain link broke, leading to it being swept away by the force of the water. Repairs are contingent on reducing the reservoir water level by 60-65%, a process that is expected to take some time.  This situation has raised concerns among both upstream and downstream communities regarding irrigation and potential flooding. Heavy rains could exacerbate the situation. The water level is currently dropping, and the Tungabhadra Board plans to expedite the repair process.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/history-of-keralas-jewish-communities-who-are-paradesi-jew-indias-jewish-population-9510422/</link>
			<description>Queenie Hallegua, the last woman of Kerala's Paradesi Jewish community, passed away recently, leaving her nephew Keith as the last remaining member of that group in Kerala.  Kerala has two main Jewish communities: the Malabar Jews, whose history dates back nearly 3,000 years, and the Paradesi Jews, who arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries from the Iberian Peninsula. The Paradesi Jews largely integrated into Malayalam culture, but eventually separated from the older Malabar Jews.  

In the mid-20th century, Kerala Jews began migrating to Israel, leaving only 14 Malabar Jews and one Paradesi Jew in Kerala today.  The community's decline is evidenced by the state's remaining "Jew Streets" and synagogues, now mostly empty relics of a vibrant past.</description>

			<description>Hindenburg Research has accused Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch of having stakes in offshore funds allegedly used in the Adani money siphoning scandal. Hindenburg claims these funds were linked to Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani. 

The Buchs deny the allegations, stating their investment in the offshore funds predates Madhabi's appointment at Sebi. They claim it was based on the expertise of the fund's Chief Investment Officer, a childhood friend of Dhaval. Sebi defends Buch, emphasizing her disclosures and recusals in potential conflict-of-interest situations. 

Hindenburg also raises concerns about Sebi's inaction against other suspect Adani shareholders. Sebi, however, highlights the extensive probe conducted in the Hindenburg matter, including communication with various regulators and examination of numerous documents.</description>

			<title>Why Ukraine has carried out incursion into Russia’s Kursk region</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukraine-russia-kursk-9510172/</link>
			<description>Ukraine launched a surprise attack on August 6th, advancing approximately 30 kilometers into Russia's Kursk region.  This marks Kyiv's largest incursion into Russian territory since the war began in 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the attack aims to "restore justice" and "push the war into the aggressor's territory." While details remain unclear, experts believe the incursion may serve multiple purposes, including strengthening Ukraine's negotiation position, potentially seizing the Kursk nuclear power plant, and diverting Russian troops from the east.  The success of the operation, however, remains uncertain, as maintaining control of captured territory would require significant resources.  Ukraine's eastern defensive operations could be impacted depending on the success or failure of the incursion.</description>

			<title>Hindenburg alleges impropriety by Sebi chief: what conflict-of-interest rules apply to market regulators in US and UK?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/hindenburg-sebi-madhabi-buch-9510138/</link>
			<description>Hindenburg Research accused Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of India’s Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), of conflict of interest, linking her to allegations against the Adani Group. The report claims Buch's husband may have used funds linked to the Adani Group, raising concerns about Sebi's impartiality in investigating the conglomerate. 

The Indian government has declined to comment, leaving questions about whether Buch disclosed potential conflicts and recused herself from relevant investigations. 

In contrast, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have strict ethical codes to prevent conflicts of interest. These codes require employees to disclose financial interests, avoid participating in matters where they have a direct or indirect interest, and pre-approve securities transactions. Violations can lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal.</description>

			<title>Hindenburg’s new allegations: How SEBI board is supposed to address conflicts of interest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sebi-board-conflicts-of-interest-9509841/</link>
			<description>Hindenburg Research recently accused SEBI chairperson Madhavi Puri Buch of having stakes in offshore entities linked to the Adani Group money laundering scandal.  Buch and her husband refuted these claims, stating that the investment in question predated her SEBI appointment and that all necessary disclosures and recusal measures were followed.  

SEBI's 'Code on Conflict of Interests for Members of Board' mandates board members to disclose personal interests and associations that could influence board decisions. This includes financial holdings, substantial transactions,  and relationships with regulated entities.  Board members are prohibited from holding other profit-bearing positions and from accepting gifts from regulated entities. Furthermore, they are required to recuse themselves from matters where a conflict of interest exists.  The code emphasizes confidentiality, although disclosures can be made under certain circumstances, including  suspicions of conflict of interest raised by the public.  A dedicated secretary manages these disclosures, ensuring transparency and accountability.</description>

			<title>How Centre’s Clean Plant Programme plans to boost India’s production of fruits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-centres-clean-plant-programme-plans-to-boost-production-of-fruits-9508509/</link>
			<description>The Clean Plant Programme (CPP) has been approved by the Indian Union Cabinet to boost horticulture crop yields and quality. The program aims to provide farmers with virus-free planting material through the establishment of nine Clean Plant Centers, infrastructure development for nursery expansion, and a regulatory system for certification and traceability. 

The need for the CPP stems from India's position as a major fruit and vegetable producer and importer, with rising demand for high-quality planting material. The program will streamline the import process and offer farmers access to disease-free planting material, contributing to increased productivity.</description>

			<title>NASA’s Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore could be stuck in Space till 2025: What happens now?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-stuck-space-2025-9508520/</link>
			<description>Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are facing an extended stay on the International Space Station (ISS) due to technical issues with their Starliner spacecraft.  Initially planned to return after a week, their departure date is now uncertain, potentially pushing back to February 2025.  While not in danger, the extended stay presents health challenges common to long-duration spaceflights, including bone density reduction and vision issues. 

The ISS can accommodate them, as it regularly hosts seven astronauts and has room for more during crew changes and visits.  Williams and Wilmore have experience in prolonged space stays, each having spent significant time aboard the station previously.  NASA is studying the long-term effects of space travel and encourages astronauts to participate in these experiments, contributing to our understanding of human adaptation to space environments.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-olympics-medals-gold-cpc-9508413/</link>
			<description>The People's Republic of China's participation in the Olympics began in 1984, coinciding with economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping.  The government's focus on sports, aimed at national rejuvenation and a positive global image, saw successful medal hauls but also raised concerns about athlete pressure and state-sanctioned doping. 

China's hosting of the 2008 and 2022 Olympics was seen as a strategic move to enhance its international standing. However, the more restrictive atmosphere during the 2022 Games highlighted concerns about growing authoritarianism in China.</description>

			<title>After breaking free, why the world’s largest iceberg is stuck spinning in circles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/a23a-largest-iceberg-antartica-9508012/</link>
			<description>For over 30 years, the world's largest iceberg, A23a, was trapped in the Antarctic. After breaking free in 2020, it began drifting northward. However, A23a  became caught in a vortex over a seamount, spinning slowly but steadily. 

This unusual occurrence is attributed to a Taylor column, a current that forms around seamounts, causing a stagnant cylinder of rotating water. While the exact duration of A23a's rotation is unknown, experts believe it could remain in the vortex for an extended period. Though the iceberg won't contribute to sea level rise, its prolonged presence may impact marine life in the area.</description>

			<title>How a knife attack triggered a wave of far-right protests across the UK</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-riots-asylum-immigration-protests-9507777/</link>
			<description>Following a knife attack in Southport that killed three young girls, the UK experienced widespread violence and riots, described as the worst in over a decade. The perpetrator, a British citizen born to Rwandan parents, was charged with murder and attempted murder. However, social media was flooded with misinformation falsely claiming that the suspect was an asylum seeker and "radical Muslim migrant."

This led to far-right groups and individuals exploiting the tragedy to incite anti-immigration and racist sentiments, culminating in attacks on mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers. Despite the perpetrator's identity being revealed, the spread of misinformation fueled extremist reactions, highlighting the UK's growing anti-immigration sentiment heightened by political rhetoric and perceived societal issues.</description>

			<title>Why Odisha is facing a potato crisis, with prices as high as Rs 60 per kg</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-potato-crisis-price-rise-9507693/</link>
			<description>Odisha is facing a severe potato shortage due to a ban imposed by the West Bengal government, its primary supplier. The ban, aimed at stabilizing prices in West Bengal, has led to a surge in potato prices in Odisha to Rs 55-60/kg. Odisha heavily relies on imports, as its own production falls significantly short of demand.  A previous mission to make Odisha self-sufficient in potato production failed due to inadequate cold storage and market linkages. 

To address the current crisis, Odisha is procuring potatoes from Uttar Pradesh and has initiated sales at subsidized rates through government shops. The state government has also appealed to West Bengal to lift the ban.</description>

			<title>Japan issues its first-ever ‘megaquake advisory’: What does it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/japan-megaquake-advisory-9506703/</link>
			<description>Japan's meteorological agency issued its first-ever "megaquake advisory" following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake on August 8th. The advisory warns of a heightened likelihood of strong shaking and large tsunamis along the Nankai Trough, a subduction zone off Japan's southwest coast. 

While the advisory doesn't predict a specific earthquake, the Nankai Trough historically experiences large earthquakes every 100 to 150 years, often in pairs. The most recent pair occurred in 1944 and 1946. Experts fear the next tremor could be devastating, given that a magnitude 8-9 earthquake along this trough has a 70% probability of striking within the next 30 years. Such an event could impact a third of Japan and cause widespread economic damage.  The advisory urges residents to prepare for potential future warnings.</description>

			<title>What is behind Ukraine’s Kursk operation in Russia?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukraine-kursk-operation-russia-9506353/</link>
			<description>Ukrainian troops have advanced into Russian territory in the Kursk region, reportedly reaching a depth of 35 kilometers. 

While the extent of Ukrainian control remains unclear, experts believe this advance is strategically motivated.  Ukraine aims to gain territory, exert pressure on Russia in potential peace negotiations, create a buffer zone for Ukrainian residents, and weaken the Russian military by diverting troops to the border. 

The operation, potentially planned for months and supported by Western military aid, carries risks for Ukraine, including potential troop losses.  However, it also presents a political victory, demonstrating Ukrainian strength and pressuring Russian leadership.  The duration of the operation depends on Western support and Russia's ability to counter. Notably, the incursion occurred near a vital gas transit station, though Russia's gas exports to Europe have declined since the war's outset.</description>

			<title>Ocean temperatures in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef now hottest in 400 years: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ocean-temperatures-australia-great-barrier-reef-9506296/</link>
			<description>A new study reveals that water temperatures surrounding Australia's Great Barrier Reef have reached their highest level in 400 years over the past decade. This alarming warming trend, linked to human-induced climate change, is severely threatening the world's largest coral reef. 

The researchers analyzed coral cores, dating back to 1618, and combined this data with historical records to track ocean temperature changes.  Their findings show a stable temperature for centuries until the 20th century, when human activity began to significantly impact the ocean's warmth. This unprecedented warming has led to five mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef since 2016, putting the reef at grave risk.</description>

			<title>Why are Rajasthan’s sanitation workers protesting?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-sanitation-workers-in-rajasthan-are-protesting-9506252/</link>
			<description>The Rajasthan government's decision to recruit 24,000 sanitation workers has sparked protests from existing Valmiki sanitation workers.  They demand preference in the recruitment, arguing that workers from other communities often sub-let sanitation work to Valmiki workers, increasing their burden. Traditionally,  Valmiki community members were hired directly as sanitation workers. However, recent recruitment processes have included other communities, leading to the appointment of non-Valmiki sanitation workers for the first time.  After the government issued a corrigendum to prioritize experience in municipal sanitation work, non-Valmiki workers challenged it in court, leading to the High Court's order to recruit as per existing rules.  The government has halted the process and is working on amending the rules to ensure Valmiki worker preference.</description>

			<title>Explained: The US antitrust ruling against Google and its implications for India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/us-antitrust-ruling-against-google-and-its-implications-for-india-9505459/</link>
			<description>A US court ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by leveraging its position as the default search engine on smartphones and browsers to maintain a monopoly. The judge cited Google's "default distribution" as a significant advantage, as most users stick to the pre-set search engine.  While the ruling specifically addresses the US market, it raises questions about Google's practices in other countries, including India.  The Indian Competition Commission has already penalized Google for similar practices and forced it to allow users to choose default search engines.  The outcome of the US case could influence ongoing litigation in India and the implementation of India's new Competition Bill, which aims to regulate anti-competitive practices by large tech companies.</description>

			<title>From pioneering microfinance to heading Bangladesh’s interim govt: Story of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus</title>

			<description>Muhammad Yunus, known as the "father of microfinance," recently took oath as Chief Adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh. His journey from academia to social activism began after witnessing the poverty and hunger in Bangladesh following its independence in 1971. He developed the Grameen Bank model, which provides collateral-free microloans to the poor, predominantly women, empowering them to overcome economic challenges. 

Grameen Bank, launched in 1976, has grown significantly, serving millions of people and dispersing billions in loans. Yunus's advocacy for social businesses has gained international recognition, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. However, he faced political opposition from then-PM Sheikh Hasina, who accused him of various wrongdoings and launched numerous legal cases against him.  With Hasina's removal from power, Yunus now leads the interim government, facing the daunting task of rebuilding national unity and addressing the complex issues that led to the recent political turmoil.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Manish Sisodia, the former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister, citing the prolonged delay in trial and pre-trial incarceration as grounds to bypass stringent bail conditions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 

The court emphasized that the constitutional right to a speedy trial supersedes the PMLA's strict bail requirements, especially when the trial's conclusion is unlikely in the near future. Although the court acknowledged the prior rejection of Sisodia's bail application, it focused on the exceptional circumstances presented by the inordinate delay in the trial process.</description>

			<description>An interim government has been established in Bangladesh following weeks of violent protests.  Mohammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate economist, is the Chief Advisor, a role similar to Prime Minister.  The government was formed after the  flight of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday. Yunus' selection was a result of negotiations between military leaders, the President, and student protesters. At least 300 people have died during the demonstrations, which began with students demanding changes to a quota system for public jobs but escalated into wider opposition to Hasina's government.</description>

			<title>Most tree planting campaigns fail. What has to change?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/most-tree-planting-campaigns-9504990/</link>
			<description>Many tree planting campaigns fail to deliver on their climate change mitigation goals. 

Reasons for failure include planting the wrong tree species in unsuitable locations, inadequate post-planting care and a lack of long-term monitoring. 

Successful campaigns, such as the Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project in China, prioritize native species, drought-resistance, and local climate conditions.  

Involving local communities in planting and care is crucial for long-term success. Focusing on planting a smaller number of trees that are more likely to thrive is also more effective than large-scale plantings with high mortality rates.</description>

			<title>Why silica dust could become the ‘new asbestos’ health risk</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/silica-dust-asbestos-health-risk-silicosis-9504526/</link>
			<description>Researchers recommend lowering the daily exposure limit to silica dust in various industries to 0.05 mg/m3 from the current 0.1 mg/m3. This change is expected to save an estimated 13,000 lives globally by reducing the risk of silicosis, a potentially fatal lung disease.  

The study, published in the British Medical Journal Thorax, highlights a need for more data on silicosis risks, especially in developing countries.  Silicosis is caused by inhaling silica dust found in materials like concrete, sand, and granite, and it can take years to develop. 

The researchers found that halving silica dust exposure over a 40-year working lifetime could reduce silicosis cases by 77%. They suggest implementing stricter workplace safety measures like water suppression, improved ventilation, and personal protective equipment to mitigate silica dust exposure.</description>

			<description>Manish Sisodia, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, has been granted bail by the Supreme Court in the Delhi excise policy case. The court noted that Sisodia had spent approximately 17 months in jail without trial, violating his right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution. While acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations, the court emphasized that bail is the rule and jail is the exception, particularly in cases where the accused has deep roots in the country and is not a flight risk.  
 
The court also noted the delays in the trial and the reversed burden of proof under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, prompting the release of Sisodia on bail with certain conditions, such as surrendering his passport and reporting to the police regularly.</description>

			<title>What’s causing Antarctica’s deep-winter heatwave, what could be its fallout?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/whats-causing-antarcticas-deep-winter-heatwave-what-could-be-its-fallout-9503603/</link>
			<description>Antarctica is experiencing a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures 10 degrees Celsius higher than average since mid-July.  The primary cause is the weakening of the polar vortex, a band of cold air that usually keeps Antarctica frigid. This weakening, caused by large-scale atmospheric waves, allowed warmer air to enter the region. 
 
  Reduced Antarctic sea ice is also likely contributing to the higher temperatures.  Sea ice reflects sunlight and acts as a barrier between cold air and warmer water, helping to regulate temperatures. A smaller sea ice extent could lead to warmer air temperatures.  These extreme temperatures are a significant concern as they contribute to melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, which could raise global sea levels and disrupt the global ocean circulation system.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/proposed-changes-to-waqf-law-9503596/</link>
			<description>The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, seeks to significantly alter India's existing Waqf law. Key changes include shifting power from Muslim-run Boards and Tribunals to state governments, clarifying the definition of Waqf property, and giving the central government power to audit Waqfs. 

The Bill aims to address concerns about government land being mistakenly designated as Waqf, and proposes changes to how a property is deemed to be Waqf property, potentially impacting mosques and graveyards.  It also allows for non-Muslim representation on Waqf Boards and under CEO positions. These proposed changes have been met with criticism from Opposition parties who view them as "unconstitutional," "anti-minority," and "divisive."</description>

			<title>Sheikh Hasina in India amid UK asylum roadblock: What is India’s policy on refugees?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sheikh-hasina-refugee-india-policy-bangladesh-9503287/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, is currently in India. Originally planning to seek asylum in the UK, she encountered difficulties due to visa restrictions and immigration rules.  India, while lacking a formal refugee policy, is allowing her to stay. This situation highlights India's inconsistent approach to refugees, exemplified by the Rohingya crisis. Although India offers refuge to some, like Tibetans and Chakmas, it has treated the Rohingya as illegal immigrants, leading to calls for deportation. This stance contradicts India's international commitments to protect refugees, raising concerns about the principle of non-refoulement. 

India's approach to refugees varies depending on the country of origin.  For instance, Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are allowed to live in Tamil Nadu with certain rights, while the Rohingya face a precarious situation. This underscores the need for a clear and consistent refugee policy in India.</description>

			<title>An expert explains | View from China on Kamala Harris replacing Biden, the possibility of Trump 2.0</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-china-kamala-trump-us-elections-9502625/</link>
			<description>Unexpected twists in the US presidential race have led to significant uncertainty and analysis within China's strategic affairs community. The withdrawal of Biden from the race and Kamala Harris' emergence as the Democratic frontrunner have prompted discussions about China's potential strategies under a potentially renewed Trump presidency or a Harris administration. 

Expert opinions diverge regarding the implications of each candidate. While some view both as detrimental to US-China relations, others believe Harris' potential inexperience could present opportunities for China. However, concerns remain about the potential for increased anti-China policies under both candidates.  Chinese online discussions reflect these tensions, highlighting the significance of the US elections for China's strategic planning and demonstrating deep-seated ideological divisions within the country's intellectual circles.</description>

			<title>Paris Olympics: Why Vinesh Phogat failed the weigh-in before the wrestling final</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/why-vinesh-failed-weigh-in-9502382/</link>
			<description>India's Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from her scheduled gold medal bout at the Paris Olympics after failing to make the weight limit on Wednesday morning. Despite clearing the weigh-in the previous day, she was found to be "a few grams over 50 kg" 

Weight cutting is common in combat sports, but it can be detrimental to an athlete's health and performance.  Vinesh had cut significant weight prior to the first weigh-in but regained some of it during the day, making the subsequent weigh-in a challenge. She ultimately failed to make the weight, resulting in her elimination from the competition. 

UWW President Nenad Lalovic emphasized the organization's desire for athletes to compete at their natural weight, citing concerns about the damaging effects of extreme weight cutting.</description>

			<title>Why has the RBI policy panel kept interest rates unchanged for the 9th time in a row?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-mpc-interest-rates-unchanged-reason-9502138/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained the repo rate at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive time, citing persistent food inflation as a concern. Despite this, the RBI has kept the GDP growth projection for FY2025 unchanged at 7.2% and the retail inflation forecast at 4.5%.  

The RBI Governor emphasized the importance of price stability and the committee's vigilance to prevent spillovers from food inflation. While headline inflation edged up in June, core inflation has moderated. However, food prices remain volatile, influenced by factors like the uneven monsoon and geopolitical uncertainties.  

Experts anticipate the RBI's first repo rate cut potentially in December 2024, contingent on favorable food inflation trends and absence of major shocks.  
The decision to hold the repo rate steady will likely keep EMIs unchanged, offering relief to borrowers with home and personal loans linked to external benchmark lending rates (EBLRs).  

Global monetary policy developments, particularly expectations of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, could also influence the RBI's future decisions.</description>

			<title>How Pyrocumulonimbus clouds are formed when wildfires spit storms, lightning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/pyrocumulonimbus-cloud-when-wildfires-spit-storms-lightning-9501605/</link>
			<description>Intense wildfires in North America have created pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which are thunderstorm clouds generated by extreme heat from the fires. These clouds can reach heights of 50,000 feet and produce lightning, posing a threat to starting new fires many kilometres away.  The frequency of these clouds has increased in recent years, with Canada alone recording 140 pyrocumulonimbus clouds in 2022, compared to an average of 50 per year. Scientists believe climate change may be contributing to the rise in these dangerous fire-generated clouds.</description>

			<title>Who is Namal Rajapaksa, Mahinda’s son who could be Sri Lanka’s next president?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-is-namal-rajapaksa-mahindas-son-who-could-be-sri-lankas-next-president-9501142/</link>
			<description>Namal Rajapaksa, son of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, will contest the upcoming presidential election in September. This election follows the 2022 uprising that forced his uncle, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, from power. Namal's candidacy presents both hope and scepticism. While some see him as a fresh face, others recall the controversies surrounding the Rajapaksa family during their previous time in power. 

Namal has attempted to distance himself from cultural extremism while emphasizing cultural identity, and has focused on expanding his party's influence beyond its traditional strongholds, particularly engaging with the Tamil community. His family legacy is a double-edged sword, offering both the popularity gained from ending the civil war and criticism related to economic mismanagement and human rights allegations.  The election takes place amidst a difficult economic climate, with the winning candidate facing the task of steering Sri Lanka towards recovery.</description>

			<title>Vinesh Olympics disqualification: What is weight cutting, and why is it controversial?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/vinesh-olympics-disqualification-what-is-weight-cutting-and-why-is-it-controversial-9500983/</link>
			<description>The article discusses weight cutting practices in combat sports, particularly highlighting the disqualification of wrestler Vinesh Phogat due to exceeding the weight limit. 

Weight cutting involves athletes rapidly reducing their weight to meet weight class requirements, often by dehydrating themselves. While some athletes believe this gives them a competitive edge, it poses significant health risks like cardiovascular problems, brain injury, and hormonal imbalances.

The article explores the dangers associated with weight cutting, citing cases of athletes experiencing severe health complications and even death. It also discusses the debate surrounding a potential ban on weight cutting, with some advocating for safer weight management strategies while others emphasize the need for complete prohibition due to the inherent risks.

Finally, the article mentions ONE Championship's successful implementation of a weight-cutting ban, which includes multiple weigh-ins and hydration testing, as a potential model for other organizations.</description>

			<title>How India views the situation in Bangladesh: Summary of EAM Jaishankar’s address to Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-india-view-bangladesh-jaishankar-parliament-address-9500894/</link>
			<description>In his first detailed statement on the Bangladesh crisis, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar emphasized the long-standing, bipartisan relationship between India and Bangladesh. He highlighted the tensions and polarization following the controversial January election, which he said fueled student protests that escalated into violence. Jaishankar revealed that India had privately urged the Hasina government to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue. He also disclosed conversations with opposition political parties in Bangladesh, aiming to ensure diverse voices were heard.

Jaishankar detailed the final days of the Hasina government, noting that her resignation came after a meeting with the Bangladesh Army and police leadership. He highlighted the critical role of the Army Chief in the unfolding situation.  

The minister assured Parliament that India's diplomatic missions were closely monitoring the situation and were in contact with the Indian community in Bangladesh. He also expressed concern for the safety of minorities, stating that the BSF was on high alert. Jaishankar concluded by calling for continued national consensus on handling this complex situation with a crucial neighboring country.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: Making sense of the political upheaval in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-9500517/</link>
			<description>Recently in Bangladesh,  long-serving Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following widespread student protests against quotas in government jobs. The protests, initially focused on economic inequality, escalated after police violence against demonstrators. The government's response, including Hasina's controversial remarks about protesters, fueled public anger and accusations of authoritarianism.

An interim government under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been established, with a focus on restoring order and public trust. 

While the future of Bangladesh's politics remains uncertain, the protests demonstrated the power of young voices and the complexities of the country's political landscape. The Awami League, Bangladesh's oldest political party, will likely remain influential, but it faces challenges rebuilding its image after its perceived missteps.</description>

			<title>Why has the draft Broadcast Services Bill 2024 raised concerns of freedom of speech?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-broadcast-draft-services-bill-freedom-speech-9500124/</link>
			<description>The Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has proposed new regulations for independent news creators on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. The Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024, expands the scope of the ministry's remit to include social media accounts and online video creators, requiring prior registration and content evaluation committees. These regulations define "digital news broadcasters" broadly, potentially encompassing individual creators who publish news and current affairs content systematically.  

The bill mandates that such creators inform the government about their operations and activities, along with details about their content evaluation committees. Non-compliance could result in hefty fines. 

The government cites the role of independent creators in the lead-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as a reason for these stricter regulations, aiming to establish "accountability" and a "level playing field" between mainstream press and independent creators.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court to review PMLA verdict: what is the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-supreme-court-review-pmla-verdict-9500075/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has delayed its review of a previous decision upholding key provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The original ruling, in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India,  favored the government's stance on several points, including bail provisions that place the burden of proof on the accused and the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) investigative powers. A review petition, filed by Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, argues that the earlier decision contained errors and needs reconsideration.  The Supreme Court rarely grants review petitions, typically only addressing "grave errors" that resulted in miscarriages of justice.</description>

			<title>In water-starved Punjab, why plans for a new irrigation canal have raised concerns</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-water-starved-punjab-plans-for-a-new-irrigation-canal-raise-several-concerns-9499220/</link>
			<description>Punjab aims to construct the 149.53-km Malwa Canal, a new irrigation channel costing Rs 2,300 crore.  The canal will originate at Harike Headworks and irrigate 2 lakh acres across seven districts. The project aims to address water scarcity in the Malwa region, particularly during the paddy sowing season.  

It seeks to provide supplemental water to the left side of the Rajasthan Feeder canal and alleviate the burden on the existing Sirhind Feeder canal, which often requires rotational operation. The canal is expected to benefit 28 villages in Ferozepur, 10 in Faridkot, and 24 in Muktsar. 

However, funding constraints and technical concerns regarding the canal's viability have been raised by experts. Land acquisition, environmental clearances, and water availability remain significant challenges for the project.</description>

			<description>The Disaster Management Act, 2005, is being amended to improve operational efficiency in disaster response. The amendment expands the role of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and mandates the creation of state-level disaster relief forces.

It also designates the National Crisis Management Committee as the nodal body for national emergencies and disasters. The NDMA will be responsible for creating national disaster databases and recommending guidelines for relief and compensation. The amendment clarifies that man-made disasters exclude law-and-order situations. Despite these changes, concerns remain regarding the NDMA's lack of institutional strengthening and the continued vacancy of the vice-Chairperson position.</description>

			<title>Explained: The debate over GST on health insurance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goods-and-services-tax-gst-on-health-insurance-gst-withdrawal-life-insurance-rahul-mamata-9499214/</link>
			<description>Opposition parties are demanding the withdrawal of GST on health and life insurance premiums, citing the impact of increased premiums on the affordability of insurance for the general population. 

They argue that the 18% GST, coupled with rising medical inflation, is making it difficult for people to access essential insurance coverage.  The government acknowledges the representations received but maintains that GST rates are determined by the GST Council.

Insurance companies cite rising costs and medical inflation as reasons for the premium hikes. While some experts are skeptical about whether reducing GST will benefit policyholders, the Confederation of General Insurance Agents’ Associations of India and industry CEOs have called for a reduction in the GST rate to make insurance more affordable and accessible.  India's insurance penetration remains low, highlighting the need for measures to encourage wider coverage.</description>

			<description>Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election.  Walz, known for his progressive policies and moderate appeal, is seen as a strong counterpoint to Republican VP candidate JD Vance. 

His background as a teacher, veteran, and small-town leader resonates with the values Harris seeks to emphasize. Walz's record in Minnesota, including championing abortion rights and common-sense gun control, aligns with the Democratic platform. His selection is also seen as a strategic move to appeal to crucial swing states in the Midwest.</description>

			<title>Before Bangladesh and Sheikh Hasina, how leaders of Sri Lanka and Afghanistan fled amid turmoil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-south-asian-leaders-fled-turmoil-9498845/</link>
			<description>In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country amidst widespread protests triggered by a Supreme Court ruling on job reservations for descendants of freedom fighters. These protests, fueled by economic hardship, evolved into a movement against Hasina's authoritarian rule, leading to her departure and a military takeover of the country.  Sri Lanka faced a similar situation in 2022 when an economic crisis led to massive public protests.  President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government were forced to resign as protesters stormed government buildings. The country has since been attempting to recover and hold elections.  Afghanistan experienced a dramatic collapse in 2021 when the Taliban rapidly gained control of the country after the withdrawal of US and NATO forces.  President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan as the Taliban took over, leading to widespread chaos and uncertainty.</description>

			<description>Major stock markets globally plunged sharply, driven by a phenomenon known as the unwinding of the yen carry trade.  This trade involved borrowing yen at Japan's historically low interest rates and investing in higher-yielding assets in other countries.  The Bank of Japan's recent decision to raise interest rates has made this strategy less profitable, prompting investors to sell their holdings in foreign assets, leading to a decline in global markets.</description>

			<title>Why an Indian start-up lobby has filed an antitrust complaint against Google</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/cci-google-antitrust-9497744/</link>
			<description>An Indian startup group has filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India against Google, alleging anti-competitive practices in online advertising. The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF) claims Google's dominance in online platforms and its 97% revenue reliance on advertising stifle competition and harm Indian businesses.  ADIF criticizes Google's ad-ranking system, trademark usage in keyword bidding, and self-preferencing of its own services. It also expresses concern about Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to phase out third-party cookies, potentially impacting non-Google advertising platforms.  This complaint comes amidst India's ongoing discussion of a comprehensive digital competition law that could significantly impact large tech companies like Google.</description>

			<title>How Sheikh Hasina’s ouster may impact India-Bangladesh trade ties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sheikh-hasina-exit-bangladesh-protests-india-bangladesh-infra-links-9497111/</link>
			<description>The relationship between India and Bangladesh has strengthened significantly since Sheikh Hasina came to power in 2009. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in the subcontinent, and India is Bangladesh's second largest partner in Asia.  Bilateral trade reached $13 billion in the financial year 2023-24. Both countries are discussing a potential free trade agreement (FTA) which could dramatically increase trade.

India has also invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, including rail and port development.  This has improved connectivity between the two countries and eased trade. Disruptions to this relationship could negatively impact trade,  investment, and India's access to its northeastern states.</description>

			<title>Explained: The 50-year-old relationship between India and Sheikh Hasina</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-the-50-year-old-relationship-between-india-and-sheikh-hasina-9497123/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, who secured India's trust after her father's assassination in 1975, faced challenges to her legitimacy but received steadfast support from India.  Her government prioritized stability and economic growth, collaborating with India on issues like maritime boundaries, security, and infrastructure.  However, her crackdown on opposition groups raised concerns, and as she exits power, India faces the task of navigating a potentially volatile political landscape in Bangladesh, balancing its security interests with the need to foster democratic values. The relationship between India and Bangladesh's new leadership will be crucial in determining the future of the region.</description>

			<title>How India needs to deal with the new Bangladesh: 5 challenges beyond 1971</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/new-delhi-dhaka-challenges-9496876/</link>
			<description>The fall of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh poses significant challenges for India, forcing it to navigate complex geopolitical ramifications. India must balance its longstanding support for Hasina  with the need to engage with her opponents and prevent a widening rift. Delhi will face pressure from Pakistan and China to exploit the instability, requiring a concerted effort with international partners to ensure a peaceful transition. India must also move beyond romanticizing the 1971 liberation narrative and engage with diverse perspectives within Bangladesh.  Ultimately, India needs strategic patience and a commitment to transcending historical baggage to build enduring relations with the evolving landscape of Bangladesh.</description>

			<title>Why Hasina’s fall was not a surprise — and what India must prepare for now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hasina-bangladesh-india-9496783/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure from Bangladesh follows weeks of violent protests and a government refusal to meet the protesters' demands.  Hasina's alleged rigging of multiple elections, coupled with her autocratic rule characterized by arrests, disappearances, and crackdowns on dissent, led to widespread discontent. 

Economic woes, including a depreciating currency, depleted foreign reserves, and high inflation, further fueled the unrest.  The protests that ultimately forced her out stemmed from a Supreme Court ruling reinstating a quota system for government jobs that favored descendants of freedom fighters. 

Hasina's legacy is complex: while she promoted secularism and modernization, her harsh tactics alienated opposition groups and potentially empowered Islamist and anti-Hindu sentiments.  India now faces a diplomatic challenge in navigating this shift in Bangladesh's leadership.</description>

			<title>Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, Jamaat-e-Islami: What to know about 5 key figures in Bangladesh politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sheikh-hasina-jamaat-awami-bnp-bangladesh-9496706/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India following widespread protests against her government. The demonstrations, sparked by student opposition to expanded government job quotas for descendants of freedom fighters, represent a broader discontent with Hasina's 15-year rule. Many opposition parties, including Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the recent January elections. 

Hasina, the leader of the Awami League and daughter of Bangladesh's "Father of the Nation," Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has maintained a strong relationship with India and overseen Bangladesh's economic growth. However, her rule has been criticized by some international actors for political crackdowns and alleged election irregularities. 

The BNP, once a formidable force in Bangladesh politics, has seen a decline in popularity and faced internal turmoil led by Khaleda Zia, who has been convicted of corruption charges. The Jamaat-e-Islami, a banned Islamist party, has been accused of fueling the protests and exploiting the situation.</description>

			<title>From killing Mujib in 1975 to ‘taking responsibility’ in 2024: the role of the army in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/role-of-army-in-bangladesh-9496610/</link>
			<description>Following widespread protests fueled by  government job quotas, Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country.  Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the formation of an interim government, assuming responsibility and urging calm.   

Protesters attacked the statue of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, symbolizing the simmering tension between civil and military power. This marked a significant moment given the army's historical involvement in Bangladesh's politics.  The Bangladesh Liberation War saw the army directly involved in the fight for independence from Pakistan,  and subsequent coups in 1975 and beyond cemented the military's role.  The historical pattern demonstrates the army's influence in shaping Bangladesh's political landscape, wielding power both during and after periods of civilian rule.</description>

			<title>As Sheikh Hasina flees, what does it mean for India? Six preliminary takeaways from Bangladesh’s crisis</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-coup-protests-9496240/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned, moving to India. This follows a month of large-scale protests over the country's job quota system, escalating a situation that had seen Hasina's popularity decline after years of economic growth and a crackdown on opposition groups, media, and civil society. The Bangladesh Army will form an interim government with political party support. 

Hasina's departure, following a 17-year tenure, creates uncertainty for India, which had a close partnership with her on counter-terrorism and development initiatives. India's continued support for Hasina, despite concerns about democracy in Bangladesh, has been a point of contention with Western nations.  

The new situation in Bangladesh raises questions about the future direction of India-Bangladesh relations, particularly given the history of instability under opposition rule. The role of the Bangladeshi Army Chief will be critical in shaping the country's future.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/markets-crash-sensex-nifty-reason-9496024/</link>
			<description>The Indian Sensex saw a significant drop of 2.5% on Monday, driven by global factors such as fears of a US recession, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and economic weakness in Japan. Experts reassured investors that this correction is not a reflection of India's economic fundamentals but rather a response to global uncertainties. They advised investors to remain calm and avoid panic-selling, recommending a cautious approach to investments and a focus on large-cap companies.  Market participants also cautioned against speculative trading in volatile times. While long-term investors are advised to hold their positions, experts suggest toning down return expectations for equity investments in the coming months.</description>

			<title>SC rules Delhi L-G can directly nominate Municipal Corporation ‘aldermen’: What was the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-mcd-delhi-lg-aldermen-9495832/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) has the power to appoint aldermen to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) without consulting the Delhi government's Council of Ministers.  The court based its decision on the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, which explicitly grants the L-G this authority.  

The case stemmed from the L-G's January 2023 nomination of 10 aldermen, which the Delhi government challenged in court, arguing that it required the L-G to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Supreme Court disagreed, citing its 2023 ruling that Parliament has the power to legislate on State List subjects, including local government, in the context of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. 


This ruling means the aldermen nomination was valid and the MCD can now proceed with its functions, including the formation of the Standing Committee, which requires alderman participation.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification: How CJI underlined substantive equality</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-cji-substantive-equality-9495522/</link>
			<description>In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court recognized the concept of “substantive equality” when it comes to reservations for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).  The court’s interpretation highlights the need to go beyond a formal understanding of equality and consider historical injustices and the diverse needs of different groups. 

The judgement traces the evolution of the court's stance on reservations, from an initial focus on equal opportunity to a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the need for affirmative action. It cites various rulings, including  M R Balaji v State of Mysore (1962), State of Kerala v. N M Thomas (1975), and   the Indra Sawhney judgment (1992).

The Court addressed the "efficiency" argument often used against reservations, emphasizing that securing minimum qualifying marks, rather than the highest, is sufficient to ensure efficient administration.  It ultimately concluded that reservation is not a concessionary exception to equality but a reflection of the Constitution's commitment to substantive equality.</description>

			<title>RBI policy: Why Monetary Policy Committee is likely to keep repo rate steady</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rbi-policy-monetary-policy-committee-repo-rate-steady-9495243/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee is predicted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent during its August meeting. This decision is attributed to concerns surrounding elevated food inflation, which could hinder the disinflation process.  

While headline inflation has edged up, experts anticipate it will gradually decline towards the RBI's 4 percent target in the third quarter.  However, risks remain, particularly from an uneven monsoon season potentially impacting food prices.

The RBI is expected to maintain its GDP growth forecast for FY25 at 7.2 percent.  Economic forecasts suggest a possible repo rate cut in late 2024 or early 2025, contingent on factors such as the monsoon's progress and global economic conditions.</description>

			<description>The recent landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, resulting in significant loss of life and displacement, prompted a swift response from the Indian Army. They deployed a Bailey bridge, a type of modular bridge invented during World War II, to provide access to the affected Mundakkai village. These pre-fabricated bridges are designed for rapid assembly, even in challenging conditions, and can be easily transported. Bailey bridges have proven invaluable in disaster relief and military operations worldwide, thanks to their speed of deployment and durability. The Indian Army has been utilizing Bailey bridges for decades, including in conflicts and during natural disasters.</description>

			<title>Are deep-sea metals a vital resource or an environmental disaster in the making?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/deep-sea-metals-vital-resource-environmental-disaster-9494429/</link>
			<description>Discussions at the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Jamaica regarding regulations for deep-sea mining have revealed deep divisions. While countries like China and Norway push for quick agreements to allow mining operations, others, including Germany, Brazil, and Palau, insist on thorough environmental impact assessments first. Many nations and environmental groups oppose deep-sea mining altogether, citing concerns about fragile marine ecosystems and the irreversible damage mining robots could inflict. 

Manganese nodules, rich in metals crucial for electric vehicles, are the primary target of mining companies. These nodules, found in vast quantities on the ocean floor, are home to thousands of unique species adapted to extreme deep-sea conditions.  Critics argue that the potential environmental and ecological costs far outweigh any economic benefits. Some experts suggest that the technology for deep-sea mining is not yet mature and the risks are significant. Major corporations are increasingly pledging to avoid using seafloor-extracted materials, citing ethical concerns and the potential for contamination.  The ISA is expected to finalize regulations by 2025.</description>

			<description>Ukraine recently sanctioned Russian oil company Lukoil, halting its pipeline crude oil deliveries to Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. These countries, heavily reliant on Russian oil, have protested and requested EU mediation. While the EU has worked to reduce its overall dependence on Russian oil and gas, it has allowed pipeline imports for certain members. The EU has particularly relied on pipeline gas from Russia, with some member states like Hungary increasing their reliance. However, Ukraine's transit contract for Russian gas is set to expire in December 2024, potentially leading to further escalation.</description>

			<description>US politics has been shaken up in July.  A potential assassination attempt on Donald Trump, his choice of younger Senator JD Vance as his running mate, President Biden's withdrawal from the race, and Vice President Kamala Harris stepping in as the Democratic nominee have made the upcoming election unpredictable.  
Trump's choice of Vance mirrors his own agenda, while Harris faces the decision of balancing her ticket or  doubling down on her own political stance.  Biden's withdrawal was prompted by concerns he would lose to Trump, and Harris has energized the Democratic party with her candidacy.  Her VP pick will be a key strategic decision, potentially impacting Indo-US relations, given India's interest in strengthening ties with the US.</description>

			<title>How a new tech promises to kill weeds in rice and wheat fields, remove need for stubble-burning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/kill-weeds-rice-wheat-fields-stubble-burning-9493286/</link>
			<description>New rice and wheat varieties offer a more sustainable approach to farming. Developed using traditional breeding methods, these crops tolerate a specific herbicide, Imazethapyr, allowing for weed control without the need for intensive water usage or tilling. Farmers can now use direct seeding techniques for rice, eliminating the need for flooded nurseries and transplanting, and zero-tillage for wheat, reducing the reliance on fallow land preparation. This shift towards herbicide-tolerant crops offers significant benefits in terms of water conservation, reduced fuel consumption, and diminished environmental impact.</description>

			<title>Russia-US prisoner exchange: How prisoners become pawns in international power politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/prisoners-international-power-politics-swaps-9493235/</link>
			<description>The recent prisoner swap between Russia and the West involved the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan, who had been convicted of espionage, in exchange for eight individuals, including a convicted hitman.  Prisoner swaps, governed by neither treaties nor a codified doctrine, are based on the  principle of sovereign equality and a negotiation of value between nations.  The price of a prisoner’s freedom can vary depending on factors such as their nationality, the public pressure on their home government, and the perceived value of the information they possess.  

Past examples, like the 1962 Powers-Abel exchange or the 2022 release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, highlight the complexities and potential consequences of these exchanges, often involving significant political and financial costs. The recent swap has drawn criticism for the differing profiles of those released, raising questions about the precedent it sets for future negotiations.</description>

			<title>What is special about the flying cauldron in the 2024 Olympics?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/paris-olympics-flying-cauldron-9492714/</link>
			<description>The Paris 2024 Olympic cauldron is a unique, moving design inspired by hot air balloons.  Created by Mathieu Lehanneur, it rises 30 meters above the ground in the evening, hovering above a metallic base. The cauldron, measuring seven meters in diameter, symbolizes fraternity and pays homage to the Montgolfier brothers who pioneered hot air balloons. Lit entirely by electricity with LED lights and misting nozzles, the cauldron is located at Jardin des Tuileries, the site of the Montgolfier's first hot air balloon launch. Visitors can freely access the cauldron.</description>

			<description>Rahul Gandhi's statement about a potential raid by the Enforcement Directorate stemmed from his Parliament speech criticizing the Budget. He compared the government's policies to the Kauravas' "chakravyuh" formation in the Mahabharata, entrapping India's people.

In the epic, the chakravyuh was a formidable military formation that only a select few, like Abhimanyu, knew how to penetrate. Abhimanyu, though skilled, only knew the entrance strategy and not the exit, ultimately falling prey to the Kauravas trapped within.</description>

			<title>Paris Olympics: In Imane Khelif vs Angela Carini boxing controversy, why issue of gender took centre stage</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/explained-the-gender-issue-in-the-imane-khelif-vs-angela-carini-boxing-match-controversy-9491846/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's victory at the Paris Olympics. After defeating Italy's Angela Carini, Khelif faced online abuse, accused of being a man competing unfairly. 

This incident highlights the ongoing debate about transgender women and athletes with certain biological characteristics competing in women's sports. The issue centers around testosterone levels and potential advantages.  While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allows athletes to compete based on their passport gender, the International Boxing Association (IBA) previously banned Khelif and another boxer based on "gender eligibility" tests. 

The article explores different perspectives on the matter, including arguments for inclusion and fairness. It also examines the IOC's evolving stance on transgender athletes and the varying regulations across different sports federations. The debate remains complex, with uncertainties regarding testosterone's precise impact on athletic performance.</description>

			<title>What is the potential fallout of Israel’s killing of senior Hamas, Hezbollah leaders?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-senior-hamas-hezbollah-leaders-9491777/</link>
			<description>Israel has assassinated three key leaders of militant groups: Fuad Shukr of Hezbollah, Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas, and Mohammed Deif, also of Hamas. These strikes are seen as a major victory for Israel in retaliation for the October 7 attacks by Hamas. 

Targeting these leaders, particularly Haniyeh in Tehran and Shukr in Beirut, sends a strong message to Iran and its proxies, raising the risk of a wider conflict.  

Iran, vowing revenge, could retaliate through attacks on Israeli targets, coordination with its allies, or targeting Israeli officials abroad. These potential actions pose significant concerns for India, considering the presence of a large Indian diaspora in the region and its reliance on West Asian oil imports.


The situation has escalated significantly, jeopardizing efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza.  International efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation, but the outcome remains uncertain, hinging largely on Iran's response.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/olympics-boxing-imane-khalif-ban-9491555/</link>
			<description>Controversy surrounds two boxers, Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, who are competing at the Paris Olympics despite failing gender eligibility tests by the International Boxing Association (IBA). The IBA stated they didn't meet criteria based on tests conducted at World Championships. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), having derecognised the IBA, says the boxers are eligible under IOC rules which prioritize passport-stated gender. The IOC has defended their participation, but criticized the IBA's decision-making process.

Other sports have varying regulations. Athletics has testosterone limits for athletes with differences in sex development (DSD), while swimming and cycling have restrictions on transgender women competing in women's events.</description>

			<title>Apex court rules states can sub-classify SCs and STs for quota: Tribal and Dalit communities that may be affected</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sub-classify-sc-st-quota-9491254/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that Scheduled Castes can be sub-classified by states for reservation purposes.  This decision impacts various tribal and Dalit communities across India.

In Maharashtra, prominent SC communities include Mahar and Matang, while Gond and Bhil are significant tribal groups. Rajasthan has 59 SCs, with Meghwal being the largest, alongside influential Meena tribes and Bhil communities. Odisha's largest tribal group is Khond, followed by Santal and Gond, while Pan is the dominant SC community. 

Chhattisgarh has a significant Gond tribal population and a large SC community, primarily identified by several names like Bairwa and Raidas. Madhya Pradesh features a prominent SC group traditionally involved in leatherwork, and the Bhil and Gond are significant tribal communities. West Bengal's largest SC community is Rajbanshi, followed by Matua and Bagdi. Gujarat's Vankar and Rohit communities are prominent among SCs, while Bhil and Halpati are notable tribal groups. Assam's largest tribe is Bodo, followed by Karbi, while Tripura has 19 recognized tribal communities.  Uttarakhand has Harijan and Balmiki as the largest SC communities and Jaunsari and Tharu as the primary tribal groups.</description>

			<description>The Great Nicobar Island infrastructure project, a Rs 72,000 crore development encompassing an airport, a transshipment terminal, and a township, has faced legal challenges citing environmental concerns and potential harm to indigenous communities. Environmental activist Ashish Kothari and the Conservation Action Trust (CAT) challenged the project's clearances, arguing that it would damage biodiversity, inadequate environmental impact assessments and raise concerns about tribal communities. 

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) formed a high-powered committee to revisit the project's environmental clearance, particularly focusing on coral conservation and the port's location in a prohibited area. While the NGT acknowledged the need for development and national security, it also highlighted “unanswered deficiencies” related to the project's environmental impact.  Petitions are still pending before the NGT and Calcutta High Court regarding the project's legality and compliance with environmental regulations.</description>

			<title>Why the Odisha government will plant palm trees to combat lightning strikes</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/lightning-strikes-palm-trees-odisha-9490868/</link>
			<description>Odisha, grappling with high lightning strike fatalities, has approved a plan to plant 19 lakh palm trees as lightning conductors. The state has witnessed 3,790 deaths from lightning strikes in the last 11 years, with a significant increase in recent years. Palm trees are believed to absorb lightning due to their height and moisture content. However, experts have raised concerns about the efficacy of this plan, citing the time it takes for trees to reach maturity and the potential for fire hazards. They advocate for a data-driven, comprehensive strategy coupled with public awareness campaigns on lightning safety.  
 
  The state's early warning system, while helpful, faces limitations in accurately predicting lightning strikes.</description>

			<title>Sub-classification of SCs, STs: Could OBC model for ‘creamy layer’ be a blueprint?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/identifying-the-creamy-layer-model-of-obc-reservation-9489999/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has allowed for the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to implement separate quotas for those considered more backward. This follows the precedent set by the OBC reservation, which excludes a "creamy layer" of more advantaged individuals.

The Court suggests adapting the OBC creamy layer model, acknowledging that criteria for excluding this layer within SC and ST communities may differ.   Justice Pankaj Mithal hinted at using educational background as a potential criterion. The decision leaves it to states to determine if and how to implement this sub-classification for SC and ST communities.</description>

			<title>Explained: Supreme Court’s verdict on sub-classification of SCs and STs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-sub-classification-of-sc-st-9489996/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-classifications within the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) categories for reservation purposes. This overturns a previous 2004 ruling that viewed SC/ST as a homogenous group. 

The court, in a 6-1 decision, emphasized that while the Constitution recognizes SCs and STs collectively, it does not preclude states from addressing internal disparities within these groups.  States can create sub-quotas to provide wider protections to the most backward communities, but they must do so based on demonstrable need, empirical evidence, and a clear rationale.  The court stressed that representation, while numerical, should also be effective, meaning these communities should have opportunities for advancement to higher positions.  Justice Gavai, in a concurring opinion, advocated for a 'creamy layer' exception within SC/ST reservations, similar to the one in place for Other Backward Classes (OBCs).</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court allowed sub-classification within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes quotas, but with several safeguards. The court emphasized that the principle behind any sub-classification must be reasonable and rational, subject to judicial scrutiny. States cannot micro-classify in a way that undermines equality or replaces it with a "doctrine of classification." 

To justify sub-classification, states must show that the group receiving preferential treatment is inadequately represented compared to other castes within the listed category.  The court also warned against reserving 100% seats for one sub-class, excluding others. Justice Gavai, in his concurring opinion, suggested adopting a "creamy layer" framework for SC/ST quotas to ensure benefits reach those who genuinely need them.</description>

			<title>Russia releases Evan Gershkovich under prisoner swap deal: Why was the Wall Street Journal journalist arrested?</title>

			<description>Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on espionage charges, was released in a prisoner exchange. Gershkovich, who reported for various outlets from Moscow before joining the WSJ, was arrested in March 2023 while dining in Yekaterinburg. He denied the charges, and the trial was widely criticized by the West. Russian authorities accused him of gathering information on a tank-making company for the CIA. The exchange, which involved 24 individuals, was facilitated by Turkish intelligence. It is believed that the arrest was part of Russia's strategy to pressure Western countries into releasing Russian prisoners.  Russia may also release former US marine Paul Whelan in the deal.</description>

			<title>SUV driver gets bail in Delhi UPSC aspirants’ death case: What is the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/driver-upsc-aspirants-death-culpable-homicide-murder-9489509/</link>
			<description>A Delhi court granted bail to businessman Manoj Kathuria who was arrested in connection with the deaths of three UPSC aspirants at Rau’s IAS Study Circle. Kathuria was charged under Section 105 BNS (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) after his SUV allegedly drove through a flooded road, causing water to enter the center’s basement where the aspirants were trapped. 

The prosecution argued that Kathuria could have slowed down his vehicle, while the defense claimed he was driving within the speed limit. The Delhi Police later dropped the charge of culpable homicide against him, leading to the court granting bail. 
 
Culpable homicide not amounting to murder typically arises when man-made disasters or inactions result in deaths, and the accused is believed to have had knowledge of the potential consequences of their actions. Punishments can range from five years to life imprisonment. 




  Previous cases involving culpable homicide not amounting to murder include building collapses, railway accidents, and drunken driving incidents. The courts often emphasize the accused’s knowledge of potential harm in deciding the severity of the charge.</description>

			<description>After nearly 40 years, the Madhya Pradesh government will finally incinerate 337 MT of toxic waste from the Union Carbide facility in Bhopal. This decision comes after years of legal battles and public protests. The Supreme Court authorized the incineration in 2010, but the project faced numerous delays and challenges.  A 2022 CPCB report revealed high levels of harmful Dioxins and Furans were released during trial runs, raising concerns about public health. The incineration process, expected to cost Rs 126 crore, is scheduled to be completed in 180 days.</description>

			<description>Vietnam's new leadership, while expected to maintain the country's balancing act in foreign relations, may face challenges due to its limited experience in international diplomacy.  Concerns arise regarding potential escalation of human rights violations under the leadership of President To Lam, who is facing scrutiny for his alleged role in a 2017 kidnapping. This could lead to increased European criticism of Vietnam's human rights record, potentially triggering calls for targeted sanctions and trade pressure. Despite this, the EU is likely to proceed cautiously, given its strong economic ties with Vietnam, particularly in light of the country's rapid economic growth and its role as a production hub for businesses seeking alternatives to China.</description>

			<title>Why do landslides occur, and what triggered the tragedy in Wayanad?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-landslides-causes-wayanad-tragedy-9488385/</link>
			<description>Landslides are becoming increasingly common due to climate change, causing significant loss of life and property. India is particularly vulnerable, accounting for 8% of global landslide fatalities.  Recent landslides in Wayanad, Kerala, highlight the severity of the issue.  

A new India Landslide Susceptibility Map developed by IIT-Madras shows 13.17% of the country is prone to landslides, with Sikkim and Kerala being the most vulnerable.  Factors contributing to landslides include steep slopes, heavy rainfall, and human activities like deforestation and unsustainable land use. Research suggests that monocropping, replacing native trees with shallow-rooted crops, increases vulnerability. The recent Wayanad landslides were triggered by heavy rainfall following prolonged periods of high temperatures. This highlights the need for better understanding and mitigation strategies for landslides in a changing climate.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court allows sub-categorisation in Scheduled Caste reservation: What is the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-sub-categorisation-reservation-9488211/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing sub-categorization within scheduled castes, a decision that will have significant implications for reservations. 

The court acknowledged that Scheduled Castes are not a homogenous group and historical and empirical evidence supports the need for sub-categorization.  This ruling overturns a 2004 judgment which had previously prohibited sub-classification. 

The decision stems from a long-standing legal battle regarding the distribution of reservation benefits within Scheduled Castes. States argued that sub-classification is necessary to address the disparity in social and economic conditions among different sub-groups within the SC community. 


  The implications of this ruling extend to various states and communities, including the Balmiki and Mazhabi Sikh communities in Punjab, and the Madiga community in Andhra Pradesh.</description>

			<title>Was the recent Kathmandu plane crash caused by a ‘wing stall’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/was-the-recent-kathmandu-plane-crash-caused-by-a-wing-stall-9487656/</link>
			<description>A Bombardier CRJ200 crashed shortly after takeoff in Kathmandu, killing all passengers except the pilot. Video footage shows the aircraft banking steeply to the right before impact, possibly due to a wing stall. This resulted in an "unusual attitude," an aerodynamic situation where the plane's orientation deviates from normal flight patterns.  

A wing stall can lead to a rapid loss of lift and control, making recovery difficult, especially at low altitudes.  In this case, the pilot likely didn't have enough time and space to recover from the stall, given the aircraft's low altitude. Pushing the nose down, as is the standard recovery technique for a stall, would have resulted in a loss of altitude, further complicating the situation.</description>

			<description>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an airstrike in Tehran, with Hamas and Iran blaming Israel. Experts predict Iran might retaliate through its allies, forming the ‘axis of resistance’. This coalition, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, originated after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.  Iran, aiming to expand its influence in a Sunni-majority region, supports these non-state actors as a deterrent against Israel and the US.  The coalition's name is a response to former US President George W Bush's 'axis of evil' designation of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.</description>

			<description>The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran has significant implications for the region and the world. Considered a major victory for Israel in its ongoing campaign against Hamas, the killing is a grave act of escalation, particularly as it occurred on Iranian soil. 

This assassination will likely anger Hamas and Iran, potentially triggering retaliatory strikes. The event also puts pressure on Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who faces a difficult balancing act between hardliners demanding retribution and his own desire for diplomatic engagement with the West.  

For Israel, the assassination props up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership amid pressure over the hostage situation. The US, amidst its own elections, will also need to carefully assess its response. 

The wider Middle East is on high alert as this incident risks a broader conflict. India, concerned about regional stability and the safety of its citizens and its oil supply, is carefully analyzing the situation before formulating a response.</description>

			<title>Da Vinci’s Last Supper or a depiction of Greek god Dionysus? Why LGBTQ tableau in Paris has created a storm</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-9486927/</link>
			<description>The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics 2024 featured a tableau depicting a variety of performers, including drag queens, a transgender model, and a blue-painted singer. The tableau drew criticism from groups like the Catholic church and the far right who claimed it was a parody of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” and an insult to Christianity. 

Organizers denied the comparison, stating it was inspired by Greek god Dionysus and a pagan feast. They emphasized the performance’s message of embracing diversity and individual rights.  Others suggested the scene represented the Festival of Dionysus or artworks like Jan van Bijlert’s “The Feast of the Gods.”</description>

			<title>On the 85th death anniversary of Udham Singh, a look at Punjab govt’s promises to memorialise him</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/udham-singh-death-anniversary-punjab-9486932/</link>
			<description>Udham Singh, an Indian revolutionary who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer in revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, is an iconic figure in Punjab.  Singh's ancestral home has been converted into a museum and a memorial was built in his honor in Sunam.  
 
Despite various promises by political parties, several demands related to the commemoration of Singh remain unfulfilled. These include relocating his belongings, including urns containing his ashes and letters, to the memorial. Organizations also advocate for the return of his pistol from London and the awarding of the Bharat Ratna. While the current Punjab CM has expressed intentions to fulfill some of these demands, progress remains slow.</description>

			<title>8 key takeaways from Hamas chief’s assassination</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/8-hamas-chiefs-assassination-israel-9486625/</link>
			<description>Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran, Iran.  This event is considered a major escalation in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Israel views this as a victory in its efforts to neutralize Hamas leadership, while Hamas sees it as a severe provocation. 

The assassination complicates peace negotiations and puts pressure on Iran's new president to respond, potentially leading to further conflict. For Israel, the assassination may bolster Prime Minister Netanyahu's position, prolonging the war in Gaza. The incident also adds complexity to the US presidential campaign, particularly for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been critical of Netanyahu's policies.  The wider region is on high alert, with countries like Qatar, Turkey, and the Houthis condemning the assassination. Global impact is significant, given the region's importance for energy and the large number of expatriates living there.</description>

			<title>Israeli strikes: What is Hezbollah and why are fears over a new regional conflict being raised?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-strikes-hezbollah-hamas-9486423/</link>
			<description>Hezbollah confirmed the death of its senior commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Israel claimed Shukr was responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israeli civilians and troops. This comes days after a rocket attack in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 Israeli teenagers and children.  Israel considers Hezbollah responsible for the attack, and the death of Shukr is viewed as retaliation. 

Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has a significant arsenal and has been involved in clashes with Israel, most notably in the 2006 war. This latest incident fuels concerns about a wider escalation in the already tense Middle Eastern region.</description>

			<title>Why River Seine’s water quality poses a challenge for the Paris Olympics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/paris-olympics-triathlon-event-river-seines-water-quality-sewage-system-water-treatment-plants-9485616/</link>
			<description>Concerns over water quality in the River Seine have led to the postponement of the men's triathlon swimming leg at the Paris Olympics.  The Seine, historically polluted, faced a challenge from outdated sewage systems that overflow during heavy rains, releasing untreated wastewater and wildlife into the water.  High levels of E. coli, a bacteria originating from animal and human waste, frequently exceed the safe limits for competition even after significant investment in water treatment and infrastructure improvements.  The Triathlon swimming events were initially scheduled for July 30 and 31, and August 5, with reserve days planned. If the Seine's water quality doesn't improve, the swimming leg might be canceled. Marathon swimming events, also planned for the Seine, have a backup venue near Paris.</description>

			<title>Why investors did not pick up Jammu and Kashmir lithium block in auction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-investors-did-not-pick-up-jk-lithium-block-in-auction-9485682/</link>
			<description>Lithium mining in India’s Reasi district faced setbacks as auctions for the mineral block were cancelled twice. Initial optimism surrounding the discovery of a large inferred lithium deposit has waned. Concerns about extraction complexities, underdeveloped reporting standards, and falling lithium prices deterred investors.  The first auction attempt was unsuccessful due to inadequate bidder participation, even after lowering the minimum requirement. The second attempt also failed to attract qualified bidders. 

Mining experts highlight the need for resource classification aligned with internationally recognized standards, such as CRIRSCO, for greater transparency and investor confidence.  They also suggest allocating unbid blocks to government companies for development and mining.</description>

			<title>Why Nicolas Maduro’s re-election has triggered protests in Venezuela, criticism abroad</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/venezuela-election-president-nicolas-maduro-re-elected-national-electoral-council-9485615/</link>
			<description>Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of Venezuela's presidential election, securing 51% of the vote against opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia. The opposition alleges electoral fraud and questions the credibility of the results due to the lack of transparency in the vote counting process.  Maduro's long-standing rule is characterized by a centralized power structure with limitations on democratic freedoms and accusations of government interference in institutions like the courts and media. 

Venezuela's economy, largely reliant on oil exports, has been in crisis since the 2014 oil price crash, experiencing hyperinflation and shortages of essential goods.  U.S. sanctions imposed on Venezuela have exacerbated the economic situation, while Russia and China have supported Maduro's government. International reactions to the election have been mixed, with some countries condemning the alleged fraud and calling for a transparent process, while others have accepted the results.</description>

			<title>Behind Leh flight cancellations: high temperatures, low air density</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/behind-leh-flight-cancellations-high-temperatures-low-air-9485614/</link>
			<description>Flight cancellations in Leh, Ladakh, were caused by unusually high temperatures. Hot weather thins the air, reducing its density. This makes it harder for aircraft wings to generate enough lift for takeoff, as there are fewer air molecules to provide the necessary pressure difference.  Additionally, thin air negatively impacts engine performance, reducing thrust and requiring longer runways. Higher altitudes naturally have thinner air, exacerbating these issues. Global warming is contributing to these extreme temperatures, leading to disruptions in air travel.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/up-govt-proposes-strengthening-anti-conversion-law-9485220/</link>
			<description>The Uttar Pradesh government amended the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021, aiming to strengthen its provisions.  The amendment expands who can file a First Information Report (FIR) for alleged unlawful conversion cases, removes restrictions on who can file a complaint.  It also introduces stringent bail conditions similar to those applied in terrorism and money laundering cases, and increases the punishment for unlawful conversion, especially if it involves minors, women, or individuals from Scheduled Castes and Tribes.  The amendment responds to concerns about religious conversion, particularly targeting vulnerable groups,  expressed in legal rulings and by the government.</description>

			<description>English singer Charli XCX's tweet "kamala IS brat" has become a viral sensation, with over 300,000 likes and reshares. Kamala Harris's campaign embraced the phrase, using it in their online presence. The "brat" aesthetic, popularized by Charli XCX's album "Brat," has been adopted by youth groups and individuals online, associating Kamala Harris with a rebellious and unapologetic image. This resonates with Harris's persona as a playful and unconventional political leader.  Charli XCX defines a "brat" as someone confident, honest, and unafraid to embrace their flaws.  The "Kamala IS brat" trend seems to further solidify Harris's image as a relatable leader who connects with younger generations.</description>

			<title>Why are Russian athletes ‘banned’ from the 2024 Paris Olympics?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/russia-athletes-banned-paris-olympics-9484765/</link>
			<description>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned athletes from Russia and Belarus from participating in the Paris Olympics under their national flags due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. This decision stems from the IOC's view that Russia's actions violate the Olympic Truce, a principle of non-aggression during the Games. 

The IOC officially suspended the Russian Olympic Committee due to its assertion of authority over Ukrainian sports organizations in contested regions. Russia's creation of the "International Friendship Games" and its diplomatic efforts to promote them were also deemed politically motivated violations of the IOC charter. 

As a compromise, athletes from Russia and Belarus can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs), subject to several conditions. They cannot represent their countries officially, nor can they actively support the war in Ukraine. They compete under a neutral flag, wear a neutral uniform, and a neutral song plays if they win medals.</description>

			<description>PARAKH has submitted a report recommending standards for equivalency across India's diverse school boards. 

The report aims to ensure a consistent standard of education for students regardless of which board they attend.  It focuses on areas like curriculum, assessment, inclusiveness, and infrastructure. 

A key recommendation is a cumulative assessment system where students' performance in Classes 9, 10, and 11 contribute to their final Class 12 results. PARAKH also suggests establishing a cadre of professional paper setters for standardized question papers. 

Boards are directed to incorporate digital literacy and adhere to the National Curriculum Framework. Periodic school reviews and a maximum three-year affiliation period are also proposed.</description>

			<title>Why Israel-Hezbollah conflict is heating up</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hezbollah-conflict-israel-rocket-strike-golan-heights-israel-palestine-war-9483552/</link>
			<description>Following a deadly rocket attack on an Israeli-occupied Golan Heights football field that killed 12 children and teenagers, Israel vowed to retaliate severely against Hezbollah.  Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, the deadliest since the start of Hamas' war in Gaza, an accusation Hezbollah denies. 

Hezbollah, which considers Israel an illegitimate state, and sees its conflict with Israel as a religious duty, has been involved in hostilities since October 8th, supporting Palestinians in Gaza.  Israel views Hezbollah as its greatest border threat due to its growing arsenal and presence in Syria. While linked to the Gaza war, the Lebanon-Israel conflict has its own history. 

The current situation has caused significant displacement and casualties on both sides, escalating tensions without fully escalating into a full-scale war.  Both sides have indicated a desire to avoid a large-scale conflict but have also prepared for it.  A ceasefire in Gaza could help de-escalate tensions in Lebanon, but diplomatic solutions are proving difficult.</description>

			<title>New paper claims 11.9 lakh excess deaths in India in 2020: What is the debate over Covid deaths?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/debate-over-covid-deaths-9483539/</link>
			<description>A new study published in Science Advances estimates that 11.9 lakh excess deaths occurred in India in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This figure has been contested by the Indian government, which called it a "gross and misleading overestimate" and cited methodological flaws.  

The official death toll for 2020 stands at 1.49 lakh, but previous studies and the World Health Organisation have suggested the actual number could be five to ten times higher. The debate stems from the methods used to estimate deaths, relying primarily on the Sample Registration Survey (SRS) which provides estimates rather than definitive counts. 

The government's claim of 99% death registration in 2020 is also disputed due to the lack of supporting data in the relevant reports. Despite the controversy, the study highlights the importance of accurate data on Covid-19 deaths for informing health and policy decisions.</description>

			<title>Referring to ED case against Kejriwal, why a Mumbai trial court released an accused in a PMLA case</title>

			<description>A Mumbai Special Court recently ruled that a businessman, Purushottam Mandhana, be released on bail in a money laundering case. The court cited a lack of justification for the arrest, emphasizing that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) did not provide Mandhana with the "reasons to believe" that he was guilty, as required by Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This ruling follows a similar case involving Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, where the Supreme Court also questioned the ED's justification for his arrest.  

These developments highlight the importance of procedural safeguards, ensuring due process and preventing arbitrary action by authorities. The PMLA, known for its stringent bail provisions, requires the ED to have concrete grounds for arrest, which must be communicated to the accused. Courts are increasingly scrutinizing these grounds, emphasizing the need for transparency and adherence to legal procedures in arrests made under this law.</description>

			<title>Why some 5-star hotels in New Delhi may have to pay crores to the govt</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/5-star-hotels-new-delhi-ground-rent-hike-9483154/</link>
			<description>The Centre has significantly increased annual ground rent for several five-star hotels in New Delhi leased land. These hotels, including The Imperial and The Claridges, are challenging the move in court. 

The hotels received perpetual leases in the 1930s with ground rent based on the land's letting value, subject to revision after 30 years.  The government now argues previous revisions were ad-hoc and asserts the right to apply a new 5% land value calculation retroactively. 

The hotels contest this, claiming the increased rent is illegal and should only apply prospectively. The Delhi High Court has ordered the L&amp;DO to hear the hotels before revising the rent.</description>

			<description>The design of the Indian contingent's uniforms at the Olympics sparked debate, prompting discussions on representing "brand India" effectively.  The selection process involves a bid from designers/design houses,  considering both creative and financial capabilities. This year, Tarun Tahiliani's Tasva label was chosen. Although the uniform incorporated contemporary silhouettes and cotton for comfort, some criticized the absence of traditional Indian weaves and embroideries, comparing it to more culturally representative designs from smaller nations like Mongolia and Sri Lanka. Tailhanian defended his choices, citing time constraints, weather conditions, and the need for functionality over purely aesthetics. He emphasized the importance of representing India while prioritizing athlete comfort and adhering to the Indian Olympic Committee's guidelines.</description>

			<title>Death in Brazil: What is Oropouche fever?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/brazil-oropouche-fever-symptoms-9483084/</link>
			<description>Brazil reported its first two deaths from Oropouche fever, both women under 30 with no underlying health conditions.  This is the first recorded fatality from the disease globally.  Brazil had 7,236 cases as of late July, primarily concentrated in Amazonas and Rondônia.  Oropouche virus, transmitted by infected midges and mosquitos, is endemic to Latin America and the Caribbean but has recently spread to new areas. Italy reported its first case in June, and Cuba experienced its first outbreak in July.  Symptoms resemble dengue fever, with most people recovering within a week. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment available, and the virus is understudied.  Experts believe deforestation may be linked to outbreaks.</description>

			<title>Why passing Class 9 is a major hurdle for Delhi government school students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-govt-school-class-9-fail-9482970/</link>
			<description>The Delhi government's schooling system faces a persistent challenge: a high failure rate in Class 9. While the government boasts about its successes, data shows that around 30-40% of students fail this grade each year. This failure rate has dipped below pre-pandemic levels,  with the 2022 pass percentage falling to 65.52%. Several factors contribute to this issue, including the  implementation of the Right to Education Act's no-detention policy until Class 8 and increased academic pressure as students prepare for their board exams. The switch to a more challenging examination pattern with multiple-choice questions is another contributing factor. 

To address this, the government has implemented remedial classes, teacher training, and initiatives like Mission Buniyaad. However, concerns remain about the quality of open schooling options like NIOS as a fallback for struggling students.</description>

			<title>How educated mothers of young kids can help strengthen their learning journey</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/nipun-bharat-mission-nep-2020-implementation-aser-surveys-9481617/</link>
			<description>India launched the NIPUN Bharat Mission to improve foundational literacy and numeracy skills in children by Grade 3.  Key to this mission's success is leveraging the rising education levels of mothers. Data from ASER surveys shows a significant increase in the number of mothers of young children (ages 4-8) who have completed more than Grade 5, particularly in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Himachal Pradesh. This educational advantage, combined with increased parental involvement during school closures due to the pandemic, presents a unique opportunity to strengthen children's learning journey.</description>

			<title>SC to examine acquitted man’s ‘right to be forgotten’: What is the right, and how have courts ruled earlier?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/european-information-privacy-regulation-supreme-court-fundamental-rights-constitution-of-india-cji-d-y-chandrachud-9481662/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India will decide whether the "right to be forgotten" exists as a fundamental right in the country. This right, recognized in European law, allows individuals to remove their digital footprint from online searches when it violates their privacy.  While India has no specific law on this right, the 2017 Puttaswamy judgment, recognizing privacy as a fundamental right, paved the way for its consideration. 

Courts have issued conflicting rulings on the matter, with some allowing removal of information from public records in certain cases, while others have upheld the principle of public access to court judgments.

The outcome of the current case will be crucial in shaping India's stance on the "right to be forgotten" and its implications for online privacy.</description>

			<title>NASA did not say it found life on Mars but is very excited about the discovery of a rock. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-life-on-mars-rover-biosignature-9480951/</link>
			<description>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered a rock named Cheyava Falls that shows signs potentially indicative of past microbial life on Mars. 

The rock contains organic compounds, veins of calcium sulfate likely formed by water, and peculiar "leopard spots" which might have been created by chemical reactions that could have provided energy for microbes. While not conclusive evidence of life, these findings make Cheyava Falls the most promising rock studied by Perseverance so far. 

Scientists hope to retrieve the rock and analyze it on Earth, but the Mars sample return mission faces delays and budget constraints.  Perseverance will continue exploring the Jezero Crater until that mission can proceed.</description>

			<title>President Droupadi Murmu appoints new Governors for nine states: All about the post and its procedures</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/new-governors-appointment-procedure-9480630/</link>
			<description>The President of India appoints state Governors, who act as the Centre's representatives.  The Governor's role is largely defined by the Constitution, requiring them to be a citizen of India, at least 35 years old, and not a member of any legislature.  They must act on the advice of the state's Council of Ministers, except in specific situations where they have discretionary powers.
      Despite being envisioned as apolitical figures, Governors have increasingly been seen as acting on behalf of the central government, leading to friction with state governments, especially those from opposing parties. This tension arises from the Governor's appointment and removal being dependent on the central government's will, leaving them potentially susceptible to political influence.   
      Constitutional experts argue that this lack of independence and the potential for political bias undermines the Governor's role and creates an imbalance of power.</description>

			<title>14 Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, sign China-brokered deal: Why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-fatah-china-deal-9480445/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a declaration signed by Hamas and Fatah, two major Palestinian groups, in Beijing, aimed at ending division and strengthening unity. 

This declaration, which calls for an international conference and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, signifies a potential shift in Palestinian politics. Hamas and Fatah have historically competed for leadership, with differences in approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  

China, a long-time supporter of Palestine, mediated this agreement and seeks to position itself as a mediator in the region, offering an alternative to U.S. involvement.  

The declaration's success in achieving lasting peace remains uncertain, given past failed attempts at unity between the two groups. The  significance highlights China's growing influence in the Middle East.</description>

			<title>What is indexation in calculating LTCG tax? Does the removal of indexation benefit in the Budget mean you will pay more tax?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/indexation-capital-gains-tax-9479405/</link>
			<description>The Union Budget for 2024-25 removed the indexation benefit for long-term capital gains (LTCG) on property, gold, and other unlisted assets. This change means that the cost basis for calculating capital gains will not be adjusted for inflation. The government maintains that the LTCG tax rate reduction to 12.5% from 20% offsets the impact of losing indexation.  

However, concerns have been raised that this could lead to higher tax burdens for those holding assets for extended periods. Critics also point out the absence of grandfathering for purchases made prior to the new regime. The government argues the new regime simplifies the tax structure and benefits most taxpayers. They claim that the lower tax rate coupled with the existing rollover benefits will mitigate the impact of the indexation removal.</description>

			<title>Why Australia has banned mining in one of the world’s largest uranium deposits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australia-banned-mining-uranium-deposits-9479330/</link>
			<description>The Australian government has announced plans to extend Kakadu National Park to encompass the Jabiluka site, a region rich in uranium deposits.  This decision, made in accordance with the wishes of the Mirarr people, the Indigenous custodians of the land, ensures that uranium mining will never take place at Jabiluka. The extension comes after the 2017 discovery of ancient artifacts near the site, highlighting the deep historical and cultural significance of the area. This move aligns with the government's commitment to protecting Indigenous heritage and follows the global condemnation of Rio Tinto's destruction of ancient rock shelters in 2020. The Jabiluka site has been a focal point of controversy for decades, with the Mirarr people long opposing mining activities there.</description>

			<title>How is the rainfall performance during the ongoing monsoon season?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/rainfall-performance-monsoon-9479264/</link>
			<description>While the overall monsoon rainfall in India has been good, its distribution has been uneven. Some regions, particularly central and peninsular India, have received normal to excess rainfall, while others, especially in the northwest, east, and northeast, have experienced significant deficits. 

This disparity in rainfall has been attributed to the position of the monsoon trough and the occurrence of rain-bearing weather systems. The trough's southward tilt has favored central and peninsular India, while weaker systems and less frequent rainfall have affected other regions.

The uneven rainfall distribution is a concern for Kharif crops, as excessive rainfall in some areas can damage crops, while deficits in others can lead to lower yields.</description>

			<title>Government slashes prices for targeted cancer drugs: All you need to know</title>

			<title>What are puberty blockers and why are they prescribed for transgender and gender-diverse teens?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-and-when-are-puberty-blockers-prescribed-9478061/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk has made controversial statements about his transgender child, claiming they were "killed by the woke mind virus" due to  puberty blockers. His child, Vivian Jenna Wilson, has refuted these claims, stating Musk is a neglectful parent. 

Puberty blockers are medications that delay puberty's physical changes, used for both transgender youth experiencing gender dysphoria and children with precocious puberty.  These medications help alleviate anxiety and mental distress caused by the disconnect between a child's gender identity and their physical development. 


 Doctors prescribe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, which suppress sex hormone production.  
 Administered through monthly injections, every quarter injections, or a yearly implant, they temporarily halt biological changes associated with puberty. 


  Possible side effects include insomnia, weight gain, mood swings, and potential mental health challenges.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/why-ais-present-and-future-bring-some-serious-environmental-concerns-9476135/</link>
			<description>Google's recent environmental report revealed a 13% increase in its emissions, primarily driven by higher electricity consumption in its data centers and supply chains.  This surge is linked to the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI), which demands significantly more energy than traditional searches. AI models process vast amounts of data, leading to increased electrical usage and heat generation, necessitating extensive cooling. Projections indicate a potential doubling of data center energy consumption by 2026, raising concerns about its environmental impact.  


While AI holds promise for mitigating climate change, its current deployment raises significant energy concerns. 
 
 It is crucial to ensure its expansion is managed responsibly to minimize environmental harm. Efforts should focus on maximizing energy efficiency in data centers and exploring sustainable cooling solutions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kargil-vijay-diwas-india-war-pakistan-9476104/</link>
			<description>The Kargil War, which ended 25 years ago on July 26, 1999, commemorated as Kargil Vijay Diwas, saw India triumph over Pakistan's infiltration of its Ladakh region. Pakistani forces occupied strategic heights in Kargil, triggering a conflict that lasted from May to July. 

The Indian Army, facing heavy casualties, recaptured these positions despite challenging conditions. The high altitude of Kargil posed significant obstacles, with freezing temperatures, thin air, and rugged terrain impacting both soldiers and equipment. 

The Indian Army adapted its strategies, implementing acclimatisation programs, procuring better cold-weather gear, and honing high-altitude assault techniques.  Overwhelming artillery fire, particularly from the Bofors guns, proved crucial in overcoming Pakistani defenses and ultimately securing victory for India. The Kargil War highlighted the unique challenges of high-altitude combat and the Indian Army's resilience in overcoming them.</description>

			<description>The Paris 2024 Olympics are aiming to be the greenest Games ever, with organizers planning to reduce carbon emissions by half compared to previous Games. This will be achieved through various measures, including using renewable energy sources, promoting plant-based food, emphasizing public transportation and cycling, and minimizing construction of new venues. The Games will also utilize recycled and rented materials to minimize environmental impact. 

Despite these efforts, some experts argue that offsetting unavoidable emissions, a key part of Paris 2024's plan, is ineffective and amounts to "greenwashing."  They advocate for real emissions reduction rather than compensation.  Nevertheless, Paris 2024 is expected to set a new standard for sustainability in major sporting events and leave a lasting positive impact on Paris.</description>

			<description>A proposed bill to restructure the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and split it into smaller city corporations is facing scrutiny.  The bill, drafted by the BBMP Restructuring Committee, aims to create up to ten city corporations within the Greater Bengaluru area.  The governance structure would have a three-tier system with the Greater Bengaluru Authority at the top, followed by the city corporations and ward committees. 

The proposed legislation has drawn opposition from BJP lawmakers who claim it is "unscientific" and will harm the city's cultural identity. They advocate for a committee of Bengaluru MLAs to thoroughly review the bill. The Deputy Chief Minister contends that the bill is necessary to address Bengaluru's haphazard growth and the influx of population from outside Karnataka.  The bill will be discussed in detail by lawmakers on July 27.</description>

Durbar Hall, with its impressive architecture, hosted historical events like the swearing-in of India's first government in 1947 and the oath-taking ceremony of the third NDA government. It is now used for Civil and Defence Investiture Ceremonies and swearing-in ceremonies.

Ashok Hall, originally a ballroom, now serves as a venue for credential presentations by foreign diplomats and formal introductions before state banquets. 

Both halls showcase a blend of architectural styles, incorporating Indian and Western influences.</description>

			<title>How the modern Olympics came to be</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/modern-olympics-history-9475330/</link>
			<description>The idea for the modern Olympics predates Pierre de Coubertin. Following Greek independence in the 1820s, intellectuals sought to revive national pride by recalling ancient Greece. Poet Panagiotis Soutsos penned "Dialogues of the Dead," posing the question of absent Olympic Games. 

Entrepreneur Evangelos Zappas then funded the first modern Olympic revival in 1859, which continued with various iterations in Athens.  Across the English Channel, W.P. Brookes organized the Wenlock and later National Olympic Games, promoting open participation while facing resistance from British aristocracy who favored amateurism. Brookes later proposed international competitions, an idea Coubertin took and realized, leading to the first modern International Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.</description>
