			<title>Heatwaves in several parts of India: Why has April been hotter than usual?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/heatwaves-april-9297681/</link>
			<description>April 2024 in India has been marked by intense heatwaves, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting such conditions across various regions. The southern peninsular and southeastern coast have been particularly affected, while the northern plains have been spared so far. Heatwaves are officially declared when temperatures exceed normal by 4.5°C in the plains and 6°C in hilly regions. This year's severe heat is attributed to the El Niño weather pattern and persistent anticyclone systems, causing subsidence and preventing cooler sea breezes. The IMD's forecast had predicted these extreme conditions, which have predominantly impacted states like West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. The situation reflects a broader trend of increasing temperatures and heatwaves in regions previously unaffected, signaling a shift in climate patterns.</description>

			<title>Congress split and Garibi Hatao: last poll before Emergency</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/congress-split-and-garibi-hatao-last-poll-before-emergency-9297825/</link>
			<description>In 1970, facing political unrest, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi dissolved the Lok Sabha, calling for early elections to seek a mandate on her policies like bank nationalization and abolition of privy purses. The Congress party split, with Indira leading her faction to victory in the 1971 elections with the slogan "Garibi Hatao." The election saw unprecedented violence and electoral malpractices. Indira's government, however, faced challenges, including accusations of involvement in the Maharaja of Bastar's assassination and a no-confidence motion. Despite these, she secured a two-thirds majority. Her tenure saw significant events like the creation of Bangladesh post-1971 war, but her election was later invalidated, leading to the declaration of Emergency in 1975, altering Indian politics significantly.</description>

			<title>What is Sierra Madre, an old ship fuelling China-Philippines tensions in South China Sea?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sierra-madre-south-china-sea-phillipines-9297439/</link>
			<description>The South China Sea dispute has intensified with the Philippines and China clashing over territorial claims. Central to this is the Sierra Madre, a WWII ship stationed by the Philippines at Second Thomas Shoal to assert sovereignty. China's aggressive tactics, including swarming Filipino resupply vessels, have escalated tensions. The ship, now dilapidated, remains a symbol of the Philippines' claim, with its removal risking Chinese dominance. The region's rich resources have led to overlapping claims, notably on the Spratly and Paracel islands. An international tribunal supported the Philippines' claims in 2016, but China rejected the ruling. The US has reaffirmed its defense commitments to the Philippines, indicating support against Chinese coercion in the disputed waters.</description>

			<title>What’s behind the demand for delaying polls in the Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha constituency</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/delaying-polls-anantnag-rajouri-constituency-9297449/</link>
			<description>In the run-up to the Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha seat elections in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, four parties have requested a postponement due to blocked roads from snowfall, hindering campaigning. Contrarily, other parties claim the roads are navigable. The controversy stems from the 2022 formation of the Anantnag-Rajouri constituency, which amalgamated regions from Jammu and Kashmir, altering the demographic balance and sparking accusations of electoral manipulation to favor the BJP. The BJP has not fielded a candidate, instead supporting allies, amidst speculation that a delayed election could benefit pro-BJP candidates. The constituency's demographic is a mix of non-ST Muslims in Kashmir and ST Gujjars, Bakerwals, and Paharis in Jammu, with recent government actions seen as BJP's bid to gain influence in the Valley.</description>

			<title>Article 31C: Why the SC is deciding if a fundamental right still exists in a case about private property?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/article-31c-supreme-court-fundamental-right-private-property-9297379/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is revisiting the constitutional validity of Article 31C, which protects laws aimed at distributing community resources equitably and preventing wealth concentration. Initially safeguarding specific directive principles from legal challenges, Article 31C's scope was expanded by the 42nd Amendment but later restricted by the Minerva Mills verdict. The current debate arises from a property acquisition case under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, questioning whether "material resources of the community" include private property. The court's decision could clarify the status of Article 31C post-Minerva Mills, addressing whether it was entirely struck down or partially revived, a significant issue with implications for property rights and socio-economic policies.</description>

			<title>All you need to know about Pakistan’s Hangor class submarines, built by China</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/pakistan-hangor-class-submarines-9297350/</link>
			<description>The first of eight Hangor-class submarines, built by China for Pakistan, was launched on April 26. These diesel-electric attack submarines, larger than India's Kalavari class, are set to join the Pakistan Navy by 2028. The Hangor-class features an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, enhancing underwater endurance, and is armed with six torpedo tubes and missile capabilities, including the Babur-3 cruise missile. While the Kalavari class lacks AIP, India plans to upgrade with an indigenous system. The Hangor-class's size may limit maneuverability in shallow waters compared to the more compact Kalavari class. Both classes have advanced sensor suites, but the Hangor's specifics remain undisclosed.</description>

			<title>Behind cannibal stereotype: Why Joe Biden’s comments offended Papua New Guinea</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/joe-biden-guinea-cannibal-stereotype-9296518/</link>
			<description>Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape rebuked US President Joe Biden for suggesting cannibalism in New Guinea during WWII. Biden's anecdote about his uncle's disappearance after a plane crash invoked outdated stereotypes, which Marape dismissed, emphasizing his nation's dignity. The article highlights the Korowai and Fore tribes' historical practices of consuming human flesh, not out of savagery but as part of complex social customs, often misunderstood by Western perspectives. The Fore ceased the practice in the 1960s after linking it to the fatal kuru disease. The piece contextualizes Biden's remarks within the broader misuse of the cannibal stereotype, historically exploited to justify colonial atrocities, and examines cannibalism's diverse roles and rationales across cultures and species.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘We do not have government by the majority… but by the majority who participate’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-upsc-voter-turnout-voting-9295719/</link>
			<description>The second phase of India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections saw a slight decrease in voter turnout at 66.7%, a 3% drop from 2019. This decline is notable given India's history of high participation rates, which are indicative of a robust democracy. The article emphasizes the importance of voting as a fundamental democratic exercise and a reflection of public trust in the political process. It highlights the struggles of marginalized groups to secure voting rights and how voting empowers individuals as stakeholders in society. The piece also discusses voter apathy, its potential dangers to democracy, and the need for greater accountability in the political system. It references the Indian Supreme Court's introduction of the 'None of the Above' option as a means to express dissatisfaction, underscoring its role in a vibrant democracy. The article concludes by examining the impact of voter disillusionment, particularly among the youth, on election participation.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand forest fire: How are forest fires caused and how frequent are they in India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/forest-fires-causes-frequency-india-9295213/</link>
			<description>In Uttarakhand's Nainital district, forest fires prompted the Indian Air Force to conduct firefighting operations using Bambi buckets. The fires affected Nainital, Haldwani, and Ramnagar forest divisions. Forest fires in India, which occur from November to June, are influenced by temperature, dry vegetation, and moisture levels. The Forest Survey of India notes that 36% of India's forests are fire-prone, with severe fires in dry deciduous forests. Northeastern states, parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and regions in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka are highly susceptible. Most fires are man-made, linked to agriculture and land-use changes. In Uttarakhand, causes include deliberate acts, carelessness, and natural factors. Prevention methods include watch towers, fire watchers, community involvement, and fire lines. Satellite technology aids in fire management. Separately, India's T20 World Cup team selection is underway, with focus on Samson and Gill, and uncertainty over KL Rahul's inclusion.</description>

			<title>How a new report links fashion giants Zara and H&amp;M to deforestation in Brazil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/new-report-zara-deforestation-brazil-9295010/</link>
			<description>An Earthsight investigation has revealed that cotton used by major brands like Zara and H&amp;M is linked to deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil. Despite sustainability labels, the UK-based NGO found that cotton production in Brazil's Cerrado region, a biodiversity hotspot, is causing environmental damage. The report tracked 816,000 tons of cotton linked to European brands, produced for eight Asian manufacturers. It highlighted the role of SLC Agricola, responsible for 11% of Brazil's cotton exports, in deforestation. Better Cotton, a certification scheme, failed to prevent the implicated cotton from reaching the market. The findings have prompted calls for stricter supply chain regulations and accountability from European markets to mitigate negative impacts on the environment and human rights.</description>

			<title>Why fentanyl, reportedly the biggest killer of Americans aged 18-49, figured in Antony Blinken’s China visit</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/antony-blinken-china-vxi-jinping-fentanyl-opioid-9294866/</link>
			<description>US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's visit to China highlighted the fentanyl crisis, a synthetic opioid causing widespread addiction and death in the US. Blinken discussed with Chinese officials the need to control the production and export of fentanyl precursors. The US blames China and Mexico for trafficking fentanyl, which is often mixed into other drugs unbeknownst to users. The US has seen a dramatic increase in opioid-related deaths, with fentanyl being a significant factor. Cooperation between the US and China is crucial, as evidenced by the recent bilateral Counternarcotics Working Group. However, tensions over various geopolitical issues have hindered progress. The US seeks to address the crisis domestically and internationally, with the FEND Off Fentanyl Bill targeting illicit traffickers and precursor chemical producers. The issue is a major concern for US voters ahead of the presidential elections.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: What Election Commission can do if normal polling process is disrupted</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/repolls-election-commission-polling-process-9294027/</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India (EC) has annulled polls in certain stations in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh due to irregularities, with repolls scheduled subsequently. Additionally, the death of a candidate has postponed elections in Madhya Pradesh's Betul constituency. India's election laws cater to disruptions in polling, ensuring a fair and uninterrupted democratic process. Provisions include voiding polls for EVM tampering or damage, booth-capturing, and natural disasters. Repolls involve fresh voting, with specific measures to prevent repeat voting. The EC has the authority to countermand elections if booth-capturing is widespread, affecting the election's integrity. In cases of candidate death, the poll is adjourned, allowing the concerned party to nominate a new candidate. These laws maintain the sanctity and transparency of elections in India.</description>

			<title>What is a Bambi Bucket, being used by an IAF helicopter to fight Nainital forest fires?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/bambi-bucket-forest-fire-9294088/</link>
			<description>To combat the forest fires in Uttarakhand's Nainital district, the Indian Air Force deployed an MI 17 V5 helicopter equipped with a "Bambi Bucket" to douse the flames. The Bambi Bucket, a collapsible container for aerial firefighting, was filled with water from Bhimtal Lake and released over the fires. Invented in 1982 by Canadian Don Arney, the Bambi Bucket has been a game-changer in firefighting due to its ease of filling and effectiveness in water delivery. It releases a solid column of water, ensuring a more impactful and less evaporative drop. Available in sizes up to 9,840 liters, it's now used globally by over 1,000 operators. Arney's innovation earned him a place in the Inventors Hall of Fame in 2017.</description>

			<title>Why Canada is top preference for Indians wishing to study abroad, despite obstacles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/canada-top-preference-indians-students-punjab-9293999/</link>
			<description>Despite recent policy changes, Canada remains a top destination for Indian students, particularly from Punjab. The country's welcoming environment and excellent public universities continue to attract students, offering them a clearer path to post-study settlement. Canada's work permit and Permanent Residency (PR) policies are more favorable than those of the US, UK, and Australia, with higher visa success rates and lower refusal rates. Experts highlight Canada's transparent process and the high presence of Indian communities as confidence boosters for students. Even with a cap on international students, opportunities for Indian students in Canada are still abundant, with a high percentage already studying there. The support from local Indian communities also helps mitigate homesickness for students abroad.</description>

			<title>When Supreme Court junked the Election Commision’s first EVM experiment in Kerala</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/a-long-way-from-1984-when-sc-junked-ecis-first-evm-experiment-9292936/</link>
			<description>In 1982, the Supreme Court of India disapproved the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in elections, citing the lack of legislative backing and the need for voter training. This verdict came after EVMs were first used in Kerala's Parur Assembly constituency, leading to a contested election result. Despite the Election Commission of India's (ECI) assertion of its constitutional powers, the court ruled that only Parliament had the legislative authority to sanction EVMs. However, the concept persisted, and by 2004, EVMs had fully replaced ballot papers in the Lok Sabha elections, following legal amendments and gradual adoption across various states. This marked a significant evolution in India's electoral process from paper ballots to electronic systems.</description>

			<title>How ISRO used satellite remote-sensing to analyse glacial lakes in Himalayas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-isro-used-satellite-remote-sensing-to-analyse-glacial-lakes-in-himalayas-9292935/</link>
			<description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has reported a significant expansion of glacial lakes in the Indian Himalayan river basins, analyzing satellite data from the past four decades. The study found that out of 2,431 lakes larger than 10 hectares, 676 have expanded since 1984, with 601 lakes more than doubling in size. This expansion is attributed to the accelerated retreat of glaciers due to global warming, leading to the formation of lakes in depressions caused by glacial movement. ISRO categorized these lakes into moraine-dammed, ice-dammed, erosion-based, and others. Glacial lakes are vital freshwater sources but also pose risks of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which can devastate downstream communities. Satellite remote-sensing technology aids in monitoring these lakes, providing insights for environmental impact assessments and risk management strategies. Fieldwork, including early warning systems, is essential for critical sites to mitigate GLOF risks.</description>

			<title>Explained: Symbol Loading Unit (SLU), the ‘matchbox’ that feeds EVM candidate information</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/slu-matchbox-that-feeds-evm-candidate-info-9292931/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has directed the Election Commission to secure Symbol Loading Units (SLUs) for 45 days post-election results, marking a change from only storing EVM components. SLUs, crucial for loading candidate symbols onto VVPATs, will now be available for scrutiny if election results are contested. This decision prevents the reuse of SLUs across different phases of multi-phase elections, necessitating the procurement of additional units by the EC. Furthermore, the court has permitted candidates to request verification of EVM software for tampering, with a focus on second and third-place finishers. This move requires candidates to bear the cost, with a refund only if tampering is detected. The verification process involves inspecting the memory/microcontrollers of EVMs, with engineers certifying their authenticity. These changes do not affect voters but significantly alter the EC's polling organization, potentially impacting the Representation of the People Act regarding election petitions.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India dismissed petitions for 100% VVPAT slip verification with EVM counts, emphasizing the importance of trust in the electoral process. Justices Khanna and Datta expressed confidence in EVM security and dismissed concerns of tampering as unfounded. The court maintained that voter rights are safeguarded by existing measures like the seven-second VVPAT slip display. Justice Khanna directed additional security checks for EVM microcontrollers and sealing of Symbol Loading Units post-election. Instances of EVM-VVPAT discrepancies were deemed isolated, with the court rejecting the idea of returning to paper ballots or providing physical VVPAT slips to voters, citing potential misuse and malpractices.</description>

			<title>Looking back at the Chernobyl disaster, 38 years later: Who was responsible?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/chernobyl-disaster-38-years-who-was-responsible-9292695/</link>
			<description>The Chernobyl disaster of April 26, 1986, stands as a catastrophic nuclear event. Reactor 4's explosion released immense amounts of radiation, initially killing two workers, with subsequent deaths from acute radiation sickness. Predictions estimate up to 9,000 cancer-related deaths in affected areas. The disaster rendered 2,600 sq km uninhabitable and sparked debate over culpability. Faulty safety tests led to the meltdown, with some blaming operator error, while others cite design flaws and poor human-machine interaction. The Soviet Union initially concealed the incident, which released more radiation than the Hiroshima bomb. Decades later, responsibility remains contested, highlighting the complex interplay between human actions and technological systems.</description>

			<title>Is Japan moving closer to a future female empress?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/japan-female-empress-9292635/</link>
			<description>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is considering legal reforms to prevent a succession crisis in the imperial family, potentially allowing female members to retain royal status post-marriage and reinstating previously removed branches. This shift, influenced by public support for an empress, marks a departure from traditionalist views. However, critics argue these proposals are conservative ploys to preserve male-only succession. The debate reflects broader societal discussions on gender equality, with many Japanese favoring a more inclusive approach to imperial succession. Despite this, the likelihood of these reforms passing is uncertain due to the need for unanimous legislative agreement and opposition from conservative factions.</description>

			<title>The planet’s plastic problem: why we need a global plastics treaty</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/global-plastic-pollution-treaty-9292563/</link>
			<description>Negotiators from 175 countries are in Ottawa to draft a global treaty to address plastic pollution, aiming to finalize it by the end of 2024. This treaty is considered the most significant environmental agreement since the 2015 Paris climate accord. Plastic production has surged since the 1950s, leading to a crisis with billions of tonnes polluting the planet and contributing to climate change. The treaty may set production caps, recycling targets, and ban certain plastics and chemicals. However, oil-producing nations and industry lobbyists oppose these measures, favoring a focus on waste management over production reduction. The "High-Ambition Coalition" of 65 nations seeks to end plastic pollution by 2040, but faces challenges from major fossil fuel producers and the US's preference for voluntary action.</description>

			<title>Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction overturned: What the court argued, its implications</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/harvey-weinstein-rape-conviction-overturned-9292208/</link>
			<description>New York's highest court has overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction and ordered a new trial, citing judicial errors in the landmark #MeToo case. The Court of Appeals found that the trial judge allowed testimony from witnesses whose allegations were not part of the charges, thus prejudicing the case. Weinstein was originally convicted for assaults in 2006 and 2013 and sentenced to 23 years. The reversal is based on the misuse of "Molineux witnesses," who testified about uncharged acts, violating Weinstein's rights to be tried solely for the charged crimes. Despite this, Weinstein remains imprisoned due to a separate 16-year sentence from a 2022 LA conviction for rape, which his lawyers plan to challenge. The decision marks a significant blow to the #MeToo movement, following a similar overturning of Bill Cosby's conviction. Appeals may now be directed to the Supreme Court.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court VVPAT judgment: What has changed — and not changed?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-vvpat-judgment-what-has-changed-9292117/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has dismissed requests for 100% verification of VVPAT slips with EVM counts, maintaining the current electoral process. The court has, however, mandated new post-election procedures for the Election Commission (EC). These include the storage of Symbol Loading Units (SLUs) for 45 days post-results for potential election petitions and allowing candidates to request verification of EVMs in 5% of machines per Assembly segment. Verification requests must be made within seven days of result declaration, with costs borne by the candidates, refundable if tampering is detected. Additionally, the court suggested the EC consider machine counting of VVPAT slips with barcodes for efficiency, though it refrained from a definitive stance on this technical suggestion.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court rejects demand for 100% verification of VVPAT slips: What was the case about?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/supreme-court-rejects-vvpat-elections-case-9291828/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, on April 26, upheld the current process of vote verification using Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs), rejecting demands for complete cross-verification with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and dismissing calls to revert to ballot papers. The verdict, delivered by Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, came after the Association for Democratic Reforms petitioned for enhanced transparency in elections through barcode-enabled VVPAT slips for faster tallying. The court suggested the Election Commission explore electronic counting of VVPAT slips. VVPATs, which provide a physical vote verification system, were fully adopted by June 2017. Currently, VVPAT slips from five randomly selected polling stations per assembly constituency are counted, a practice established by a 2019 Supreme Court judgment. Despite opposition parties advocating for increased verification to ensure election integrity, the Election Commission has cited logistical challenges and potential result delays as reasons for maintaining the status quo.</description>

			<title>50 yrs of portugal’s Carnation Revolution: How Europe’s longest dictatorship was overthrown</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/50-yrs-of-portugals-carnation-revolution-how-europes-longest-dictatorship-was-overthrown-9291423/</link>
			<description>Portugal marked the 50th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which ended Europe's longest fascist rule and brought democracy. Antonio Oliveira Salazar's regime, which began in 1932, fell in 1974. Salazar, once Finance Minister, balanced Portugal's budget and stabilized its currency. As Prime Minister, he established the Estado Novo, a regime maintaining the Portuguese empire. The 1974 revolution, led by junior army officers, sought democracy and an end to colonial wars in Africa, leading to rapid decolonization. Today, the rise of the populist Chega party, which reveres Salazar's ideals, challenges this legacy. Chega, advocating "God, patriotism, family, and work," has grown significantly, reflecting on Portugal's current socio-economic issues.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: How a ‘new’ Japan promises to transform Asian geopolitics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-how-a-new-japan-promises-to-transform-asian-geopolitics-9291424/</link>
			<description>Japan is undergoing a significant shift from its post-WWII pacifism to becoming a major military power. This change is driven by external pressures such as China's rise, North Korea's military capabilities, and uncertainties in US security commitments. Internally, conservatives in Tokyo advocate for Japan to assume more responsibility for its own security and contribute to regional order. Japan has increased its defense spending, acquired counter-strike capabilities, eased its weapons export ban, and is revising its defense command structure with the US. These moves signify Japan's transition from a US protectorate to an active partner in Indo-Pacific security, reshaping the regional security landscape and aligning with India's vision of a multipolar Asia.</description>

			<title>How sending notice to party, not candidate, for poll code violations marks a shift in EC response</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/model-code-of-conduct-violations-sending-notice-to-party-not-candidate-marks-shift-in-ec-response-9291258/</link>
			<description>In a notable departure from past practices, the Election Commission (EC) has issued notices to political parties, specifically the BJP and Congress, for alleged Model Code of Conduct (MCC) violations by their star campaigners, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. This shift emphasizes individual accountability and suggests that parties may be held responsible for their campaigners' actions. The move raises questions about the extent of action against individual leaders and the consequences for parties with unsatisfactory responses. The EC's approach aligns with a "calibrated approach" announced by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, targeting "repeat offenders" and legally linking campaigners' conduct to their parties, reminding them of their constitutional commitments. This change is underscored by the fact that no sitting Prime Minister has previously received an MCC violation notice.</description>

			<title>Why a US court overturned Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-court-overturned-harvey-weinstein-2020-rape-conviction-9290940/</link>
			<description>A New York appeals court has overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 sex crime conviction and ordered a new trial, citing serious errors in the previous trial, including the admission of invalid testimony. The Court of Appeals found that uncharged allegations had been erroneously admitted, which did not pertain to the complainants of the underlying crimes. Weinstein's lawyers argued that the trial was swayed by allowing testimonies from three women not involved in the case. While dissenting opinions criticized the decision for perpetuating outdated views on sexual violence, the majority ruled for a retrial. Weinstein, currently serving a 23-year sentence for separate convictions, will remain in prison despite the overturned New York ruling. The decision's impact on Weinstein is yet to be determined. The case has been a significant part of the #MeToo movement, following numerous allegations against Weinstein in 2017.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/army-tactical-missile-systems-us-ukraine-9290863/</link>
			<description>The U.S. has confirmed the provision of long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, following President Zelenskyy's request and a $61 billion funding bill passed by Congress. These missiles, with a range of 300km, are an upgrade from previous systems with shorter ranges. They are launched from HIMARS and MLRS platforms, previously supplied by the U.S. and U.K. National Security Adviser Sullivan cited Russia's intensified attacks on civilian infrastructure as the reason for the timing of this delivery. The move comes amid concerns of escalation and reports of North Korea providing ballistic missiles to Russia. The ongoing Ukraine-Russia war has seen continued demands for aid from Ukraine, with U.S. President Biden supporting aid despite opposition from some Republican leaders.

			<title>How American universities have long been hotbeds of protest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/american-universities-protest-israel-gaza-9290561/</link>
			<description>Protests have erupted across US college campuses in response to Israel's actions in Gaza, with significant police arrests at UT Austin and USC, and potential police action at Harvard and Brown. The movement, involving at least 30 universities, was sparked by NYPD's arrest of 108 Columbia University students demanding divestment from Israel-linked entities. This echoes the 1968 Columbia protests against Vietnam War policies and the influential 1960 Greensboro sit-ins, which contributed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Student activism has a long history in the US, from pre-Revolution protests to anti-apartheid and Black Lives Matter movements, often leading to significant institutional changes and reflecting broader societal issues.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/maratha-quota-case-update-bombay-hc-9290326/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court is set to resume hearings on June 13 regarding the 10% reservation for Marathas under Maharashtra's SEBC Act, 2024. This follows political upheaval and the significance of Maharashtra's 48 Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming elections. The court's decision will impact applications for education and government jobs under the Act. The Maratha community, constituting nearly a third of the state's population, has seen previous reservation laws fail. The current challenge argues the Act's unconstitutionality for exceeding the 50% reservation ceiling without constitutional amendment. The Shukre Commission's extensive survey supports the Marathas' backward status, but its findings and the Act's validity face scrutiny in court.</description>

			<description>Microsoft has introduced Phi-3-Mini, a new small language model (SLM), as part of its Phi-3 series. This model is designed to be more capable and cost-effective than larger language models (LLMs), performing well on benchmarks in language, reasoning, coding, and math. Phi-3-Mini, with a 3.8 billion parameter count, is available on platforms like Azure AI Studio and HuggingFace. It supports a context window of up to 128K tokens, enabling it to process large text content efficiently. The model is also instruction-tuned for immediate use. Microsoft plans to release more models in the Phi-3 family, including Phi-3-small and Phi-3-Medium. SLMs like Phi-3-Mini are ideal for resource-constrained environments and quick response scenarios, such as chatbots. They require less computing power and energy, making them suitable for smaller devices and organizations. Microsoft's Phi-3-Mini is said to outperform its predecessors and other models of similar or larger size.</description>

			<title>Case before Supreme Court: Can Govt redistribute privately owned property?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/case-before-supreme-court-can-govt-redistribute-privately-owned-property-9289189/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is revisiting the interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution, which addresses the distribution of material resources to serve the common good. Historically, the apex court ruled that private property does not fall under "material resources of the community," but Justice Krishna Iyer's minority opinion, later supported by a five-judge bench, argued otherwise. This view was influential in nationalizing coal mines in 1983. Currently, the court is hearing a case on the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act's amendment, which allows the state to acquire 'cessed' properties in Mumbai for redistribution. The case challenges the constitutionality of this amendment, questioning if privately owned resources are included in "material resources of the community." A nine-judge bench is now deliberating on this matter.</description>

It outlines the history of wealth-related taxes in India, including the now-abolished estate duty, wealth tax, and gift tax. The piece also touches on global discussions about taxing the wealthy to address income inequality, with proposals like a global minimum corporate tax rate and a 'Billionaire Minimum Income Tax' in the US. It highlights the challenges of implementing such taxes, including capital flight and administrative costs, and notes the IMF's observation of declining wealth tax rates worldwide. The article concludes with the effectiveness of wealth taxes and the potential revenue from a global minimum tax on billionaires.</description>

			<description>Rahul Gandhi's rhetoric on a caste census has evolved from a tool for social justice to a central goal, intertwining it with issues of inequality and wealth concentration. Despite internal dissent and BJP's criticism of threatening middle-class wealth, Gandhi remains unapologetic, advocating for an "X-ray" financial survey to inform revolutionary policies. Sam Pitroda's inheritance tax suggestion, contrasting with the Congress manifesto's tax stance, has sparked debate and confusion within the party. Gandhi insists on a caste census upon forming government, aiming for comprehensive socio-economic clarity. This stance marks a significant shift for Congress, aligning with socialist parties and challenging the Supreme Court's reservation cap, reflecting a broader strategy beyond electoral promises.</description>

			<title>What is Art 244(A), the constitutional promise of autonomy driving the election narrative at a tribal seat in Assam?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/article-244a-diphu-assam-9288844/</link>
			<description>In Assam's Diphu constituency, a long-standing election promise is the implementation of Article 244(A), which allows for an autonomous state within Assam. This provision, added in 1969, would enable the tribal-majority areas of Karbi Anglong, West Karbi Anglong, and Dima Hasao, currently under the Sixth Schedule, to have greater autonomy with their own legislature or council. Despite past peace accords and settlements promising enhanced autonomy and development packages, the actual implementation of Article 244(A) remains a central issue. Political parties continue to pledge its enactment, but progress post-elections is criticized as stagnant. The current focus is on the upcoming vote, with candidates reiterating commitments to autonomy, reflecting the region's complex history of autonomy demands and political negotiations.</description>

			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed restrictions on Kotak Mahindra Bank, instructing it to halt the onboarding of new customers via online and mobile banking channels and to cease issuing new credit cards. This directive follows the RBI's IT examination for 2022 and 2023, which revealed significant deficiencies in the bank's IT management and compliance. The bank experienced frequent outages, highlighting a lack of operational resilience and inadequate IT infrastructure. Despite ongoing discussions with the RBI, the bank's rapid growth in digital transactions has further strained its systems. The RBI's decision aims to protect customer interests and ensure the stability of digital banking services. Kotak Mahindra Bank will continue serving existing customers and is taking steps to address the IT issues.</description>

			<title>Why Centre filed an application to modify 2G spectrum scam judgement</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/application-modify-2g-spectrum-scam-judgement-9288254/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has sought to modify a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on the 2G spectrum allocation process. The original case involved the allocation of 2G licenses on a first-come-first-serve basis in 2008, which led to allegations of a massive scam and subsequent investigations. The Supreme Court canceled 122 licenses and mandated auctions for allocation to prevent misuse. The government now argues that auctions may not always be optimal, citing needs for spectrum in public interest functions and situations where auctions are not technically or economically viable. It seeks clarification on whether administrative allocation could be allowed in certain cases, referencing a 2012 court clarification that auctions are not a constitutional principle for all natural resources.</description>

			<title>Road ahead for Tesla: Why EV sector is struggling, how Elon Musk hopes to negotiate potholes and speed bumps</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/tesla-ev-sector-musk-9288255/</link>
			<description>Tesla Inc's shares rose over 10% after-hours despite a significant miss in revenue and earnings, marking the first decline in over four years with a 9% drop from the previous year. The company's operating profit and adjusted net income fell by more than 50% year-on-year, and future delivery volumes are projected to be notably lower. Tesla's inventory reached an all-time high of 28 days, and layoffs at its Texas factory numbered 2,600 due to low demand. Additionally, 4,000 Cybertrucks were recalled due to a faulty accelerator pedal. Surprisingly, the stock's rise post-earnings call was attributed to plans for more affordable vehicles, a potential Tesla robotaxi service, and a surge in software revenue from its full self-driving feature. Despite challenges, including competition from Chinese EV makers and the need to open its charging network, Tesla is pushing forward with new models, including a low-cost "Model 2" expected to launch by early 2025.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha elections 2024: What the BJP and Congress manifestos say on climate change</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/election-manifestos-climate-change-9288078/</link>
			<description>India's general elections are unfolding amidst a severe heatwave, with climate change being a critical but underrepresented issue in campaigns. Despite experiencing climate-induced disasters, political parties have not prioritized it in their electioneering. However, both the BJP and Congress have included climate agendas in their manifestos. The BJP aims to continue its current policies, expand renewable energy to 500 GW by 2030, and promote a green credit system. It also plans to launch river health programs and a National Atmospheric Mission. Conversely, Congress proposes an independent authority to enforce environmental standards and a National Climate Resilience Development Mission, alongside funds for green transitions and infrastructure. Both parties commit to expanding forest cover, protecting ecosystems, and reducing pollution.</description>

			<title>US Senate passes Bill that may ban TikTok: What can be the implications?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/us-bill-banning-tiktok-9287878/</link>
			<description>The U.S. Senate has passed a bill that could mandate the sale of TikTok by its Chinese owner, Bytedance, or lead to its outright ban, reflecting ongoing U.S.-China tensions. The bill, which addresses national security concerns over TikTok's Chinese connections, suggests that Bytedance must divest TikTok within nine months for it to continue operating in the U.S. President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law, potentially triggering legal challenges and retaliatory actions from Beijing. Critics argue the bill infringes on free speech, with TikTok claiming it would harm American users and businesses. Previously, the Trump administration attempted to force TikTok's sale to a U.S. company, with Microsoft notably entering negotiations. The broader context includes tech bans as foreign policy tools, with countries targeting Chinese tech firms like Huawei in response to strained relations, leading to reciprocal actions and the development of independent tech capabilities.</description>

			<title>Reservation for Muslims: Andhra Pradesh case and issues before the court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/reservation-for-muslims-andhra-pradesh-case-and-issues-before-the-court-9287313/</link>
			<description>In a speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Congress of attempting to provide a 5% reservation for Muslims in Andhra Pradesh, which he claimed was part of a larger plan to implement across India. The article discusses the legal challenges and changes to Muslim reservation in various states. In Andhra Pradesh, attempts to include all Muslims in the OBC category were struck down by the High Court for not excluding the "creamy layer" and lacking objective criteria. Despite the High Court's affirmation that Muslim reservations do not conflict with secularism, subsequent attempts to establish a 5% Muslim quota were invalidated. The Supreme Court is yet to hear the final appeal, following its decision on the Economically Weaker Section quota. The article also briefly mentions AstraZeneca's admission of rare side effects from its Covid vaccine.</description>

			<title>After wars, deaths, political turmoil, how the 1967 Lok Sabha elections saw the Indira Gandhi era begin</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/lok-sabha-elections-after-wars-deaths-political-turmoil-the-era-of-indira-gandhi-9287333/</link>
			<description>The period between India's third and fourth Lok Sabha elections (1962-1967) was marked by significant political upheaval. The nation faced a defeat by China and the deaths of Prime Ministers Nehru and Shastri. Indira Gandhi succeeded as Prime Minister, leading Congress to victory in the 1967 elections, which saw the end of simultaneous Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections. The elections expanded to 520 Lok Sabha seats and over 3,500 state Assembly seats, reflecting changes like new states and Union Territories. Despite internal challenges and the rise of opposition parties, Congress maintained a vote share above 40%, although it faced setbacks with non-Congress governments forming in several states. The era post-1967 ushered in a political dominance by Indira Gandhi, reshaping India's political landscape.</description>

			<title>How much wealth do Indian Muslims have? Here’s what a study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/wealth-indian-muslims-9286910/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegation that the Congress plans to redistribute gold to Muslims has been refuted as "lies" and "hate speech" by the Congress. A 2020 study by the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies reveals disparities in wealth ownership among different social groups in India. Hindu high castes hold about 41% of the nation's wealth, with Hindu OBCs at 31%, and Muslims, SCs, and STs owning smaller percentages. The wealth distribution is disproportionate to the population share of these groups. The study also highlights the variations in average household wealth, with Hindu high castes at the top. Additionally, Hindu OBCs possess the largest share of gold among social groups.</description>

			<title>How US colleges are witnessing protests over the Israel-Palestine conflict</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-colleges-protests-israel-palestine-9286916/</link>
			<description>U.S. colleges are embroiled in debates over student protests linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Arrests have been made at Columbia, NYU, and Yale, with students facing charges for their involvement. The protests were sparked by a Hamas attack on Israel and subsequent Israeli military action, which resulted in significant casualties. Tensions on campuses stem from differing views on the Middle East, with some student groups blaming Israel for the violence and others decrying perceived antisemitism in anti-Israel protests. Universities face a dilemma in balancing free speech with maintaining support from benefactors. High-profile resignations and cancelled speeches have occurred amidst congressional testimonies on antisemitism in colleges. The situation reflects the historical role of U.S. campuses as sites of political activism and debate.</description>

			<title>The story of Doordarshan’s iconic logo, now in controversy over its colour</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/dordarshan-logo-colour-9286815/</link>
			<description>Doordarshan (DD), India's public broadcaster, recently changed its logo color from ruby red to saffron, sparking criticism from opposition parties amid elections. They linked the new color to the ruling party, BJP. DD defended the change as a visual update, noting that saffron was part of its logo when it transitioned to color broadcasting in the 1980s. The article traces DD's history from its black and white transmission days in 1959, highlighting the iconic 'DD Eye' logo and the signature tune composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Ahmed Hussain Khan. The 'Eye' logo, designed by Devashis Bhattacharyya, symbolized yin and yang and evolved over the decades, with students from the National Institute of Design (NID) contributing to its revamp. The article also briefly mentions the journalist's background and unrelated content about HPBOSE class 12 results.</description>

			<title>New World Meteorological Organisation report released: 5 charts that tell the status of climate crisis in Asia</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/wmo-report-climate-crisis-asia-9286724/</link>
			<description>The World Meteorological Organisation's 2023 report highlights Asia's accelerated warming, with the region experiencing more extreme weather and water-related events than any other. In 2023, 79 hydrometeorological events impacted over nine million people and caused over 2,000 deaths. The majority were floods and storms, exacerbated by Asia's surface temperature rising 1.87°C above the 1961–1990 average. Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are losing mass due to high temperatures and dry conditions, with significant losses over the past 40 years. Precipitation patterns have shifted, with areas like Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar experiencing below-normal rainfall, while others received excess. Sea surface temperatures in Asia have also reached record highs, particularly in the North-west Pacific Ocean, with warming rates in some areas more than triple the global average.</description>

			<title>What is the UK govt’s recent Bill, which could lead to some migrants being deported to Rwanda?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-bill-migrants-rwanda-plan-9286181/</link>
			<description>The UK's upper house passed the Safety of Rwanda Bill, affirming Rwanda as a safe country for deporting undocumented immigrants, despite the Supreme Court's previous ruling against such policies due to human rights concerns. This move follows a treaty signed with Rwanda to enhance migrant protections. The contentious plan, initiated by former PM Boris Johnson, involves flying migrants 6,400 km to Rwanda for resettlement assessments. The UK has already paid Rwanda £290 million, with an additional £50 million pending the Bill's passage. The UNHCR criticizes the policy, and the ECHR halted initial deportations. With upcoming elections, immigration remains a hot-button issue, and PM Rishi Sunak asserts that flights to Rwanda will commence within 10-12 weeks, notwithstanding potential legal challenges.</description>

			<title>Dawoodi Bohra leader wins legal battle: Who challenged Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin’s position as 53rd Dai, and why?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dawoodi-bohra-high-court-dai-9286169/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court dismissed a decade-long challenge to the leadership of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, head of the Dawoodi Bohra community. The dispute arose after the 52nd al-Dai al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin, passed away in 2014, and his son, Saifuddin, succeeded him. This succession was contested by Burhanuddin's half-brother, Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who claimed he had been secretly appointed as the successor in 1965. Qutbuddin's son, Taher Fakhruddin, continued the legal battle after his father's death in 2016. The court ruled on evidence, not faith, noting that the nass (succession) could be changed and revoked, supporting Saifuddin's claim, which was backed by witnesses and documents from 1969 and reaffirmed in 2011. The case's length was attributed to extensive evidence and disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</description>

			<title>How the rupee has ‘strengthened’ under Modi government</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rupee-modi-government-9285946/</link>
			<description>The Indian rupee has depreciated by 27.6% against the US dollar from 2014 to 2024, a slightly higher rate than during the previous decade. The article explains that the rupee's value is not only determined by its exchange rate with the dollar but also by its Effective Exchange Rate (EER) with a basket of currencies from major trading partners. The Nominal EER (NEER) shows the rupee depreciated 32.2-40.2% against this basket over the last 20 years, less than its 45.7% fall against the dollar. The Real EER (REER), adjusted for inflation, indicates the rupee has strengthened in real terms, suggesting an overvaluation that could affect India's trade competitiveness. The article highlights the complexity of currency valuation and its impact on the economy.</description>

			<title>Explained: What do countries and companies want in global plastic treaty talks?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/global-plastic-treaty-canada-significance-9285936/</link>
			<description>Global leaders are convening in Ottawa to draft a landmark treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution, potentially rivaling the 2015 Paris Agreement in environmental significance. The treaty seeks to manage plastics' entire lifecycle, addressing the industry's contribution to carbon emissions—currently 5% and potentially rising to 20% by 2050. Divisions exist among nations and interest groups on the treaty's scope, with some advocating for production limits and others opposing such measures. The "High-Ambition Coalition," including the EU and Japan, aims to eliminate plastic pollution by 2040, proposing legally binding reductions in plastic production. In contrast, the U.S. favors individual national plans. Industry groups argue against production caps, fearing consumer cost impacts, and prefer focusing on recycling and reuse. Consumer brands support the treaty, including production limits and comprehensive waste management strategies. Final negotiations are scheduled for December in Busan, South Korea.</description>

			<title>Why High Court upheld Karnataka’s ban on hookah</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-high-court-upheld-karnatakas-ban-on-hookah-9285368/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has affirmed the state's ban on hookah bars, ruling them as an illegal service under anti-tobacco laws. The decision is based on Article 47 of the Constitution, which mandates the state to improve public health and allows for the prohibition of harmful substances. The court found that hookah smoking involves services similar to serving food or alcohol, which distinguishes it from cigarette smoking in designated zones. Consequently, the ban extends to all forms of hookah, including herbal varieties, as they require an instrument and thus constitute a service. This ruling aligns with the directive principles of state policy aimed at protecting citizens' health under Article 21.</description>

			<title>No age restriction for health insurance now: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/health-insurance-for-all-ages-9285375/</link>
			<description>In a significant move, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has mandated insurance companies to offer health insurance to all individuals, including senior citizens, irrespective of their age or pre-existing medical conditions. This directive aligns with the government's commitment to include those over 70 in the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Insurers are now encouraged to design inclusive products that provide comprehensive coverage for various groups, particularly the elderly. The change aims to improve healthcare access and affordability for seniors, addressing the challenges they face with high premiums and limited coverage due to age-related risks. The IRDAI's guidelines also emphasize the importance of continuous coverage, prohibiting insurers from refusing renewal based on previous claims and advocating for fair premium adjustments. This reform is expected to foster innovation in the insurance market, benefiting the aging population and contributing to the broader goal of universal healthcare by 2030.</description>

			<title>Why the US may sanction Netzah Yehuda, an Israeli Defence Forces battalion</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-sanction-netzah-yehuda-israel-military-9284966/</link>
			<description>The U.S. is considering sanctions against an IDF battalion over alleged human rights abuses, a first in U.S.-Israel relations. The Axios report suggests the sanctions would prevent U.S. military aid to the battalion, with Secretary Blinken indicating a decision is imminent. Israeli President Netanyahu has publicly opposed such sanctions, especially as IDF soldiers combat terrorism. The allegations stem from incidents in the West Bank, including the death of Omar Assad, a U.S.-Palestinian citizen, after IDF detention. The IDF admitted to moral failure but denied violence, despite claims of mistreatment. The Netzah Yehuda battalion, accommodating ultra-Orthodox Jewish soldiers, has faced past indictments for abuse. The potential sanctions, under the Leahy Laws, coincide with Israel's Gaza offensive and U.S. political tensions, as Biden balances support for Israel with domestic and international criticism. Congress recently voted to support Israel with $26 billion, reflecting this delicate balance.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/do-muslims-have-more-children-than-others-9284858/</link>
			<description>At an election rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized the Congress party for allegedly favoring "infiltrators" and those with larger families, hinting at the Muslim community. The article highlights the lack of recent census data on religious demographics in India. It notes that the Muslim population grew by 24.69% from 2001 to 2011, marking the slowest growth in the community's history. Additionally, it points out that Muslims have the lowest labor force and worker population ratios among all religious groups, although their unemployment rate is below the national average. The article concludes with a mention of the Indian cricket team's selection process for the T20 World Cup, focusing on the inclusion of players Sanju Samson and Shubman Gill, and the potential exclusion of KL Rahul.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: Why does sea level rise matter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/sea-level-rise-9284789/</link>
			<description>A study published in Science warns that a quarter of China's coastal land could be underwater within a century due to land subsidence and climate change, threatening millions. This issue extends globally, potentially impacting up to half a billion people. Sea levels have risen 21-24 centimeters since 1880, with the rate doubling since 1993. The acceleration could add another 20 centimeters by 2050, increasing flood risks worldwide. Global warming, causing glacier melt and thermal expansion of seawater, is the primary cause. Coastal cities in India and island nations like Indonesia face significant threats, with Indonesia relocating its capital due to flood risks. Rising sea levels also intensify storm surges and contaminate freshwater sources.</description>

			<title>SC allows abortion of 30-week foetus: What is the law on abortions, and what does the court consider?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-allows-abortion-30-week-foetus-law-9284545/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has permitted a 14-year-old sexual assault victim to terminate her nearly 30-week pregnancy, emphasizing the need to protect her physical and mental well-being. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, generally allows abortions up to 20 weeks, with exceptions up to 24 weeks under specific conditions. Beyond this, a medical board's approval is required. The court has occasionally allowed terminations past this period, considering the woman's rights and foetal viability. Recent cases highlight the liberal interpretation of the MTP Act and the evolving legal stance on reproductive rights, prioritizing women's autonomy over the rights of the unborn, marking a shift from traditional benchmarks and pointing to legislative gaps in India's abortion laws. This summary reflects the article's focus on the legal aspects of abortion in India without including unrelated content.</description>

			<title>New shoe sizing system proposed for Indians: What is ‘Bha’ and the need for it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bha-new-shoe-footwear-sizing-system-india-9284216/</link>
			<description>A comprehensive survey across India has led to the development of 'Bha', a new Indian footwear sizing system, set to replace UK/European and US sizes. The study, covering over 100,000 participants, revealed that Indians generally have wider feet, necessitating a size larger than ideal in existing systems. This mismatch has caused discomfort and health issues, particularly among women and diabetics. The proposed Bha system, based on extensive 3D foot scanning, suggests eight size categories, simplifying manufacturing and potentially fitting 85% of the population correctly. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Central Leather Research Institute (CSIR–CLRI) has recommended Bha to the Bureau of Indian Standards for approval, with implementation expected by 2025. This change aims to enhance comfort and reduce returns, especially from online sales, benefiting both consumers and manufacturers in one of the world's largest footwear markets.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-the-significance-of-earth-day-9284220/</link>
			<description>Celebrated globally on April 22, Earth Day 2024 marks its 54th anniversary, emphasizing environmental protection. UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged unity and action for climate change on this day. Originating in 1970 with 20 million protesters, Earth Day catalyzed environmental activism, leading to significant milestones like the Paris Agreement. The day underscores our collective duty to balance economic, social, and environmental needs for current and future generations. The 2024 theme, 'Planet vs. Plastics,' addresses the plastic crisis, advocating for a 60% reduction in plastic production by 2040 to mitigate its toxic impact on human health and the environment. Earth Day continues to be a pivotal platform for raising awareness and driving substantial environmental change.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘If you want to test a man’s character, give him power’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-upsc-power-ethics-morality-9283268/</link>
			<description>The article explores the concept of power, its ethical implications, and its portrayal in popular culture. It references quotes like "With great power comes great responsibility" and delves into the true test of character when one is endowed with power. Originally attributed to Abraham Lincoln, the quote under scrutiny is likely from Robert G. Ingersoll, emphasizing that power reveals true character, especially in prosperity. The article discusses power's various interpretations, from a tool for social change to a means of coercion. It highlights Hannah Arendt's view of power as legitimate collective action and contrasts it with Marxist perspectives on power as class dominance. The piece concludes by questioning whether power is the ultimate measure of character, suggesting that adversity can also reveal a person's true nature.</description>

			<title>Whether copyright can be claimed over maths and science textbooks: What Andhra Pradesh HC held</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/textbooks-copyright-law-courts-9282945/</link>
			<description>The Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled that textbooks on mathematical equations and science are not subject to copyright as they are non-literary. This decision came after Deepthi Publications, a Guntur-based publisher, challenged a 2010 government order preventing private schools and colleges from self-publishing to combat piracy. The court quashed a criminal case against the publisher, stating that their books, which are based on CBSE and ICSE syllabi and aid in competitive exam preparation, fall under the fair use doctrine. The court emphasized that educational materials used for instruction are exempt from copyright infringement, and originality is required for copyright to exist. However, the court did not quash the government order, acknowledging its intent to protect against piracy and safeguard students' futures.</description>

			<title>Why some student visa hopefuls are attempting to go to Canada on visitor visas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/canada-student-visitor-visa-delays-9282594/</link>
			<description>In response to Canada's cap on international students, many Indian students are considering entering Canada on visitor visas and then applying for study permits. This trend follows the introduction of stringent requirements for study visas, including mandatory attestation letters from the student's intended province or territory, which has led to delays and increased competition for study permits. Some educational consultants are misleading students by suggesting this indirect route, despite it being legal. However, experts advise applying directly for study visas, as the process is becoming more streamlined. They warn that the visitor visa route is complex, costly, and subject to the same cap on international students. It's recommended that students apply for study visas to avoid complications and potential legal issues.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/legislations-judicial-reforms-election-manifesto-9281605/</link>

			<title>Russia-Ukraine war: Have tanks become obsolete in modern warfare?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/russia-ukraine-war-tanks-obsolete-9281662/</link>
			<description>The Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted the vulnerability of tanks in modern warfare. Despite Russia destroying five and damaging three of the 31 M1 Abrams tanks sent by the US to Ukraine, and Ukraine losing 796 tanks since 2022, both countries continue to use and produce them. Drones, particularly FPV drones, have become a cost-effective method to target tanks' weak points. Ukraine's failure to fully protect its tanks from such attacks is one reason for its heavy losses. Tanks, however, still offer significant firepower, mobility, and psychological impact. History has shown their value in warfare, and with adequate infantry support and armor upgrades, tanks can be indispensable in urban combat. The narrative underscores the enduring relevance of tanks despite advancements in anti-tank weaponry.</description>

			<title>Attack and retaliation, anger and restraint: Connecting the dots in the Iran-Israel hostility</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-israel-hostility-9281462/</link>
			<description>On April 19, coinciding with Ayatollah Khamenei's 85th birthday, Israel launched a strike on Iran, targeting a military base near Isfahan. This action was in retaliation for Iran's April 13 drone and missile attack, which was a response to an earlier Israeli strike in Syria. The IAEA confirmed no nuclear facilities were damaged. Both nations have since maintained a silence, signaling a mutual desire to avoid escalation. The US was informed prior to the strike, suggesting coordination. Iran remains on alert, with President Raisi warning of a harsh response to any further invasions. Meanwhile, India has urged restraint from both sides, emphasizing diplomacy without issuing a formal reaction to the strike. The situation remains tense, with global implications hinging on the next moves by Israel and Iran.</description>

			<title>Influencing Severus Snape to SRK, why Lord Byron still captures our imagination</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/snape-srk-lord-byron-9281153/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the enduring influence of Lord Byron, 200 years after his death, highlighting the cultural impact of the Byronic hero archetype. This character type, known for its rebellious charm and brooding intensity, often exhibits heroic qualities alongside self-destructive tendencies. The Byronic hero has permeated pop culture, with examples ranging from Erik in "The Phantom of the Opera" to Severus Snape in the "Harry Potter" series. The archetype has also been prominent in Bollywood, influencing roles played by Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan. The article discusses the public's fascination with these complex characters, suggesting they offer an escape from societal constraints and allow for self-exploration. It also touches on the emergence of Byronic heroines, challenging traditional female characterizations and reflecting a shift towards more nuanced portrayals of women. The piece concludes by asserting the lasting appeal of Byronic characters, who captivate audiences with their depth and complexity.</description>

			<title>Punjabiyat: How Punjab can be bridge for national reconciliation between India and Pakistan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/maryam-punjabiyat-cultural-bonds-india-pakistan-punjab-9280346/</link>
			<description>Maryam Nawaz Sharif, Chief Minister of Pakistan's Punjab, emphasized her Punjabi roots while advocating for improved Indo-Pak relations at Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. She echoed her father's sentiment to foster friendship, not conflict, with neighbors. The concept of 'Punjabiyat'—a shared Punjabi identity—has been a recurring theme to bridge bilateral ties. Despite the division of Punjab in 1947 and subsequent wars, cultural bonds persist, marked by a common culture, empathy, and efforts to heal Partition's wounds. Cultural exchanges in films and music, and political initiatives like paradiplomacy, have sought to strengthen these ties. The Attari-Wagah land route, once a symbol of potential trade growth, remains a point of contention and hope for future reconciliation and mutual prosperity.</description>

			<title>How Jawaharlal Nehru won a third term in the 1962 elections, despite growing challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-nehru-won-a-third-term-despite-growing-challenges-9280350/</link>
			<description>The 1962 Indian general elections marked a significant evolution in the country's electoral process, with the Election Commission refining its procedures and recording the highest voter turnout to date. Despite Prime Minister Nehru's successful liberation of Goa and other territories from Portuguese rule, the Congress party faced its first substantial political criticism. The elections introduced key changes, including the abolition of two-member constituencies and the realignment of administrative boundaries due to the creation of new states and union territories. The Congress party emerged victorious, winning 361 Lok Sabha seats, while the opposition parties, despite their efforts, could not make a significant impact. The election also continued the practice of marking voters with indelible ink, although the experiment with photo identity cards was discontinued. Amidst the political shifts, Nehru began his third term as Prime Minister, confronting challenges such as linguistic nationalism, social unrest, and the aftermath of the Chinese invasion. His tenure, however, ended with his death in 1964, marking the longest prime ministerial term in India's history.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/musk-set-to-arrive-potential-win-win-for-tesla-and-india-some-challenges-too-9280347/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk's visit to India signals a potential $2 billion investment in a Tesla car manufacturing facility, aligning with the government's EV policy to import 8,000 electric cars at reduced duties. This move could mark a significant moment for India's auto sector, similar to Apple's impact on cell phone assembly. Musk will also discuss Starlink and his social media platform, avoiding controversies during the election period. The visit focuses on Tesla's influence on India's EV ecosystem and its potential as an export hub. Despite challenges like a small luxury car market and infrastructure needs, the new policy aims to attract global EV manufacturers and provide Indian consumers with advanced technology, supporting the 'Make in India' initiative. However, Tesla faces competition from local players and must navigate India's unique market conditions.</description>

			<title>Indian BrahMos missiles delivered to the Philippines: The missile’s significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/brahmos-missiles-philippines-development-9280055/</link>
			<description>India delivered BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines, marking a significant step in becoming an arms exporter. The $375 million deal, signed in 2022, was highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of India's growing defense exports, totaling Rs 21,000 crore this year. The BrahMos missile, developed by BrahMos Aerospace—a joint venture between India's DRDO and Russia's NPOM—stands out for its speed, range, and precision. It's a two-stage missile capable of reaching supersonic speeds and performing complex maneuvers. The missile's versatility and stealth capabilities make it a strategic asset in defense and a symbol of India's advanced military technology. Ongoing upgrades aim to enhance its range and maneuverability, with tests being conducted across all Indian Armed Forces branches. The BrahMos has also been integrated into various platforms, including land-based systems, warships, fighter jets, and submarines, demonstrating India's commitment to advancing its missile technology and defense capabilities.</description>

			<title>Is the EU’s image failing in Southeast Asia?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/eu-image-failing-southeast-asia-9279961/</link>
			<description>A survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute indicates a decline in Southeast Asia's trust in the EU's commitment to free trade and the rules-based order. Trust in the EU as a global free trade leader fell to less than 14%, and its role in upholding international law dropped to third place. Confidence in the EU's contribution to global peace and governance also decreased, with only 41% of respondents believing the EU would "do the right thing," partly due to perceptions of the EU being preoccupied with internal affairs. The EU's stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict and deforestation legislation has affected its popularity, particularly with Malaysia and Indonesia. Despite these challenges, the EU maintains a strong partnership with ASEAN, being its fourth most important dialogue partner. The survey's findings suggest the EU needs to enhance cooperation and engagement to improve its image and partnership in Southeast Asia.</description>

			<description>The indelible ink, a symbol of Indian elections, is being produced by Mysore Paints &amp; Varnish Ltd. for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with around 26.5 lakh phials prepared. This ink, containing silver nitrate, has been used for decades to prevent multiple voting and is applied on voters' fingers at polling booths. Initially marked with a glass rod, the ink's application has evolved, but its purpose remains integral to the electoral process. The ink's formula, a closely guarded secret, ensures its resistance to various cleaning agents for up to 72 hours. Manufactured since 1962, the ink is now exported to over 25 countries, with diverse application methods tailored to different electoral systems.</description>

			<title>Fourth global mass coral bleaching triggered: What are corals and why are they important?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/global-mass-coral-bleaching-triggered-9279731/</link>
			<description>The fourth global mass coral bleaching event, driven by record ocean temperatures, has been announced by NOAA. This event poses a threat to marine life and the livelihoods of millions dependent on reefs. The rise in sea surface temperature to 21.07°C in March 2023 is attributed to increased greenhouse gas emissions, with oceans absorbing 90% of this excess heat. Coral reefs, vital for marine ecosystems and human economies, are suffering as a result. Corals, particularly hard corals that build reefs, are experiencing bleaching due to stress from environmental changes. While not immediately fatal, bleaching impacts coral reproduction and increases disease vulnerability. The current bleaching event, exacerbated by El Niño, has affected over 54% of global coral areas. Scientists warn that such events may become more frequent and severe, threatening the majority of coral reefs with even a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures. Efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C by reducing greenhouse gas emissions are critical but remain challenging.</description>

			<description>The Maldives High Court has overturned the 11-year sentence of former president Abdulla Yameen on graft and money laundering charges, ordering a retrial due to an unfair trial. Yameen's involvement in the MMPRC scandal, where over USD 90 million was embezzled, led to his initial conviction. Despite his release after a Supreme Court appeal, he was re-sentenced in 2022. His convictions barred him from the 2023 presidential race, which his party won with an anti-India campaign. Upcoming parliamentary elections will test the new government's policies amidst geopolitical tensions and domestic challenges.</description>

			<description>Canadian student visa processing has been delayed since January due to policy changes, including a cap on international students and the new requirement of attestation letters from provinces/territories. Students unable to secure visas for the May intake are now aiming for September. To improve visa chances, students must ensure their program isn't banned and may use the Web Form or CAIPS for application updates. Reapplication is a last resort due to additional costs. Experts advise careful application review for an enhanced success rate, and colleges are expected to streamline attestation issuance soon.

			<title>As Aamir Khan’s fake video on Congress goes viral, how to spot disinformation amid elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/aamir-khan-video-congress-ai-elections-9279171/</link>
			<description>As India approaches the Lok Sabha elections, manipulated media and deepfake videos have surged online. Two viral videos of Aamir Khan, altered to show him endorsing political views, and a deepfake of Ranveer Singh criticizing the Prime Minister, highlight the issue. These deepfakes often use 'voice swap' technology, which can alter voice characteristics to create realistic fakes. Despite the challenge of detecting sophisticated deepfakes, the public is advised to verify sources, listen for audio anomalies, scrutinize visual inconsistencies, stay informed, and use AI detection tools like Optic's 'AI or Not' to assess content authenticity. Awareness and vigilance are crucial, especially during sensitive times like elections.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/nestle-sugar-baby-food-india-asia-africa-harmful-9278215/</link>
			<description>A report by Public Eye and IBFAN found that Nestlé's baby food products in Asia, Africa, and Latin America contain added sugars, unlike their European counterparts. Cerelac, a leading brand, has nearly 3 grams of added sugar per serving in India. Nestlé India claims to have reduced added sugars by up to 30% in the past five years. The report criticizes Nestlé for inconsistent nutritional standards and unclear sugar content labeling. It highlights the risks of added sugars, which can lead to health issues like diabetes and obesity. The WHO recommends limiting free sugar intake, and experts warn against adding sugars to baby foods due to its addictive nature and the risk of nutrition-based disorders. The study underscores the growing exposure to added sugars in low- and middle-income countries, driven by global food brands. WHO advises against added sugars before age 2, and a UNICEF-supported study found high sugar levels in many baby foods in Southeast Asia.</description>

			<title>Cost and benefit: Israel’s very expensive defence against aerial threats</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/iran-israel-missile-attack-cost-9278118/</link>
			<description>Israel's recent interception of Iranian missiles and drones, which saw 99% of over 300 projectiles neutralized, was a strategic success but came at a steep economic cost. The defense involved costly systems like the Iron Dome and Arrow interceptors, with each interception missile costing up to $100,000. The financial toll for Israel exceeded $550 million in one night, while Iran's expenses were significantly lower, at $100-$200 million for the attack. The disparity in costs highlights a strategic challenge for Israel, as Iran possesses a large arsenal capable of multiple attacks. This economic strain is prompting a shift towards more cost-effective defense technologies, such as microwave and laser beams, which promise cheaper and potentially unlimited defense capabilities.</description>

			<title>ED attaches properties of Shilpa Shetty’s husband: What is the alleged Rs 6,606 cr Bitcoin fraud?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ed-shilpa-shetty-raj-kundra-fraud-9277996/</link>
			<description>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth Rs 97.79 crore of businessman Raj Kundra under the PMLA, linked to a Bitcoin investment fraud case. The properties include a flat in Mumbai, a bungalow in Pune, and shares, all connected to Kundra and his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty. The case involves a Ponzi scheme started by Amit Bhardwaj and others in 2017, deceiving investors with promises of high returns from Bitcoin mining. Multiple FIRs led to the ED's money laundering probe. Kundra allegedly received 285 Bitcoins from Bhardwaj, which he retained after a failed deal to set up a mining farm in Ukraine. These Bitcoins are now valued at over Rs 150 crore. Kundra, previously arrested in a pornography case, was first questioned by the ED in 2018 and made a biopic about his jail experience in 2023.</description>

			<title>Did the comments of India’s envoy to Ireland breach IFS service rules?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ireland-envoy-breach-ifs-service-rules-9277730/</link>
			<description>The Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra, is under scrutiny for potentially breaching service rules after his public rebuttal to an Irish Times editorial. The editorial criticized India's democratic integrity under PM Narendra Modi, to which Mishra responded, calling the views "biased and prejudiced" and indirectly attacking the previous Congress regime. His comments have sparked demands from the opposition for his dismissal, citing a breach of the expected political neutrality enshrined in the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules. While some officials view his remarks as distasteful, they may not constitute an actionable breach. The incident has reignited discussions on the apolitical conduct expected from civil servants, referencing past controversies and reforms aimed at maintaining civil service integrity and discipline.</description>

			<title>Where India’s trade with Israel and Iran stands, and whether regional tensions could impact it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-israel-iran-trade-oil-prices-tensions-9277472/</link>
			<description>Tensions rise in the Middle East after Iran's attack on Israel, raising concerns for India due to its friendly ties with both nations. India's trade with Israel has flourished since 1992, reaching $10.7 billion in 2022-23. Meanwhile, trade with Iran, despite fluctuations, stood at $2.33 billion in the same period. India's exports to Israel include diesel and diamonds, while it imports space equipment and potassium chloride. Investment ties with Israel and Iran show Indian firms investing more in Israel than vice versa. Though the conflict's impact on petroleum prices is uncertain, shipping disruptions in the Red Sea could affect global trade routes.</description>

			<title>How Uttar Pradesh’s anti-conversion law governs religious conversion</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/up-anti-conversion-law-9276164/</link>
			<description>The Allahabad High Court upheld an FIR against a Muslim man in an interfaith live-in relationship, citing Uttar Pradesh’s anti-conversion law. The law prohibits conversions through coercion or fraudulent means, including conversion through relationships like marriage. Punishments range from 1-5 years imprisonment to 3-10 years for mass conversions. It also declares marriages for unlawful conversion void and requires a stringent process for valid conversion, including declarations to the District Magistrate. Challenges to the law's constitutionality are pending before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, cases against the law have been filed in Allahabad HC. AstraZeneca's admission of rare side effects from its COVID vaccine may lead to legal payouts.</description>

			<title>‘Voluntary Code of Ethics’ for social media platforms: What EC told X on taking down elections-related posts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/voluntary-code-of-ethics-social-media-x-takedown-9276290/</link>
			<description>X (formerly Twitter) has complied with the Election Commission of India's request to withhold four posts during the Lok Sabha elections, despite disagreeing with the orders. The EC cited violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the Voluntary Code of Ethics for social media platforms. The MCC, in effect since March 16, prohibits unverified allegations and criticism of private lives of political parties and candidates. Established after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Voluntary Code of Ethics mandates social media platforms to facilitate grievance redressal and promptly act on EC's orders. X, while complying, advocates for freedom of expression and urges the EC to publicize future takedown orders.</description>

			<title>Why has Sonam Wangchuk suspended Ladakh’s Pashmina March again?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sonam-wangchuk-pashmina-march-9276088/</link>
			<description>Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has suspended Ladakh's "Pashmina March" after initially planning it to raise awareness about grazing pasture loss. Wangchuk, known for his environmental activism, recently undertook a 21-day protest fast demanding Ladakh's inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. He highlights the loss of land to corporations and Chinese activities along the Line of Actual Control as reasons for the pasture loss. Wangchuk's activism reflects broader concerns in Ladakh, including dissatisfaction with the region's new administrative setup following its separation from Jammu and Kashmir. Despite attempts to engage with authorities, negotiations have been inconclusive, leading to Wangchuk's continued activism and protests.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/beam-sunlight-lord-ram-ayodhya-surya-tilak-9276021/</link>
			<description>A Surya Tilak ceremony was performed at the newly-built Ram temple in Ayodhya on Ram Navami, projecting sunlight onto Lord Ram’s idol's forehead. Astronomers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics designed a mirror-lens system to achieve this. They calculated the Sun’s position annually, directing beams through mirrors and lenses to focus on the idol. A 19-gear system adjusts the setup yearly based on the Metonic cycle. Due to temple construction, a modified version was used initially. Precision is crucial, with concern for cleanliness to prevent soot and dust accumulation. The final installation awaits temple completion.</description>

			<title>What is the dress code for advocates and when can it be relaxed?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/dress-code-advocates-9276050/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has exempted advocates at District and Trial courts from wearing black coats during the scorching summer months, providing relief from the heat and rapid courtroom transitions. While strict dress codes persist in higher courts, recent relaxations hint at possible changes. The Bar Council of India, empowered by the Advocates Act, regulates attire to ensure a dignified appearance. Notices often coincide with summer onset, permitting relaxation. High Courts, including Kerala, Punjab &amp; Haryana, and Delhi, have exempted gowns during summers. The Supreme Court briefly considered amending rules but dismissed the plea in 2022. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca's acknowledgment of rare vaccine side effects may lead to legal compensation.</description>

			<description>Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, two terrorist groups, were the focus of a recent ruling by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. Jaffar Ahmad Parray, detained under the Public Safety Act, was ordered released due to illegal preventive detention. Justice Rahul Bharti found flaws in the detention process, noting the police's reliance on a vague dossier and the District Magistrate's failure to consider Parray's representation. This decision echoes past cases highlighting the importance of proper procedure in preventive detention orders. In a related development, AstraZeneca acknowledged rare side effects of its COVID vaccine, potentially leading to significant legal compensations.</description>

			<title>What’s behind heavy rainfall in Dubai</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/floods-dubai-uae-9275782/</link>
			<description>The UAE experienced its heaviest rainfall ever due to a severe thunderstorm, disrupting air travel and causing flooding in homes and businesses. Dubai received 142mm of rain in one day, usually taking a year and a half to reach that amount. Flights were delayed, and popular areas like Dubai Mall were flooded. School closures and work-from-home orders were issued, while neighboring Oman also faced severe weather, resulting in casualties. Cloud seeding may have contributed to the heavy rains. Experts speculate climate change may intensify such events due to warmer temperatures increasing atmospheric moisture. However, attributing specific events to climate change is complex due to various factors.</description>

			<description>Security forces engaged in a significant operation in Chhattisgarh's Kanker district, resulting in the alleged killing of 29 Maoists, marking one of the largest such operations since the state's inception. The operation penetrated deep into Abujhmad, a dense forest area known as a Maoist stronghold. While the casualties may include members of the CPI Maoists’ Partapur Area Committee, there's speculation that local tribal militias might also have been affected. Chhattisgarh, with a significant Maoist presence, remains a focus for government efforts to combat left-wing extremism. However, concerns persist regarding human rights violations and allegations of fake encounters. Despite these challenges, the government is intensifying its efforts, aiming to eradicate Naxalism within three years.</description>

			<title>‘Embryos same as children’: How a US court judgment impacts IVF, poses a problem for Republicans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/alabama-ivf-republicans-abortion-9273693/</link>
			<description>The Alabama Supreme Court's recent ruling equating frozen embryos with children has stirred debate over reproductive rights in the US. This ruling intersects with the Republican Party's pro-life stance, raising questions about their support for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). While IVF has facilitated millions of births, the court's decision aligns with the pro-life ideology. This creates a dilemma for Republicans, who advocate for both pro-life principles and IVF. The ruling's impact extends to potential regulations on IVF procedures, prompting concerns about legal liabilities. Alabama's response was a new law signed by Governor Kay Ivey, protecting IVF providers from legal repercussions. However, the law doesn't address the broader implications of the court's decision, leaving unresolved ethical and legal questions surrounding IVF.</description>

			<description>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unveiled its election manifesto, promising to extend the Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance scheme to cover senior citizens. The scheme, launched in 2018, currently excludes seniors but with this pledge, they would gain access to its benefits. India's ageing population, expected to triple by 2050, faces increased health challenges, with many lacking insurance coverage due to low awareness and affordability. The scheme aims to alleviate out-of-pocket expenses, offering coverage for prevalent ailments like cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Government data highlights significant savings for beneficiaries under the scheme, particularly in rural areas where private healthcare costs are substantially higher.</description>

			<title>Why Goans who took Portuguese nationality are facing issues in surrendering their Indian passport</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/goa-portuguese-nationality-passport-9273722/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) memorandum from November 2022 has led to the revocation of over 100 passports from Goans who acquired Portuguese citizenship. This move has left many unable to apply for Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI). Two affected individuals have filed petitions in the High Court of Bombay at Goa, denying suppression of material information. The issue arose due to a requirement for surrender certificates, citing Section 10(3)(b) of the Passport Act of 1967. The MEA’s decision has affected thousands in Goa, prompting calls for reconsideration and amnesty from the state government. The situation remains unresolved, affecting Goans' access to OCI and their ties to their homeland.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-air-defence-system-iran-attacks-9273448/</link>
			<description>Iran launched a major attack on Israel with over 300 armed drones and missiles, retaliating against an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel's multi-layered air defense system, with support from the US, UK, France, and regional allies, intercepted 99% of the projectiles. Systems like Arrow, David's Sling, Iron Dome, and Patriot, along with fighter jets, counter different threats. Israel is developing Iron Beam, a laser-based defense. Iran notified its neighbors 72 hours before the attack, allowing Israel to prepare. US bases in the region detected the attack early. Air defense involves detection via radars, satellites, and human intelligence, followed by interception. Israeli and allied forces intercepted drones and missiles from various locations, minimizing damage.</description>

			<description>China's economy exceeded expectations with a 5.3% growth in Q1 2024, driven by service sector expansion and robust external demand. Fixed-asset investment rose by 4.5%, indicating government support despite challenges like a sluggish property market. However, the jobless rate remained low at 5.2%, raising concerns about data interpretation amidst US trade tensions and European economic slowdown. Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1%, highlighting worries about consumer spending amid stalled real estate investments. China's growth outlook is clouded by real estate weakness, global demand softness, and structural constraints, posing risks to sustained growth. The World Bank projects a tough task for Beijing to maintain Q1 momentum amidst economic challenges and geopolitical tensions.</description>

			<title>How Supreme Court’s verdict on climate change can push climate litigation in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/supreme-court-climate-change-litigation-9273166/</link>
			<description>The Indian Supreme Court recently affirmed citizens' fundamental right to be protected from climate change's adverse effects, linking it to the right to life and equality in the constitution. This landmark ruling could boost climate litigation in India, echoing a global trend of seeking legal remedies for climate-related issues. The court's decision, prompted by a case on conserving the Great Indian Bustard, underscores the urgency to address climate risks. While India has seen limited climate litigation historically, the ruling is expected to catalyze more cases. However, the effectiveness of court interventions in mitigating climate change remains uncertain due to its complex, multifaceted nature.</description>

			<title>Even if convicted, why Trump could again become US president</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/convicted-trump-president-9273092/</link>
			<description>Former US President Donald Trump faced a criminal trial for allegedly covering up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, marking the first such trial for a former president. The case revolves around a $130,000 payment made to Daniels in 2016, orchestrated by Trump's then-lawyer, Michael Cohen. Trump initially denied knowledge but later admitted to reimbursing Cohen. Prosecutors argue the payment was an illegal campaign contribution. If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison, though first-time offenders often receive lighter sentences. Despite potential legal consequences, there's no legal barrier to Trump running for president again, even if convicted. While some voters see the charges as serious, Trump has historically used legal challenges to his advantage, citing them as evidence of conspiracy.</description>

			<title>Explained: Tamil Nadu’s decentralised industrialisation model</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explained-tamil-nadus-decentralised-industrialisation-model-9272702/</link>
			<description>Tamil Nadu, ahead of its April 19 vote, stands out in India for its economic complexity, boasting a diversified GDP and employment landscape. Unlike Gujarat, TN's economy is less reliant on agriculture, with higher contributions from industry and services. The state's economic transformation is driven by medium-scale businesses rather than big corporations, facilitated by cluster-based industrialization. These clusters, like Tirupur for knitwear and Coimbatore for engineering goods, provide employment outside agriculture, reducing rural-urban migration. TN's entrepreneurial landscape spans various communities, from traditional Chettiars and Brahmins to newer entrants like Kammavar Naidus and Kongu Vellalars, fostering a diverse industrial base. This decentralized entrepreneurship, coupled with social progress indicators, underpins TN's industrial success.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: The strategic importance of Andaman and Nicobar Islands</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/anadaman-and-nicobar-island-development-strategic-importance-indian-navy-explained-9272599/</link>
			<description>India’s shift from Look East to Act East policy underscores the importance of developing its island territories, especially the Andaman and Nicobar group, in response to growing Chinese naval capabilities. Located strategically near vital maritime chokepoints, these islands offer significant potential for India's maritime security and economic interests. Challenges include infrastructure development, environmental regulations, and coordination among ministries. Key recommendations include enhancing surveillance, building infrastructure, reducing mainland dependence, and leveraging international partnerships like the Quad. Expedited development is urged through streamlined clearances, international expertise, and incentivized habitation of uninhabited islands. The article emphasizes the urgency of fortifying India's presence in the Indo-Pacific region for security and economic gains.</description>

			<title>A year after fighting broke out in Sudan, what is the state of the conflict?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sudan-war-conflict-status-one-year-9272042/</link>
			<description>Sudan, after the fall of Omar al-Bashir's regime in 2019, has been embroiled in conflict, with a military coup in 2021 further destabilizing the nation. Despite a power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian groups, tensions remain, particularly between General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF's General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The country is on the brink of famine, with half of its population requiring aid. International efforts to mediate have been unsuccessful, and the US is seeking to restart talks post-Ramadan. The UN needs $2.7 billion to assist nearly half of Sudan's 51 million people, but funding is severely lacking. Violence continues to displace millions, both internally and across borders, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</description>

			<title>Which nine-judge bench cases will the Supreme Court hear next?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/nine-judge-bench-supreme-court-9271932/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, under Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, is addressing four significant cases with a nine-judge bench. Two cases involve state powers: one on taxing mining leaseholders and another on regulating "industrial alcohol." Two longstanding cases, pending for over 20 years, are also being heard. The first concerns the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act (MHADA), amended to allow state acquisition of dilapidated buildings if 70% of occupants agree, challenged for violating property owners' rights. The second case questions the broad definition of 'industry' under the Industrial Disputes Act, which includes state activities, and seeks legislative clarity. AstraZeneca's admission of rare side effects from its Covid vaccine, "Covishield," manufactured by Serum Institute of India, is unrelated to these cases.</description>

			<title>Trump becomes first former US President to face criminal trial: What is the hush money payment case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-hush-money-payment-trial-9271912/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump is undergoing a criminal trial for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels, which could impact his political campaign. The trial, starting with jury selection, follows his indictment over 34 counts of falsifying business records. The case centers on a $130,000 payment made by Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in 2016, which Trump later admitted reimbursing. Cohen's guilty plea to federal campaign finance crimes led prosecutors to investigate Trump's involvement, considering the payment an illegal campaign contribution. Trump faces Class E felony charges, each with a potential four-year sentence, but conviction may not lead to prison time, with probation being a possibility.</description>

			<title>Pakistan man accused in Sarabjit Singh killing shot dead: What was the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pakistan-sarabjit-singh-killing-case-9271679/</link>
			<description>A Pakistani man, accused of killing Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh, was shot dead in Lahore. Singh's 1990 arrest and 2013 death sparked India-Pakistan diplomatic tensions. Alleged to be an Indian spy, Singh was sentenced to death in Pakistan but claims of torture and unfair trial arose. His execution was stayed after Indian appeals. In 2013, Singh died following a jail attack. The assailants, acquitted in 2018 due to witness hostility, were linked to LeT founder Hafiz Sayeed. Singh's death was mourned in India; the government provided compensation and jobs for his daughters. The HRCP condemned the jail assault, highlighting systemic issues in prisoner protection.</description>

			<title>Gopi Thotakura to be the first Indian space tourist: What is space tourism?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gopi-thotakura-space-tourism-indian-9271691/</link>
			<description>Gopi Thotakura is poised to be the first Indian space tourist aboard Blue Origin's NS-25 mission. A seasoned pilot and entrepreneur, Thotakura's inclusion in the six-member crew marks a significant milestone, following India's first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, in 1984. Space tourism, despite its burgeoning market projected to reach $27.86 billion by 2032, faces hurdles like exorbitant costs and environmental impacts. Thotakura, a commercial jet pilot and co-founder of a wellness center, is an avid aviator with experience in diverse aircraft. The NS-25's sub-orbital journey will briefly transcend the Kármán line, offering passengers a glimpse of space. However, concerns over rocket emissions and a 3% astronaut fatality rate underscore the risks involved in this nascent industry.</description>

			<title>Who was Thiruvalluvar, and why has the BJP invoked him in its election manifesto?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/thiruvalluvar-bjp-manifesto-tamil-nadu-9271690/</link>
			<description>The BJP's election manifesto for 2024 includes a promise to establish Thiruvalluvar Cultural Centres globally to promote Indian culture and democracy. Thiruvalluvar, a revered Tamil figure, is at the center of a political tug-of-war in Tamil Nadu. His exact historical period and religious identity remain debated, with claims of him being a Hindu, Jain, or a Dravidian sage without religious labels. The 'Thirukkural', attributed to him, is a moral guide akin to the Bhagavad Gita in Tamil culture. Controversies have arisen over his portrayal, with the BJP accused of saffronizing his image, while scholars suggest he was likely a Jain. Political appropriation of Thiruvalluvar has been a strategy by various groups to connect with Tamil heritage and influence voters.</description>

			<title>Sensex down 930 points, Nifty down 0.65%: What triggered the fall?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/sensex-nifty-fall-9271258/</link>
			<description>On April 15, India's Sensex and Nifty indices fell due to rising tensions between Iran and Israel and concerns over US interest rate cuts and the India-Mauritius tax treaty amendment. The Sensex opened at 73,315.16, down by 930 points, and the Nifty fell by 180.35 points. Despite initial losses, both indices recovered slightly by midday. The conflict escalation after Iran's attack on Israel, the anticipated US inflation rates, and the tax treaty changes have led to negative investor sentiment. Foreign portfolio investors sold over Rs 8,027 crore in equities, and analysts expect outflows to continue until there's clarity on the treaty's benefits. The market's future depends on the evolving geopolitical situation and central banks are monitoring closely. Separately, India protested against pro-Khalistan slogans at an event in Canada attended by PM Trudeau, which has strained relations.</description>

			<title>India’s hepatitis headache</title>

			<description>The WHO's Global Hepatitis Report 2024 highlights India's significant viral hepatitis burden, comparable to tuberculosis as a leading infectious killer. In 2022, deaths from viral hepatitis reached 1.3 million globally, with a slight decrease in new cases. The report focuses on hepatitis B and C, blood-borne viruses that can cause chronic disease, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. Hepatitis B is preventable through vaccination, while hepatitis C is curable with medication. India accounts for over 11% of the global hepatitis burden, with low diagnosis rates despite free national diagnosis and treatment programs. Mother-to-child transmission drives hepatitis B cases, while hepatitis C is prevalent among injection drug users. The report emphasizes the need for widespread vaccination, improved diagnosis, and a 'treat all' approach for hepatitis B, akin to HIV treatment strategies. Despite India's low-cost diagnostics and treatments, the disparity in treatment coverage compared to tuberculosis remains significant, with minimal hep B treatment and only 21% of hep C cases receiving therapy.</description>

			<title>Lamp to Lotus, Two Bullocks to Hand: a story of symbols</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/lamp-to-lotus-two-bullocks-to-hand-a-story-of-symbols-9270434/</link>
			<description>Election symbols, integral to Indian politics, help voters identify parties, especially in a country with low literacy rates. Recognized parties choose from approved symbols, while independents and unrecognized parties get 'free symbols'. The Congress initially had 'Two Bulls with Yoke on' but post-1969 splits, the 'Hand' became its symbol. The BJP, originating from the Bharatiya Jana Sangh with 'Lamp', was allotted 'Lotus' after the Janata Party's dissolution. Symbol disputes often follow party splits, reflecting their significance in political identity and legacy. The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a pivotal role in symbol allotment, ensuring symbols are secular and non-sentimental, with historical shifts marking changes in party dynamics.</description>

			<title>Explained: A short history of Iran-Israel ties and why they soured after 1979</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/history-israel-iran-relations-middle-east-9270079/</link>
			<description>Iran has retaliated against Israel for an earlier attack on its consulate in Syria, which resulted in the death of Iranian commanders. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard's response involved limited strikes, claiming damage to an Israeli military site, but no significant casualties. This escalation follows a series of regional tensions, including attacks by Hamas and Yemen's Houthis. Historically, Iran recognized Israel in 1948, but relations soured post-1979. Iran's Islamic Revolution marked a shift, with Israel viewed as an occupier and Iran challenging regional powers. Despite no direct military confrontations, both nations have engaged in proxy conflicts and strategic attacks, with the US's stance adding to the complexity amid its presidential elections.</description>

			<title>Contrast with Oct 7: Delhi’s call for de-escalation marks four key shifts in its Middle East diplomacy</title>

			<description>India's diplomacy in the Middle East, a region marked by complex politics and conflicts, has undergone significant transitions. The recent call for de-escalation after Iran's strike against Israel contrasts with India's earlier solidarity with Tel Aviv, reflecting a balanced approach to the region's state actors. India's policy now acknowledges the internal dynamics of the Middle East, moving beyond the historical West vs Middle East perspective. The emphasis is on strategic engagement with diverse regional powers, irrespective of religious considerations, aligning with India's broader interests like the India Middle East Europe Corridor. This nuanced diplomacy is crucial as India navigates the intricate and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.</description>

			<title>A brief look at Iran’s military capabilities, amid its attacks on Israel</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-military-capability-israel-attacks-9269588/</link>
			<description>On April 14, Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Syria. This escalation has heightened concerns of a broader conflict in the Middle East, especially since the Palestinian group Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023. Iran, accused by Israel of backing Hamas and other militant groups, has criticized Israeli actions in Gaza, which have resulted in over 32,000 deaths. Iran's military capabilities include over 500,000 active personnel and 200,000 reserves, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) playing a significant role. The IRGC, designated as a terrorist organization by the US in 2019, controls the Basij militia and the elite Quds Force. Iran's arsenal, one of the largest in the Middle East, features ballistic missiles and drones capable of striking any target in the region, including Israel. Recent attacks saw 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles launched, though none entered Israeli territory, and a small number of 110 ballistic missiles reached Israel. Iran also continues to advance its drone technology, with the recent development of the Mohajer-10 drone.</description>

			<description>Iran initiated a direct aerial assault on Israel with over 300 threats, including missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike in Damascus that killed 13, including an Iranian general. The IDF, with allied support, intercepted most threats, preventing significant damage. Launched from multiple countries, this unprecedented attack marks a new escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. Iran deems the matter closed post-attack, but Israel's response is pending. President Biden condemned the attack, pledging US support for Israel and calling for a G7 meeting to address the situation, adding complexity to his Middle East policy amid re-election efforts.</description>

			<title>On Ambedkar Jayanti, a look at the significance of the Mahad Satyagraha</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/ambedkar-mahad-satyagraha-9268251/</link>
			<description>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a pivotal figure in India's struggle against caste discrimination, is remembered for his leadership in the Mahad Satyagraha of 1927, a landmark event in Dalit emancipation. Despite the Bombay Legislative Council's 1923 resolution for Dalit access to public water sources, ground realities remained unchanged due to upper-caste resistance. Ambedkar's Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha, founded in 1924, aimed to combat untouchability. The Mahad conference, initially a platform for awakening among Dalits, unexpectedly turned into a Satyagraha when Ambedkar led a procession to drink water from the previously forbidden Chavadar tank. This act of defiance, coupled with the subsequent burning of the Manusmriti, symbolized the rejection of caste oppression and ignited the Dalit movement, establishing Ambedkar as a leader of the oppressed. The Mahad Satyagraha set a precedent for organized resistance against caste-based discrimination.</description>

			<title>Here’s what to know about the hunger crisis in Gaza</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hunger-crisis-gaza-9268216/</link>
			<description>The Gaza Strip is on the brink of famine six months into the Israel-Hamas war, with a crisis exacerbated by Israel's siege and military operations. The blockade, in place even before the war, severely restricted humanitarian aid and commercial imports. Following a Hamas attack on Israel, Israel tightened controls, blocking food imports and targeting Gaza's port, farms, and infrastructure, displacing the population and destroying businesses. The U.N.'s IPC warns that famine is imminent, defined by severe food scarcity, acute malnutrition in children, and related deaths. Past famines in Somalia and South Sudan were also human-made, compounded by drought and conflict. Despite the availability of aid outside Gaza, access issues and disagreements between the U.N. and Israel over aid delivery persist, with critics accusing Israel of using aid restrictions as punishment. Global pressure mounts on Israel to ensure adequate aid and civilian protection.</description>

			<title>Iran launches attacks on Israel: Who are the Iran-backed regional groups of concern?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-israel-axis-of-resistance-9268156/</link>
			<description>In a significant escalation of regional tensions, Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel on April 14. This aggressive move was in retaliation for an Israeli assault on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which resulted in the death of several Iranian generals. The attack is the latest in a series of hostilities between the two nations, with Iran accusing Israel of previous attacks and Israel condemning Iran's support for militant groups like Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas. These groups, backed by Iran, have been central to the country's strategy of regional influence and resistance against Western interests. The recent violence has raised fears of a broader conflict in a region already fraught with religious and ethnic strife, compounded by the actions of these militant organizations.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/operation-meghdoot-siachen-army-9268157/</link>
			<description>Operation Meghdoot, executed on April 13, 1984, marked India's strategic control over Siachen Glacier, outmaneuvering Pakistan. Key military figures like Gen AS Vaidya, Lt Gen CN Somanna, and others orchestrated the operation. The war game 'Exercise Walnut Cracker' was pivotal in planning, involving top brass from HQs 15 Corps. The operation's success hinged on the roles of 4 Kumaon and 19 Kumaon regiments, with the latter achieving a historic march across Zojila during winter. Author Amit K Paul's book and articles detail the operation's intricacies, including the war game's anticipation of Pakistani responses, which were ultimately deemed non-threatening. The operation's execution was seamless, with critical passes secured despite weather delays, showcasing the Indian Army's meticulous preparation and resilience. The operation remains a testament to strategic foresight and military tenacity.</description>

			<title>How the Jallianwala Bagh massacre changed the course of India’s freedom struggle</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/jallianwala-bagh-massacre-freedom-struggle-9268106/</link>
			<description>On April 13, 1919, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre became a defining moment in India's struggle for independence. British troops, under Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, fired on a peaceful gathering, with official reports claiming 379 deaths, though estimates suggest thousands. This act followed the Rowlatt Act's unrest and was a response to perceived threats of rebellion. The British initially supported Dyer, but condemnation grew as the massacre's brutality was revealed. Winston Churchill publicly decried the act, leading to Dyer's dismissal. The event shocked India, prompting Rabindranath Tagore to renounce his knighthood and Mahatma Gandhi to initiate the Non-Cooperation Movement. Historians view it as the end of moral legitimacy for British rule in India, turning victims into martyrs of nationalism.</description>

			<description>The Netflix biopic "Amar Singh Chamkila," directed by Imtiaz Ali and starring Diljeet Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra, revisits the life of the legendary Punjabi folk singer Amar Singh Chamkila, known as the 'Elvis of Punjab'. Chamkila, who dominated Punjab's music scene from 1979 to 1988, was renowned for his raw voice and songs that candidly addressed social issues. Despite facing criticism for his explicit lyrics, he amassed a loyal fanbase. Born into poverty, Chamkila's passion for music led him from aspiring electrician to a celebrated artist. His partnership with Amarjot Kaur catapulted him to fame, but his life was tragically cut short when he was murdered in 1988 at the age of 27, alongside Amarjot. The murder sparked numerous conspiracy theories, yet the case remains unsolved. Chamkila's influence endures, inspiring films, books, and a lasting legacy in Punjabi music.</description>

			<title>Regulating religious conversions to Buddhism: What is the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act ?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/gujarat-freedom-religion-act-conversions-buddhism-9267603/</link>
			<description>The Gujarat government has issued a circular stating Buddhism is a separate religion from Hinduism under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act (GFR Act), impacting religious conversions. The GFR Act prohibits conversions by force, allurement, misrepresentation, or marriage without District Magistrate's permission. Violations can lead to imprisonment and fines, with stricter penalties for women, minors, and SC/ST members. The 2021 amendment criminalizes conversion through marriage and places the burden of proof on the accused. The circular addresses non-compliance with the GFR Act for conversions from Hinduism to Buddhism, contradicting the constitutional inclusion of Buddhism within Hinduism for social welfare laws. The GFR Act's amendment faces legal challenges, with a limited stay granted against provisions concerning interfaith marriages, while the Supreme Court considers consolidating challenges to anti-conversion laws nationwide.</description>

			<title>Why text of amended tax treaty with Mauritius triggered stock sell-offs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-text-of-amended-tax-treaty-with-mauritius-triggered-stock-sell-offs-9267604/</link>
			<description>India has revised its tax treaty with Mauritius, introducing a Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to combat tax evasion and avoidance. This amendment aligns with the global Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework, aiming to prevent treaty abuse. The PPT will deny treaty benefits if the main intent of a transaction is to gain those benefits. The amendment has caused concern among Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) due to potential increased scrutiny and uncertainty about whether past investments will be grandfathered. Mauritius is a significant source of FPI for India, and the changes could impact future investment structures and lead to more litigation. The tax authorities now have the power to scrutinize transactions more closely, especially those not yet exited by investors. The amendment's implications are still unclear, and formal clarification is awaited to resolve ambiguities.</description>

			<description>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is set for a diplomatic visit to China, including a meeting with Xi Jinping, amidst EU-China trade tensions and security concerns. Scholz's trip, his second as chancellor, comes after Germany's strategic shift to reduce reliance on China, aligning with the EU's stance. Despite this, Scholz's delegation of industrial executives suggests a desire to maintain business relations. Experts highlight Germany's internal divide on China policy and expect Scholz to address geopolitical issues like China's support for Russia and military activities near Taiwan. The visit also coincides with EU scrutiny over Chinese electric vehicles, reflecting broader challenges in balancing economic interests with political positions.</description>

			<title>Why India has advised citizens not to travel to Israel and Iran</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-india-has-advised-citizens-not-to-travel-to-israel-and-iran-9267381/</link>
			<description>In light of rising tensions in West Asia, India has issued a travel advisory against visiting Iran and Israel, urging citizens to register with Indian Embassies and minimize movement. This follows a labor shift in Israel due to suspended work permits for Palestinians and Arab migrants, leading to an influx of Indian workers. Tensions escalated after a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran's embassy in Syria, killing several Iranian military advisors. Global powers, including the US, France, and Russia, have issued similar travel warnings and called for restraint to prevent further destabilization. The situation remains precarious, with potential Iranian reprisal attacks anticipated, which could provoke severe responses from Israel depending on the targets.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: What Moscow terror attack suggests about ISKP, counter-terrorism cooperation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/moscow-terror-attack-iskp-9266899/</link>
			<description>In the aftermath of the Moscow terror attack at Crocus City Hall, four Tajik suspects were arrested by Russian authorities. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility, yet without direct affiliation, leading to speculation by IS watchers about the involvement of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). Russian investigators suggested Ukrainian Special Services' involvement, citing the suspects' confessions and phone forensics. The attack, which lacked jihadist slogans or suicide bombers, seemed motivated by money rather than ideology. The incident raises questions about the credibility of IS claims and the potential shift towards mercenary recruitment. The attack's 'hit-and-run' nature signals a new urban warfare tactic, potentially inspiring lone-wolf attacks, as indicated by recent threats to European football stadiums and an FBI arrest in the US. The article underscores the weakening global counter-terrorism cooperation and the persistent threat posed by IS and its affiliates. Anju Gupta, a security analyst, emphasizes the need for thorough investigation of IS claims to understand the current terrorist threat landscape.</description>

			<description>Switzerland is set to host a peace conference in Bürgenstock on June 15-16, aiming to facilitate dialogue for a lasting peace in Ukraine, following the G7 Summit in Italy. The conference, initiated at Ukraine's President Zelenskyy's request, seeks to involve 120 countries, including India, and will discuss a roadmap for peace based on international law. Switzerland's history of neutrality and role as a mediator in global conflicts underscores its suitability for hosting such discussions. The conference marks the beginning of a process that may eventually include Russia, despite initial skepticism. India's balanced diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine and its potential role in the peace process highlight its position as a credible, non-partisan player on the global stage. The event precedes the Lok Sabha election results, offering India a chance to influence global discourse.</description>

			<title>Explained: Vietnam’s $12 billion financial fraud, for which a businesswoman has been sentenced to death</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vietnam-scam-truong-my-lan-death-penalty-9266548/</link>
			<description>Truong My Lan, a prominent businesswoman in Vietnam, has been sentenced to death for her involvement in a massive financial fraud case, considered the country's largest on record, amounting to $12.5 billion, about 3% of Vietnam's 2022 GDP. Lan, who rose from selling cosmetics on the streets to chairing a major real estate company, allegedly diverted a large sum of money from the Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB) through shell companies, following a 2011 bank merger.

The court found Lan guilty of bribery, violating banking regulations, and embezzlement, along with her accomplices, including family members. Despite efforts to fight the case, the verdict was upheld. Notably, Lan's death sentence for financial crimes, particularly as a woman, is uncommon in Vietnam.

This trial reflects the government's crackdown on corruption within the private sector, possibly to reinforce the Communist Party's control amid the sector's rapid growth and recent scandals involving high-ranking officials. The verdict is also part of broader political maneuvers, as seen in the government's "Blazing Furnace" campaign targeting corruption among influential figures, including former presidents.</description>

Apple has been sending out these threat notifications since late 2021, offering advice on protecting devices and privacy. Recommendations include updating software, using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and activating Lockdown Mode, which restricts device functions to prevent access by attackers.</description>

			<title>Why Trump has refused to endorse a national abortion ban in US</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-abortion-ban-us-9266472/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump recently stated that he believes abortion laws should be determined by individual states, distancing himself from endorsing a national ban. This disappointed some of his conservative supporters who advocate for a nationwide abortion ban. Trump's stance contrasts with the growing demand among conservative Republicans for such a ban, especially after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Critics argue that the issue should focus on protecting unborn children rather than state jurisdiction. Trump's position is seen as a political move ahead of the presidential elections, recognizing the complexity of the abortion issue and its impact on independent voters. Meanwhile, Democrats are using Trump's statement to rally support, emphasizing the importance of abortion rights in the upcoming election. Trump's stance on abortion has been inconsistent over the years, and while some view his recent statement as a moderation, it's uncertain whether he will maintain this position in the long run.</description>

			<title>Swiss women win landmark climate change case: Why is it significant?</title>

			<description>Europe’s highest human rights court recently ruled in favor of 2,000 Swiss women over 64, who sued the Swiss government for not doing enough to combat climate change. The court found that the government violated the women's right to life by failing to enact adequate climate policies and meet greenhouse gas emission goals. This landmark ruling could set a precedent for similar cases across Europe and beyond. It follows a recent decision by India's Supreme Court recognizing the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. The rise of climate litigation globally reflects a growing trend of holding governments and companies accountable for their contributions to climate change and insufficient mitigation efforts.</description>

			<description>Canada has adjusted its allocation of attestation letters for international students, which are necessary for study permit issuance. While there's a cap on visas, choosing provinces with more letters can improve chances. The allocation model aims for zero net growth, replacing each departing student with a new one. Overall, there's a 28% decrease in study permit approvals compared to last year. Certain student categories are exempt, but there's a focus on provinces with increased allocations like Alberta, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories. Traditional favorites like Ontario and British Columbia have seen decreases in allocations. Experts advise considering less popular provinces for better visa success rates.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/karnataka-hc-quash-circular-dog-breeds-9266050/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has struck down a circular issued by the Centre that aimed to prohibit the sale, breeding, or keeping of 23 "dangerous" dog breeds. The court ruled that the ban could not be imposed without appropriate recommendation from a properly constituted committee. This decision came after the Karnataka HC had previously stayed the circular on March 19, with the Calcutta HC also ordering a partial stay and the Delhi HC seeking the Centre's response to a plea challenging the circular. The Karnataka HC emphasized the need for consultation with stakeholders and criticized the lack of representation from certified breeding organizations in the decision-making process. Additionally, the court noted that a blanket ban on the specified breeds would violate rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The Calcutta HC partially stayed the circular, particularly objecting to the directive mandating the sterilization of dog breeds, which it deemed potentially fatal, especially for young puppies. In Delhi, a plea challenged the circular's sterilization mandate, arguing against its scientific credibility and legitimacy. The court there sought a response from the Centre on the matter.</description>

			<title>A Sicilian volcano is blowing smoke rings in the sky. What are volcanic vortex rings?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/mount-etna-volcano-smoke-rings-vortex-9265785/</link>
			<description>Mount Etna, Europe's largest and one of the most active volcanoes, has been producing rare volcanic vortex rings since April 2, 2024. These rings are circular smoke formations caused by the rapid release of gas, primarily water vapor, through a nearly perfect circular vent in the crater. This phenomenon, first observed in 1724, has been documented at other volcanoes worldwide. However, Etna is particularly known for its prolific production of these rings, with dozens observed daily. While the recent activity from Etna's new vent has generated hundreds, if not thousands, of smoke rings, experts clarify that it does not necessarily indicate an impending spectacular eruption. The activity from the vent may slow down due to changes in the conduit's properties.</description>

			<description>India's first Lok Sabha election in 1951-52 marked a historic moment in the country's democratic journey. It involved over 176 million electors, with the majority being unlettered, showcasing a significant act of faith in the democratic process. Led by Jawaharlal Nehru's Indian National Congress, other parties in the race included the Socialist Party, Communist Party of India, and others. The Election Commission faced unprecedented challenges in organizing the elections, including logistical issues and ensuring the participation of women voters. Despite the hurdles, the elections were a success, with a voter turnout of 45% women. The results saw the Congress winning a majority of seats, solidifying Nehru's position. The election process involved innovative measures such as colored ballot boxes and papers to accommodate the illiterate population. This election laid the foundation for India's democratic principles and remains a significant milestone in its history.</description>

			<description>The Swiss government has announced plans to host a summit on June 15-16 aimed at initiating lasting peace in Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February 2022. More than 100 countries may participate, with India among the invitees, though Russia's attendance remains uncertain. The summit is a follow-up to a plan proposed by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis. However, it's cautioned that the conference won't lead to an immediate peace deal. Talks have been complicated by differing conditions, with Ukraine insisting on an end to hostilities and Russian withdrawal from occupied territories, while Russia emphasizes "denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine. Previous peace proposals, including a 10-point plan by Ukraine and a 12-point plan backed by China, have failed to gain traction. Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis stressed the importance of Russian involvement in the peace process, even if they're not present at the first meeting.

			<title>The path Ambedkar showed: Why lower castes embrace Buddhism</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/the-path-ambedkar-showed-why-lower-castes-embrace-buddhism-9264683/</link>
			<description>The Gujarat government has stated that conversions from Hinduism to Buddhism in the state require prior approval from the district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003. Thousands of Dalits, especially in Gujarat, convert to Buddhism annually, with approximately 2,000 conversions reported in 2023. This practice has historical roots dating back to Dr. B R Ambedkar's conversion in 1956 and beyond, as Buddhism emerged as a response to the orthodox Vedic religion, offering an alternative to the caste system. Ambedkar saw Buddhism as a revolutionary path to challenge caste-based discrimination. The conversion to Buddhism by lower castes continues to be significant across India, symbolizing not only emancipation but also following in Ambedkar's footsteps.</description>

			<title>History of Sulthan Bathery, which Kerala BJP chief wants renamed as Ganapathyvattam</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/kerala-bjp-wayanad-sulthan-bathery-ganapathyvattam-tipu-sultan-9264627/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the renaming of Sulthan Bathery, a town in Kerala's Wayanad district. K Surendran, the state BJP president and candidate for the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, argues that renaming the town is inevitable due to its association with Tipu Sultan, whom he characterizes as a historical figure responsible for massacres of Hindus and Christians.

Surendran proposes renaming Sulthan Bathery to Ganapathyvattam, reflecting its historical connection to a stone temple built by Jains from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the 13th century. The temple, originally known as Ganapathyvattam, was partially destroyed during Tipu Sultan's invasions in the 18th century.

Tipu Sultan used the Maha Ganapathy temple as a battery or store for weapons, leading the British to refer to it as "[Tipu] Sultan's Battery," which eventually evolved into the name Sulthan Bathery.

The controversy over renaming the town is part of the broader political landscape in Wayanad, where Surendran is contesting against sitting MP Rahul Gandhi (Congress) and Annie Raja (CPI). The article also mentions the historical context of Tipu Sultan's invasions in the region, including the destruction of temples and churches and forced religious conversions.

In addition to the discussion on Sulthan Bathery, the article briefly mentions the upcoming announcement of exam results by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education.</description>

			<title>What is the ‘Adjudicating Authority’ that has confirmed ED’s attachment of Rahul-Sonia-promoted company’s assets?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/adjudicating-authority-ed-attachment-rahul-sonia-company-assets-9264546/</link>
			<description>The Adjudicating Authority under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) has confirmed the attachment of assets worth Rs 751.9 crore belonging to the National Herald newspaper, which is promoted by the Congress party. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) provisionally attached these properties in November 2023 in a PMLA case against Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) and Young Indian (YI), the companies behind the newspaper. YI, controlled by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, is being investigated for allegedly acquiring AJL and its assets for a low price with Congress's involvement.

The PMLA allows attachment of properties suspected to be acquired from criminal proceeds, and this order must be confirmed within 180 days by the Adjudicating Authority. The accused can still use the property until confirmation, but once confirmed, the ED can take possession. Challenging this confirmation is possible through appeals.

Confiscated properties can remain inaccessible until the trial's conclusion, potentially deteriorating over time. Vehicles may also deteriorate while in storage, with the ED paying for parking and potentially losing more than the vehicle's value in rent.</description>

			<title>New FDTL rules: Why DGCA has asked airlines to indicate their implementation timelines</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/pilot-fatigue-new-fdtl-rules-aviation-9264258/</link>
			<description>The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has deferred the implementation of new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules, which include measures for managing stress and fatigue among pilots. Originally planned for June 1, the rules were postponed due to resistance from airlines. The DGCA has asked airlines to indicate when they can implement the new rules, with a tentative date expected by May 8. The new regulations aim to improve fatigue management through longer weekly rest periods and fewer night landings. However, airlines argue that implementing these rules would require hiring more pilots and could impact operations. Fatigue and stress among pilots have raised concerns about flight safety, prompting the need for better regulations. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates countries to establish fatigue management regulations. The DGCA's current regulations require airlines to establish limitations on flight duty time within its framework. The regulations also prohibit flight crew from accepting assignments that exceed prescribed limitations and require carriers to maintain a system for managing fatigue reports.</description>

			<title>Why revival of 1864 abortion law could resonate in US politics beyond Arizona</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-revival-of-1864-abortion-law-could-resonate-beyond-arizona-9263251/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of Arizona recently made a significant decision, resurrecting a law from 1864 that practically bans most abortions in the state. Under this law, doctors who perform abortions could face 2-5 years in prison. The law, dating back to the Civil War era, prohibits abortion unless it's necessary to save the mother's life, without exceptions for rape or incest. Although initially blocked by a court after Roe v Wade in 1973, recent legal developments have paved the way for its enforcement. The ruling has reignited the polarizing abortion debate, particularly as it may influence the upcoming presidential election in Arizona, a crucial swing state. Notably, even some Republicans have criticized the ruling, expressing concerns about its implications. This decision adds to a growing trend of states imposing stricter abortion laws, with implications for national politics.</description>

			<title>Why Supreme Court’s curative petition relief for Delhi Metro is significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-supreme-courts-curative-petition-relief-for-delhi-metro-is-significant-9263211/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) doesn't have to pay nearly Rs 8,000 crore to Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a Reliance Infrastructure company. This overturns a 2021 judgment upholding the arbitral award in favor of DAMEPL. The dispute arose from a public-private partnership between DMRC and DAMEPL for the Delhi Airport Metro Express. Despite operational issues and termination of the agreement, DMRC won the case after multiple court battles. The SC exercised its "extraordinary powers" in a curative writ petition to correct a "fundamental error" in its judgment, restoring the 2019 position and relieving DMRC of the payment obligation. This rare use of curative jurisdiction, initiated by the government, raises questions about judicial restraint and investor confidence.</description>

			<title>In allowing curative plea in DMRC case, how Supreme Court pushes the envelope</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/allowing-curative-plea-how-supreme-court-pushes-the-envelope-9263351/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has set aside a 2017 arbitral award that required the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to pay almost Rs 8000 crore to Reliance Infrastructure, owned by Anil Ambani. This move expands the scope of the court's intervention powers beyond constitutionally prescribed processes. The court invoked a sparingly used judicial innovation called a curative writ petition to revive a 2019 Delhi High Court judgment that partially set aside the Delhi Metro arbitration award. This innovation is used to correct a "grave miscarriage of justice." However, using this jurisdiction in a commercial case raises concerns about the finality of the court's ruling. The court's intervention also contradicts the principle of minimum judicial interference, which it has promoted since 2015. The prolonged timelines of court interference in commercial matters also raise questions about the enforcement of arbitral awards in India. Even the Supreme Court, in its curative writ, acknowledges the risks of its intervention and cautions against its routine use.</description>

			<title>How invasive species threaten natural ecosystems</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/invasive-species-natural-ecosystems-threaten-9262836/</link>
			<description>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration sought assistance from the Wildlife Institute of India to manage the growing population of chital (spotted deer) in Ross Island. Chital were introduced to the island by the British and have since spread rapidly, impacting the native flora and fauna. This highlights the issue of invasive species, which can threaten biodiversity and ecosystems. In India, the legal definition of invasive species is narrower, focusing on non-native species that threaten wildlife or habitats. Examples include certain fish and turtle species, like the red-eared slider, which are often abandoned by exotic pet owners and pose threats to local species. Invasive species disrupt ecosystems by dominating food chains and outcompeting native species. The proliferation of chital in the Andamans has affected native vegetation regeneration. Globally, invasive species have significant economic costs, with billions of dollars lost annually due to damage to ecosystems. For instance, the cotton mealy bug has severely impacted cotton crops in India.</description>

			<title>What is CDP-SURAKSHA, govt’s new digital platform to disburse subsidies to horticulture farmers?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cdp-suraksha-horticulture-9262824/</link>
			<description>The BJP-led government in India has introduced a new platform called CDP-SURAKSHA to distribute subsidies to horticulture farmers as part of the Cluster Development Programme (CDP). This initiative aims to boost the horticulture sector, which contributes significantly to India's agricultural gross value addition. The CDP-SURAKSHA platform is digital and allows for instant subsidy disbursal to farmers' bank accounts using e-RUPI vouchers. It integrates various databases and allows farmers to order planting material online. Once the material is delivered, farmers verify it, and the subsidy is released. The platform streamlines the subsidy process, ensuring farmers receive support upfront. Currently, the platform is being piloted in selected clusters, with plans for further expansion.</description>

			<title>When is a moveable asset ‘sizable’ enough to declare? It depends, says Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/when-is-a-moveable-asset-sizable-enough-to-declare-it-depends-says-the-supreme-court-9262793/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently ruled on a case concerning the disclosure of a candidate's private information in election papers. The court emphasized a candidate's right to privacy, stating that voters do not have an absolute right to know every detail of a candidate's private life. It was clarified that candidates are not required to disclose every movable property they own unless it constitutes a "sizable asset" or reflects upon the candidate's lifestyle relevant to their candidacy.

The case involved Karikho Kri, whose election to the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly was challenged for alleged non-disclosure of certain assets in his nomination papers. The High Court had declared Kri's victory void, citing non-disclosure of a vehicle as constituting "undue influence." However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision, stating that not every non-disclosure automatically amounts to a defect of substantial nature.

The Supreme Court emphasized that each case must be judged on its own facts, with no strict rule regarding the non-disclosure of movable assets. Factors such as the value of the assets and their reflection on the candidate's lifestyle are considered. For instance, the non-disclosure of high-priced assets reflecting a lavish lifestyle may constitute undue influence, whereas the non-disclosure of simple, low-value assets may not.

In summary, the Supreme Court's ruling highlights the importance of considering the relevance and impact of non-disclosed assets on a candidate's candidacy, rather than applying a blanket rule to all cases of non-disclosure.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/new-3-d-map-universe-nature-dark-energy-9260670/</link>
			<description>The universe's expansion, known since Edwin Hubble's observations in 1929, was found to be accelerating in the late 1990s, leading to the hypothesis of "dark energy." This mysterious force comprises about 70% of the universe. Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provided promising data. Operating for three years, DESI captured light from 6 million galaxies, creating a detailed 3D map of the universe's evolution. It revealed an increasing expansion rate, challenging established theoretical models. Initial hints suggest fluctuations in dark energy density, which could revolutionize our understanding of the universe, potentially leading to new physics. Further analysis of DESI data is underway, offering hope for deeper insights into dark energy's nature.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/brazil-supreme-court-judge-elon-musk-9260553/</link>
			<description>The Brazil Supreme Court has been investigating the spread of fake news, implicating Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Musk has accused the judge of betraying Brazil's constitution and people, calling for his removal. The dispute arose when the court ordered certain X accounts to be blocked, which Musk refused to comply with, citing concerns about free speech. The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, accused Musk of obstructing justice and inciting crime, leading to an investigation into Musk's alleged misuse of X. This isn't the first time the court has clashed with social media giants; similar conflicts have arisen with former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and others. While Musk claims to support free speech, X has complied with some government requests in the past, despite disagreement. The Indian government, for example, has issued orders affecting X, leading to compliance despite objections. However, Musk has also faced criticism for allegedly silencing critics on his platform.</description>

			<title>How and why US wants to establish a time standard for the Moon</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/lunar-time-standard-moon-9260264/</link>
			<description>The White House has directed NASA to establish a time standard for the Moon, called Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC), by the end of 2026. This standard will help coordinate activities on the lunar surface for international bodies and private companies. While most timekeeping on Earth is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), lunar time is different due to factors like gravity affecting the passage of time. A unified time standard is crucial as more countries plan lunar missions in the coming years. To create LTC, atomic clocks may be deployed on the Moon to account for its unique time flow. These clocks will need to be strategically placed to accommodate variations caused by factors like the Moon's rotation and local mass concentrations. Just as atomic clocks on Earth vary in rate from the Equator to the poles, lunar atomic clocks will provide a precise time standard for lunar activities.</description>

			<title>What is a citizen’s ‘right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change’, underlined by Supreme Court?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/the-citizens-climate-rights-9258997/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently ruled that people have a "right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change," citing Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. This decision emerged from a case concerning the conservation of the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB). The Court's judgment, delivered on March 21 by a three-judge Bench, emphasized the intersection of climate change and human rights, urging states to address climate impacts through a rights-based approach.

The case originated from a petition filed by conservationist M K Ranjitsinh, seeking protection for the GIB and the Lesser Florican, both facing extinction. The Court modified its previous order regarding overhead transmission lines in the GIB habitat, directing experts to assess the feasibility of undergrounding power lines in specific areas.

In its ruling, the Court highlighted India's obligations to combat climate change and emphasized the importance of integrating environmental principles into constitutional rights. While recognizing the absence of specific legislation on climate change, the Court affirmed the existence of a "right against adverse effects of climate change" for Indians.

Legal experts view the judgment as significant for environmental jurisprudence, expanding Article 14 to include environmental and climate justice issues. They anticipate its influence on public discourse and future government policies, setting a precedent for recognizing broader public interests where existing laws fall short.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/zaporizhzhia-attacked-again-the-nuclear-risks-from-reckless-military-action-9258996/</link>
			<description>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant faced a crisis following a drone strike, prompting concerns about nuclear safety amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia blamed Ukraine for the attack, but responsibility remains unclear. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed damage to one reactor but stated nuclear safety hadn't been compromised. However, the incident raised fears about the integrity of the containment system. The plant's reliance on external power sources poses a risk, with previous outages highlighting vulnerabilities. While nuclear reactors are designed to withstand certain impacts, deliberate attacks could pose unprecedented threats. The situation underscores the avoidable nature of the crisis, with the IAEA unable to prevent military actions near nuclear facilities. Director General Grossi urged restraint to avoid future attacks, emphasizing the inherent danger of targeting nuclear sites.</description>

			<title>When Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha formed coalition governments — what history says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/hindu-mahasabha-muslim-league-coalition-9258342/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent exchange between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge regarding historical associations of political parties in India. Modi suggested that the Congress manifesto had similarities to the Muslim League's agenda, prompting Kharge to accuse the BJP's ancestors of supporting the British and the Muslim League during India's freedom struggle.

Kharge's claims were then examined for historical accuracy. It's noted that during the 1937 provincial elections, Congress performed well, forming ministries in various provinces. However, non-Congress governments were formed in Punjab, Sindh, and Bengal. In Bengal, the Muslim League formed a coalition government with Fazlul Huq's Krishak Praja Party (KPP), despite Congress being the single largest party.

The article highlights that both the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha entered alliances with the British during the Quit India Movement of 1942. While Congress leaders were imprisoned for their involvement in the movement, the League and Mahasabha continued supporting the British war effort, aiming to maintain their political power. 

Additionally, the article mentions ideological similarities between the League and the Mahasabha, as noted by scholars and leaders like Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. This ideological convergence translated into political alliances, such as the League-Mahasabha coalition governments in Sindh and NWFP during the Quit India Movement.

Overall, the article provides historical context to the claims made by Modi and Kharge, highlighting the complex political landscape during India's freedom struggle and the alliances formed by various parties at that time.</description>

			<title>How solar eclipse will help study Sun, why Aditya L1’s view will not be blocked</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/solar-eclipse-study-sun-aditya-l1-view-india-9258200/</link>
			<description>A team of Indian solar physicists is gearing up to closely observe the Sun during Monday's total solar eclipse to gain insights into the solar atmosphere. Led by Dipankar Banerjee from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), the team will be stationed in Dallas, Texas, to conduct experiments and observations during the eclipse. They aim to study the solar corona using ground-based telescopes and the coronagraph onboard the Aditya L1 spacecraft, which is stationed 1.5 million km from Earth. The eclipse provides a unique opportunity to study the Sun's corona, particularly its inner regions, which are normally difficult to observe due to scattered light. By employing narrowband imaging and conducting on-band and off-band observations, the team hopes to investigate high-frequency oscillations and variable phenomena in the solar atmosphere. These observations will also aid in calibrating instruments on the Aditya L1 spacecraft and provide insights into the Sun's activity during the current solar cycle.</description>

			<title>K Kavitha’s bail plea rejected: What court said on PMLA’s bail concession for women</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/pmla-bail-concession-women-k-kavitha-plea-9257301/</link>
			<description>The Delhi trial court denied interim bail to Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in the Delhi excise scam case. The court cited the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which allows bail for women but is not mandatory for the court to follow. Section 45 of the PMLA sets strict bail standards, placing the burden of proof on the accused. While there's an exception for women, it's not automatic and depends on specific conditions, such as not being a flight risk or tampering with evidence or witnesses. Kavitha's lawyer argued she should be granted bail based on a Delhi High Court ruling, but the trial judge disagreed. The judge found Kavitha not only engaged in evidence destruction but also influenced witnesses, making her ineligible for bail under the PMLA.</description>

			<title>How anti-money laundering law came to have a vast scope, granting police powers to ED</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/anti-money-laundering-law-pmla-evolution-9257298/</link>
			<description>The Congress party's manifesto, titled "Nyay Patra," for the Lok Sabha election, vows to end the weaponization of laws, arbitrary searches, and indiscriminate arrests if elected. It promises to enact a law on bail emphasizing "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" across all criminal laws. This proposal appears to be a critique of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which have been criticized for their stringent provisions leading to prolonged incarceration without trial. The PMLA, enacted to combat money laundering and terror financing, was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2021, despite criticism. The law grants the ED sweeping powers, including stringent standards for bail, which have been controversial. Amendments made in 2009 and 2012 expanded the ED's powers, allowing coercive action against politicians accused of corruption. These amendments, particularly those in 2012, have been criticized for leading to prolonged pre-trial incarcerations. Critics argue that such extended detentions before trial effectively amount to serving a sentence even before conviction.</description>

			<title>Remembering Mangal Pandey, and the legacy of the revolt he inspired</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/mangal-pandey-legacy-revolt-1857-9256891/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of Mangal Pandey's actions in triggering the Revolt of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny or the First War of Indian Independence. It highlights how the annexation of Awadh by the British and the introduction of new rifles with controversial cartridges sparked discontent among Indian soldiers like Pandey, leading to his mutiny and subsequent execution. The revolt spread across India, involving various groups opposed to British rule. Despite their bravery, the rebels were ultimately defeated by the superior British forces. The article also mentions the subsequent changes in British governance in India, including the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown and the Queen's Proclamation aimed at improving relations with Indian subjects. It concludes by calling for greater recognition of Mangal Pandey's sacrifice and the significance of the Revolt of 1857 in Indian history.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘An unexamined life is not worth living’, by Socrates</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-unexamined-life-worth-socrates-9256767/</link>
			<description>The article delves into the famous quote attributed to Socrates, "An unexamined life is not worth living," and its implications. It discusses how Socrates, through his student Plato, criticized the Athenian democracy for its susceptibility to manipulation and blind faith in the Greek gods, which ultimately led to his trial and execution. The quote emphasizes the importance of introspection, ethical evaluation, and questioning one's beliefs and actions.

The article explores both the merits and critiques of Socrates' assertion. On one hand, self-reflection can lead to personal growth, moral clarity, and societal critique. On the other hand, critics argue that the examined life may not always lead to happiness or fulfillment, as it can be arduous and may not be accessible to everyone. Moreover, excessive self-analysis could lead to cynicism or narcissism.

In conclusion, while Socrates' notion of self-examination holds relevance in a world inundated with information and conflicting perspectives, its practicality and potential pitfalls warrant consideration.</description>

			<title>Two reasons why food inflation may soften in the months ahead</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/food-inflation-lower-reasons-9256361/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted the challenge posed by food price pressures to reaching the inflation target of 4%. Despite overall inflation standing at 4.85% in March, retail food inflation was at 8.52%, persistently high for nine consecutive months. However, there's optimism for a decrease in food inflation in the coming months, potentially allowing the MPC to consider cutting interest rates. This optimism stems from a global decrease in food prices, driven by bumper harvests and restored supply lines post disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine War. Specifically, the prices of vegetable oils have risen, but cereal prices continue to decline. Importing wheat is becoming more feasible due to lower global prices, potentially easing pressure on domestic production. Similarly, pulses imports have surged due to dry weather in major growing states, but the weakening El Niño weather pattern brings hope for improved rainfall and agricultural output. This could mitigate food inflation and benefit the government post the upcoming elections.</description>

			<title>Why Mexico suspended diplomatic ties with Ecuador after dramatic embassy raids</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/mexico-suspends-ties-ecuador-embassy-raids-9256265/</link>
			<description>Mexico has severed diplomatic ties with Ecuador after Ecuadorian police raided Mexico's embassy in Quito to arrest former Vice President Jorge Glas, who had been granted asylum there. President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador condemned Ecuador's actions as a violation of international law. Glas, convicted twice for corruption, has been at the embassy since December 2023. Despite Mexico's complaints, armed police entered the embassy and took Glas into custody. Glas alleges political persecution by Ecuador's center-right government. Mexico's progressive President Obrador's criticism of Ecuador's political violence strained relations even before this incident. The expulsion of Mexico's ambassador from Ecuador exacerbated tensions. Ecuador's justification for the embassy raid was Glas's "imminent flight risk" and the inability to diplomatically resolve the situation. The situation has drawn criticism from Latin American governments and the US State Department. Mexico plans to file a complaint with the International Court of</description>

			<title>What makes a total solar eclipse so rare?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/total-solar-eclipse-rare-9255264/</link>
			<description>On Monday, April 8, a rare event will occur: a total solar eclipse crossing North America, passing over Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Total solar eclipses are infrequent for any specific location, with about 400 years passing between occurrences. Solar eclipses happen when the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow. There are four types: total, annular, partial, and hybrid. Total eclipses occur when the Moon fully blocks the Sun, allowing observers to see the Sun's corona. Annular eclipses happen when the Moon is at its farthest point from Earth, leaving a ring of sunlight visible. Partial eclipses occur when the Moon blocks only part of the Sun. Hybrid eclipses shift between total and annular as the Moon's shadow moves. Solar eclipses occur during a new moon, but not every month due to the Moon's tilted orbit. Solar eclipses are relatively rare events, with total eclipses occurring about once every 18 months. The umbral shadow during a total eclipse covers less than one percent of the Earth's surface, making it rare for many people to witness it.</description>

			<title>Why Botswana threatened to send 20,000 elephants to Germany</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/botswana-elephant-population-germany-9255371/</link>
			<description>Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi recently warned of sending 20,000 elephants to Germany in response to Germany's proposed stricter limits on importing hunting trophies. Botswana, home to a significant elephant population, has been a sanctuary for these animals due to stable governance and conservation efforts. However, the increasing elephant population has led to conflicts with humans, damaging property and crops, and posing risks to livelihoods. Botswana has attempted to mitigate this by donating elephants to other countries, but with limited success. In 2019, Botswana lifted its ban on trophy hunting, arguing it helps control elephant numbers and benefits the local economy. Critics, including animal rights advocates, argue against trophy hunting, citing ethical concerns and disputing its economic benefits. Despite differing opinions, experts stress the need for nuanced approaches to conservation, considering the complex dynamics involved.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/nehru-bose-maulana-barkatullah-indias-first-prime-minister-kangana-ranaut-9254798/</link>
			<description>Kangana Ranaut recently asserted in an interview that Subhas Chandra Bose, not Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister. She referenced the Provisional Government of Azad Hind (Free India) formed by Bose in 1943 as evidence. This government, established in Singapore, claimed authority over Indian civilians and military personnel in British Southeast Asian colonies and was recognized by Axis powers during World War II. Similarly, a Provisional Government of India was formed in Kabul in 1915 by the Indian Independence Committee. These provisional governments aimed to legitimize resistance against British rule but lacked widespread international recognition and control over Indian territory. Despite their symbolic significance, they cannot be considered the legitimate government of India due to these factors.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court recently halted an Allahabad High Court decision that deemed the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004 unconstitutional. The High Court had ruled the Act violated secularism and fundamental rights by focusing on Islamic studies over modern subjects. There are around 16,513 recognized and 8,449 unrecognized madrasas in Uttar Pradesh, serving approximately 27 lakh students. The Act, enacted in 2004, has faced scrutiny, especially since 2017, with allegations of irregularities, foreign funding, and potential terror links. Concerns also arose over the payment of salaries to modern subject teachers in these madrasas. The discontinuation of a modernization scheme further fueled protests by teachers demanding overdue salaries.</description>

			<title>Why green hydrogen presents both major opportunities and significant challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-green-hydrogen-presents-both-major-opportunities-significant-challenges-9253910/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in India has introduced a scheme worth Rs 496 crore to support pilot projects focusing on green hydrogen as a vehicle fuel and developing infrastructure like refuelling stations. Major Indian commercial vehicle manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Volvo Eicher, and Ashok Leyland are intensifying efforts to develop hydrogen-powered trucks and buses. Indian energy companies are also scaling up green hydrogen production to reduce costs and compete with other fuels. Green hydrogen, produced from water electrolysis using renewable energy, offers emission-free production and has significant potential for reducing carbon emissions in transportation. The MNRE scheme aims to validate the technical feasibility and economic viability of green hydrogen-powered vehicles and refuelling stations. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) offer a promising alternative to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for heavy-duty trucks due to their lighter weight and increased payload capacity. However, challenges such as high production costs, storage, and transportation constraints need to be addressed for widespread adoption. Specialized cylinders for storing green hydrogen and robust safety standards are essential for handling and retailing the fuel. While advancements in battery technology may affect the long-term viability of green hydrogen-powered vehicles, efforts to develop infrastructure and reduce costs continue.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/bengaluru-and-cape-town-a-tale-of-two-cities-hit-by-water-scarcity-9253919/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe water shortage crisis faced by Bengaluru, comparing it to Cape Town's water scarcity situation in 2015-18. Dr. T V Ramachandra from the Indian Institute of Science highlights that if Bengaluru continues to mismanage its water supply, it could face a situation worse than Cape Town's. Both cities experienced critically low reservoir levels due to below-average rainfall, rapid urbanization, and inefficient water use practices. Measures such as water rationing and restrictions on water usage have been implemented in both cities. Bengaluru's BWSSB has imposed penalties for violators of water usage rules. The crisis disproportionately affects the poor, increasing health risks due to the lack of water for sanitation. However, BWSSB officials believe the situation will improve soon.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nato-at-75-purpose-members-challenges-9253642/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on its 75th anniversary. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that NATO is bigger, stronger, and more united than ever with 32 member-states, but it also faces challenges, notably from Russia. NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members, based on the concept of collective security, where an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Its purpose was to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War. NATO has expanded over the years, including former Eastern Bloc countries. Despite concerns about its relevance post-Cold War, NATO has adapted and continues to serve various functions, including stabilizing Europe. Tensions have arisen within NATO, particularly regarding military spending and strategic coordination. Disagreements over funding and future commitments persist, especially regarding the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The article also briefly mentions the announcement of exam results by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education.</description>

			<title>4.8 magnitude earthquake hits New York City: why it is a rare event in the region</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/why-earthquakes-are-rare-in-new-york-9253858/</link>
			<description>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.8 struck near New York City, surprising residents in an area that rarely experiences significant seismic activity. The quake's epicenter was located in New Jersey, and tremors were felt from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts. While there were no reports of damages, the event raised questions about why earthquakes are uncommon in the region. Unlike the West Coast, where tectonic plates meet, the East Coast, including New York, is not situated near plate boundaries. However, there are fault lines in the area, such as the Ramapo Fault in New Jersey and smaller ones under Manhattan. These faults result from geological processes millions of years ago, and while they have become less active over time, they can still release stress, causing occasional earthquakes. The exact fault line responsible for the recent quake is unclear, as studying the region is challenging due to the lack of nearby plate boundaries.</description>

			<title>As Shoma Sen gets bail, what is the status of other accused in Elgaar Parishad case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/shoma-sen-bail-elgaar-parishad-case-9253584/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently granted bail to former Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, who had been arrested six years ago by the Pune Police for alleged Maoist links in the Elgaar Parishad case. This decision was influenced by Sen's prolonged detention and the fact that her trial has not yet commenced. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not oppose her bail, signaling a shift in their stance.

The Elgaar Parishad case stems from the Koregaon Bhima violence of January 1, 2018, where Maoist groups allegedly organized a gathering the day before the violence erupted. Sixteen arrests were made in connection with the case, with accusations against lawyers, activists, and academics for alleged Maoist affiliations.

Among the accused, eight have been granted bail, including prominent figures like poet P Varavara Rao, lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj, and former IIT professor Anand Teltumbde. However, some remain incarcerated pending appeal hearings or ongoing legal processes.

The courts have been considering the extended detention of the accused without a trial, with several directives issued to expedite legal proceedings. Despite the bail granted to some, others, including journalist-activist Sudhir Dhawale and lawyer Surendra Gadling, remain behind bars as their cases are still pending.

The judicial process is ongoing, with the courts emphasizing the need for timely trials and addressing concerns regarding lengthy incarcerations without convictions.</description>

			<title>Why are more German firms moving from China to Japan?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/german-firms-moving-china-japan-9252780/</link>
			<description>The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan, along with KPMG in Germany, conducted a survey revealing that 38% of German companies are moving production facilities from China to Japan, with 23% also relocating regional management functions. This shift is primarily motivated by economic, political, and social stability concerns. Factors such as rising costs in China, geopolitical tensions, and uncertainty about future trade relations with the US are prompting these changes. Japan is seen as a stable choice, offering a qualified workforce, advanced infrastructure, and legal protection of intellectual property. Additionally, lower wages compared to Germany and a more appealing living environment contribute to Japan's attractiveness for businesses. These findings highlight the growing trend of German companies favoring Japan as a destination for their operations.</description>

			<description>The Income-tax Department opened return filing utilities on its portal from April 1, 2024, marking the beginning of Assessment Year 2024-25. Around 23,000 taxpayers filed their income tax returns within the first three days. This early availability contrasts with the previous year when filing functionalities were delayed until May. The Department has operationalized filing functionalities for commonly used segments like ITR-1, ITR-2, and ITR-4, with ITR-6 for companies also available from April 1. However, some experts advise waiting for the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Form 26AS, typically updated by the end of the financial year, to ensure accurate filings. These documents contain crucial details regarding TDS/TCS, interest, dividend, and other financial transactions. The delay in updating these documents is due to processes involving reporting entities like banks and financial institutions. The Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education also announced the results for the first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE) today, with over 10 lakh students appearing for the exams held from March 1 to April 20.</description>

			<title>Why RBI has kept policy rates unchanged</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-policy-rates-unchanged-9252604/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) recently convened and decided to maintain the repo rate at 6.5%, with a policy stance of 'withdrawal of accommodation'. This decision, reached with a 5:1 majority, reflects confidence in the economy's overall outlook, despite challenges in certain sectors. The RBI projects GDP growth at 7% and retail inflation at 4.5% for fiscal 2024-25. While inflation has moderated broadly, elevated food inflation persists, although core inflation remains benign. The RBI aims to anchor inflation to the target sustainably. It anticipates headline inflation to ease in the coming months due to favorable factors like harvests and expectations of a normal monsoon. The RBI will likely maintain a cautious approach, prioritizing inflation alignment while supporting growth. GDP growth for FY25 is forecasted at 7%, with geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions posing risks. Despite challenges, the economy shows resilience, supported by robust manufacturing and steady investment. Inflation is projected at 4.5% for FY25, with concerns over climate-related risks and potential price pressures in nonperishable food categories. Supply-side interventions have helped temper prices, particularly in cereals. Global commodity price upticks and pressures on deposit growth may influence lending and deposit rates, with external benchmark lending rates expected to remain stable. Overall, the RBI's stance reflects a balanced approach to managing inflation and supporting economic growth.</description>

			<title>Before SC’s 9-judge bench, question of whether states can levy excise duty on industrial alcohol</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/before-sc-can-states-levy-excise-duty-on-industrial-alcohol-9252199/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is currently deliberating on whether states have the authority to regulate and tax industrial alcohol. The case involves a complex interplay between state and central powers, with arguments focusing on constitutional provisions and past judicial decisions.

The central question revolves around whether states can control industrial alcohol, which is used in manufacturing processes and not for human consumption, or if this power rests exclusively with the central government.

Historical legal interpretations have played a significant role in shaping the arguments. For instance, a previous Supreme Court ruling in 1989 restricted states' authority to regulate only those alcoholic beverages intended for human consumption.

However, there are precedents, such as the Tika Ramji case in 1956, which suggest that states may have broader powers in certain industries under the Concurrent List.

Senior Advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, representing the State of Uttar Pradesh, contends that states should retain authority over industrial alcohol unless the central government explicitly asserts control through relevant legislation.

The outcome of this case could have significant implications for both state revenues and the regulatory framework governing industrial alcohol.

The next hearing is scheduled for April 9. In unrelated news, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will release the results of the Intermediate exams on April 12, accessible through the official website using roll number and date of birth.</description>

			<title>Katchatheevu controversy: Why international agreements are best left alone in domestic politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/katchatheevu-controversy-why-international-agreements-are-best-left-alone-in-domestic-politics-9252195/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent controversy stirred by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's amplification of an RTI reply regarding the Katchatheevu issue, accusing the former government of "callously giving away" the island to Sri Lanka. While External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar reiterated the government's stance on the issue, he did not suggest reopening the 1974 bilateral pact on Katchatheevu, citing that it's "sub judice." The BJP's actions are seen as a political move in Tamil Nadu, but they have raised concerns both in India and Sri Lanka, especially regarding India's international credibility and diplomatic image. The article emphasizes the importance of upholding agreements and warns against unilateral actions that could harm India's reputation and relations with neighboring countries. Sri Lanka has responded maturely to the statements, emphasizing that the issue was settled long ago. The article concludes by urging caution against actions that could be exploited by external powers and damage India's diplomatic standing.</description>

			<title>Why Tamil Nadu is claiming disaster relief funds from the Centre</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/tamil-nadu-karnataka-disaster-relief-funds-centre-9251548/</link>
			<description>Tamil Nadu has filed a suit at the Supreme Court, alleging that the Centre is withholding national disaster relief funds following Cyclone Michaung and subsequent floods in December 2023. Similarly, Karnataka has also filed a plea claiming denial of disaster relief funds for drought-affected areas. Both states seek additional funds from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), arguing that the Centre's inaction violates the Disaster Management Act of 2005.

The NDRF, established after the 2004 tsunami, provides funds for calamities such as cyclones, droughts, and floods. States facing calamities beyond their coping capacity can request funds from the NDRF. The process involves assessments by Inter Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) and committees, culminating in a decision by a high-level committee chaired by the Home Minister.

Tamil Nadu seeks Rs 37,902 crores for Cyclone Michaung damage and Rs 2,000 crore for relief operations. Karnataka seeks Rs 18,171 crores for drought relief. Both states allege delays in fund release violate citizens' rights to equality and dignity. The legal battle follows similar disputes between opposition-ruled states and the Centre, including Kerala's recent claim regarding bill assents and borrowing powers.</description>

			<title>Why has Israel killed Iranian generals in Syria and who are the Quds Force?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/quds-force-israel-killed-iranian-generals-syria-attack-9250654/</link>
			<description>Israeli warplanes conducted an airstrike on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria, resulting in at least 13 deaths, including General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior leader of the Iranian Quds Force. Israel confirmed its involvement in the strike but denied that the building had diplomatic status. Iran has vowed revenge, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stating they will make Israel regret the attack. The Quds Force is the paramilitary and intelligence wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG), established in 1979 after the Islamic Revolution. The IRCG operates alongside Iran's regular armed forces and is known for its military actions, espionage, and cybersecurity attacks. Tensions between Iran and Israel stem from geopolitical rivalries, with Iran viewing Israel's alliance with the US as a threat to its security and interests. The Quds Force supports militant groups like Hezbollah and has been active in Syria's civil war, aiding the Syrian government and opposing US interests. General Zahedi, killed in the strike, was a close associate of Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated by the US in 2020. The strike raises concerns about escalating violence in the region, as both sides have engaged in proxy conflicts and covert operations against each other.</description>

			<title>Why Uttarakhand govt wants to evaluate the risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/risk-from-glacial-lake-floods-9249967/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand government has formed expert teams to assess the risk posed by five glacial lakes prone to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the region. These events have caused disasters in recent years, necessitating efforts to minimize their occurrence. The National Disaster Management Authority has identified 13 such lakes in Uttarakhand out of 188 in the Himalayan states. GLOFs occur due to sudden water discharge from glacial lakes, often triggered by factors like glacial calving or landslides. Studies show rising global temperatures increase the risk of GLOFs, threatening millions of people and infrastructure. Uttarakhand has experienced major GLOF incidents, prompting the categorization of sensitive lakes into risk levels. The state's increasing temperatures further exacerbate the risk.</description>

			<title>Massive earthquake hits Taiwan: What is the Ring of Fire?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/earthquake-taiwan-ring-of-fire-9249383/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent earthquake in Taiwan, the largest in at least 25 years, which resulted in nine deaths and over 1,000 injuries. Taiwan sits along the Pacific "Ring of Fire," known for frequent seismic activity due to tectonic plate interactions. The Ring of Fire encompasses numerous tectonic plates, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Taiwan specifically experiences earthquakes from the Philippine Sea Plate interacting with the Eurasian Plate. The article also explains how volcanoes form in the Ring of Fire through subduction, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. This geological phenomenon results in the high concentration of earthquakes and volcanoes in the region.</description>

			<title>Why Vistara pilots are unhappy before the Air India merger</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/vistara-flight-disruptions-9248889/</link>
			<description>Vistara, a Tata group-owned airline, has experienced over 150 flight cancellations and numerous delays due to pilots going on mass sick leave, resulting from dissatisfaction with a new compensation structure. This structure reduces guaranteed pay for pilots, leading to fears of lower salaries. The situation worsened after an ultimatum from management, causing more pilots to call in sick. Additionally, concerns about career progression and rostering practices have contributed to the unrest. Vistara's CEO held a meeting with pilots, promising improvements in rostering and addressing merger concerns. Flight disruptions are expected to ease soon. The incident highlights potential challenges for the Tata group as it merges airlines, including people integration and HR issues. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce intermediate exam results today, affecting over 10 lakh students.</description>

			<title>Katchatheevu and Wadge Bank: The story of two India-Sri Lanka agreements from a half century ago</title>

			<description>The article discusses the resurgence of the Katchatheevu issue by the BJP in Tamil Nadu ahead of the Lok Sabha election. The Katchatheevu island, located between India and Sri Lanka, has been a point of contention since the 1970s. In 1974, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India signed an agreement ceding the island to Sri Lanka but allowing Indian fishermen access for certain purposes. The article explores the historical background of the dispute, including the ownership claims by both countries and subsequent agreements.

It also highlights political maneuvering around the issue, including the role of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi and current Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in attempting to address the matter. Despite demands from various political parties in Tamil Nadu to retrieve Katchatheevu, Sri Lanka has refused to link its status to the fishing rights issue.

The BJP has criticized the Congress and DMK for allegedly surrendering the island to Sri Lanka, but concrete steps towards reclaiming it have not been taken. The matter remains pending in the Supreme Court, with the Indian government citing it as sub judice. Sri Lankan officials have stated that there has been no official communication from India regarding the issue.</description>

			<title>Why the Supreme Court gave bail to AAP’s Sanjay Singh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-the-supreme-court-gave-bail-to-aaps-sanjay-singh-9247688/</link>
			<description>AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh was granted bail by the Supreme Court after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) didn't argue its case on merits. Singh was arrested in October 2023 on money laundering charges related to the alleged Delhi excise scam. While Singh isn't accused of corruption, the ED accused him of laundering proceeds from the scam. The case largely relies on statements from businessman Dinesh Arora, who allegedly implicated Singh. Singh's lawyer argued that Arora's statements lacked consistency and evidence. The ED didn't oppose bail, opting for a concession instead of arguing on merits.</description>

			<title>What is Kallakkadal, which has flooded houses in Kerala’s coastal areas?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-kallakkadal-which-has-flooded-houses-in-keralas-coastal-areas-9247767/</link>
			<description>High sea waves, known as swell waves, have flooded hundreds of houses in coastal areas of Kerala, particularly in Alappuzha, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram districts since March 31. Relief camps have been set up for affected communities. This phenomenon, called Kallakkadal in Malayalam, is coastal flooding during the pre-monsoon season caused by swell waves on the southwest coast of India. Unlike tsunamis, which result from underwater disturbances like earthquakes, swell surges are formed by distant storms generating high waves that travel thousands of kilometers. The recent flooding was triggered by a low atmospheric pressure system in the South Atlantic Ocean. Kallakkadal often lacks precursors or local wind activity, making advance warning challenging, although systems like the Swell Surge Forecast System provide some early alerts. Despite being mistaken for tsunamis, Kallakkadal is distinct and is expected to impact Kerala and other western coast regions for the next few days. INCOIS has issued alerts for coastal areas prone to sea erosion to take precautionary measures.</description>

			<title>Turkey’s opposition scores ‘historic victory’ against President Erdogan’s party in local elections: What happened?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/turkey-opposition-victory-erdogan-elections-9247193/</link>
			<description>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) suffered a significant defeat in nationwide local elections, marking its largest electoral setback since Erdogan came to power. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) won municipalities in 36 of Turkey’s 81 provinces, including the five largest cities: Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Antalya. These elections were widely viewed as a referendum on Erdogan and his party, with the AK Party losing the popular vote for the first time. 

The AK Party's defeat was largely attributed to Turkey's struggling economy, marked by high inflation rates that have led to a cost of living crisis for many citizens. The opposition's victory is expected to bolster their morale and strengthen their position as they were previously divided after their defeat in the 2023 presidential and parliamentary elections. 

The decisive win of Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul solidifies his role as a prominent opposition figure and potential future presidential contender. This defeat could also signal a turning point in Erdogan's political career, potentially thwarting his plans to extend his rule beyond 2028.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sanjay-singh-bail-ed-allegations-aap-delhi-excise-9247016/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Sanjay Singh, a senior AAP leader, in a case related to the alleged Delhi excise scam. This decision came after the Enforcement Directorate did not oppose it. Singh was arrested in October 2023 and accused of being a "key conspirator" in the scam, where private entities allegedly received wholesale liquor business in exchange for kickbacks. The ED claimed the scam's proceeds amounted to over Rs 292 crore, some of which allegedly funded AAP's election campaign in Goa. Singh's alleged involvement included forming a special purpose vehicle to launder money generated from the scam. Previously, lower courts had denied Singh bail, stating there was prima facie evidence of his involvement in money laundering.</description>

			<title>Amidst Lok Sabha elections, why fake news, disinformation and fact-checking matter</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/lok-sabha-polls-fake-news-fact-checking-9246488/</link>
			<description>April 2 is International Fact-checking Day, established by the International Fact-checking Network in 2016 to recognize the importance of accurate information. In the midst of elections in India, various threats like misinformation, generative AI images, and deepfakes are prevalent. Fact-checking has never been more crucial, but what exactly is it? Fake news, defined as fabricated stories lacking verifiable facts, sources, or quotes, has a long history, notably with "yellow journalism" in the US in the 1890s. Although Donald Trump popularized the term "fake news," its documented use dates back to the 1890s. Misinformation is false information shared unknowingly, while disinformation is knowingly spread falsehoods. Fact-checking involves verifying facts, essential to combatting false and misleading information. With the democratization of mass communication tools, misinformation thrives, particularly in regional languages in India. Here are some tips to safeguard against fake news: check the source, verify news stories on credible outlets, verify images, and rely on fact-checking websites.</description>

			<title>Why Supreme Court barred unregulated soil extraction for linear projects</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-supreme-court-barred-unregulated-soil-extraction-for-linear-projects-9245830/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently overturned a 2020 notification from the Environment Ministry exempting extraction of ordinary earth for linear projects, like road and railway construction, from needing Environmental Clearance. The exemption was challenged for being arbitrary and bypassing legal procedures. The NGT instructed the Ministry to review the exemption, but it was only acted upon after the matter reached the Supreme Court. The Court found the exemption to be arbitrary and lacking in necessary safeguards. This isn't the first time such exemptions have faced legal scrutiny. Similar instances in the past have led to judicial intervention. In other news, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce the results of the first and second year intermediate public exams today.</description>

			<title>Utkala Dibasa or Odisha Day: Story of the state’s formation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/utkala-dibasa-odisha-day-state-formation-9245492/</link>
			<description>April 1 is celebrated as Odisha Day, marking the formation of the state of Odisha in 1936. It was carved out from Bihar and Orissa Province, with the addition of Koraput and Ganjam districts from the Madras Presidency. Odisha is one of the two Indian states with a formation date predating Independence, the other being Bihar, and it was the first state to be consciously created on linguistic basis.

The region now known as Odisha has a history dating back 3,000 years, with various local dynasties ruling over it. In 1568, it lost its independence to the Bengal Sultanate, later coming under Maratha and British rule. Despite movements for linguistic states emerging in the late 19th century, it remained part of the Bengal Presidency until 1936.

The movement for Odisha's creation gained momentum in the late 19th century, focusing on cultural revival and harking back to its ancient past. The Utkal Sabha, formed in 1882, and the Utkal Sammilani, formed in 1903 under Madhusudan Das's leadership, played significant roles. With the Indian National Congress adopting linguistic reorganization of provinces as a key agenda, Odisha Province was created in 1936 after extensive inquiries by three committees.

The new province was carved from Bihar and Orissa Province, Madras Province, and Central Provinces. However, 26 princely states within the Eastern States Agency remained until Independence. Today, Odisha celebrates its history and cultural heritage on April 1.</description>

			<title>What is ‘Havana syndrome’, linked to a Russian intelligence unit?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/havana-syndrome-russian-intelligence-unit-9245485/</link>
			<description>The Kremlin has dismissed a joint media investigation suggesting Russian military intelligence might be behind the 'Havana syndrome', a mysterious health condition affecting US diplomats and spies worldwide. The investigation implicates a Russian unit in using "directed energy" weapons to target US officials' brains. The syndrome, characterized by symptoms like hearing sounds, nausea, and memory loss, originated in Cuba in 2016, spreading to other countries including China and India. While initially suspected to be a "sonic attack," further research suggests high-powered microwaves may be involved, possibly causing permanent brain damage. The syndrome's occurrence in India has been limited, with suspicion of foreign involvement.</description>

			<title>On road to Viksit Bharat, India should target per capita, not aggregate, GDP. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/viksit-bharat-india-gdp-per-capita-china-comparison-economy-growth-9245440/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the economic growth trajectories of China and India since 1990. At the start of the period, China's per capita GDP was lower than India's, but over the next few decades, China experienced rapid growth, becoming the world's second-largest economy by 2010. In contrast, India's growth was slower, and while its nominal GDP increased, its relative position in the global economy improved only marginally.

The article emphasizes the importance of per capita GDP alongside aggregate GDP, particularly for countries like India with large populations. It discusses the significance of sustained economic growth rates over time and highlights China's remarkable transformation, both in terms of aggregate and per capita GDP.

India aims to achieve developed status by 2047, and improving per capita GDP is crucial for this goal. While India is currently classified as a lower-middle-income country and China as an upper-middle-income country, both nations aspire to reach higher income brackets in the future.

Overall, the article underscores the importance of sustained economic growth, particularly in terms of per capita income, for achieving developmental goals and enhancing global stature.</description>

			<title>What is the ‘Click here’ trend on X, and why has it been criticised?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/click-here-trend-meme-alt-text-criticism-9243358/</link>
			<description>The "Click here" trend on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) has gained traction among major accounts like BJP, Congress, AAP, Barcelona, and PSG. It involves posting rectangular photos with white backgrounds and black text saying "Click here," accompanied by an ALT box that opens to display additional text when clicked. This trend has been used for jokes, marketing, and spreading slogans.

X promotes this as a way to improve accessibility for visually impaired users, as screen readers can read the alt text accompanying images. Alt text also aids in SEO by helping Google understand webpage content. However, some have criticized the trend for misusing accessibility features, such as when major brands like McDonald’s and Red Bull used it for memes instead of its intended purpose.

Critics argue that using alt text for jokes or unrelated information undermines its accessibility purpose. This controversy highlights the importance of content creators understanding and using alt text appropriately. Studies have shown a significant lack of alt text usage across websites and social media, indicating a need for better awareness and implementation of accessibility features.</description>

			<title>Did Congress ‘give away’ Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/katchatheevu-island-modi-nehru-congress-dmk-9242985/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently criticized the Congress for its decision to relinquish the island of Katchatheevu, calling it "eye-opening and startling." This criticism stems from documents suggesting that the Congress, under Indira Gandhi's leadership, did not prioritize the island's importance and even considered giving up claims to it. Katchatheevu, a small uninhabited island between India and Sri Lanka, holds significant political resonance in Tamil Nadu, where it is a hot-button issue. 

Historically, Katchatheevu was controlled by various entities, including the Jaffna kingdom of Sri Lanka and the Ramnad zamindari of India. However, in 1974, as part of the Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime agreement, Indira Gandhi ceded Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka, believing it held little strategic value and to strengthen ties with Sri Lanka. This decision sparked protests, particularly in Tamil Nadu, where concerns about fishing rights and livelihoods persist.

Since then, there have been ongoing demands, particularly from Tamil Nadu politicians, to retrieve Katchatheevu. Efforts have included legal petitions and appeals to the central government. However, the Union government's stance remains largely unchanged, asserting that no Indian territory was ceded, and sovereignty was not relinquished. The issue continues to be contentious, with little action taken by the government due to the complexities involved, as stated by the former Attorney General.

In Tamil Nadu, this issue remains politically charged, with leaders like MK Stalin of the DMK urging Prime Minister Modi to address the matter. However, concrete steps towards reclaiming Katchatheevu have yet to be taken.</description>

			<title>Crashes, blowout, leadership shake-up: What explains the Boeing MAX’s issues?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/boeing-crashes-blowout-leadership-resign-safety-troubles-9242971/</link>
			<description>Boeing is facing significant challenges with its 737 MAX aircraft, leading to a top-tier management shake-up. CEO David Calhoun will step down at the end of the year, while Stan Deal, head of commercial airplanes, has been replaced by Stephanie Pope. The company's chairman will also be replaced. These changes come after a series of safety concerns, including a recent midair door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9.

The incident, which caused an emergency landing, highlighted ongoing issues with the aircraft's safety. Critics argue that Boeing's focus on profits over quality may be at the root of these problems. The company's philosophy shifted after its merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, prioritizing cost optimization and efficiency. Boeing has also faced challenges with the quality of parts, including those manufactured by suppliers like Spirit AeroSystems.

Despite these challenges, Indian carriers have ordered a significant number of 737 MAX aircraft. The Indian aviation regulator is closely monitoring the situation, conducting inspections and staying in touch with Boeing and airlines operating the aircraft.

In other news, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce the results of the Intermediate exams on April 12, accessible through the official website using roll number and date of birth. Last year, the pass percentages were 61% for first year and 72% for second year.</description>

			<title>Remembering Vaikom satyagraha, a 100 years later</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/remembering-vaikom-satyagraha-a-100-years-later-9241758/</link>
			<description>The article recounts the Vaikom Satyagraha, a significant non-violent protest that began on March 30, 1924, in the temple town of Vaikom, Travancore. This movement was part of a larger struggle against caste discrimination and for temple entry rights for lower castes, employing Gandhian methods of civil disobedience.

In the early 20th century, despite educational advancements among lower castes like the Ezhavas, societal and ritual discrimination persisted, with upper castes dominating government jobs. The agitation for temple entry was initiated by Ezhava leader T.K. Madhavan in 1917, gaining momentum with the involvement of the Indian National Congress and Mahatma Gandhi's support.

The satyagraha focused on gaining access to roads around the Vaikom temple rather than the temple itself. Despite arrests and counter-agitations, the protesters remained steadfast. The death of the Maharaja of Travancore in 1924 and subsequent negotiations led by Gandhi resulted in a compromise in 1925, opening three of the four roads to all castes.

The movement, which lasted over 600 days, demonstrated unity across caste lines and highlighted the issue of untouchability in India. Although the final compromise was seen as inadequate by some, including Periyar, the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation by the Maharaja of Travancore was a landmark victory, abolishing the ban on temple entry for marginalized castes.

The article also mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce Intermediate exam results on April 12, 2024, with the exams having taken place from March 1 to April 20, 2024. Last year's pass percentages were 61% for the first year and 72% for the second year, with girls outperforming boys. The results will be available on the official website.

This summary captures the essence of the article, highlighting the historical context, key events, and outcomes of the Vaikom Satyagraha, as well as providing a brief update on an unrelated educational announcement.</description>

			<title>Jacob Zuma banned from running in South Africa elections: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/jacob-zuma-banned-south-africa-elections-9241472/</link>
			<description>South Africa's Election Commission has disqualified former President Jacob Zuma from running in the country's upcoming elections in May due to his 2021 conviction and imprisonment for over a year, which under the constitution bars him from holding public office. Zuma, who has until April 2 to appeal the decision, leads the new uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which is showing potential to challenge the African National Congress's (ANC) dominance in polls. Despite the disqualification, Zuma is expected to continue his campaign against the ANC. His political career includes serving as president from 2009 to 2018, and his tenure was marked by controversies including corruption allegations and a significant relationship with the Gupta family, leading to accusations of state capture. Zuma resigned in 2017 amidst political pressure and was later imprisoned in 2021 for refusing to appear at a corruption inquiry, although he was released on medical parole after a few months.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: Why US allowed UNSC resolution on Gaza ceasefire to pass</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-expert-explains-why-us-allowed-unsc-resolution-on-gaza-ceasefire-to-pass-9240986/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant development in the UN Security Council (UNSC), where the US abstained from vetoing a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and the release of all hostages. This move is notable because historically, the US has used its veto power to support Israel. The abstention reflects a shift in US domestic politics, where there is a growing division over the country's stance on Israel, particularly in light of the upcoming presidential election. President Biden's administration is considering the Arab and Muslim vote, as well as the left wing of the Democratic party, which have been critical of Israel's actions.

The abstention also signals a change in the US's approach to Israel at the international level. Despite the US's long-standing support for Israel, there have been instances, such as during the Obama administration, where the US has distanced itself from Israeli policies. The UNSC resolution, while prescriptive, faces limitations in enforcement if the targeted country does not comply, as is the case with Israel.

The article also touches on the broader US-Israel relationship, suggesting that despite the current political messaging, the fundamental partnership between the two countries, including aid and defense cooperation, is unlikely to deteriorate. The US's commitment to Israel remains strong, exemplified by a 10-year, $38 billion aid program and joint projects like the Iron Dome.

The situation is further complicated by the internal politics of both countries, with the US Republicans seeking to capitalize on the situation and the Democrats distancing themselves from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu while maintaining support for Israel itself.

In summary, the US's abstention in the UNSC is a significant political message that reflects changing dynamics within US domestic politics and its international relations with Israel. However, it is not expected to fundamentally alter the longstanding US-Israel alliance or resolve the ongoing conflict. The article concludes with insights from Arun K Singh, a former Indian Ambassador to Washington DC and Tel Aviv.</description>

			<title>Why Good Friday is observed, and why its date changes every year</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/good-friday-jesus-christ-significance-origin-9240703/</link>
			<description>Good Friday is a significant day for Christians, marking Jesus Christ's crucifixion. Despite its somber origins, it's called "Good" because it represents the day Jesus made a sacrifice for humanity's sins. The term "Good" historically signifies a day of religious observance. The date of Good Friday varies annually, aligning with the first Sunday after the full Moon following the spring equinox. This variability is due to the method used to calculate Easter, which is independent of the Earth's actual motion around the Sun and time zones. Different Christian denominations may observe Easter on varying dates, with the Eastern Orthodox Church typically celebrating it later due to the Julian calendar. Good Friday is observed with various traditions worldwide, including re-enactments and church services, to honor Jesus's sacrifice and teachings. The Holy Week leading to Easter also includes Palm Sunday, commemorating Jesus's entry into Jerusalem.</description>

			<title>With less than 150 Great Indian Bustards remaining in the wild, what’s driving their extinction?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/great-indian-bustard-threats-conservation-power-9240502/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has decided to revisit its April 2021 directive that mandated burying all power lines in habitats of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB), a critically endangered bird, due to the central government's argument that the order is "practically impossible to implement" over extensive distances. The court has set up a seven-member committee to suggest measures to conserve the GIB and determine crucial areas where power lines might need to be buried.

The GIB, with fewer than 150 remaining in the wild, faces severe threats from power lines that criss-cross its habitats in the Kutch and Thar deserts. These regions are also key to India's renewable energy expansion due to their solar and wind energy potential. In 2020, a Wildlife Institute of India study estimated that power lines in the area kill about 84,000 birds annually, with the GIB being particularly vulnerable due to its size and frontal vision limitations.

Initially, the Supreme Court ordered that power lines in critical GIB habitats be buried to mitigate this threat, disregarding the associated costs. However, the central government has since raised concerns about the feasibility of this approach, citing high costs, technical challenges, and safety issues. They argued that underground cables are impractical for long-distance high-voltage power transmission and emphasized the importance of these areas for renewable energy, vital for meeting India's energy demands and international climate commitments.

In light of these challenges, the Supreme Court has indicated it may narrow the scope of its order from covering 88,636 sq km to prioritizing 13,696 sq km of the most critical habitat areas for the GIB in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The expert committee is expected to submit its recommendations by July 31. This case highlights the complex balance between developmental goals and wildlife conservation.</description>

			<title>What explains the frequent disagreements between state governments and Governors?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/state-government-governors-powers-disagreements-9240141/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing conflict between the Kerala state government and the Governor, reflecting a broader issue of friction between state governments and Governors across India. Here's a summary:

- **Kerala's Conflict**: The Kerala government has approached the Supreme Court, challenging the withholding of assent to several Bills by the President and the Governor. The state alleges that the Governor referred seven Bills to the President without any stated reason, some pending for up to two years. The Left Democratic Front-led government contends that this act is unconstitutional and lacks good faith.

- **Governor's Role**: The Governor, though intended to be an apolitical figure acting on the council of ministers' advice, holds constitutional powers like assenting to state Bills and determining majority deadlines. However, there's no clear protocol for public engagement between the Governor and the state when opinions differ, traditionally managed by mutual respect.

- **Historical Friction**: Instances of conflict have included decisions on government formation, majority deadlines, Bill approvals, and public criticism of state administrations. Notable events include the dissolution of the J&amp;K Assembly in 2018, the short-lived Maharashtra government in 2019, and various comments and actions by Governors in West Bengal, Nagaland, and Kerala.

- **Allegations of Central Influence**: Since the 1950s, there have been accusations that the Centre uses the Governor's position to destabilize state governments. Dismissals of state governments have occurred frequently, especially between 1971 and 1990, but have decreased with the rise of coalition governments and regional parties.

- **Experts' Views**: Constitutional experts argue that Governors have become political appointees, leading to a fundamental flaw in the Constitution. The Governor is answerable only to the Centre, not the people, which creates a conflict of interest.

- **Lack of Reforms**: Despite various commissions recommending reforms to the Governor's selection and tenure, including impeachment provisions, no government has implemented these suggestions.

- **Unrelated Case**: The article also mentions the arrest of Ajit P Menon, a close aide of the Cox and Kings owner, in connection with a Rs 400 crore Yes Bank fraud case.

This summary captures the essence of the article, highlighting the tension between state governments and the role of Governors in India's political landscape. If you need more details on any specific part, feel free to ask!</description>

			<title>Museum files lawsuits to ‘protect’ dignity of Michelangelo’s David: A look at Italy’s cultural heritage code</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/lawsuits-michelangelo-david-italy-cultural-heritage-code-9240185/</link>
			<description>Michelangelo's David, completed in 1504 and housed at the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, is a seminal piece of Italian Renaissance art. Recently, concerns have emerged about the statue's religious and political significance being undermined by the proliferation of souvenirs in Florence that inappropriately focus on David's genitalia. In response, Cecilie Hollberg, the gallery's director, has initiated legal actions under Italy's cultural heritage code, which protects national treasures from disparaging and unauthorized commercial use. This code allows cultural institutions to demand a concession fee for reproductions and ensures that uses align with the artwork's cultural purposes.

Recent legal precedents include a 2023 ruling against GQ Italia for an unauthorized magazine cover featuring David, and a 2022 decision that prohibited a German company from selling a puzzle of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man. These cases illustrate a shift towards enforcing longer-term protections for artworks beyond the typical copyright terms specified by the Berne Convention, which protects artworks for the artist’s lifetime plus 70 years. Once copyright expires, artworks usually enter the public domain, although Italy's approach under its cultural heritage code might challenge this standard, as it extends protections indefinitely. This ongoing legal framework development is testing the balance between public domain rights and cultural preservation.</description>

			<title>PM Modi speaks of returning Rs 3,000 crore attached by ED to West Bengal’s poor: How ED attaches cash</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-ed-west-bengal-cash-attach-procedure-9240001/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considering legal avenues to return approximately Rs 3,000 crore seized by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in West Bengal to the state's impoverished citizens. This statement was made during a conversation with Amrita Roy, a BJP candidate, and was later criticized by the TMC for allegedly breaching the Model Code of Conduct.

The article explains how the ED handles seized assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED conducts searches with a warrant, seizing assets with independent witnesses present. Previously, seized cash was held in fixed deposit accounts until case resolution, with the funds being returned with interest if the accused was acquitted, or deposited into the government treasury upon conviction. Valuables like gold were stored in lockers.

In 2018, the process was streamlined, and now seized funds are deposited directly into the treasury via personal deposit accounts, without accruing interest. The attachment aims to prevent the accused from benefiting from the assets until the trial concludes.

The ED has 180 days post-attachment to secure confirmation from the Adjudicating Authority. Confirmed attachments allow the ED to take possession, even issuing eviction notices for immovable property. However, these orders can be contested in the PMLA Appellate Tribunal and higher courts.

The article also details how the ED manages properties of no immediate use, such as appointing a custodian or auctioning post-trial. It outlines the ED's rights to claim profits from businesses and rent from residences attached during trials. Changes to the handling of attached vehicles are also mentioned, allowing the accused to use them while paying rent set by the transport department.

Lastly, the article briefly touches on a viral video of cricketer Virat Kohli patting Rohit Sharma during a match, unrelated to the main content. 

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided and my last update in 2021; for the most current details, it's best to refer to the latest reports or official statements.</description>

			<title>Kerala govt goes to SC over Governor withholding assent to Bills: The issues and the law</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/governors-assent-to-state-laws-9239214/</link>
			<description>The Kerala government has approached the Supreme Court challenging the actions of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and President Droupadi Murmu regarding the withholding of assent to several state bills. The Governor withheld assent to seven bills, some for up to two years, and referred them to the President, who withheld assent to four bills without providing reasons. Kerala argues that this practice is unconstitutional and lacks good faith, asserting that it subverts the functioning of the state legislature and undermines its legislative authority as outlined in Articles 200 and 201 of the Indian Constitution.

Article 200 allows the Governor three options after a bill is passed by the state legislature: assent, withhold assent, or reserve it for the President's consideration. There is no specified timeline for these actions, which has led to prolonged periods of inaction. The President, under Article 201, can withhold assent but must return the bill with recommended amendments for reconsideration by the state legislature.

This legal struggle highlights the ongoing conflict between state governments led by opposition parties and Governors appointed by the central government. Similar issues have arisen in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Punjab, with state governments challenging the Governors' refusals to assent to legislation, suggesting a pattern of political rivalry and interference that potentially disrupts state governance.

The Supreme Court previously indicated that the term "as soon as possible" implies a constitutional obligation for timely decisions on bills, yet it has not set a definitive timeline. This issue remains central to the Kerala government's petition, as it seeks a resolution to ensure that state legislatures can function effectively without undue delay or obstruction from the Governor or the President.</description>

			<title>Why thousands of doctors are protesting in South Korea</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/doctors-south-korea-protests-reason-9238739/</link>
			<description>In South Korea, thousands of junior doctors have been on strike for approximately six weeks, protesting a government proposal to significantly increase medical school admissions and the number of physicians. This action has led to disruptions in hospital operations nationwide, with cancellations of surgical procedures and emergency rooms turning away patients.

The junior doctors are protesting poor working conditions and inadequate pay, insisting these issues be resolved before increasing the physician count. They argue that the plan to increase the number of junior doctors, rather than hiring more senior staff, will exacerbate the problem due to their longer working hours and lower labor costs. Reports suggest that junior doctors typically work 80 to 100 hours per week.

The government contends that more doctors are needed to address healthcare demands, particularly in rural areas, and to avoid an expected shortage of 15,000 doctors by 2035. Following the protests, the government initially took a firm stance, issuing back-to-work orders and threatening prosecution for non-compliance. However, they have recently expressed willingness to dialogue and consider suggestions to improve the plan.

Senior doctors at major hospitals have now joined the protest, further pressuring the government by submitting their resignations, although they continue to work. They demand that the government first abandon the plan to increase medical school admissions before any negotiations can proceed.

The medical community in South Korea, which is considered among the best in the world, generally believes that the number of doctors is sufficient and argues that the government’s proposed figures for increased admissions are arbitrary and lack transparency. They emphasize that without addressing the issues of pay and overwork among junior doctors, the plan to increase the number of physicians will not be effective in improving the healthcare system.</description>

			<title>Explained: The push for nuclear energy as climate solution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/nuclear-energy-climate-solution-problems-india-9237794/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant Nuclear Energy Summit held in Brussels, attended by representatives from 30 countries. The summit, organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), aimed to promote nuclear energy as a key component in addressing climate change and enhancing energy security, despite lingering concerns from incidents like Fukushima and the ongoing crisis at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant.

The IAEA has been actively promoting nuclear power through initiatives like 'Atoms4Climate' and engaging with climate conferences (COPs) to integrate nuclear solutions into global climate strategies. Despite its benefits of low emissions and constant availability for electricity generation, nuclear energy faces challenges such as high costs, lengthy construction times, and stringent regulations, which have hindered its rapid adoption compared to renewable sources like solar and wind.

Globally, the number of nuclear reactors has slightly decreased over the past two decades, and nuclear energy's share in global electricity production has been declining. However, recent climate goals have reignited interest in expanding nuclear capacity, with ambitious targets like tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 discussed at recent COP meetings.

India, with its modest but growing nuclear capacity, is planning significant expansions, though it has not committed to the tripling target. Key figures in India's nuclear sector argue for a more aggressive expansion to meet increasing clean energy demands.

Overall, while nuclear energy is recognized as a clean and reliable energy source, its growth is impeded by technological and financial challenges, demanding greater innovation and investment to realize its potential in the global energy mix.</description>

			<title>State of employment in India: What a new report says about youths and women, concerns and caution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/state-of-employment-in-india-what-a-new-report-says-about-youths-women-concerns-caution-9237158/</link>
			<description>The **India Employment Report 2024** highlights several key trends in the Indian labor market:

- **Labor Market Indicators**: There have been improvements in labor force participation rate, workforce participation rate, and unemployment rate after a long-term decline from 2000-2019. These improvements occurred during economic distress, including the Covid-19 pandemic.

- **Employment Conditions**: The report expresses concerns over poor employment conditions, such as the reversal of the transition to non-farm employment, an increase in self-employment and unpaid family work (particularly among women), lower quality of youth employment compared to adults, and stagnant or declining wages.

- **Employment Condition Index**: The index improved from 2004-05 to 2021-22, but disparities exist among states, with some consistently performing poorly and others well.

- **Informal Employment**: Informal employment has risen, with about half of the formal sector jobs being informal. Self-employment and unpaid family work have increased, especially for women, with 82% of the workforce in the informal sector and nearly 90% informally employed.

- **Self-Employment**: Remains the primary source of employment at 55.8% in 2022, with casual and regular employment at 22.7% and 21.5%, respectively. There was a shift from regular employment to self-employment from 2019 to 2022.

- **Gender Gap**: The female labor force participation rate is one of the world's lowest and has seen a significant decline from 2000 to 2019, followed by an increase from 2019 to 2022. However, it remains much lower than the global average.

- **Youth Employment**: There has been an increase in youth employment, but the quality is a concern. Unemployment among educated youths has intensified, with a higher rate among young women, especially graduates.

- **Non-Farm Employment**: The transition towards non-farm employment reversed after 2018-19, with an increase in agricultural employment.

The report suggests that while there are signs of improvement in some labor market indicators, significant challenges remain, particularly in terms of employment quality, gender disparities, and the informal sector's dominance.

Additionally, the article mentions **Aanchal Magazine**, a Senior Assistant Editor with The Indian Express, who specializes in macroeconomy and fiscal policy reporting.

In a separate note, Apple has issued threat notifications to users in India and 91 other countries about potential attacks, advising caution with links and attachments from unknown senders. The company has updated its support page with safety tips for users.</description>

			<title>An expert explains: What will it take to resume India-Pakistan trade?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-trade-explained-9237172/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complex relationship between India and Pakistan, particularly focusing on the potential resumption of trade. Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Muhammad Ishaq Dar, indicated a possible reconsideration of trade with India, which had ceased following constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The economic crisis in Pakistan and pressure from the business community due to high energy prices are influencing factors.

Trade indirectly occurs through third countries like Dubai, which is inefficient and costly. Despite the economic logic for direct trade, political challenges persist. Past attempts at trade, such as the short-lived decision to trade sugar and cotton in 2021, highlight the internal political struggle in Pakistan. The military's influence, especially the Army Chief's stance, remains a critical factor.

India's position is that trade cannot resume without Pakistan addressing terrorism. Historical context shows fluctuating trade relations, with significant military interventions from Pakistan. The article suggests that economic sense and regional stability may eventually lead to a softening of positions, but domestic politics in Pakistan and India's firm stance on Kashmir and terrorism make the path forward uncertain.

The article concludes that while economic partnership between the two nations is sensible, political inertia and strategic considerations dominate the discourse. Quiet diplomacy might offer a way forward, with the UAE playing a role in facilitating dialogue. The author, Dr. C Raja Mohan, emphasizes the need for both countries to be prepared to negotiate when the political climate allows. The article is by Dr. C Raja Mohan, an expert on international affairs, and was reported by Rishika Singh. The piece also briefly mentions other topics such as cultural affairs and honors awarded to military personnel.

			<description>Pakistan is attempting discreet diplomatic outreach to India after a period of estrangement. To facilitate this, Pakistan will host its National Day celebrations in New Delhi, honoring the 1940 Lahore Resolution that called for an independent Muslim state in India. The resolution outlined the creation of two separate autonomous units for Muslim-majority regions, which later became the basis for Pakistan's independence. National Day is observed at the Pakistani embassy in New Delhi with speeches, music, and the presence of Indian dignitaries.</description>

			<title>Why Thailand’s now-replaced WTO Ambassador questioned India’s agriculture subsidies, what India argued</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/wto-india-food-subsidy-farmers-thailand-9193340/</link>
			<description>Thailand replaced its Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) after India protested her comments regarding India's Public Stockholding (PSH) program.

Thailand, as part of the Cairns Group, criticized India's PSH program, claiming it is subsidized and distorts global food prices. India, with rice exports exceeding the WTO's de minimis limit of 10% for developing countries, has argued for a change in the subsidy calculation method.

The Cairns Group, supported by the EU and US, seeks to reduce India's farm support, while India demands a permanent solution for public stockholding.

During the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference, tensions escalated between India and Thailand, leading to Indian negotiators boycotting discussions where the Thai representative was present.

Indian farmers have expressed concerns about WTO restrictions on farm support and have requested its removal from the WTO agreement.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, said by former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-shastri-9193486/</link>
			<description>Lal Bahadur Shastri, India's former Prime Minister, coined the iconic slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" ("hail the soldier, hail the farmer") in 1965 amidst numerous challenges, including the Indo-Pak conflict and agricultural crisis. The slogan emphasizes the vital role of both soldiers and farmers in India's well-being and security.

Shastri's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by his swift actions during the conflict, which resulted in a ceasefire on Pakistan's terms. He also prioritized agriculture, allocating funds and reforms to lay the foundation for the Green Revolution and empowered key figures in the sector.

Over the years, the slogan has evolved, with subsequent leaders adding "Jai Vigyan" (hail science) and "Jai Anusandhan" (hail research) to highlight the importance of scientific advancement and research.</description>

			<title>What is grey zone warfare, mentioned by India’s Chief of Defence Staff recently?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/grey-zone-warfare-meaning-examples-china-taiwan-9193251/</link>
			<description>In the 2024 Raisina Dialogue, General Anil Chauhan introduced "grey zone warfare" as the latest form of informal warfare, citing examples from the South China Sea and China's actions around Taiwan. Grey zone warfare involves actions that fall between direct conflict and peace, such as economic operations, influence campaigns, and cyberattacks.

Experts believe grey zone warfare has emerged due to factors like nuclear weapons and technological advancements, making direct conflicts too costly. It allows countries to pursue objectives covertly or with obfuscated attribution.

Grey zone warfare methods include economic sanctions, disinformation campaigns, and proxy wars. Russia and China have been associated with such tactics. For instance, China's presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan's complaints about increased Chinese military activity are examples of grey zone warfare.

While grey zone warfare poses challenges different from open conflicts, experts warn that it can escalate in multiple dimensions and become difficult to manage. It can also be used to bait adversaries into escalation, normalize disputed claims, and project strength.</description>

			<title>Bribes for votes: Why SC will decide if MLAs and MPs immune from criminal prosecution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-mla-mp-immune-criminal-prosecution-corruption-9193229/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is considering overturning a 1998 ruling that granted legislators immunity from bribery charges in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution provide this protection, which was interpreted literally in the P.V. Narasimha Rao case. However, a seven-judge bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud is examining the issue, focusing on whether the purpose of these articles was to protect legislators from criminal prosecution, the definition of "in respect of," and when the offense of bribery is complete. Senior advocates Raju Ramachandran and P.S. Patwalia argue for a narrow interpretation of the immunity, while Attorney General R. Vankataramani and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta advocate for reconsideration. The court will ultimately decide whether to maintain or overrule the P.V. Narasimha judgement.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Modi and Mauritian Prime Minister Jugnauth inaugurated an airstrip and jetty built by India on Agaléga Islands. Despite denials, reports suggest the airstrip could be developed into a military base. The project aims to enhance India's reach in the Indian Ocean, especially amidst China's growing influence. The initiative is part of India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy' with Mauritius and involves Indian Navy detachments and the supply of defense equipment. India is also strengthening ties with neighboring countries such as Seychelles, Madagascar, and certain African nations, while its relationship with the Maldives has been affected by political changes.</description>

			<title>What India’s latest leopard population estimates suggest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-leopard-population-estimates-9192015/</link>
			<description>According to the 'Status of Leopards in India, 2022' report, India's leopard population has increased to 13,874 from 12,852 in 2018. Central India and Eastern Ghats have the highest population of leopards. Madhya Pradesh has the largest population, followed by Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. While tiger populations have positively impacted leopard populations in some areas, they have also negatively impacted them in others. Poaching, habitat loss, and road accidents remain significant threats to leopards. Leopard-human conflict is also a growing issue due to leopards' adaptability and presence outside protected areas. States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala have reported numerous fatal attacks and human-leopard encounters.</description>

			<title>Is the President immune from prosecution? US Supreme Court to decide on Trump case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/presidential-immunity-trump-us-supreme-court-9191776/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court (SCOTUS) is considering whether former President Donald Trump has immunity from criminal charges for attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Trump faces conspiracy charges related to the January 6th Capitol attack.

The Constitution does not specify presidential immunity, but SCOTUS ruled in United States v Nixon (1974) that the President can be required to testify and produce evidence in criminal cases. However, the question of whether a President can be prosecuted while in office remains unanswered.

Trump argues that the "absolute immunity" granted to former President Nixon in Nixon v Fitzgerald (1982) should extend to criminal liability for actions taken during office.

In contrast to the US, India's President and Governors have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution during their terms. However, the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers have no such protection and can be treated like ordinary citizens in court.</description>

			<title>Obesity on the rise, high levels of undernutrition persist in India: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/obesity-undernutrition-persist-india-new-study-9191754/</link>
			<description>India faces a double burden of obesity and undernutrition. Over the past 32 years, obesity has surged, particularly in women with a 9.8% prevalence in 2022. Childhood obesity has also increased significantly. Despite declining, undernutrition remains high, with India having the highest prevalence of thinness in girls and the second highest in boys globally.

Socioeconomic factors play a role, with junk food being more accessible and affordable than nutritious options. Obesity is more prevalent in urban areas and among the better-off, while undernutrition persists in remote and poor regions.

Obesity contributes to non-communicable diseases, while undernutrition increases susceptibility to these conditions later in life. The study recommends addressing both issues through programs that promote healthy nutrition and weight loss support.</description>

			<description>Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, despite economic headwinds, remains optimistic, using weather metaphors to predict a brighter future. Despite a global downturn, reduced demand, and a struggling real estate industry, Li aims to revitalize China's economy. The key challenge is reaching the 5% growth threshold in 2024. Li's upcoming report to Parliament will outline his plan to boost internal consumption and attract foreign investment. Germany plays a significant role in this growth strategy, with record levels of FDI. Visa liberalization measures have been implemented to encourage investment from Germany and other EU nations, demonstrating China's eagerness for international business collaboration.</description>

			<title>Why have GDP and GVA growth rates diverged in Q3?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-have-gdp-and-gva-growth-rates-diverged-in-q3-9191086/</link>
			<description>India's GDP grew by an unexpected 8.4% in Q3 of 2023-24, surpassing RBI estimates of 6.5%. This helped raise the full-year estimate to 7.6%. Growth was driven by manufacturing, mining, construction, and services, while agriculture contracted.

However, there is a discrepancy between GDP and GVA growth, with GDP growing at 8.4% and GVA at 6.5%. This is due to lower-than-expected annual GDP deflator and a sharp rise in net taxes.

Investment growth supported GDP, while private consumption growth remained subdued. The government attributed the GVA-GDP divergence to a fall in subsidies.

Economists believe GDP deflator growth could lead to lower real GDP growth in the future. They emphasize monitoring consumption growth and private investments for sustained growth.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-how-the-development-of-agalega-figures-in-indias-vision-for-its-maritime-neighbourhood-9191082/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Jugnauth inaugurated an airstrip and jetty on Agaléga Island, which belongs to Mauritius. The development aims to enhance socio-economic security for Mauritius and aligns with India's maritime vision. These facilities will improve the well-being of the island's inhabitants and create employment opportunities. They will also strengthen Mauritius' government presence and enable better monitoring of their Exclusive Economic Zone. India and Mauritius have close historical and cultural ties, with 70% of Mauritians having Indian origin. India's commitment to the SAGAR vision and willingness to assist maritime nations are underscored by this joint development. India respects sovereignty and has a track record of providing material support, information exchange, and joint exercises with Mauritius, but only upon request and in accordance with established mechanisms. India's development aid is not intended to create debt traps or violate sovereignty.</description>

			<title>Can you be sued for defamation if you retweet defamatory content?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/can-you-be-sued-for-defamation-if-you-retweet-defamatory-content-9190215/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has stayed a trial against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for retweeting an allegedly defamatory YouTube video. Retweeting may not always imply endorsement, according to the court. Kejriwal's counsel admitted the post was a mistake.

In Indian law, defamation can be civil (libel/slander) or criminal (IPC Section 499). Criminal defamation requires proof beyond reasonable doubt and carries up to two years' imprisonment. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of criminal defamation laws, but reasonable restrictions can be imposed under Article 19(2).

The Delhi High Court had ruled that retweeting defamatory content prima facie attracts liability. However, the Supreme Court has observed that retweeting may simply be sharing information and not an endorsement. The case will proceed with further hearings.</description>

			<title>How climate change has fuelled farmers’ protests in Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-farmer-protests-europe-9190128/</link>
			<description>European farmers are protesting due to rising costs, cheap imports, and the impact of climate change on agriculture. The EU's environmental regulations, aimed at reducing GHG emissions, have further exacerbated the situation. Farmers argue that these regulations are too strict, unfair, and economically unviable, especially with the added burden of energy costs and competition from Ukraine's neighbors. The backlash has led to a rollback of some regulations, but the EU still needs to curtail emissions from the sector to meet its Green Deal targets without further igniting farmer unrest.</description>

			<title>Sensex, Nifty jump above 1 per cent: What has led to this gain?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sensex-nifty-jump-1-per-cent-factors-gdp-9189716/</link>
			<description>Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty surged over 1% following the release of better-than-expected GDP growth of 8.4% for Q3 FY24. Key contributors include strong growth in manufacturing, construction, and capital formation.

Experts attribute the market rally to the solid GDP numbers and highlight the potential for large caps like Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ICICI Bank to lead the surge. However, tepid private consumption might impact consumer staples stocks.

While fixed investment remains a key driver of growth, consumption lags behind. The services sector shows resilience, but agriculture underperforms.

Despite the positive GDP data, Nomura projects a more moderate growth of 6.1% in 2024 and 6.2% in FY25 due to factors such as the impact of elections on public spending and weak consumption.</description>

			<title>Why the Supreme Court overturned its 2018 decision, which set a time limit on courts’ stay orders</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-decision-2018-stay-interim-orders-9189641/</link>
			<description>In 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) aimed to address delayed trials by automatically vacating stay orders by High Courts after six months. However, in 2023, a five-judge SC bench has overturned this ruling, citing concerns about "doing injustice" by nullifying lawful stay orders.

The bench held that constitutional courts should avoid setting precise timelines for case decisions, leaving discretion to lower courts familiar with local issues. They emphasized that High Courts should prioritize applications to vacate stay orders to ensure faster disposal of cases.

The ruling was based on arguments that automatic vacation of stay orders without due process violates principles of judicial fairness and that setting timelines is within Parliament's legislative powers, not the court's.</description>

			<title>India-built airstrip inaugurated in Agaléga, Mauritius: Its strategic significance vis-a-vis Maldives and China</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/agalega-airstrip-inagurated-mauritius-maldives-and-india-9189103/</link>
			<description>Indian technical personnel have replaced Indian military personnel on one of three aviation platforms in the Maldives. India also inaugurated an airstrip and jetty on Mauritius' Agaléga Island, strategically located in the Indian Ocean.

Mauritius and the Maldives are crucial outposts for India due to their maritime and strategic significance. China's increasing presence in the region has heightened India's concerns. India's withdrawal of military personnel from the Maldives follows pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu's request.

After an MoU signed in 2015, India upgraded the airstrip on Agaléga Island to enhance Mauritius' capabilities in safeguarding its interests and monitoring its Exclusive Economic Zone. Despite domestic criticism, Mauritius has managed the situation better than the Maldives, where former Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid disputes claims of foreign military presence.

India's presence in the Indian Ocean supports its maritime security interests and strengthens its relationships with island nations. However, domestic politics in these nations can influence their policies and India must navigate its diplomatic efforts carefully.</description>

			<title>How does a chatbot remember the prompts you gave it? Understanding context windows</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-are-context-windows-in-ai-9188742/</link>
			<description>ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by GPT 3.5 or GPT-4, a large language model (LLM). The chatbot interacts with users through a chat interface, similar to messengers.

Context windows are crucial for AI models to recall information during a conversation. The size of the context window determines the amount of information the model can consider at once to generate responses. Larger context windows provide more information but require more computational power and can lead to irrelevant information being included.

GPT-4 Turbo has a massive context window of 128K tokens, while Google Gemini 1.5 Pro has a context window of up to 1 million tokens. While larger windows can enhance accuracy, they come with challenges such as increased computational power, memory bandwidth, and storage requirements. Additionally, large context windows can result in repetitive or contradictory responses and a higher carbon footprint.</description>

			<title>Why homesexuality is ‘natural’ in the animal kingdom</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/homesexuality-in-animal-kingdom-9188557/</link>
			<description>Researchers observed male humpback whales engaging in sexual activity for the first time in 2022. Homosexuality is prevalent in many animal species, attributed to both biological and environmental factors. Despite reproductive implications, homosexuality persists due to hypotheses such as "indiscriminate mating," where individuals indiscriminately mate without recognizing sex. Other hypotheses suggest adaptive functions, such as fostering social bonds and reducing intrasexual aggression. Studies have found a correlation between same-sex sexual behavior and sociality, and evidence indicates it may mitigate adulticide in males. Same-sex sexual behavior is considered a convergent adaptation in mammals, providing survival benefits.</description>

			<title>Who is Abdul Karim ‘Tunda’, linked to 40 terrorist bombings, and now acquitted in one case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/who-is-abdul-karim-tunda-acquitted-bomb-blasts-9188408/</link>
			<description>Abdul Karim "Tunda," an alleged bomb expert and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, has been acquitted in a 1993 train blasts case. The acquittal comes despite being linked to numerous terrorist attacks over the years.

Tunda, born in 1943, joined the neo-fundamentalist sect after witnessing communal violence during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He later traveled to Pakistan and received training in explosives from the ISI.

After the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, Tunda is suspected of being involved in several bombings, including the December 6, 1993, train blasts. He was also accused of raising funds and scouting recruits for LeT.

Apprehended in 2013, Tunda faced multiple cases, but was acquitted in most. Despite being convicted in a 1996 blast case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court later commuted his sentence.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/national-science-day-cv-raman-9185655/</link>
			<description>In 1986, India instituted National Science Day to commemorate Sir CV Raman's discovery of the "Raman Effect" in 1930, earning him a Nobel Prize. The Raman Effect occurs when light passing through a liquid scatters, resulting in a different color due to changes in wavelength.

CV Raman, born in 1888, published his first research paper at 18 and began his breakthrough experiments on light scattering after becoming an assistant accountant general in Calcutta. His observations on the Mediterranean Sea's blue color led to the discovery.

Raman's discovery revolutionized quantum theory and gave birth to Raman spectroscopy, a tool for chemical analysis. Today, it has diverse applications, including studying art, detecting drugs, and conducting non-invasive examinations.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-karnataka-temple-bill-controversry-9184880/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government's proposal to increase Hindu temple taxation by diverting a portion of their gross income to a common pool failed in the Legislative Council due to opposition from the BJP. The Bill aimed to redistribute temple income to support lower-income temples and provide benefits to priests. However, the BJP criticized the government for targeting Hindu temples alone and claimed that the funds would not be used for religious purposes.

Other states have different approaches to temple revenue management. Telangana has a Common Good Fund where religious institutions contribute a percentage of their income for temple maintenance and religious education. Kerala has Devaswom Boards that manage temples and receive state funding, but revenue figures are not publicly disclosed.</description>

			<title>BJP and the idea of simultaneous elections: A short history going back 40 years</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/bjp-simultaneous-elections-history-9184172/</link>
			<description>The BJP's memorandum to the One Nation, One Election Committee proposes simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha, state assemblies, and later local bodies. The idea has been part of BJP manifestos since 1984, along with other electoral reforms like electronic voting machines and voter ID cards.

Over the decades, the BJP's manifestos have included proposals for:

* Controlling election funding by banning company donations and instituting public funding (1984)
* Banning company donations, compulsory voting, and empowering the Election Commission (1989)
* Allowing company donations and incentivizing open funding (1991, 1996)
* Electoral reforms bill, fixed five-year terms, and replacing no-confidence motion with a constructive vote (1998, 1999)
* Eliminating criminality in polls and revising expenditure limits (2014)
* Simultaneous elections and a single voters' list (2019)</description>

			<title>SC terms woman military officer’s 1988 discharge ‘illegal’: How courts have ruled for women in armed forces</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-woman-military-officers-armed-forces-9184035/</link>
			<description>- Lt. Selina John, a former permanent commissioned officer in the Military Nursing Service (MNS), was released from service in 1988 due to her marriage, which was deemed a violation of gender equality.


- The Armed Forces Tribunal deemed the termination illegal and ordered her reinstatement with back wages, but the Central government challenged this order in the Supreme Court.


- The Supreme Court upheld the tribunal's decision, stating that the government's rule terminating employment due to marriage was discriminatory and illegal.


- The court directed the government to pay Rs 60 lakhs in compensation to Lt. John and rejected the argument that women nursing officers were unfit for service due to marriage or childbirth.


- The Supreme Court's decision aligns with a previous ruling in 2020 that granted permanent commission to women officers in the Army, recognizing their right to pursue full-length careers.


- Despite this ruling, military nurses were not granted the status of ex-servicemen, affecting their re-employment opportunities and benefits.


- A Punjab and Haryana High Court division bench recently ruled that MNS officers should be considered ex-servicemen under the Punjab Recruitment of Ex-Servicemen Rules, 1982, acknowledging their service to the nation.</description>

			<title>Three proposals from Tesla, BYD and VinFast, three policy responses in India’s Electric Vehicles push</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/three-proposals-three-policy-responses-in-indias-ev-push-9182676/</link>
			<description>1.  Tesla is seeking lower import duties on EVs in exchange for a guaranteed financial commitment of about $2 billion in a proposed EV facility in India.
2.  VinFast Auto, a Vietnamese automaker, is setting up an integrated EV manufacturing site in Tamil Nadu and has requested import duty concessions for a limited time to familiarize customers with its products while a local manufacturing plant is being built.
3.  BYD, a Chinese automaker, was reportedly denied permission to build a $1 billion EV plant in India due to national security concerns. BYD is a leader in battery technology and has developed a cost-effective and safer "blade battery."
4.  The Indian government's approach to these three automakers has varied, with Tesla receiving potential tax incentives, VinFast following the regular dispensation, and BYD facing disincentives.</description>

			<title>Russia captures Avdiivka: What this means for Ukraine, the war, and Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/russia-captures-avdiivka-what-this-means-for-ukraine-the-war-and-europe-9171658/</link>
			<description>Summary: Russia celebrates a significant victory by capturing the strategic town of Avdiivka in Ukraine, a major resistance stronghold near Donetsk. This victory opens doors for further Russian advancement and poses challenges for Ukrainian forces. The fall of Avdiivka exposes Ukraine's shortage of arms and ammunition, affecting their ability to defend against the overpowering Russian military. Western aid delays, specifically a stalled $60 billion package in the US House of Representatives, exacerbate Ukraine's vulnerabilities. The fall of Avdiivka raises concerns in Europe about increasing defense spending amid Russia's assertiveness, emphasizing the shifting security landscape and the need for greater self-reliance.</description>

			<title>What is Article 142, invoked by SC to overturn Chandigarh mayoral poll results?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-article-142-chandigarh-mayoral-poll-results-9171621/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently overturned the results of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation's mayoral elections using its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. This article delves into the history and scope of Article 142, highlighting its unique ability to deliver complete justice even in situations where existing laws may not provide a remedy. The court's rulings in various cases, such as the Bhopal gas tragedy case, have shaped the understanding and application of Article 142. Criticism surrounding the broad and potentially arbitrary nature of these powers is addressed, emphasizing the need for self-regulation to prevent misuse. The article also discusses the judiciary's accountability and the importance of the separation of powers. Despite these criticisms, the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution limited the use of Article 142 to exceptional circumstances where existing laws fall short. Additionally, the Supreme Court has set limits on its own exercise of power under Article 142 to ensure justice according to law rather than sympathy or illegality.</description>

			<title>SC directs govts to follow ‘broad’ definiton of forests: How they are defined, what law says on conservation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-forests-definition-conservation-9171444/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has instructed governments to adhere to the expansive definition of forests from its 1996 T N Godavarman case until a consolidated record of all types of forests in India is compiled. The court recently ruled that the 2023 amendments to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, had weakened the Act by narrowing its scope. The government's amendments aimed to specifically identify forests as per government records, which was a response to perceived expansion of the Act's applicability. The court emphasized that the Act would apply to all lands identified as forests or resembling the dictionary meaning of forests. Future decisions will be based on the progress of expert committees identifying protected forest areas. The matter is set for final hearing in July.</description>

			<title>What are Money Bills and why are they the subject of a constitutional challenge?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/money-bills-supreme-court-criteria-electoral-bonds-9171044/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal debate before the Supreme Court regarding what constitutes a money Bill. This debate is crucial as money Bills offer a faster route for enacting laws by Parliament and involve specific conditions related to financial matters. Recent challenges have questioned the validity of passing certain Acts, like the Aadhaar Act and the Finance Act, through the money Bill route. Justices have expressed differing opinions on the constitutionality of these Acts as money Bills, highlighting the importance of clarifying this issue. The pending decision by a seven-judge bench will likely impact future legal challenges against Acts passed through the money Bill route, such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Aadhaar Act.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/tatas-tower-chip-foundries-india-semiconductor-9170790/</link>
			<description>Fresh proposals from the Tata Group and Tower Semiconductor have reignited hopes for the establishment of a semiconductor fabrication plant in India.

			<title>Why Canada’s Opposition leader demanded to know ‘WTF!’ in the country’s Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canada-poilievre-justin-trudeau-arrivecan-wtf-9170678/</link>
			<description>Canada's Leader of Opposition, Pierre Poilievre, highlighted in Parliament that the Canadian government paid $258 million over several years to a small company involved in creating an app for safe travel during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, GC Strategies, received numerous contracts without competitive bidding, leading to concerns of financial mismanagement. The Auditor General's report revealed that the Canada Border Services Agency and other government bodies failed to follow good management practices in the app's development and contracting process. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has responded by suspending contracts with GC Strategies and pledging cooperation with investigations. The scandal has compounded Trudeau's political challenges leading up to the 2025 general elections, with the Opposition linking the financial irregularities to the country's growing cost of living crisis and declining support for liberal immigration policies.</description>

			<title>Situation report in pulses, cotton: The crops in Centre’s MSP proposal to protesting farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/situation-report-in-pulses-cotton-crops-in-centres-msp-proposal-to-farmers-9170063/</link>
			<description>During recent talks, the Indian government proposed crop diversification in Punjab, suggesting cooperatives to procure five crops at MSP. The farmers demand guaranteed MSP for all crops nationwide and rejected the proposal. Punjab's heavy focus on water-intensive paddy cultivation has led to groundwater depletion. Despite efforts to diversify crops, cotton and maize cultivation areas have decreased, while pulses' area has risen. India aims for self-sufficiency in pulses by 2027 through MSP incentives and procurement schemes. Punjab contributes minimally to CCI's cotton procurement. NAFED procured significant quantities of pulses under PSS and PSF, but concerns exist regarding their disposal below MSP.</description>

			<title>La Nina impacted air quality in India in the winter of 2022: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/la-nina-impacted-air-quality-in-india-what-a-new-study-says-9170062/</link>
			<description>A recent study by Indian researchers from the National Institute of Advanced Studies and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has linked air quality in Indian cities to La Nina events. In the winter of 2022, northern cities like Delhi experienced cleaner air due to a deviation from normal wind patterns, while western and southern cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai saw worse air quality. The change in wind direction transported pollutants from agricultural waste burning in Punjab and Haryana to southern regions, impacting cities like Mumbai. The study suggests that the extended La Nina event lasting three years influenced these anomalous wind patterns, highlighting the potential impact of La Nina on air quality trends in India.</description>

			<description>The Bombay High Court criticized the CBI for what it termed as an "abuse of power" in the arrests of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar. The arrests were related to a case involving loans granted by ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group. The court highlighted that the arrests violated Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code, which aims to prevent unnecessary detentions. The HC stated that the couple had complied with CBI notices and had not been interrogated for over three years since the FIR was filed. It emphasized that the arrests lacked proper justification and condemned them as a misuse of authority.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/round-4-government-punjab-farmers-protest-talks-9169756/</link>
			<description>During recent talks, the government proposed diversification into pulses, cotton, and maize to address farmers' concerns. They assured minimum support prices (MSP) for these crops without quantity limitations. The proposal includes procurement by cooperative agencies and legal contracts for farmers. Punjab Chief Minister and farm unions support the idea, citing benefits such as reduced water dependency and increased income. The proposal aims to address water scarcity issues and could aid in crop diversification. However, uncertainties remain, as farmers are reviewing the proposal before making a final decision. The move is crucial for Punjab, facing water scarcity and desertification issues due to paddy cultivation.</description>

			<description>The Kerala High Court upheld the life imprisonment of 10 individuals, including three CPI(M) leaders, in the T P Chandrasekharan murder case, a highly sensational crime from 12 years ago.

			<title>Warming up to climate change: How does climate change impact extreme weather events?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-impact-extreme-weather-events-9169603/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of climate change on extreme weather events due to the increase in global temperatures. It notes that rising temperatures have led to more frequent and intense events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. While it's challenging to attribute specific events solely to climate change, studies can indicate how warming climate exacerbates these events. For instance, heatwaves and droughts are becoming more severe due to global warming, leading to dire consequences like famine and displacement of populations. The article also mentions how warmer temperatures amplify hurricanes, with oceans absorbing much of the excess heat, causing marine heat waves and intensifying storms. Additionally, it highlights how higher temperatures contribute to more evaporation, heavier rainfall, and increased flooding.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/cji-chandrachud-court-vacations-judges-criticism-debate-9169237/</link>
			<description>Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud addressed criticisms regarding the vacation days allotted to Indian judges, highlighting the misconception that judges have excessive holidays. He emphasized that judges work tirelessly every day, including weekends, with district judges engaged in legal aid camps and administrative tasks. The Supreme Court operates for 193 days annually, while High Courts and trial courts function for approximately 210 and 245 days, respectively. Despite scheduled breaks, judges are available in "vacation benches" to address urgent cases. The debate around vacation days stems from concerns about case backlogs and slow legal processes. Various recommendations have been made to reduce vacation periods and enhance court efficiency. Comparisons with apex courts in the US and the UK show differing workloads and vacation structures.</description>

The ruling by a New York court judge also includes a ban on Trump and his adult sons from holding top positions in New York companies for several years. The judge criticized the defendants for their lack of remorse and ordered Trump to pay the penalty, potentially affecting his significant net worth, estimated to be around $2.6 billion. Trump faces additional financial challenges, including legal fees and damages to pay in other cases, which might compel him to liquidate assets to cover the penalties.</description>

			<title>Why the Right wing in America dislikes Taylor Swift</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/why-right-wing-america-dislikes-taylor-swift-9165323/</link>
			<description>Former President Donald Trump criticized Taylor Swift for potentially endorsing Joe Biden, suggesting it would be disloyal after he signed the Music Modernization Act in 2018. Right-wing conspiracy theorists claim Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce, her boyfriend who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, is a PR stunt to boost Biden's chances. Some conspiracy theories propose that the Pentagon is using Swift's large online following to combat misinformation and elevate Democrats' political aims. Others suggest that the NFL rigged games to allow Swift and Kelce to make a splashy endorsement of Biden. Swift's political involvement and endorsements have sparked dislike from the right-wing, particularly Republicans who view it as a departure from her country music roots. It remains unclear whether Swift's endorsements can significantly influence elections, but her massive fan base could potentially increase voter turnout for candidates she supports.</description>

			<title>Navalny dies in prison: How the anti-corruption crusader became Putin’s biggest rival</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/navalny-dies-prison-putin-rival-9165227/</link>
			<description>The death of Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has raised suspicions of a state-orchestrated political assassination. Navalny gained recognition as an anti-corruption activist and participated in protests against Putin in 2011-12. Despite facing obstacles, including arrest and being barred from running for public office, Navalny remained in the public eye through his YouTube channel, which produced popular videos criticizing the Kremlin. In 2020, he survived a poisoning attack with a nerve agent called Novichok, but upon returning to Russia in 2021, he was arrested and sentenced to 19 years in prison on controversial charges. Amnesty International recognized him as a "prisoner of conscience." Navalny was moved to a harsh penal colony in the Arctic Circle, where he spent significant time in isolation. His death leaves him as the last prominent Putin critic remaining in Russia, as others have either fled the country or died under mysterious circumstances. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin faces little opposition as he seeks to extend his rule beyond 2030.</description>

			<title>Why has RBI put restraints on a certain card network?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-restraints-card-network-9164676/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has ordered an unnamed card network to stop allowing "unauthorized payments" through business cards. The regulator cited violations of payment system laws and concerns over non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. The RBI did not mention the specific card network, but mentioned that only one card network has enabled unapproved card payments by businesses. The arrangement involved an intermediary accepting card payments from corporates and transferring the funds to non-card accepting recipients via IMPS, RTGS, or NEFT. The RBI advised the card network to halt such arrangements until further notice, while clarifying that regular usage of business credit cards is unaffected. Visa has confirmed receiving the regulator's directive and instructed Business Payment Service Providers (BPSPs) to suspend transactions until further notice.</description>

			<title>Electoral Bonds verdict: How the proportionality test was applied in the case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/electoral-bonds-verdict-how-the-proportionality-test-was-applied-in-the-case-9164082/</link>
			<description>A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, unanimously struck down the electoral bonds scheme, stating that the restrictions on free speech were not proportional to its goals: curbing black money and protecting donor privacy. The court emphasized that a law passed by Parliament cannot interfere with the fundamental rights listed in Part-III of the Constitution. The proportionality test, which determines if an action is a reasonable restriction, was applied in this case. The court also highlighted the importance of balancing competing fundamental rights, specifically the right to information and the right to privacy. The Chief Justice suggested that less intrusive methods, like the electoral trusts scheme, could be used to achieve the same objectives. In unrelated news, Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin withdrew from the 3rd Test due to a family medical emergency, with the BCCI expressing support for him and his family's privacy.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by the electoral bonds scheme in India, particularly from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Election Commission of India (ECI). The RBI objected to the proposal of allowing other banks to issue electoral bearer bonds, citing concerns about multiple entities issuing bearer instruments and the potential for money laundering. The RBI argued that existing payment methods like cheques and digital payments could achieve the same purpose. The ECI raised objections regarding the impact on transparency in political finance and recommended reintroducing caps on corporate funding. The absence of key BJP figures in Tamil Nadu and the growing popularity of the DMK have raised concerns about the BJP's electoral prospects in the state.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court draws new red line: burden is on state to  be ‘least restrictive’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/electoral-bonds-scheme-sc-draws-new-red-line-burden-is-on-state-to-be-least-restrictive-9164175/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has struck down the electoral bonds scheme, stating that the state must prove its measure is the "least restrictive" and that there are other "equally effective" methods to achieve its goal. The court rejected the government's argument that electoral bonds are the only way to curb black money and suggested Electoral Trusts as a less restrictive alternative. It disagreed with the idea that a voter's right to know should be extinguished for donor privacy. The ruling questions whether donor anonymity can be a legitimate state interest for all donors and marks a departure in how the court balances competing rights. Previously, the court placed public interest over individual rights, but this ruling requires a proportionality test to ensure the state's action is proportional to its goal. This is a significant departure from previous cases.</description>

			<description>Shehbaz Sharif, a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), is expected to become the next Prime Minister of Pakistan.

Shehbaz's political career includes serving as the Prime Minister of Pakistan until August 2023 and as Chief Minister of Punjab on multiple occasions. He is known for his efficient working style and infrastructure development, but his time as Prime Minister faced criticism for economic handling and allegations of corruption. Shehbaz's elevation is attributed to his better relationship with the military compared to his brother.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court has invalidated the Electoral Bonds Scheme (EBS), which allowed anonymous funding of political parties through the purchase of electoral bonds. The court also struck down amendments to electoral finance laws related to the introduction of the EBS. The petitioners argued that the scheme violated voters' right to information about political party funding. The court agreed, emphasizing the link between money and politics and the voters' right to know about potential policy changes influenced by large contributions. The court also reinstated the cap on political contributions from companies, highlighting the risk of unlimited corporate influence on elections.</description>

			<title>Electoral Bonds: How SC struck down amendments in three key laws, restored status quo restricting political donations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-electoral-bonds-verdict-restore-status-quo-9163356/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has struck down amendments made by the Indian government to key laws in order to facilitate corporate donations to political parties. These amendments, made through the Finance Acts of 2016 and 2017, were overturned alongside the Electoral Bonds Scheme. Before these amendments, political parties were required to declare all contributions over Rs 20,000 and maintain a record of donations for taxation purposes. The amendments removed the donation limit for companies and eliminated the requirement to declare and maintain a record of donations made through electoral bonds. The Supreme Court's judgment restores the previous regulations, emphasizing the importance of transparency and curbing corruption in electoral financing.</description>

			<title>Why does Kerala want the Centre to amend the Wildlife Protection Act?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kerala-centre-amend-wildlife-protection-act-9163205/</link>
			<description>The Kerala Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging the Union Government to amend sections of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The proposed amendments aim to address the escalating human-animal conflict in the state. Specifically, Kerala wants to devolve the powers of the Chief Wildlife Warden to Chief Conservators of Forests, simplifying procedures for dealing with wild animals posing a threat to human life. Additionally, Kerala seeks to have wild boar declared as vermin, allowing for the culling of their population to protect livelihoods. The state has witnessed a rise in human-animal conflicts, causing damage to agriculture and resulting in casualties. Kerala's previous attempts to control the wild boar population were hindered by a lack of licensed shooters and bureaucratic processes.</description>

			<title>Explained: China’s ‘Xiaokang’ border defence villages along the LAC, now being occupied</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/china-xiaokang-border-defence-villages-lac-9163202/</link>
			<description>Chinese residents have started occupying several of the model 'Xiaokang' border defense villages along the China-India border. These villages were constructed by China since 2019 but remained unoccupied until recently. Some of these villages are located near the Lohit Valley and Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh. The purpose of these villages, which consist of large double-storey buildings, is not entirely clear but they are believed to serve both civil and military purposes. China has constructed a total of 628 such villages along India's border with the Tibet Autonomous Region. The exact extent of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has been a point of contention between the two countries. China passed a new law in 2021, effective from January 1, 2022, concerning its land borders, which includes the border defense villages program. In response, India has announced the Vibrant Villages Programme to develop its border villages into modern villages and tourist attractions. This program aims to develop 663 border villages in the first phase, with select villages along the China-India border being prioritized for development. Both China and India have been focusing on building infrastructure and improving connectivity in their respective border regions.</description>

			<title>SC strikes down electoral bonds scheme as ‘unconstitutional’: What grounds did the verdict rely upon?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-strikes-down-electoral-bonds-scheme-as-unconstitutional-what-issues-did-the-verdict-mention-9162710/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India declared the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional in a unanimous judgment. The scheme allowed corporations and individuals to anonymously donate money to political parties through purchasing electoral bonds from the State Bank of India. The details of bond purchasers were accessible only to the bank. The court raised several issues, including whether the scheme violated the Right to Information, whether curbing black money justified restricting the Right to Information, whether the infringement of RTI was justified for donor privacy protection, and whether unlimited political contributions by companies were unconstitutional. The court concluded that the scheme violated the right to information, curbing black money was not a legitimate reason to restrict RTI, donor privacy extended to political contributions, and unlimited political contributions by companies were not permitted.</description>

			<title>Nvidia releases ‘Chat with RTX’ AI chatbot: The blurring lines between makers of GenAI software, hardware</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/the-blurring-lines-between-makers-of-genai-software-hardware-9162360/</link>
			<description>Nvidia Corporation is releasing a new tool called "Chat with RTX," which allows users to run an offline AI-powered chatbot on their Windows PC using their latest series graphic cards. The tool, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, enables users to customize a generative AI model by linking it to files, documents, and notes for queries. Nvidia's push into chatbots aligns with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's efforts to revamp the semiconductor industry and address the supply-and-demand issue of AI chips. Nvidia's advantage lies in its proprietary software, powerful GPUs, and full-stack solutions, making it a leader in AI chips. Altman, on the other hand, seeks investments to increase global chip-building capacity. This development suggests a convergence of interests between Nvidia and OpenAI, blurring the lines between hardware and software players in the AI industry.</description>

			<title>Can parties receive anonymous donations? Arguments before the Supreme Court in electoral bonds petitions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-cour-electoral-bond-verdict-anonymous-donations-9162164/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is deciding whether to strike down the central government's electoral bonds scheme, which allows anonymous donations to political parties through purchasing bonds from the State Bank of India. The petitioners argue that the scheme prevents citizens from knowing the source of donations and favors the ruling government. They also highlight gaps in the scheme, such as the lack of requirement for the donation to be connected to elections. The central government justifies the scheme by emphasizing confidentiality rather than anonymity and explaining their efforts to curb black money in politics. BCCI secretary Jay Shah emphasizes that centrally contracted players must participate in domestic red ball tournaments, considering guidance from the national cricket academy for players with physical limitations.</description>

			<title>Do high levels of ‘good’ cholesterol mean lower risk of heart disease? How HDL-C is actually linked to cardiovascular health</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/how-hdl-c-is-actually-linked-to-cardiovascular-health-9160272/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the difference between correlation and causation in diagnostic tests for health improvement. It explains that while correlations can predict risk, they do not identify the underlying cause of a disease. The example of ice cream sales and shark attacks is used to illustrate this point. The article also highlights the confusion caused by media headlines linking certain factors to health benefits without establishing causation. It specifically mentions HDL-Cholesterol (good cholesterol) and its correlation with low cardiovascular disease risk. However, clinical trials have failed to prove a causal link between HDL-Cholesterol and reduced risk. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the intricacies of markers like HDL-C and considering other factors such as LDL-C, Apolipoprotein-B, exercise, and overall health interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk. It concludes by cautioning readers to enjoy coffee for its taste rather than its potential health benefits.</description>

			<title>Why Forms 45 and 47 are at the heart of Pakistan’s election rigging controversy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/form-45-pakistan-elections-controversy-9161589/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's February 8 election results have been marred by allegations of rigging and result manipulation. The controversy revolves around Forms 45 and 47, which are crucial for documenting and compiling election results. Form 45, also known as the 'Result of Count' form, records votes polled at a polling station and includes important information like the number of registered voters, votes cast, and candidate-wise breakdown of votes. It must be publicly displayed for transparency. After completion, Form 45 is submitted to the Returning Officer, who gathers results from all Form 45s to determine the final outcome. Form 47 documents the unconfirmed results in a constituency before official confirmation. Concerns arose when candidates were denied Form 45s, and discrepancies were found between the data in Form 45s and Form 47s. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party claimed that the results were falsely changed and challenged them in court.</description>

			<title>PM Modi to inaugurate BAPS temple in UAE: Its special features, architecture, significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pm-modi-inaugurate-baps-temple-in-uae-features-9159741/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the BAPS Swaminarayan temple in Abu Dhabi, which is the first Hindu temple in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The temple, built by the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), holds significance for the Hindu community in the UAE and strengthens bilateral ties between the two nations. The temple features traditional architecture, including seven shikhars and intricate carvings representing universal values and different cultures. It sits on a 27-acre complex and was gifted 13.5 acres of land by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE. The temple is open to all visitors and boasts various amenities, including an assembly hall, community center, exhibitions, and classrooms. The construction of the temple involved the use of pink sandstone from Rajasthan and Italian marble, with over 20,000 tonnes shipped in for the project. The temple's inauguration underscores the unity and collaboration of people from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds, as exemplified by the Muslim king's donation of the land, the involvement of architects and designers from different faiths, and the support from various communities.</description>

			<description>The Australian government is considering a Bill that would establish a "right to disconnect" for workers, regulating whether employers can contact them outside of working hours. The aim is to address the blurring boundaries between work and personal life due to technology and remote work. The Bill has passed the Senate and will now go to the House of Representatives. Similar laws exist in countries like France, Italy, and Belgium. Critics argue that it may hinder business owners and impact women's participation in the workforce. In India, a similar Bill was proposed but not discussed in the House. The implementation and mechanisms for resolving disputes differ in each case.</description>

			<title>Why India wants to develop high-altitude pseudo-satellite vehicles, powered by the Sun</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/haps-high-altitude-pseudo-satellite-vehicles-9158726/</link>
			<description>The National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) in Bengaluru successfully tested a prototype of a new-generation unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite vehicle (HAPS). This UAV runs on solar power, can fly at heights of 20 km, and has the potential to remain in the air for months. HAPS vehicles are primarily used for surveillance and monitoring purposes and can be valuable in disaster management. While several countries and companies have developed similar vehicles, none have mastered the technology yet. NAL's prototype flew for eight and a half hours and aims to achieve a 24-hour flight next month. The goal is to develop a full-scale machine that can stay airborne for 90 days continuously by 2027. HAPS vehicles address the limitations of current UAVs and satellites, providing longer flight durations, better surveillance capabilities, and the ability to observe larger areas. They can be redeployed and reequipped with ease, unlike geostationary satellites. The development of HAPS faces technological challenges related to generating enough solar power, operating payloads, and charging batteries. Design considerations include creating a lightweight and stable aircraft suitable for the stratosphere, where wind speeds are low and observation is ideal. HAPS technology is a significant engineering challenge, and India's involvement places them in the race alongside other countries. The country's expertise in tropical areas could provide an advantage due to the presence of jet streams in the upper atmosphere.</description>

			<title>Wayanad elephant kills man: Behind escalating human-animal conflict in Kerala</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/wayanad-elephant-kills-man-behind-escalating-human-animal-conflict-in-kerala-9158201/</link>
			<description>The article highlights the escalating human-animal conflict in Wayanad, Kerala, particularly with wild elephants and tigers attacking humans. The data shows a significant number of wild animal attacks, leading to deaths and crop losses. Wayanad, located near various tiger reserves and forests, has been severely affected by such conflicts. The study identifies two major factors contributing to the conflict: the decline in forest habitat quality due to the cultivation of alien plants and changing agricultural practices that lure animals to farmland. The article discusses the steps taken by Kerala, such as constructing elephant-proof trenches and solar-powered fencing, eco-restoration programs, and land acquisition for forest conversion. However, the measures are not enough to address the crisis, and the state requested assistance from the central government, which was denied. The situation has caused protests and unrest in the affected communities.</description>

			<title>RLD ditches INDIA for NDA: What this means for the party, the two alliances</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/rld-ditches-india-for-nda-what-this-means-9157927/</link>
			<description>The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in Uttar Pradesh has switched sides to join the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), further fragmenting the INDIA bloc. The RLD, a farmers' party with support from the Jat community, brings perception benefits to the NDA rather than a significant number of votes. The party has seen a decline in its influence, losing seats in previous elections. The alliance with RLD may help the BJP consolidate Jat support and improve its chances in west UP. The RLD's departure is a blow to INDIA's unity and could prompt the Congress-SP alliance to focus on wooing Muslim voters. Some critics argue that the RLD has compromised on its ideology by joining the BJP, but the party has a history of switching sides.</description>

			<title>What is a floor test, which Nitish Kumar won in the Bihar Legislative Assembly?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/floor-test-bihar-assembly-meaning-process-9157395/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent floor test held in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar won the vote, demonstrating the confidence of the MLAs in his new government. It explains that a floor test is conducted to determine if a government, suspected of losing its majority, still retains the confidence of the House. The leader of the party claiming majority moves a vote of confidence, and if the majority votes in favor, the government survives. Different methods of voting, such as voice voting and electronic voting, are explained. The article also mentions the Composite Floor Test, which is conducted when multiple parties claim to form the government. It concludes with an unrelated mention of Abdul Malik, a leader involved in a property dispute that caused protests in Haldwani.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-town-square-internet-global-village-9156294/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of the Internet as a "town square" where ideas are shared and debates take place. It highlights how the term "town square" refers to a common space for gathering, discussing ideas, and holding debates. The ancient Greek practice of discussing ideas in public view is mentioned, with philosophers like Plato and Aristotle critiquing the fallacious arguments used by professional rhetoricians. The article also draws parallels between social media platforms like Twitter and the concept of a town square, noting the role they played during events like the Arab Spring. However, it raises concerns about the lack of regulation and common rules on these platforms, which hinders genuine and fair debate. The idea of a "global village" and the need for a free space for debate in an interconnected world are also discussed, along with the challenges and subjective nature of defining interesting and substantial debate. The article concludes with suggestions for setting standards and potentially exploring new platforms that foster meaningful discussion.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna: Why Charan Singh was a messiah for farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-charan-singh-was-a-messiah-for-farmers-9156566/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the views and proposals of Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former Union Home Minister of India, regarding reservations for farmers in government jobs and educational institutions. Singh believed that representation should be provided to the "sons or dependents of the actual tillers of the soil" to rectify the privileges enjoyed by city-dwellers. He argued that reservations would not only provide opportunities to farmers but also improve efficiency in government departments. Singh's proposal faced criticism for only including the "sons of cultivators" and excluding landless laborers. He emphasized that his focus was on providing representation to tillers of the soil, regardless of their caste. The article also highlights Singh's contribution to land reform laws in Uttar Pradesh, which empowered the middle peasantry. However, the current challenges faced by agriculture, such as decreasing yields, rising production costs, and climate change, make the need for reservations for farmers' children more relevant today.</description>

			<title>In Pakistan poll outcome, key question for India: Whom does New Delhi talk to with no civilian political power centre?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/in-pakistan-poll-outcome-key-question-for-india-9156118/</link>
			<description>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, emerged as the winner in Pakistan's parliamentary elections. Independent candidates backed by PTI secured the most seats, surpassing the two main established parties, Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PTI-backed candidates won a majority of the 101 independent seats. However, none of the three parties alone can achieve a simple majority in the National Assembly. The outcome raises questions about whom New Delhi should engage with in Pakistan, with the suggestion being to communicate with Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir. The final tally of the elections, released after a delay, led to concerns about the process and allegations of the Army rigging the polls. The article highlights key takeaways, including the Army's ability to manipulate the outcome in favor of established parties, PTI's success in various provinces, and the lack of a strong political power center in the civilian structure, giving the Army control over political actors.</description>

			<title>Explained: Israel’s plans to invade Rafah, and why US, others have criticised it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-invasion-south-gaza-rafah-9156043/</link>
			<description>The Israeli government plans to expand its military actions in the south of Gaza to combat the Palestinian militant organization Hamas. The conflict began when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, resulting in many casualties. Israel aims to eliminate Hamas and has called for the evacuation of civilians in the city of Rafah. The decision has received criticism from Palestinians, Israel's allies, and international organizations. There are concerns that the military action could lead to more Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, and there is a lack of safety and basic amenities for Palestinians. Egypt has expressed concerns about the potential consequences of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah and has threatened to suspend its peace treaty with Israel. The United States has also expressed criticism, with President Joe Biden stating that Israel's response is "over the top."</description>

			<title>What is Nazool land, behind recent dispute and violence in Haldwani?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/nazool-land-behind-dispute-violence-haldwani-uttarakhand-9155345/</link>
			<description>Violence broke out in Haldwani, Uttarakhand's Nainital district, during a demolition drive at a mosque and madrasa located on Nazool land, resulting in five deaths and numerous injuries. Nazool land refers to government-owned land that is leased to entities for a fixed period. After India gained independence from British rule, lands confiscated from opposing kings and kingdoms were categorized as Nazool land. These lands are typically used for public purposes like schools, hospitals, and government buildings. The property where the demolition took place was registered as Nazool land under the Municipal Council. The administration claims that a notice was issued, requiring the removal of encroachments or submission of ownership documents within three days. Locals had requested the administration to wait until the next hearing in the High Court on February 14, but the demolition proceeded after receiving court approval.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-elections-results-pti-imran-khan-nawaz-sharif-9154605/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the uncertainty and unrest following Pakistan's recent elections. Both Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif claim victory, but allegations of election manipulation and rigging are prevalent. The establishment initially backed Nawaz Sharif, while Imran Khan faced multiple obstacles, including imprisonment and persecution of his party members. Surprisingly, Imran Khan's popularity resulted in a strong showing for his loyalists. However, there were reports of manipulated results, leading to protests and clashes. International observers, including the US, expressed concern over electoral violence and interference. With no party holding a majority, a coalition government is likely, with Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto potentially leading it. Imran Khan's response to this outcome is yet to be seen, and the establishment may try to manipulate the situation further. International pressure, particularly from the US, may also play a role in shaping events.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/the-message-in-the-bharat-ratnas-how-the-politics-of-honour-works-9154262/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that former Prime Ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, as well as Dr M S Swaminathan, will be awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. This announcement is significant as it comes just before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, with the award for Dr Swaminathan and Charan Singh signaling the government's focus on farmers and agriculture. The recognition for Narasimha Rao highlights the Congress party's neglect of his accomplishments due to differences with Sonia Gandhi. The previous recipients of the Bharat Ratna under the Modi government have also been strategic choices, emphasizing political messaging and highlighting certain individuals' contributions.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code bans polygamy: Is the practice more prevalent among Muslims?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ucc-bans-polygamy-is-the-practice-more-prevalent-among-muslims-9153803/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly has passed the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024, which aims to bring uniformity in personal laws regarding marriage, divorce, and inheritance across communities in the state, excluding tribals. The bill extends the rule of monogamy to the Muslim community, disallowing men from having more than one wife. Data on polygamy in India is obtained from sources like the census and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), but both have limitations. The census infers polygamy based on the difference in the number of married men and women, while the NFHS directly asks women if their husbands have other wives. The most recent census was conducted in 2011, and the NFHS-5 surveyed less than 1% of households in India. A 1974 study found that Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus had higher rates of polygamy than Muslims. Overall, the prevalence of polygamy has decreased in recent years. According to the NFHS-5, Christians reported the highest incidence of polygamy, followed by Muslims and Hindus. A study by the International Institute of Population Sciences showed a decline in polygynous marriages among the whole population from 1.9% in 2005-06 to 1.4% in 2019-21.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna P V Narasimha Rao: 4 things you did not know about the man who changed India’s economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/things-to-know-bharat-ratna-p-v-narasimha-rao-9153578/</link>
			<description>Former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao has been posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He is recognized for his extensive service to India and his visionary leadership in advancing the country's economy. Here are four key points about Narasimha Rao:

1. After his passing, Narasimha Rao's body was not allowed inside the Congress headquarters for ordinary workers to pay their respects, causing controversy. His funeral in Hyderabad also made headlines as his half-burnt body was shown abandoned with stray dogs nearby.

2. Narasimha Rao had a strained relationship with Sonia Gandhi, attributed to personal, political, and ideological differences. Their disagreements included the distribution of a Rajya Sabha ticket, progress in the investigation of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, and the Congress party's defeat in the 1996 Lok Sabha election.

3. Narasimha Rao considered converting Ayodhya into a Union Territory with a Vatican-like status. He even contemplated building a temple at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid but later decided to wait until after the 1996 elections.

4. Atal Bihari Vajpayee referred to Narasimha Rao as the "true father" of India's nuclear program. Narasimha Rao was actively involved in the program and, despite international speculation, he considered conducting nuclear tests in Pokhran but ultimately postponed them due to various factors, including the 1996 elections.

In summary, P V Narasimha Rao's contributions to India as a leader, his complicated relationship with Sonia Gandhi, his thoughts on Ayodhya, and his involvement in the nuclear program shaped his legacy.</description>

			<title>Test tube rhinos: Why rebuilding doomed species is a desperate race against time</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/test-tube-rhinos-why-rebuilding-doomed-species-is-a-desperate-race-against-time-9135853/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the efforts of scientists to rebuild the northern white rhino population through in vitro fertilization (IVF). They have achieved the first-ever rhino pregnancy by transferring a lab-made rhino embryo into a surrogate mother. The process of preparing a surrogate mother, particularly a southern white rhino, is complex and requires careful monitoring of the fertile window for implanting the embryo. However, even with successful IVF and surrogacy, the genetic viability of the northern white rhino population remains a challenge. One potential solution is to create sperm and eggs from stem cells extracted from preserved tissue samples. The article also highlights the importance of raising the first batch of IVF northern white calves with northern white adults to learn the social and behavioral skills of the species. The project is funded by the German government and other donors, but there have been questions raised about whether resources should be allocated to other endangered species. The article emphasizes the urgency of conservation efforts, as the northern white rhino was declared extinct in the wild in 2008.</description>

			<title>Why a Chemistry professor suggested adding salt to tea for the perfect cup</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/salt-in-tea-bitter-taste-effect-science-9127798/</link>
			<description>A new book called "Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea" by Michelle Francl has caused a debate between Americans and the British regarding the best way to prepare tea. Francl suggests adding a pinch of salt to tea to reduce its bitterness, which sparked disagreement. The US Embassy in the UK clarified that adding salt to tea is not official US policy. The UK's Cabinet Office responded with humor, stating that tea can only be made using a kettle. 

Tea is beloved in Britain since it arrived from China during the colonial era, while the US is primarily a nation of coffee drinkers. Both tea and coffee have a slight bitterness due to caffeine and tannin compounds. The salt tip seems to work because taste receptors on the tongue prevent the brain from confusing bitter and sweet flavors. Mixing salt with bitter compounds can mask the bitterness. However, the exact mechanism behind this is not well-known.

Francl's book explores over 100 chemical compounds in tea and provides brewing advice. She recommends using short and stout tea cups to retain heat, heating the cup separately for more aromatic compounds, and preferring loose tea over teabags for better circulation of tea leaves. Microwaves are discouraged for tea preparation. When using tea bags, large ones should be used and steeped quickly with dunking and squeezing to reduce sour-tasting tannins.

To avoid curdling, warmed milk should be added after pouring the tea. Francl also suggests adding a small amount of lemon juice to remove floating scum formed from chemical elements in the tea and water. The book connects the chemistry of tea with fundamental scientific discoveries, such as Emil Fischer's Nobel Prize-winning work on caffeine and George de Hevesy's isotopic tracing research.

In unrelated news, an IAS officer in Chandigarh ordered the sealing of establishments and suspension of liquor licenses for ten major vendors. As a result, the Home department transferred him out of the Excise department.</description>

			<title>January 26, 1950: How India observed its first Republic Day</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/january-26-1950-when-india-became-republic-9127785/</link>
			<description>On January 26, 1950, India became a sovereign and democratic republic, marking the end of British rule in the country. After two years of independence, the newly drafted Constitution of India came into effect, replacing the British-era Government of India Act of 1935. Dr Rajendra Prasad became the President of India, and the Constituent Assembly became the Parliament until the first general elections took place in 1951-52. To showcase state authority and prestige, India continued the tradition of military parades started during the British Raj. The Republic Day celebrations included a grand military parade in New Delhi, with participation from the armed forces and the Delhi Police. The parade featured a 31-gun salute, celebratory gunfire, and aerial displays by Indian Air Force planes. The President's horse-drawn carriage was flanked by the President's Bodyguard, and after the event, the President returned to Government House. Despite the celebrations, leaders recognized the challenges ahead, as inequality persisted in social and economic life. In a speech, Dr B R Ambedkar emphasized the need to address this contradiction for the success of political democracy.</description>

			<title>What are Odisha’s famous black tigers, and why is the state planning a safari around them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-black-tigers-safari-naveen-patnaik-9127455/</link>
			<description>Odisha's Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik, has announced the development of a melanistic tiger safari near the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR), which will be the first of its kind in the world. This new safari aims to showcase the rare and majestic melanistic tiger species found exclusively in Odisha. The plan has received approval from the technical committee of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and is expected to be ready for visitors by October this year.

The STR, located in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district, is Asia's second-largest biosphere and the only habitat for melanistic royal Bengal tigers in India. These tigers have black and yellow interspersed stripes due to a unique lineage with higher-than-normal levels of melanin. However, they are more accurately described as being pseudo-melanistic since they are not entirely black.

Research conducted by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NBCS) suggests that a single mutation in the Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) gene results in the broadened or spread stripes seen in the Similipal black tigers. Genetic analyses indicate that these tigers may have originated from a small founding population and are inbred due to their isolation from other tiger populations.

The proposed melanistic tiger safari will encompass around 200 hectares of land near the Dhanbad-Balasore National Highway-18, approximately 15 km away from the STR. It will feature an open enclosure housing three melanistic tigers from the Nandankanan zoo and other rescued tigers unsuitable for the wild but suitable for display. The park will also include veterinary care facilities, a rescue center, staff infrastructure, and visitor amenities.

The safari's objective is to enable wildlife conservationists, researchers, and enthusiasts to observe these rare big cats up close and raise awareness about the need for their conservation. As the sighting of tigers is challenging in the expansive STR, the safari will enhance the attraction for visitors to Similipal.

The project requires further feasibility studies by an NTCA committee and other statutory clearances, including approval from the Central Zoo Authority. The state government's ongoing tiger survey suggests a higher number of royal Bengal tigers in the STR than reported by the NTCA, with their findings soon to be released.</description>

			<title>Moti Mahal vs Daryaganj: Who invented butter chicken? Delhi HC to decide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/moti-mahal-daryaganj-who-invented-butter-chicken-9126175/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court is currently handling a dispute between two restaurant chains, Moti Mahal and Daryaganj, over the claim of who invented butter chicken and dal makhani. Moti Mahal asserts that its founder, Kundal Lal Gujral, brought these dishes to India after Partition from Peshawar's Moti Mahal restaurant. However, Daryaganj, known for its appearance on Shark Tank India, also started advertising itself as the inventor of these dishes, attributing it to their forefather, Kundan Lal Jaggi. Moti Mahal filed a lawsuit against Daryaganj, alleging trademark infringement and passing off.

Moti Mahal's suit seeks a temporary injunction against Daryaganj, which would require them to refrain from certain actions until the court makes a decision. Moti Mahal claims that Daryaganj is misleading the public by falsely claiming to have invented butter chicken and dal makhani and by using a manipulated photograph of the Peshawar restaurant on its website. They want Daryaganj to stop claiming any association with Moti Mahal and using their trademarked tagline.

In response, Daryaganj argues that the photograph in question was jointly used by both parties' predecessors and that Moti Mahal has no exclusive rights to it. They claim that they cropped the picture to exclude the term "Moti Mahal" and avoid trademark infringement. While they agreed to remove the disputed photograph, Daryaganj is yet to file its complete response to the lawsuit.

The article explains that a trademark provides exclusive rights to its owner and its unauthorized use can be considered infringement. A trademark can be violated even if the infringing mark is not identical but is deceptively similar. Passing off is another form of infringement where one party tries to benefit from the reputation established by another in a trade or business. Moti Mahal argues that Daryaganj's claims and use of the manipulated photograph amount to passing off their trademark as their own.

In cases of trademark infringement, the owner can initiate legal action, seeking remedies like injunctions, damages, and accounts. An injunction is an official court order to prevent someone from doing something. The Delhi High Court has asked Daryaganj to file its response within 30 days, and the matter is scheduled for a hearing on May 29.

The article concludes with unrelated information about filmmaker Rohit Shetty, stating that he made a film called Cirkus during the pandemic to provide jobs for his associated workers but would not make the same film given a choice today.</description>

			<title>Why Thailand seeks an ambitious trade deal with EU, what the hurdles are</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/eu-thailand-trade-deal-significance-9126857/</link>
			<description>The European Union (EU) and Thailand are set to hold a second round of talks on a free trade agreement. Bangkok aims to finalize the negotiations by early 2025, hoping to revive its sluggish economy. The deal would solidify the EU's focus on Southeast Asia, as it has already secured trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore, while negotiating with Indonesia and the Philippines. However, discussions between the EU and Thailand may face challenges, particularly regarding the protection of their respective fishery industries. The EU is seeking a more comprehensive deal than Thailand's previous trade pacts, and both sides are expected to address concerns related to market access, intellectual property, government contracts, environmental standards, and agricultural and fishery imports. Thailand considers the EU trade agreement a top priority and hopes to conclude the deal within the specified timeframe.</description>

			<description>Operation Sarvashakti is a military operation launched by the Indian Army in the Rajouri-Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir. The objective of the operation is to target terrorists who have been carrying out attacks on security forces in the area. The operation involves deploying additional troops to increase the density of forces and enhance the chances of contact with terrorists. This operation is reminiscent of a previous operation called Operation Sarpvinash, which took place in the same forests over two decades ago. During that operation, Indian forces successfully flushed out terrorists who had infiltrated from across the border and had set up camps in the region. The current operation aims to eliminate the threat posed by terrorists in the area and restore peace.</description>

			<description>The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, recently announced the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, a program aimed at installing rooftop solar systems on 1 crore (10 million) houses. The objective of this initiative is to reduce electricity bills for the poor and middle classes while making India self-reliant in the energy sector. The target for rooftop solar installations had been set at 40 GW by 2022, but it has been missed. The new program focuses on individual households, which have great untapped potential for solar energy. The details of the program have not been released yet, but it aims to accelerate the adoption of decentralized solar power in the country.</description>

			<title>From Calcutta to Berlin via Kabul: How Subhas Bose outwitted the British to escape to Germany</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/how-subhas-bose-outwitted-the-british-to-escape-to-germany-9124203/</link>
			<description>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent figure in India's fight for independence, had a remarkable escape from house arrest in Calcutta during World War II. He traveled from Calcutta to Gomoh to Peshawar to Kabul to Russia, changing his identity three times along the way. Bose's escape involved careful planning and the assistance of individuals like Mian Akbar Khan. Eventually, he reached Berlin with the help of the German embassy and the support of Italy and Russia. It was a daring and resourceful journey that allowed Bose to continue his efforts for India's freedom.</description>

			<title>Sri Lankan Catholic church moves to declare Easter attack victims as ‘saints’: What this means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sri-lankan-church-easter-attack-saints-meaning-9122350/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Catholic church in Sri Lanka is planning to declare the 273 people who were killed in the 2019 Easter Sunday suicide bombings as "saints." The process of declaring saints in the Catholic Church involves verifying their virtuous lives, any miracles they may have performed, and their ascension to heaven after death. The bishop of their diocese initiates the process, and it is then reviewed by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Vatican. If approved, the person is recognized as a "Servant of God" and later as "Venerable" by the Pope. Beatification and canonization require the confirmation of miracles attributed to the person. Martyrs, on the other hand, can be beatified without a verified miracle but still require canonization to be declared saints. In the case of the Easter Sunday victims, the Catholic church plans to declare them as saints on April 21, 2024, five years after their sacrifice.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/multivitamins-memory-impact-health-9120654/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, the study mentioned in the article found that adults aged 60 and older who took a daily multivitamin for two years scored higher on memory and cognitive tests compared to those who took a placebo. The study suggests that multivitamins can be a safe and accessible approach to protecting cognitive health in older adults. However, experts caution that the benefits were small and it's unclear if they would translate to tangible improvements in people's lives. It's important to note that more research is needed to understand who specifically benefits from taking multivitamins.</description>

			<title>Davos meeting 2024: 5 key takeaways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/davos-meeting-2024-5-key-takeaways-9120670/</link>
			<description>At this year's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, held from January 15 to January 19, several key themes emerged. One prominent topic of discussion was Artificial Intelligence (AI), with conversations focusing on its transformative potential for human welfare, as well as concerns about regulation, job losses, misinformation, and inequality. Overall, the sentiment leaned towards the belief that the benefits of AI outweigh the negatives. Another significant theme was the fragility of the geopolitical situation, including wars in the Middle East and Europe, threats to global supply chains, and uncertainty around food security. However, no concrete plans for peace were offered regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict. Climate change also took center stage, emphasizing the need for businesses to adapt and countries to unite in taking action. China's economy, facing a slowdown, sought to attract more investment from the West. Finally, India's transformation as one of the fastest-growing economies and its contributions to women's health and gender equity were highlighted.</description>

However, 11% of tehsils have experienced a decrease in rainfall. The study also highlighted that monsoon patterns in India have been shifting and erratic, mainly due to the accelerating rate of climate change. These changes in rainfall patterns can have implications for agriculture output and ecosystems. Additionally, the study mentioned that there has been an increase in heavy rainfall events, which can lead to flash floods.</description>

The article discusses the recent missile strikes between Iran and Pakistan, as well as the attacks on Indian shipping in the Red Sea, highlighting the interconnected insecurities of the Subcontinent and the Gulf. It mentions five key trends in security interdependence that have emerged. These include the fragility of Pakistan's western borderlands, regional power politics involving dissident groups, Balochistan's geopolitical significance in the Gulf, Afghanistan's potential involvement in the Gulf, and India's growing economic and security stakes in the Middle East. The article suggests that these developments will require India to reassess its assumptions about security in the region.</description>

			<title>Markets crash: Causes, what retail investors should do</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/markets-crash-causes-what-retail-investors-should-do-9116077/</link>
			<description>The stock market in 2023 showed resilience, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gaining around 20%. This was driven by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, improved corporate sector performance, the expectation of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in 2024, and higher inflows from foreign portfolio investors. However, the rally did not last long, as domestic equity indices plummeted in January due to factors such as fears of rate cut delay by the Fed, weaker quarterly results from HDFC Bank, a rise in US bond yields, profit booking, and foreign portfolio investor outflows. Experts suggest that short-term volatility should not worry retail investors. It is important for investors to have a long-term vision and not try to time the market.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: Did we know 2023 was going to be the warmest year? Why climate warnings need to improve</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/2023-warmest-year-why-climate-warnings-need-to-improve-9112389/</link>
			<description>The year 2023 was the warmest on record, with each day being more than 1℃ above average. The future is uncertain, and the information provided by the climate community is not actionable at local levels. The warming trend is expected to continue in 2024, but the location and intensity of climate-related events may vary. Factors like reduced sulphate aerosols, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires likely contributed to the record warming. El Niño is forecasted to dissipate, and a La Niña may emerge in 2024, which could absorb heat from the atmosphere. It is challenging to predict the impact of global warming on the Cold Tongue region. Early warnings are crucial for crisis management, especially for food, water, energy, and transportation. Location-specific outlooks are necessary to plan for events like erratic monsoons, heatwaves, and fog episodes.</description>

			<title>Why the Tamil Nadu CM and Governor’s posts on Thiruvalluvar Day sparked a row, again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/tamil-nadu-cm-governor-thiruvalluvar-saffron-9111878/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the depiction of Thiruvalluvar, a philosopher-poet in Tamil Nadu, during the celebration of Thiruvalluvar Day. The Governor's office shared an image of Thiruvalluvar in saffron-colored clothes, which drew criticism from the ruling DMK party, accusing the governor of "saffronisation." The Chief Minister, on the other hand, shared an image of Thiruvalluvar in white robes. Thiruvalluvar is a revered figure in Tamil Nadu, and his teachings are considered essential by Tamilians, regardless of their religion. The article also mentions the historical ambiguity surrounding Thiruvalluvar's life and the various political groups that have shaped his depictions over time. The controversy is taking place in the context of recent archaeological findings that support the ancient history of Tamil Nadu.</description>

			<title>Who are the shankaracharyas — and who was Adi Shankara?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/shankaracharyas-adi-shankara-ram-temple-9110633/</link>
			<description>The four shankaracharyas, who head the four Hindu mathas, have announced that they will not attend the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on January 22. While the seers from Dwarka and Sringeri have not given reasons, the shankaracharyas of the Joshimath and Puri mathas have cited their concerns. One of them expressed that there is no reason to rush the consecration before the completion of the temple. The shankaracharyas are religious teachers who belong to a line of teachers going back to Adi Shankara, an important figure in Hinduism. The mathas are believed to have been established by him, although there is little historical evidence prior to the 14th century. Adi Shankara is known for his contributions to Advaita Vedanta, a school of Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the unity of consciousness and ultimate reality. His mathas are seen as keepers of Hindu faith and traditions.</description>

			<title>Ahead of Ram Temple consecration, Odisha to unveil its own ambitious project at Jagannath Temple</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/odisha-jagannath-temple-puri-project-corridor-9110431/</link>
			<description>The Odisha government is set to inaugurate a Rs 800-crore heritage corridor project around Puri's Jagannath Temple. The project aims to enhance infrastructure for visiting devotees and transform Puri into a world-class heritage city. The corridor includes a 75-meter corridor surrounding the temple complex. The project faced hurdles such as clearing structures and legal challenges, but it received permission from the National Monument Authority. The Odisha government has invited representatives from nearly 1,000 temples for the grand opening. The project is part of the state's flagship 5T initiative, with plans for the development of other major temples in the state as well.</description>

			<title>Delays at Delhi airport: Apart from the fog, what else is causing the chaos</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/delhi-airport-delays-fog-what-else-is-causing-chaos-9110487/</link>
			<description>Flight operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi were heavily disrupted due to dense fog. Passengers experienced long delays, cancellations, and even physical altercations. The complex nature of airline operations, with multiple flights and crew serving different sectors, compounded the problems caused by fog. On Sunday, over 500 outbound flights were delayed and 87 were cancelled, while inbound flights faced delays and cancellations as well. The situation improved on Monday as visibility improved. The airport's runway maintenance and construction activity further worsened the situation. The cascading effect of disruptions was also seen at the Mumbai airport, despite being unaffected by fog. Airlines with dense networks and high aircraft and crew utilization levels were particularly affected. Delays and congestion led to passengers being stuck in aircraft for hours. The congestion also affected the parking availability for incoming aircraft. Flight crew exceeding their Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) due to delays and long hours of waiting can result in crew shortage for airlines.</description>

			<title>Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Lohri and more: Significance of these festivals, celebrated across India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/makar-sankranti-pongal-lohri-significance-rituals-9109065/</link>
			<description>Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Magh Bihu are cultural celebrations held in different states of India on January 14. These festivals mark the transition from winter to warmer months and the beginning of longer days. Makar Sankranti follows the solar cycle and is celebrated almost on the same day every year. On this day, worshippers take a bath in sacred rivers, offer prayers to Lord Surya (Sun god), perform rituals, and break their fast during Punya Kaal. Regional variations exist in the way these festivals are celebrated. For example, in Tamil Nadu, the Pongal festival includes cleaning the house, making decorative kolam, and honoring the toil of bulls. In Karnataka, there is a tradition of eating a mixture of sesame seeds and jaggery and speaking good words. In northern India, sesame and jaggery ladoos or chikkis are distributed, and bonfires are organized. Kite-flying and sky lanterns are also part of the celebrations in certain regions.</description>

			<title>Hydroxychloroquine: How a new study links the COVID ‘cure’ to 17,000 deaths</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hydroxychloroquine-covid-medicine-new-study-9108866/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, I can summarize that hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, was briefly promoted as a potential treatment for COVID-19. However, researchers have linked it to an increased mortality rate of up to 11%. The World Health Organization conducted trials but found no clinical improvements in patients. It is important to note that repurposing drugs in a panic, without sufficient evidence, can be hazardous. While hydroxychloroquine is generally safe, its effects need to be evaluated differently when given preventively to a large number of healthy people. The drug was hailed as a "miracle cure" by some, including former US President Donald Trump, but its use was cautioned against by the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. Small-scale studies reported side effects, but larger studies are needed to determine the precise cause. A recent systematic review linked hydroxychloroquine to 17,000 deaths, but there is no consensus yet as different studies may have used conflicting methods. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders like lupus. It is important to consult healthcare professionals for accurate and up-to-date information on the use of hydroxychloroquine.</description>

			<description>William Lai, also known as Lai Ching-te, from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won the presidential election despite China's warnings. Lai, the current vice president, secured around 40% of the vote share. He grew up in a poor coal-mining village and pursued medicine before entering politics. China considers him a "separatist" due to his views on Taiwan's sovereignty. Lai aims to protect Taiwan from China's interference and maintain peace while strengthening ties with the United States and other democracies. The reaction from China and potential tensions remain uncertain.</description>

			<title>Voluntary freezing of trading accounts: How will SEBI’s new norms safeguard investors?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/voluntary-freezing-of-trading-sebi-investors-9107735/</link>
			<description>Starting July this year, investors in India will have the ability to freeze or block their trading accounts if they suspect any suspicious activity. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has instructed stock brokerages to establish a framework for this by April 1 and implement it from July 1, 2024. Currently, investors can only voluntarily block or freeze their demat accounts (which hold financial instruments electronically), not their trading accounts (which execute trades in the stock market). SEBI has recognized the need for a facility to block trading accounts, similar to blocking ATM or credit cards, to protect investors from potential fraud. The guidelines will be developed by the Brokers' Industry Standards Forum in consultation with SEBI and stock exchanges. The guidelines will include processes for clients to request the blocking of their trading accounts and the actions trading members need to take upon receiving such requests. Stock exchanges must ensure compliance by trading members and submit a compliance report to SEBI by August 31, 2024.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The United States and the United Kingdom conducted strikes against Houthi groups in Yemen on January 11. These strikes were in response to the Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, a vital maritime trade route. The Houthis have been attacking ships in protest of the Israeli military's actions in Gaza. The strikes targeted multiple Houthi locations and were supported by several countries. The Red Sea attacks have raised concerns about the conflict involving other countries and groups. The peace negotiations in Yemen may also be affected by these recent developments.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hafiz-abdul-salam-bhuttavi-let-9106693/</link>
			<description>Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi, a founding member of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and a key conspirator in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, has been confirmed dead by the United Nations Security Council. He passed away due to cardiac arrest on May 29, 2023, while in the custody of the Pakistani government. Bhuttavi, who was born in 1946, played a significant role in establishing LeT's base in Lahore and served as the acting chief on multiple occasions when Hafiz Saeed, the chief and mastermind behind the Mumbai attack, was detained. He was also involved in issuing fatwas and preparing terrorists for the Mumbai attacks. Bhuttavi had been serving a 16-year sentence in a terror financing case and was in prison since 2019.</description>

			<title>What happened in Bhutan’s elections — and are the results a win for India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bhutans-elections-india-china-9106431/</link>
			<description>The People's Democratic Party (PDP) and its leader Tshering Tobgay emerged victorious in the runoff election in Bhutan, defeating the Bhutan Tendrel Party (BTP). The PDP secured 30 seats in the national legislature, with a significant voter turnout. Bhutan's elections have been relatively fair and peaceful, despite the recent transition to a parliamentary democracy. However, there are concerns about media censorship, discrimination against minorities, and lack of accountability in the political system. The election took place amidst economic challenges, including a struggling tourism industry and high youth unemployment. Tobgay focused his campaign on addressing these issues and attracting investment to boost the economy. India, Bhutan's largest donor and ally, plays an important role in Bhutan's economic recovery, while China's influence in the region remains a point of contention. Tobgay is considered pro-India, strengthening India's strategic interests in the area. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Tobgay on his victory and expressed a desire to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-were-the-amalek-netanyahu-gaza-israel-icj-9105643/</link>
			<description>The Amalekites were an ancient biblical nation mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical accounts, they were the first to attack the Jewish people after their escape from Egypt. The story of the Amalekites has been used by Israeli politicians to justify violence against Palestinians. The invocation of Amalek evokes collective memories of historical persecution and serves as a justification for brutal reprisals. For example, in 1994, an Israeli extremist named Bharuch Goldstein gunned down unarmed Palestinians, believing them to be the Amalekites. It is concerning that the identification of Palestinians with Amalekites has had deadly consequences.</description>

			<description>India and the US will address various trade issues in their trade policy forum meeting. These include India's request for the restoration of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) revoked by former US President Donald Trump and the US's objection to India's laptop import monitoring system. The meeting is crucial as the US is India's largest trade partner, and India relies on US demand for export earnings. Closer trade ties could attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) and help resolve trade tensions. The US is concerned about India's monitoring system for laptop imports, questioning its purpose as a non-tariff measure. India also seeks a liberal visa regime and a totalisation agreement for social security benefits for Indian professionals working in the US.</description>

The bridge, also known as Atal Setu Nhava Sheva Sea Link, will reduce travel time between the two locations to under 20 minutes. The project, which was conceptualized six decades ago, aims to improve connectivity in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and promote economic development. The bridge is expected to benefit commuters and facilitate greater integration of Navi Mumbai with other areas, including the under-construction Navi Mumbai International Airport. However, concerns remain regarding the toll fees and the lack of public transport facilities on the bridge.</description>

They made changes to the sanitation and waste collection system, popularized initiatives among citizens, and focused on segregation and disposal of waste. The city also cleared and treated legacy waste and constructed transfer stations. Efforts were made to install new toilets and dustbins, and citizens were encouraged to build better habits around cleanliness. The city also imposed fines for littering and other offenses to deter habitual offenders.</description>

			<title>Why has South Africa taken Israel to the International Court of Justice?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-south-africa-israel-international-court-of-justice-9103758/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is holding a hearing to decide whether to order "provisional measures" in a case filed by South Africa against Israel for alleged violations of the Genocide Convention in relation to Palestinians in Gaza. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and settles legal disputes between states. The Genocide Convention is an international human rights treaty that defines genocide and codifies the crime for the first time. South Africa is asking for urgent relief to protect the rights of the Palestinian people and prevent further harm. The court will make a provisional measures order within weeks, which will be binding on all states. Israel has called the case "baseless," while Palestine and several other countries have welcomed it. This is not the first case the ICJ has heard under the Genocide Convention.</description>

			<title>What is the Square Kilometer Array project, significance of India joining it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-the-square-kilometer-array-project-significance-of-india-joining-it-9102401/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. India has officially joined the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project, which aims to build the world's largest radio telescope. India has been contributing to the project for several years and has now become a full member by signing an international treaty and making a financial commitment. The SKA will consist of thousands of dish antennas operating as a single unit, providing a large effective area for collecting radio waves. The project is being implemented in South Africa and Australia, and once completed, it will be significantly more powerful than existing radio telescopes. Although the SKA facilities are not located in India, the country's participation as a full member offers scientific and technological benefits, including preferential access to the facilities and opportunities for research and capacity building. The project also involves advanced technologies and intellectual property that will be accessible to all member countries. Indian scientists have identified various research areas, including the evolution of the early universe, galaxy formation, neutron star physics, and solar sciences, to utilize the SKA telescopes.</description>

			<title>Why 2023 was the warmest year ever, and what happens now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-2023-was-the-warmest-year-ever-9102355/</link>
			<description>According to the article, 2023 was the warmest year on record since 1850, surpassing the previous record set in 2016. Temperatures in 2023 likely exceeded those of any year-long period in at least the last 100,000 years. Rising temperatures in 2023 led to numerous extreme weather events worldwide, including heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires. The main driver behind this extreme warming is the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is suggested that 2024 could be even hotter than 2023, and there is a possibility of surpassing the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold for the entire calendar year.</description>

			<title>Gabriel Attal: Who is the new PM of France, what changes with his appointment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gabriel-attal-new-pm-france-what-changes-9102260/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. France's President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Gabriel Attal as the new Prime Minister, making him the youngest person to hold the post at the age of 34. This decision comes after the resignation of the previous Prime Minister, Elisabeth Borne. Macron's appointment of Attal is seen as an effort to rejuvenate his government ahead of the European Union Parliament elections, where his ratings have been trailing. Attal, who previously served as the Minister of Education, is a popular figure both within the ruling coalition and in opposition circles. He is also France's first openly gay Prime Minister. While the President holds greater powers in France's political system, Attal's personal popularity and energy may help the Macron government overcome recent challenges and move forward. It is worth noting that there are other serving gay Prime Ministers in the world, such as Ana Brnabić of Serbia, Leo Varadkar of Ireland, and Xavier Bettel, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg.</description>

			<title>Politics and piracy: How Houthi attacks in Red Sea are different from the earlier Somali hijackings</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/houthi-attacks-red-sea-somali-piracy-hijacking-comparison-9102168/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia on merchant ships in the Red Sea. These attacks have raised concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains, as shipping firms face the choice between higher insurance premiums for the risky Red Sea route or taking the longer and costlier route around the Cape of Good Hope. A US-led force has been deployed in the Red Sea to counter these attacks, but the dangers to shipping persist. The Houthis have targeted certain types of ships, particularly automobile carriers, while generally leaving oil tankers alone. The article also mentions the Houthis' support for Hamas and their links to Iran. It highlights the decline in piracy in the Gulf of Aden since 2016 due to international efforts in military cooperation and intelligence-sharing.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/private-us-spacecraft-land-moon-9100677/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. A private US company has launched a spacecraft carrying scientific instruments from NASA with the goal of becoming the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon in over 50 years. The mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, which involves private space companies in the Artemis program for lunar exploration. The spacecraft, called Peregrine, developed technical problems after launch, but the company is working to rectify them. The mission aims to reach the Moon on February 23 and will carry out various exploratory activities, including detecting water. The payloads will remain active for ten days after landing. This mission marks a significant step in the US's return to the Moon and its plans for longer stays and establishing a permanent base camp. NASA is collaborating with the private sector through the CLPS initiative to leverage American companies for lunar exploration. This launch is the first under the CLPS initiative and is seen as a giant leap for humanity.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/orthodox-christmas-why-after-december-25-9098968/</link>
			<description>In Eastern Orthodox traditions, Christmas is celebrated on different dates due to the use of different calendars. While most Orthodox churches celebrate Christmas on December 25th, some follow the Julian calendar and celebrate it on January 7th. This includes the Russian Orthodox Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, Georgian Orthodox Church, and some others. In Ukraine, the observance of Christmas on January 7th has political implications, as it asserts national identity and independence from Russia. In the United States, Orthodox churches may vary in their observance, with some following the December 25th date and others following the January 7th date. The specific traditions and worship services may also vary among different Orthodox communities.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/experts-explain-why-is-aditya-at-l1-9097705/</link>
			<description>Aditya-L1, launched by ISRO, is a mission to observe and understand the Sun. It is placed at the L1 point, which is the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point. The mission aims to study the Sun's energy production, the corona, solar wind, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. Aditya-L1 has seven instruments to observe radiation and charged particles. Its location at L1 allows uninterrupted observations. L1 is a stable point between the Earth and the Sun, where the gravitational forces cancel each other out. Aditya-L1 will remain in orbit around L1, providing a continuous view of the Sun. Placing the spacecraft at L1 ensures an uninterrupted view of the Sun, which is crucial for its mission.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh elections and India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bangladesh-elections-india-9097172/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the close relationship between India and Bangladesh, highlighting the importance of a stable and friendly Bangladesh for India's national security and economic interests. The incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seen as a close friend and ally of India, having improved security cooperation and cracked down on anti-India elements during her tenure. Bangladesh's economic rise has also strengthened ties with India, with Bangladesh becoming the second-largest economy in South Asia and a significant export destination for Indian goods. India also sees Bangladesh as a potential hub for regional cooperation in the Bay of Bengal, connecting South and Southeast Asia. While there have been concerns about democratic backsliding in Bangladesh, Hasina's leadership is considered crucial for maintaining stability and peace in the region. The article also mentions the complex relationships between Bangladesh, the US, and the UK, with the US showing some signs of toning down its criticism of Hasina's government. Overall, India hopes for a fair and non-violent election process in Bangladesh to further strengthen bilateral relations.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. In 1914, Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motors, announced a significant increase in the minimum daily wage for his workers, raising it from $2.34 to $5. This move garnered attention and sparked various reactions at the time. Ford had implemented a new method of production called the moving assembly line, which increased efficiency and reduced the time it took to build a car. Despite concerns about worker retention, the higher wages helped Ford retain employees and improve productivity. The decision proved to be a successful cost-cutting move, leading to increased profits for Ford Motors.</description>

			<title>Elections in Bangladesh: Why both India and China are backing Sheikh Hasina</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-elections-india-china-back-sheikh-hasina-9096924/</link>
			<description>Hmm, Bangladesh is currently at an inflection point both economically and geopolitically. Its growing economy, valued at $400 billion and with a growth rate of 7.1% in 2022, has attracted the attention of major powers. These powers, such as India, China, the United States, and Russia, see Bangladesh's growth and stability as crucial to advancing their own strategic interests in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.

The national elections in Bangladesh, which took place on January 7, have become a significant arena for various ambitions to play out. India and China, in particular, have high stakes in the outcome and credibility of the election process. Both countries have robust economic ties with Bangladesh and have wider regional rivalries. How Bangladesh manages the partnership expectations from these two Asian giants will be closely watched internationally.

India and Bangladesh have a strong trade relationship, with bilateral trade exceeding $15 billion in 2021-22. India recognizes Bangladesh as an important buffer state and provides critical support in ports and power grid access. On the other hand, Bangladesh's trade with China surpassed $25 billion in 2022. Bangladesh aligns strategically with China, which is helping transform its landscape through mega projects and has made significant investments in BRI-financed infrastructure projects.

Bangladesh follows a nuanced approach in its relations with India and China, prioritizing mutually beneficial relationships that align with its national interests. It leverages socio-economic, trade, and cultural ties with India for growth while maintaining significant military relations with China. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's handling of multiple partnerships has been adept, showcasing Bangladesh's strategic autonomy and its ability to cooperate and collaborate with major regional powers.

The intersection of geopolitics and economics is evident in Bangladesh's pursuit of developed nation status by 2041. The country strategically harnesses the economic and technological strengths of both India and China, granting them port access and fostering modernization. Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific outlook emphasizes engagement with regional and global stakeholders for human security, connectivity, and the blue economy, while avoiding geopolitical tensions.

The January 7 elections in Bangladesh hold significance for both India and China. The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the elections, raising concerns about the credibility of the election results. Both India and China, deeply invested in Bangladesh's stability, are wary of potential political and economic risks post-election. China's $38 billion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) initiatives depend on the continuity of the ruling party, while India may need to explore alternative strategies if Prime Minister Hasina were to be unseated.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like to know about Bangladesh or if you have any other questions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/oscar-pistorius-parole-9096717/</link>
			<description>Former South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has been released on parole after serving more than seven years for the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, known as the "Blade Runner" for his carbon fiber prosthetic legs, won medals in both the Paralympics and the Olympics. He claimed that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired four shots at a locked bathroom door in his home. While initially convicted of culpable homicide, the Supreme Court later found him guilty of murder and increased his sentence. Pistorius will live with his family in Pretoria and must attend rehabilitation programs while on parole.</description>

The building's LED display, installed in 2014, consists of over 1.2 million pixels, making it the world's largest electronic display.
