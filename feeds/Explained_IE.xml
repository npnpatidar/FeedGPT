			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/pakistan-national-day-lahore-resolution-explained-9193702/</link>
			<description>Pakistan is attempting discreet diplomatic outreach to India after a period of estrangement. To facilitate this, Pakistan will host its National Day celebrations in New Delhi, honoring the 1940 Lahore Resolution that called for an independent Muslim state in India. The resolution outlined the creation of two separate autonomous units for Muslim-majority regions, which later became the basis for Pakistan's independence. National Day is observed at the Pakistani embassy in New Delhi with speeches, music, and the presence of Indian dignitaries.</description>

			<title>Why Thailand’s now-replaced WTO Ambassador questioned India’s agriculture subsidies, what India argued</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/wto-india-food-subsidy-farmers-thailand-9193340/</link>
			<description>Thailand replaced its Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) after India protested her comments regarding India's Public Stockholding (PSH) program.

Thailand, as part of the Cairns Group, criticized India's PSH program, claiming it is subsidized and distorts global food prices. India, with rice exports exceeding the WTO's de minimis limit of 10% for developing countries, has argued for a change in the subsidy calculation method.

The Cairns Group, supported by the EU and US, seeks to reduce India's farm support, while India demands a permanent solution for public stockholding.

During the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference, tensions escalated between India and Thailand, leading to Indian negotiators boycotting discussions where the Thai representative was present.

Indian farmers have expressed concerns about WTO restrictions on farm support and have requested its removal from the WTO agreement.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, said by former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-shastri-9193486/</link>
			<description>Lal Bahadur Shastri, India's former Prime Minister, coined the iconic slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" ("hail the soldier, hail the farmer") in 1965 amidst numerous challenges, including the Indo-Pak conflict and agricultural crisis. The slogan emphasizes the vital role of both soldiers and farmers in India's well-being and security.

Shastri's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by his swift actions during the conflict, which resulted in a ceasefire on Pakistan's terms. He also prioritized agriculture, allocating funds and reforms to lay the foundation for the Green Revolution and empowered key figures in the sector.

Over the years, the slogan has evolved, with subsequent leaders adding "Jai Vigyan" (hail science) and "Jai Anusandhan" (hail research) to highlight the importance of scientific advancement and research.</description>

			<title>What is grey zone warfare, mentioned by India’s Chief of Defence Staff recently?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/grey-zone-warfare-meaning-examples-china-taiwan-9193251/</link>
			<description>In the 2024 Raisina Dialogue, General Anil Chauhan introduced "grey zone warfare" as the latest form of informal warfare, citing examples from the South China Sea and China's actions around Taiwan. Grey zone warfare involves actions that fall between direct conflict and peace, such as economic operations, influence campaigns, and cyberattacks.

Experts believe grey zone warfare has emerged due to factors like nuclear weapons and technological advancements, making direct conflicts too costly. It allows countries to pursue objectives covertly or with obfuscated attribution.

Grey zone warfare methods include economic sanctions, disinformation campaigns, and proxy wars. Russia and China have been associated with such tactics. For instance, China's presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan's complaints about increased Chinese military activity are examples of grey zone warfare.

While grey zone warfare poses challenges different from open conflicts, experts warn that it can escalate in multiple dimensions and become difficult to manage. It can also be used to bait adversaries into escalation, normalize disputed claims, and project strength.</description>

			<title>Bribes for votes: Why SC will decide if MLAs and MPs immune from criminal prosecution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-mla-mp-immune-criminal-prosecution-corruption-9193229/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is considering overturning a 1998 ruling that granted legislators immunity from bribery charges in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution provide this protection, which was interpreted literally in the P.V. Narasimha Rao case. However, a seven-judge bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud is examining the issue, focusing on whether the purpose of these articles was to protect legislators from criminal prosecution, the definition of "in respect of," and when the offense of bribery is complete. Senior advocates Raju Ramachandran and P.S. Patwalia argue for a narrow interpretation of the immunity, while Attorney General R. Vankataramani and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta advocate for reconsideration. The court will ultimately decide whether to maintain or overrule the P.V. Narasimha judgement.</description>

			<title>What is the military significance of the airstrip that India has developed for Mauritius?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/military-significance-airstrip-india-developed-mauritius-9192454/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi and Mauritian Prime Minister Jugnauth inaugurated an airstrip and jetty built by India on Agaléga Islands. Despite denials, reports suggest the airstrip could be developed into a military base. The project aims to enhance India's reach in the Indian Ocean, especially amidst China's growing influence. The initiative is part of India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy' with Mauritius and involves Indian Navy detachments and the supply of defense equipment. India is also strengthening ties with neighboring countries such as Seychelles, Madagascar, and certain African nations, while its relationship with the Maldives has been affected by political changes.</description>

			<title>What India’s latest leopard population estimates suggest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-leopard-population-estimates-9192015/</link>
			<description>According to the 'Status of Leopards in India, 2022' report, India's leopard population has increased to 13,874 from 12,852 in 2018. Central India and Eastern Ghats have the highest population of leopards. Madhya Pradesh has the largest population, followed by Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. While tiger populations have positively impacted leopard populations in some areas, they have also negatively impacted them in others. Poaching, habitat loss, and road accidents remain significant threats to leopards. Leopard-human conflict is also a growing issue due to leopards' adaptability and presence outside protected areas. States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala have reported numerous fatal attacks and human-leopard encounters.</description>

			<title>Is the President immune from prosecution? US Supreme Court to decide on Trump case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/presidential-immunity-trump-us-supreme-court-9191776/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court (SCOTUS) is considering whether former President Donald Trump has immunity from criminal charges for attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Trump faces conspiracy charges related to the January 6th Capitol attack.

The Constitution does not specify presidential immunity, but SCOTUS ruled in United States v Nixon (1974) that the President can be required to testify and produce evidence in criminal cases. However, the question of whether a President can be prosecuted while in office remains unanswered.

Trump argues that the "absolute immunity" granted to former President Nixon in Nixon v Fitzgerald (1982) should extend to criminal liability for actions taken during office.

In contrast to the US, India's President and Governors have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution during their terms. However, the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers have no such protection and can be treated like ordinary citizens in court.</description>

			<title>Obesity on the rise, high levels of undernutrition persist in India: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/obesity-undernutrition-persist-india-new-study-9191754/</link>
			<description>India faces a double burden of obesity and undernutrition. Over the past 32 years, obesity has surged, particularly in women with a 9.8% prevalence in 2022. Childhood obesity has also increased significantly. Despite declining, undernutrition remains high, with India having the highest prevalence of thinness in girls and the second highest in boys globally.

Socioeconomic factors play a role, with junk food being more accessible and affordable than nutritious options. Obesity is more prevalent in urban areas and among the better-off, while undernutrition persists in remote and poor regions.

Obesity contributes to non-communicable diseases, while undernutrition increases susceptibility to these conditions later in life. The study recommends addressing both issues through programs that promote healthy nutrition and weight loss support.</description>

			<description>Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, despite economic headwinds, remains optimistic, using weather metaphors to predict a brighter future. Despite a global downturn, reduced demand, and a struggling real estate industry, Li aims to revitalize China's economy. The key challenge is reaching the 5% growth threshold in 2024. Li's upcoming report to Parliament will outline his plan to boost internal consumption and attract foreign investment. Germany plays a significant role in this growth strategy, with record levels of FDI. Visa liberalization measures have been implemented to encourage investment from Germany and other EU nations, demonstrating China's eagerness for international business collaboration.</description>

			<title>Why have GDP and GVA growth rates diverged in Q3?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-have-gdp-and-gva-growth-rates-diverged-in-q3-9191086/</link>
			<description>India's GDP grew by an unexpected 8.4% in Q3 of 2023-24, surpassing RBI estimates of 6.5%. This helped raise the full-year estimate to 7.6%. Growth was driven by manufacturing, mining, construction, and services, while agriculture contracted.

However, there is a discrepancy between GDP and GVA growth, with GDP growing at 8.4% and GVA at 6.5%. This is due to lower-than-expected annual GDP deflator and a sharp rise in net taxes.

Investment growth supported GDP, while private consumption growth remained subdued. The government attributed the GVA-GDP divergence to a fall in subsidies.

Economists believe GDP deflator growth could lead to lower real GDP growth in the future. They emphasize monitoring consumption growth and private investments for sustained growth.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: How the development of Agaléga figures in India’s vision for its maritime neighbourhood</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-how-the-development-of-agalega-figures-in-indias-vision-for-its-maritime-neighbourhood-9191082/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Jugnauth inaugurated an airstrip and jetty on Agaléga Island, which belongs to Mauritius. The development aims to enhance socio-economic security for Mauritius and aligns with India's maritime vision. These facilities will improve the well-being of the island's inhabitants and create employment opportunities. They will also strengthen Mauritius' government presence and enable better monitoring of their Exclusive Economic Zone. India and Mauritius have close historical and cultural ties, with 70% of Mauritians having Indian origin. India's commitment to the SAGAR vision and willingness to assist maritime nations are underscored by this joint development. India respects sovereignty and has a track record of providing material support, information exchange, and joint exercises with Mauritius, but only upon request and in accordance with established mechanisms. India's development aid is not intended to create debt traps or violate sovereignty.</description>

			<title>Can you be sued for defamation if you retweet defamatory content?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/can-you-be-sued-for-defamation-if-you-retweet-defamatory-content-9190215/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has stayed a trial against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for retweeting an allegedly defamatory YouTube video. Retweeting may not always imply endorsement, according to the court. Kejriwal's counsel admitted the post was a mistake.

In Indian law, defamation can be civil (libel/slander) or criminal (IPC Section 499). Criminal defamation requires proof beyond reasonable doubt and carries up to two years' imprisonment. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of criminal defamation laws, but reasonable restrictions can be imposed under Article 19(2).

The Delhi High Court had ruled that retweeting defamatory content prima facie attracts liability. However, the Supreme Court has observed that retweeting may simply be sharing information and not an endorsement. The case will proceed with further hearings.</description>

			<title>How climate change has fuelled farmers’ protests in Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-farmer-protests-europe-9190128/</link>
			<description>European farmers are protesting due to rising costs, cheap imports, and the impact of climate change on agriculture. The EU's environmental regulations, aimed at reducing GHG emissions, have further exacerbated the situation. Farmers argue that these regulations are too strict, unfair, and economically unviable, especially with the added burden of energy costs and competition from Ukraine's neighbors. The backlash has led to a rollback of some regulations, but the EU still needs to curtail emissions from the sector to meet its Green Deal targets without further igniting farmer unrest.</description>

			<title>Sensex, Nifty jump above 1 per cent: What has led to this gain?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sensex-nifty-jump-1-per-cent-factors-gdp-9189716/</link>
			<description>Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty surged over 1% following the release of better-than-expected GDP growth of 8.4% for Q3 FY24. Key contributors include strong growth in manufacturing, construction, and capital formation.

Experts attribute the market rally to the solid GDP numbers and highlight the potential for large caps like Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ICICI Bank to lead the surge. However, tepid private consumption might impact consumer staples stocks.

While fixed investment remains a key driver of growth, consumption lags behind. The services sector shows resilience, but agriculture underperforms.

Despite the positive GDP data, Nomura projects a more moderate growth of 6.1% in 2024 and 6.2% in FY25 due to factors such as the impact of elections on public spending and weak consumption.</description>

			<title>Why the Supreme Court overturned its 2018 decision, which set a time limit on courts’ stay orders</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-decision-2018-stay-interim-orders-9189641/</link>
			<description>In 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) aimed to address delayed trials by automatically vacating stay orders by High Courts after six months. However, in 2023, a five-judge SC bench has overturned this ruling, citing concerns about "doing injustice" by nullifying lawful stay orders.

The bench held that constitutional courts should avoid setting precise timelines for case decisions, leaving discretion to lower courts familiar with local issues. They emphasized that High Courts should prioritize applications to vacate stay orders to ensure faster disposal of cases.

The ruling was based on arguments that automatic vacation of stay orders without due process violates principles of judicial fairness and that setting timelines is within Parliament's legislative powers, not the court's.</description>

			<title>India-built airstrip inaugurated in Agaléga, Mauritius: Its strategic significance vis-a-vis Maldives and China</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/agalega-airstrip-inagurated-mauritius-maldives-and-india-9189103/</link>
			<description>Indian technical personnel have replaced Indian military personnel on one of three aviation platforms in the Maldives. India also inaugurated an airstrip and jetty on Mauritius' Agaléga Island, strategically located in the Indian Ocean.

Mauritius and the Maldives are crucial outposts for India due to their maritime and strategic significance. China's increasing presence in the region has heightened India's concerns. India's withdrawal of military personnel from the Maldives follows pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu's request.

After an MoU signed in 2015, India upgraded the airstrip on Agaléga Island to enhance Mauritius' capabilities in safeguarding its interests and monitoring its Exclusive Economic Zone. Despite domestic criticism, Mauritius has managed the situation better than the Maldives, where former Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid disputes claims of foreign military presence.

India's presence in the Indian Ocean supports its maritime security interests and strengthens its relationships with island nations. However, domestic politics in these nations can influence their policies and India must navigate its diplomatic efforts carefully.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/first-semiconductor-fabrication-plant-can-help-plug-in-to-global-value-chain-9189172/</link>
			<description>The Union Cabinet has approved semiconductor projects worth ₹1.26 lakh crore, with the key highlight being Tata Group's partnership with TSMC to establish a semiconductor fabrication plant in India. This plant will produce semiconductor wafers for various industries, including high-performance computing and microcontrollers. The plant's construction is expected to begin in three months.

The plant is significant for India's semiconductor ambitions, as domestic manufacturing of these wafers is crucial for meeting national needs. The plant is part of a government-funded initiative to boost the domestic semiconductor industry, including a ₹76,000 crore chip incentive scheme.

Semiconductors are complex products requiring specialized facilities (fabs) for manufacturing. India aims to develop its semiconductor ecosystem by attracting foreign companies and promoting domestic research. Challenges include attracting highly skilled talent and fostering original semiconductor design research, but the government is investing in R&amp;D to address these issues.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/red-bull-christian-horner-cleared-in-mysterious-probe-9188913/</link>
			<description>Formula One has been embroiled in controversy before the start of its 2024 season. Rumors abound about Lewis Hamilton's possible move to Ferrari, while Christian Horner, Red Bull team principal, has been cleared by an internal investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior.

Despite the clearance, Horner's future in F1 remains uncertain as details of the allegations against him remain undisclosed. This lack of transparency has led to speculation and placed Red Bull, F1, and stakeholders like sponsors and drivers in a precarious position.

Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and driver Lewis Hamilton have called for greater clarity, while Verstappen has expressed trust in the process. Red Bull's dominance in recent years is at stake, with Horner's departure potentially leaving the team in uncharted territory.</description>

			<title>PM Modi launches hydrogen-powered ferry: features, significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-launches-hydrogen-powered-ferry-features-significance-9188830/</link>
			<description>India has launched its first domestically built hydrogen fuel cell ferry, named "Harit Nauka." Built by Cochin Shipyard Limited, the ferry has a 24-meter catamaran design and can accommodate 50 passengers. It is eco-friendly, with zero emissions, noise, and energy efficiency due to its hydrogen fuel cell technology, which generates electricity using hydrogen and releases only water. The ferry uses a 50-kW PEM fuel cell with Lithium-Ion Phosphate batteries, developed by KPIT Technologies and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Labs. India has now indigenously developed hydrogen fuel cell systems, giving it an advantage in the marine sector. The "Harit Nauka" initiative aims to transition inland vessels to green fuels, with the ferry as a pilot project.</description>

			<title>How does a chatbot remember the prompts you gave it? Understanding context windows</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-are-context-windows-in-ai-9188742/</link>
			<description>ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by GPT 3.5 or GPT-4, a large language model (LLM). The chatbot interacts with users through a chat interface, similar to messengers.

Context windows are crucial for AI models to recall information during a conversation. The size of the context window determines the amount of information the model can consider at once to generate responses. Larger context windows provide more information but require more computational power and can lead to irrelevant information being included.

GPT-4 Turbo has a massive context window of 128K tokens, while Google Gemini 1.5 Pro has a context window of up to 1 million tokens. While larger windows can enhance accuracy, they come with challenges such as increased computational power, memory bandwidth, and storage requirements. Additionally, large context windows can result in repetitive or contradictory responses and a higher carbon footprint.</description>

			<title>Why homesexuality is ‘natural’ in the animal kingdom</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/homesexuality-in-animal-kingdom-9188557/</link>
			<description>Researchers observed male humpback whales engaging in sexual activity for the first time in 2022. Homosexuality is prevalent in many animal species, attributed to both biological and environmental factors. Despite reproductive implications, homosexuality persists due to hypotheses such as "indiscriminate mating," where individuals indiscriminately mate without recognizing sex. Other hypotheses suggest adaptive functions, such as fostering social bonds and reducing intrasexual aggression. Studies have found a correlation between same-sex sexual behavior and sociality, and evidence indicates it may mitigate adulticide in males. Same-sex sexual behavior is considered a convergent adaptation in mammals, providing survival benefits.</description>

			<title>Who is Abdul Karim ‘Tunda’, linked to 40 terrorist bombings, and now acquitted in one case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/who-is-abdul-karim-tunda-acquitted-bomb-blasts-9188408/</link>
			<description>Abdul Karim "Tunda," an alleged bomb expert and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, has been acquitted in a 1993 train blasts case. The acquittal comes despite being linked to numerous terrorist attacks over the years.

Tunda, born in 1943, joined the neo-fundamentalist sect after witnessing communal violence during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He later traveled to Pakistan and received training in explosives from the ISI.

After the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, Tunda is suspected of being involved in several bombings, including the December 6, 1993, train blasts. He was also accused of raising funds and scouting recruits for LeT.

Apprehended in 2013, Tunda faced multiple cases, but was acquitted in most. Despite being convicted in a 1996 blast case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court later commuted his sentence.</description>

			<title>Why Apple has shelved its car project: Vehicles are now more about software than hardware</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/apple-shelve-car-project-ai-significance-9188455/</link>
			<description>Apple has ended its 10-year electric self-driving car project, Project Titan, to focus on generative AI and mixed-reality headsets. The shift from mechanical to software-driven vehicles has made car manufacturing more software-centric, giving Apple an advantage due to its expertise in this area.

Apple's CarPlay smartphone integration platform, supported by most new US cars, has allowed it to dominate the car software experience. CarPlay has fostered customer loyalty and given Apple control over driver data, which is expected to become increasingly valuable in the future.

The growing demand for connectivity and digital offerings in cars is driving a shift towards software integration, creating opportunities for companies like Apple. Legacy automakers are facing software challenges and are actively hiring software engineers to address this gap.</description>

			<title>Explained: The Genome India project, aimed at creating a genetic map of the country</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/creating-indias-genetic-map-9187160/</link>
			<description>The Genome India initiative has sequenced 10,000 genomes from Indian individuals, creating a genetic map of the population. The 8 petabyte dataset is a "digital public good" available to researchers for developing diagnostics, therapies, and studying rare diseases. The project aims to map the genetic diversity of India's distinct population groups. Researchers have identified 135 million genetic variants found in India, including mutations associated with cardiac arrest and skin conditions. The database enables targeted treatments, identifies resistance-indicating variants, and helps prevent adverse reactions to anesthesia. The sequencing process takes five days per genome and involved collecting samples from 99 population groups. The completed map provides a baseline for understanding the genetic makeup of India's population.</description>

			<title>Why did the Supreme Court ban Patanjali from advertising its products?</title>

			<description>The Supreme Court has banned Patanjali Ayurved from advertising its products due to misleading claims. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) filed a petition after Patanjali published ads attacking allopathic medicine, claiming it was "stupid" and responsible for COVID-19 deaths. Despite assurances from Patanjali to the court that such claims would cease, the company continued to publish misleading ads claiming "permanent relief" for diseases and superiority over conventional medicines. The court deemed Patanjali's actions "unacceptable" and imposed a blanket ban on all advertising of its medicinal products until further orders. The case will be heard again on March 19.</description>

			<title>National Science Day: The Raman Effect, which CV Raman won the Nobel for</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/national-science-day-cv-raman-9185655/</link>
			<description>In 1986, India instituted National Science Day to commemorate Sir CV Raman's discovery of the "Raman Effect" in 1930, earning him a Nobel Prize. The Raman Effect occurs when light passing through a liquid scatters, resulting in a different color due to changes in wavelength.

CV Raman, born in 1888, published his first research paper at 18 and began his breakthrough experiments on light scattering after becoming an assistant accountant general in Calcutta. His observations on the Mediterranean Sea's blue color led to the discovery.

Raman's discovery revolutionized quantum theory and gave birth to Raman spectroscopy, a tool for chemical analysis. Today, it has diverse applications, including studying art, detecting drugs, and conducting non-invasive examinations.</description>

			<title>Row over Karnataka temple Bill: What changes it proposed, how other states manage temple revenues</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-karnataka-temple-bill-controversry-9184880/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government's proposal to increase Hindu temple taxation by diverting a portion of their gross income to a common pool failed in the Legislative Council due to opposition from the BJP. The Bill aimed to redistribute temple income to support lower-income temples and provide benefits to priests. However, the BJP criticized the government for targeting Hindu temples alone and claimed that the funds would not be used for religious purposes.

Other states have different approaches to temple revenue management. Telangana has a Common Good Fund where religious institutions contribute a percentage of their income for temple maintenance and religious education. Kerala has Devaswom Boards that manage temples and receive state funding, but revenue figures are not publicly disclosed.</description>

			<title>BJP and the idea of simultaneous elections: A short history going back 40 years</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/bjp-simultaneous-elections-history-9184172/</link>
			<description>The BJP's memorandum to the One Nation, One Election Committee proposes simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha, state assemblies, and later local bodies. The idea has been part of BJP manifestos since 1984, along with other electoral reforms like electronic voting machines and voter ID cards.

Over the decades, the BJP's manifestos have included proposals for:

* Controlling election funding by banning company donations and instituting public funding (1984)
* Banning company donations, compulsory voting, and empowering the Election Commission (1989)
* Allowing company donations and incentivizing open funding (1991, 1996)
* Electoral reforms bill, fixed five-year terms, and replacing no-confidence motion with a constructive vote (1998, 1999)
* Eliminating criminality in polls and revising expenditure limits (2014)
* Simultaneous elections and a single voters' list (2019)</description>

			<title>SC terms woman military officer’s 1988 discharge ‘illegal’: How courts have ruled for women in armed forces</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-woman-military-officers-armed-forces-9184035/</link>
			<description>- Lt. Selina John, a former permanent commissioned officer in the Military Nursing Service (MNS), was released from service in 1988 due to her marriage, which was deemed a violation of gender equality.


- The Armed Forces Tribunal deemed the termination illegal and ordered her reinstatement with back wages, but the Central government challenged this order in the Supreme Court.


- The Supreme Court upheld the tribunal's decision, stating that the government's rule terminating employment due to marriage was discriminatory and illegal.


- The court directed the government to pay Rs 60 lakhs in compensation to Lt. John and rejected the argument that women nursing officers were unfit for service due to marriage or childbirth.


- The Supreme Court's decision aligns with a previous ruling in 2020 that granted permanent commission to women officers in the Army, recognizing their right to pursue full-length careers.


- Despite this ruling, military nurses were not granted the status of ex-servicemen, affecting their re-employment opportunities and benefits.


- A Punjab and Haryana High Court division bench recently ruled that MNS officers should be considered ex-servicemen under the Punjab Recruitment of Ex-Servicemen Rules, 1982, acknowledging their service to the nation.</description>

			<title>Russia captures Avdiivka: What this means for Ukraine, the war, and Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/russia-captures-avdiivka-what-this-means-for-ukraine-the-war-and-europe-9171658/</link>
			<description>Summary: Russia celebrates a significant victory by capturing the strategic town of Avdiivka in Ukraine, a major resistance stronghold near Donetsk. This victory opens doors for further Russian advancement and poses challenges for Ukrainian forces. The fall of Avdiivka exposes Ukraine's shortage of arms and ammunition, affecting their ability to defend against the overpowering Russian military. Western aid delays, specifically a stalled $60 billion package in the US House of Representatives, exacerbate Ukraine's vulnerabilities. The fall of Avdiivka raises concerns in Europe about increasing defense spending amid Russia's assertiveness, emphasizing the shifting security landscape and the need for greater self-reliance.</description>

			<title>What is Article 142, invoked by SC to overturn Chandigarh mayoral poll results?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-article-142-chandigarh-mayoral-poll-results-9171621/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently overturned the results of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation's mayoral elections using its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. This article delves into the history and scope of Article 142, highlighting its unique ability to deliver complete justice even in situations where existing laws may not provide a remedy. The court's rulings in various cases, such as the Bhopal gas tragedy case, have shaped the understanding and application of Article 142. Criticism surrounding the broad and potentially arbitrary nature of these powers is addressed, emphasizing the need for self-regulation to prevent misuse. The article also discusses the judiciary's accountability and the importance of the separation of powers. Despite these criticisms, the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution limited the use of Article 142 to exceptional circumstances where existing laws fall short. Additionally, the Supreme Court has set limits on its own exercise of power under Article 142 to ensure justice according to law rather than sympathy or illegality.</description>

			<title>SC directs govts to follow ‘broad’ definiton of forests: How they are defined, what law says on conservation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-forests-definition-conservation-9171444/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has instructed governments to adhere to the expansive definition of forests from its 1996 T N Godavarman case until a consolidated record of all types of forests in India is compiled. The court recently ruled that the 2023 amendments to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, had weakened the Act by narrowing its scope. The government's amendments aimed to specifically identify forests as per government records, which was a response to perceived expansion of the Act's applicability. The court emphasized that the Act would apply to all lands identified as forests or resembling the dictionary meaning of forests. Future decisions will be based on the progress of expert committees identifying protected forest areas. The matter is set for final hearing in July.</description>

			<title>What are Money Bills and why are they the subject of a constitutional challenge?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/money-bills-supreme-court-criteria-electoral-bonds-9171044/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal debate before the Supreme Court regarding what constitutes a money Bill. This debate is crucial as money Bills offer a faster route for enacting laws by Parliament and involve specific conditions related to financial matters. Recent challenges have questioned the validity of passing certain Acts, like the Aadhaar Act and the Finance Act, through the money Bill route. Justices have expressed differing opinions on the constitutionality of these Acts as money Bills, highlighting the importance of clarifying this issue. The pending decision by a seven-judge bench will likely impact future legal challenges against Acts passed through the money Bill route, such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Aadhaar Act.</description>

			<title>Why Canada’s Opposition leader demanded to know ‘WTF!’ in the country’s Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canada-poilievre-justin-trudeau-arrivecan-wtf-9170678/</link>
			<description>Canada's Leader of Opposition, Pierre Poilievre, highlighted in Parliament that the Canadian government paid $258 million over several years to a small company involved in creating an app for safe travel during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, GC Strategies, received numerous contracts without competitive bidding, leading to concerns of financial mismanagement. The Auditor General's report revealed that the Canada Border Services Agency and other government bodies failed to follow good management practices in the app's development and contracting process. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has responded by suspending contracts with GC Strategies and pledging cooperation with investigations. The scandal has compounded Trudeau's political challenges leading up to the 2025 general elections, with the Opposition linking the financial irregularities to the country's growing cost of living crisis and declining support for liberal immigration policies.</description>

			<title>Situation report in pulses, cotton: The crops in Centre’s MSP proposal to protesting farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/situation-report-in-pulses-cotton-crops-in-centres-msp-proposal-to-farmers-9170063/</link>
			<description>During recent talks, the Indian government proposed crop diversification in Punjab, suggesting cooperatives to procure five crops at MSP. The farmers demand guaranteed MSP for all crops nationwide and rejected the proposal. Punjab's heavy focus on water-intensive paddy cultivation has led to groundwater depletion. Despite efforts to diversify crops, cotton and maize cultivation areas have decreased, while pulses' area has risen. India aims for self-sufficiency in pulses by 2027 through MSP incentives and procurement schemes. Punjab contributes minimally to CCI's cotton procurement. NAFED procured significant quantities of pulses under PSS and PSF, but concerns exist regarding their disposal below MSP.</description>

			<title>La Nina impacted air quality in India in the winter of 2022: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/la-nina-impacted-air-quality-in-india-what-a-new-study-says-9170062/</link>
			<description>A recent study by Indian researchers from the National Institute of Advanced Studies and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has linked air quality in Indian cities to La Nina events. In the winter of 2022, northern cities like Delhi experienced cleaner air due to a deviation from normal wind patterns, while western and southern cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai saw worse air quality. The change in wind direction transported pollutants from agricultural waste burning in Punjab and Haryana to southern regions, impacting cities like Mumbai. The study suggests that the extended La Nina event lasting three years influenced these anomalous wind patterns, highlighting the potential impact of La Nina on air quality trends in India.</description>

			<description>The Bombay High Court criticized the CBI for what it termed as an "abuse of power" in the arrests of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar.

The court highlighted that the arrests violated Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code, which aims to prevent unnecessary detentions. The HC stated that the couple had complied with CBI notices and had not been interrogated for over three years since the FIR was filed. It emphasized that the arrests lacked proper justification and condemned them as a misuse of authority.</description>

			<title>Round 4 of talks: What has the Govt offered protesting farmers from Punjab?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/round-4-government-punjab-farmers-protest-talks-9169756/</link>
			<description>During recent talks, the government proposed diversification into pulses, cotton, and maize to address farmers' concerns.

Punjab Chief Minister and farm unions support the idea, citing benefits such as reduced water dependency and increased income. The proposal aims to address water scarcity issues and could aid in crop diversification. However, uncertainties remain, as farmers are reviewing the proposal before making a final decision. The move is crucial for Punjab, facing water scarcity and desertification issues due to paddy cultivation.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: How does climate change impact extreme weather events?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-impact-extreme-weather-events-9169603/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of climate change on extreme weather events due to the increase in global temperatures. It notes that rising temperatures have led to more frequent and intense events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. While it's challenging to attribute specific events solely to climate change, studies can indicate how warming climate exacerbates these events. For instance, heatwaves and droughts are becoming more severe due to global warming, leading to dire consequences like famine and displacement of populations. The article also mentions how warmer temperatures amplify hurricanes, with oceans absorbing much of the excess heat, causing marine heat waves and intensifying storms. Additionally, it highlights how higher temperatures contribute to more evaporation, heavier rainfall, and increased flooding.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/cji-chandrachud-court-vacations-judges-criticism-debate-9169237/</link>
			<description>Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud addressed criticisms regarding the vacation days allotted to Indian judges, highlighting the misconception that judges have excessive holidays. He emphasized that judges work tirelessly every day, including weekends, with district judges engaged in legal aid camps and administrative tasks. The Supreme Court operates for 193 days annually, while High Courts and trial courts function for approximately 210 and 245 days, respectively. Despite scheduled breaks, judges are available in "vacation benches" to address urgent cases. The debate around vacation days stems from concerns about case backlogs and slow legal processes. Various recommendations have been made to reduce vacation periods and enhance court efficiency. Comparisons with apex courts in the US and the UK show differing workloads and vacation structures.</description>

			<title>Court orders Trump to pay over $350 million: What is the case — and can the former president afford the penalty?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-pay-350-million-civil-fraud-9166736/</link>
			<description>Former US President Donald Trump has been ordered to pay over $350 million plus potential interest charges of $100 million for fraudulently inflating his net worth to deceive lenders. The ruling by a New York court judge also includes a ban on Trump and his adult sons from holding top positions in New York companies for several years. The judge criticized the defendants for their lack of remorse and ordered Trump to pay the penalty, potentially affecting his significant net worth, estimated to be around $2.6 billion. Trump faces additional financial challenges, including legal fees and damages to pay in other cases, which might compel him to liquidate assets to cover the penalties.</description>

			<title>Why the Right wing in America dislikes Taylor Swift</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/why-right-wing-america-dislikes-taylor-swift-9165323/</link>
			<description>Former President Donald Trump criticized Taylor Swift for potentially endorsing Joe Biden, suggesting it would be disloyal after he signed the Music Modernization Act in 2018. Right-wing conspiracy theorists claim Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce, her boyfriend who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, is a PR stunt to boost Biden's chances. Some conspiracy theories propose that the Pentagon is using Swift's large online following to combat misinformation and elevate Democrats' political aims. Others suggest that the NFL rigged games to allow Swift and Kelce to make a splashy endorsement of Biden. Swift's political involvement and endorsements have sparked dislike from the right-wing, particularly Republicans who view it as a departure from her country music roots. It remains unclear whether Swift's endorsements can significantly influence elections, but her massive fan base could potentially increase voter turnout for candidates she supports.</description>

			<title>Navalny dies in prison: How the anti-corruption crusader became Putin’s biggest rival</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/navalny-dies-prison-putin-rival-9165227/</link>
			<description>The death of Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has raised suspicions of a state-orchestrated political assassination. Navalny gained recognition as an anti-corruption activist and participated in protests against Putin in 2011-12. Despite facing obstacles, including arrest and being barred from running for public office, Navalny remained in the public eye through his YouTube channel, which produced popular videos criticizing the Kremlin. In 2020, he survived a poisoning attack with a nerve agent called Novichok, but upon returning to Russia in 2021, he was arrested and sentenced to 19 years in prison on controversial charges. Amnesty International recognized him as a "prisoner of conscience." Navalny was moved to a harsh penal colony in the Arctic Circle, where he spent significant time in isolation. His death leaves him as the last prominent Putin critic remaining in Russia, as others have either fled the country or died under mysterious circumstances. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin faces little opposition as he seeks to extend his rule beyond 2030.</description>

			<title>Why has RBI put restraints on a certain card network?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-restraints-card-network-9164676/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has ordered an unnamed card network to stop allowing "unauthorized payments" through business cards. The regulator cited violations of payment system laws and concerns over non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. The RBI did not mention the specific card network, but mentioned that only one card network has enabled unapproved card payments by businesses. The arrangement involved an intermediary accepting card payments from corporates and transferring the funds to non-card accepting recipients via IMPS, RTGS, or NEFT. The RBI advised the card network to halt such arrangements until further notice, while clarifying that regular usage of business credit cards is unaffected. Visa has confirmed receiving the regulator's directive and instructed Business Payment Service Providers (BPSPs) to suspend transactions until further notice.</description>

			<title>Electoral Bonds verdict: How the proportionality test was applied in the case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/electoral-bonds-verdict-how-the-proportionality-test-was-applied-in-the-case-9164082/</link>
			<description>A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, unanimously struck down the electoral bonds scheme, stating that the restrictions on free speech were not proportional to its goals: curbing black money and protecting donor privacy. The court emphasized that a law passed by Parliament cannot interfere with the fundamental rights listed in Part-III of the Constitution. The proportionality test, which determines if an action is a reasonable restriction, was applied in this case. The court also highlighted the importance of balancing competing fundamental rights, specifically the right to information and the right to privacy. The Chief Justice suggested that less intrusive methods, like the electoral trusts scheme, could be used to achieve the same objectives. In unrelated news, Indian cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin withdrew from the 3rd Test due to a family medical emergency, with the BCCI expressing support for him and his family's privacy.</description>

			<title>On what grounds RBI, EC objected to electoral bonds scheme</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/on-what-grounds-rbi-ec-objected-to-electoral-bonds-scheme-9164077/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by the electoral bonds scheme in India, particularly from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Election Commission of India (ECI). The RBI objected to the proposal of allowing other banks to issue electoral bearer bonds, citing concerns about multiple entities issuing bearer instruments and the potential for money laundering. The RBI argued that existing payment methods like cheques and digital payments could achieve the same purpose. The ECI raised objections regarding the impact on transparency in political finance and recommended reintroducing caps on corporate funding. The absence of key BJP figures in Tamil Nadu and the growing popularity of the DMK have raised concerns about the BJP's electoral prospects in the state.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court draws new red line: burden is on state to  be ‘least restrictive’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/electoral-bonds-scheme-sc-draws-new-red-line-burden-is-on-state-to-be-least-restrictive-9164175/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has struck down the electoral bonds scheme, stating that the state must prove its measure is the "least restrictive" and that there are other "equally effective" methods to achieve its goal. The court rejected the government's argument that electoral bonds are the only way to curb black money and suggested Electoral Trusts as a less restrictive alternative. It disagreed with the idea that a voter's right to know should be extinguished for donor privacy. The ruling questions whether donor anonymity can be a legitimate state interest for all donors and marks a departure in how the court balances competing rights. Previously, the court placed public interest over individual rights, but this ruling requires a proportionality test to ensure the state's action is proportional to its goal. This is a significant departure from previous cases.</description>

			<description>Shehbaz Sharif, a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), is expected to become the next Prime Minister of Pakistan. This comes as a surprise, as his older brother Nawaz Sharif was widely expected to assume the position. Shehbaz's political career includes serving as the Prime Minister of Pakistan until August 2023 and as Chief Minister of Punjab on multiple occasions. He is known for his efficient working style and infrastructure development, but his time as Prime Minister faced criticism for economic handling and allegations of corruption. Shehbaz's elevation is attributed to his better relationship with the military compared to his brother.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court has invalidated the Electoral Bonds Scheme (EBS), which allowed anonymous funding of political parties through the purchase of electoral bonds. The court also struck down amendments to electoral finance laws related to the introduction of the EBS. The petitioners argued that the scheme violated voters' right to information about political party funding. The court agreed, emphasizing the link between money and politics and the voters' right to know about potential policy changes influenced by large contributions. The court also reinstated the cap on political contributions from companies, highlighting the risk of unlimited corporate influence on elections.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-electoral-bonds-verdict-restore-status-quo-9163356/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has struck down amendments made by the Indian government to key laws in order to facilitate corporate donations to political parties. These amendments, made through the Finance Acts of 2016 and 2017, were overturned alongside the Electoral Bonds Scheme. Before these amendments, political parties were required to declare all contributions over Rs 20,000 and maintain a record of donations for taxation purposes. The amendments removed the donation limit for companies and eliminated the requirement to declare and maintain a record of donations made through electoral bonds. The Supreme Court's judgment restores the previous regulations, emphasizing the importance of transparency and curbing corruption in electoral financing.</description>

			<title>Why does Kerala want the Centre to amend the Wildlife Protection Act?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kerala-centre-amend-wildlife-protection-act-9163205/</link>
			<description>The Kerala Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging the Union Government to amend sections of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The proposed amendments aim to address the escalating human-animal conflict in the state. Specifically, Kerala wants to devolve the powers of the Chief Wildlife Warden to Chief Conservators of Forests, simplifying procedures for dealing with wild animals posing a threat to human life. Additionally, Kerala seeks to have wild boar declared as vermin, allowing for the culling of their population to protect livelihoods. The state has witnessed a rise in human-animal conflicts, causing damage to agriculture and resulting in casualties. Kerala's previous attempts to control the wild boar population were hindered by a lack of licensed shooters and bureaucratic processes.</description>

			<title>Explained: China’s ‘Xiaokang’ border defence villages along the LAC, now being occupied</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/china-xiaokang-border-defence-villages-lac-9163202/</link>
			<description>Chinese residents have started occupying several of the model 'Xiaokang' border defense villages along the China-India border. These villages were constructed by China since 2019 but remained unoccupied until recently. Some of these villages are located near the Lohit Valley and Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh. The purpose of these villages, which consist of large double-storey buildings, is not entirely clear but they are believed to serve both civil and military purposes. China has constructed a total of 628 such villages along India's border with the Tibet Autonomous Region. The exact extent of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has been a point of contention between the two countries. China passed a new law in 2021, effective from January 1, 2022, concerning its land borders, which includes the border defense villages program. In response, India has announced the Vibrant Villages Programme to develop its border villages into modern villages and tourist attractions. This program aims to develop 663 border villages in the first phase, with select villages along the China-India border being prioritized for development. Both China and India have been focusing on building infrastructure and improving connectivity in their respective border regions.</description>

			<title>SC strikes down electoral bonds scheme as ‘unconstitutional’: What grounds did the verdict rely upon?</title>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India declared the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional in a unanimous judgment. The scheme allowed corporations and individuals to anonymously donate money to political parties through purchasing electoral bonds from the State Bank of India. The details of bond purchasers were accessible only to the bank. The court raised several issues, including whether the scheme violated the Right to Information, whether curbing black money justified restricting the Right to Information, whether the infringement of RTI was justified for donor privacy protection, and whether unlimited political contributions by companies were unconstitutional. The court concluded that the scheme violated the right to information, curbing black money was not a legitimate reason to restrict RTI, donor privacy extended to political contributions, and unlimited political contributions by companies were not permitted.</description>

			<title>Nvidia releases ‘Chat with RTX’ AI chatbot: The blurring lines between makers of GenAI software, hardware</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/the-blurring-lines-between-makers-of-genai-software-hardware-9162360/</link>
			<description>Nvidia Corporation is releasing a new tool called "Chat with RTX," which allows users to run an offline AI-powered chatbot on their Windows PC using their latest series graphic cards. The tool, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, enables users to customize a generative AI model by linking it to files, documents, and notes for queries. Nvidia's push into chatbots aligns with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's efforts to revamp the semiconductor industry and address the supply-and-demand issue of AI chips. Nvidia's advantage lies in its proprietary software, powerful GPUs, and full-stack solutions, making it a leader in AI chips. Altman, on the other hand, seeks investments to increase global chip-building capacity. This development suggests a convergence of interests between Nvidia and OpenAI, blurring the lines between hardware and software players in the AI industry.</description>

			<title>Can parties receive anonymous donations? Arguments before the Supreme Court in electoral bonds petitions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-cour-electoral-bond-verdict-anonymous-donations-9162164/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is deciding whether to strike down the central government's electoral bonds scheme, which allows anonymous donations to political parties through purchasing bonds from the State Bank of India. The petitioners argue that the scheme prevents citizens from knowing the source of donations and favors the ruling government. They also highlight gaps in the scheme, such as the lack of requirement for the donation to be connected to elections. The central government justifies the scheme by emphasizing confidentiality rather than anonymity and explaining their efforts to curb black money in politics. BCCI secretary Jay Shah emphasizes that centrally contracted players must participate in domestic red ball tournaments, considering guidance from the national cricket academy for players with physical limitations.</description>

			<title>Do high levels of ‘good’ cholesterol mean lower risk of heart disease? How HDL-C is actually linked to cardiovascular health</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/how-hdl-c-is-actually-linked-to-cardiovascular-health-9160272/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the difference between correlation and causation in diagnostic tests for health improvement. It explains that while correlations can predict risk, they do not identify the underlying cause of a disease. The example of ice cream sales and shark attacks is used to illustrate this point. The article also highlights the confusion caused by media headlines linking certain factors to health benefits without establishing causation. It specifically mentions HDL-Cholesterol (good cholesterol) and its correlation with low cardiovascular disease risk. However, clinical trials have failed to prove a causal link between HDL-Cholesterol and reduced risk. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the intricacies of markers like HDL-C and considering other factors such as LDL-C, Apolipoprotein-B, exercise, and overall health interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk. It concludes by cautioning readers to enjoy coffee for its taste rather than its potential health benefits.</description>

			<title>Why Forms 45 and 47 are at the heart of Pakistan’s election rigging controversy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/form-45-pakistan-elections-controversy-9161589/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's February 8 election results have been marred by allegations of rigging and result manipulation. The controversy revolves around Forms 45 and 47, which are crucial for documenting and compiling election results. Form 45, also known as the 'Result of Count' form, records votes polled at a polling station and includes important information like the number of registered voters, votes cast, and candidate-wise breakdown of votes. It must be publicly displayed for transparency. After completion, Form 45 is submitted to the Returning Officer, who gathers results from all Form 45s to determine the final outcome. Form 47 documents the unconfirmed results in a constituency before official confirmation. Concerns arose when candidates were denied Form 45s, and discrepancies were found between the data in Form 45s and Form 47s. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party claimed that the results were falsely changed and challenged them in court.</description>

The article further examines consumer sentiments in rural India, which experienced a significant decline in January 2024, attributed to stagnation in commodity prices and reduced profits. Additionally, the article presents data from the Reserve Bank of India's consumer confidence survey, indicating negative consumer sentiment throughout Prime Minister Modi's second term.

			<title>PM Modi to inaugurate BAPS temple in UAE: Its special features, architecture, significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pm-modi-inaugurate-baps-temple-in-uae-features-9159741/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the BAPS Swaminarayan temple in Abu Dhabi, which is the first Hindu temple in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The temple, built by the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), holds significance for the Hindu community in the UAE and strengthens bilateral ties between the two nations. The temple features traditional architecture, including seven shikhars and intricate carvings representing universal values and different cultures. It sits on a 27-acre complex and was gifted 13.5 acres of land by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE. The temple is open to all visitors and boasts various amenities, including an assembly hall, community center, exhibitions, and classrooms. The construction of the temple involved the use of pink sandstone from Rajasthan and Italian marble, with over 20,000 tonnes shipped in for the project. The temple's inauguration underscores the unity and collaboration of people from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds, as exemplified by the Muslim king's donation of the land, the involvement of architects and designers from different faiths, and the support from various communities.</description>

			<title>No calls or mails after office hours: What’s in Australia’s ‘right to disconnect’ Bill?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/australia-right-to-disconnect-bill-work-life-balance-office-wfh-9159440/</link>
			<description>The Australian government is considering a Bill that would establish a "right to disconnect" for workers, regulating whether employers can contact them outside of working hours. The aim is to address the blurring boundaries between work and personal life due to technology and remote work. The Bill has passed the Senate and will now go to the House of Representatives. Similar laws exist in countries like France, Italy, and Belgium. Critics argue that it may hinder business owners and impact women's participation in the workforce. In India, a similar Bill was proposed but not discussed in the House. The implementation and mechanisms for resolving disputes differ in each case.</description>

			<title>Why India wants to develop high-altitude pseudo-satellite vehicles, powered by the Sun</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/haps-high-altitude-pseudo-satellite-vehicles-9158726/</link>
			<description>The National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) in Bengaluru successfully tested a prototype of a new-generation unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite vehicle (HAPS). This UAV runs on solar power, can fly at heights of 20 km, and has the potential to remain in the air for months. HAPS vehicles are primarily used for surveillance and monitoring purposes and can be valuable in disaster management. While several countries and companies have developed similar vehicles, none have mastered the technology yet. NAL's prototype flew for eight and a half hours and aims to achieve a 24-hour flight next month. The goal is to develop a full-scale machine that can stay airborne for 90 days continuously by 2027. HAPS vehicles address the limitations of current UAVs and satellites, providing longer flight durations, better surveillance capabilities, and the ability to observe larger areas. They can be redeployed and reequipped with ease, unlike geostationary satellites. The development of HAPS faces technological challenges related to generating enough solar power, operating payloads, and charging batteries. Design considerations include creating a lightweight and stable aircraft suitable for the stratosphere, where wind speeds are low and observation is ideal. HAPS technology is a significant engineering challenge, and India's involvement places them in the race alongside other countries. The country's expertise in tropical areas could provide an advantage due to the presence of jet streams in the upper atmosphere.</description>

			<title>Wayanad elephant kills man: Behind escalating human-animal conflict in Kerala</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/wayanad-elephant-kills-man-behind-escalating-human-animal-conflict-in-kerala-9158201/</link>
			<description>The article highlights the escalating human-animal conflict in Wayanad, Kerala, particularly with wild elephants and tigers attacking humans. The data shows a significant number of wild animal attacks, leading to deaths and crop losses. Wayanad, located near various tiger reserves and forests, has been severely affected by such conflicts. The study identifies two major factors contributing to the conflict: the decline in forest habitat quality due to the cultivation of alien plants and changing agricultural practices that lure animals to farmland. The article discusses the steps taken by Kerala, such as constructing elephant-proof trenches and solar-powered fencing, eco-restoration programs, and land acquisition for forest conversion. However, the measures are not enough to address the crisis, and the state requested assistance from the central government, which was denied. The situation has caused protests and unrest in the affected communities.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/farmers-how-current-protest-differs-from-2020-21-9157982/</link>
			<description>Farmers in India are once again protesting in Delhi, demanding the government guarantee a minimum support price for all crops. The protest, organized by the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha and Samyukta Kisan Morcha, involves over 250 farmers' unions. The current protest differs from the 2020-21 agitation, with different leaders and demands. The government has held talks with farmer union leaders but failed to reach a resolution. The protest has faced opposition from the police, with tear gas being used to disperse protestors. The situation remains tense as farmers continue their march towards Delhi.</description>

			<title>RLD ditches INDIA for NDA: What this means for the party, the two alliances</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/rld-ditches-india-for-nda-what-this-means-9157927/</link>
			<description>The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in Uttar Pradesh has switched sides to join the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), further fragmenting the INDIA bloc. The RLD, a farmers' party with support from the Jat community, brings perception benefits to the NDA rather than a significant number of votes. The party has seen a decline in its influence, losing seats in previous elections. The alliance with RLD may help the BJP consolidate Jat support and improve its chances in west UP. The RLD's departure is a blow to INDIA's unity and could prompt the Congress-SP alliance to focus on wooing Muslim voters. Some critics argue that the RLD has compromised on its ideology by joining the BJP, but the party has a history of switching sides.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the recent floor test held in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar won the vote, demonstrating the confidence of the MLAs in his new government. It explains that a floor test is conducted to determine if a government, suspected of losing its majority, still retains the confidence of the House. The leader of the party claiming majority moves a vote of confidence, and if the majority votes in favor, the government survives. Different methods of voting, such as voice voting and electronic voting, are explained. The article also mentions the Composite Floor Test, which is conducted when multiple parties claim to form the government. It concludes with an unrelated mention of Abdul Malik, a leader involved in a property dispute that caused protests in Haldwani.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-town-square-internet-global-village-9156294/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of the Internet as a "town square" where ideas are shared and debates take place. It highlights how the term "town square" refers to a common space for gathering, discussing ideas, and holding debates. The ancient Greek practice of discussing ideas in public view is mentioned, with philosophers like Plato and Aristotle critiquing the fallacious arguments used by professional rhetoricians. The article also draws parallels between social media platforms like Twitter and the concept of a town square, noting the role they played during events like the Arab Spring. However, it raises concerns about the lack of regulation and common rules on these platforms, which hinders genuine and fair debate. The idea of a "global village" and the need for a free space for debate in an interconnected world are also discussed, along with the challenges and subjective nature of defining interesting and substantial debate. The article concludes with suggestions for setting standards and potentially exploring new platforms that foster meaningful discussion.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna: Why Charan Singh was a messiah for farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-charan-singh-was-a-messiah-for-farmers-9156566/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the views and proposals of Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former Union Home Minister of India, regarding reservations for farmers in government jobs and educational institutions. Singh believed that representation should be provided to the "sons or dependents of the actual tillers of the soil" to rectify the privileges enjoyed by city-dwellers. He argued that reservations would not only provide opportunities to farmers but also improve efficiency in government departments. Singh's proposal faced criticism for only including the "sons of cultivators" and excluding landless laborers. He emphasized that his focus was on providing representation to tillers of the soil, regardless of their caste. The article also highlights Singh's contribution to land reform laws in Uttar Pradesh, which empowered the middle peasantry. However, the current challenges faced by agriculture, such as decreasing yields, rising production costs, and climate change, make the need for reservations for farmers' children more relevant today.</description>

			<title>In Pakistan poll outcome, key question for India: Whom does New Delhi talk to with no civilian political power centre?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/in-pakistan-poll-outcome-key-question-for-india-9156118/</link>
			<description>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, emerged as the winner in Pakistan's parliamentary elections. Independent candidates backed by PTI secured the most seats, surpassing the two main established parties, Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PTI-backed candidates won a majority of the 101 independent seats. However, none of the three parties alone can achieve a simple majority in the National Assembly. The outcome raises questions about whom New Delhi should engage with in Pakistan, with the suggestion being to communicate with Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir. The final tally of the elections, released after a delay, led to concerns about the process and allegations of the Army rigging the polls. The article highlights key takeaways, including the Army's ability to manipulate the outcome in favor of established parties, PTI's success in various provinces, and the lack of a strong political power center in the civilian structure, giving the Army control over political actors.</description>

			<title>Explained: Israel’s plans to invade Rafah, and why US, others have criticised it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-invasion-south-gaza-rafah-9156043/</link>
			<description>The Israeli government plans to expand its military actions in the south of Gaza to combat the Palestinian militant organization Hamas. The conflict began when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, resulting in many casualties. Israel aims to eliminate Hamas and has called for the evacuation of civilians in the city of Rafah. The decision has received criticism from Palestinians, Israel's allies, and international organizations. There are concerns that the military action could lead to more Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, and there is a lack of safety and basic amenities for Palestinians. Egypt has expressed concerns about the potential consequences of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah and has threatened to suspend its peace treaty with Israel. The United States has also expressed criticism, with President Joe Biden stating that Israel's response is "over the top."</description>

			<title>What is Nazool land, behind recent dispute and violence in Haldwani?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/nazool-land-behind-dispute-violence-haldwani-uttarakhand-9155345/</link>
			<description>Violence broke out in Haldwani, Uttarakhand's Nainital district, during a demolition drive at a mosque and madrasa located on Nazool land, resulting in five deaths and numerous injuries. Nazool land refers to government-owned land that is leased to entities for a fixed period. After India gained independence from British rule, lands confiscated from opposing kings and kingdoms were categorized as Nazool land. These lands are typically used for public purposes like schools, hospitals, and government buildings. The property where the demolition took place was registered as Nazool land under the Municipal Council. The administration claims that a notice was issued, requiring the removal of encroachments or submission of ownership documents within three days. Locals had requested the administration to wait until the next hearing in the High Court on February 14, but the demolition proceeded after receiving court approval.</description>

			<title>Confusion in Pakistan: What happens now?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-elections-results-pti-imran-khan-nawaz-sharif-9154605/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the uncertainty and unrest following Pakistan's recent elections. Both Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif claim victory, but allegations of election manipulation and rigging are prevalent. The establishment initially backed Nawaz Sharif, while Imran Khan faced multiple obstacles, including imprisonment and persecution of his party members. Surprisingly, Imran Khan's popularity resulted in a strong showing for his loyalists. However, there were reports of manipulated results, leading to protests and clashes. International observers, including the US, expressed concern over electoral violence and interference. With no party holding a majority, a coalition government is likely, with Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto potentially leading it. Imran Khan's response to this outcome is yet to be seen, and the establishment may try to manipulate the situation further. International pressure, particularly from the US, may also play a role in shaping events.</description>

			<title>The message in the Bharat Ratnas: How the politics of the honour works</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/the-message-in-the-bharat-ratnas-how-the-politics-of-honour-works-9154262/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that former Prime Ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, as well as Dr M S Swaminathan, will be awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. This announcement is significant as it comes just before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, with the award for Dr Swaminathan and Charan Singh signaling the government's focus on farmers and agriculture. The recognition for Narasimha Rao highlights the Congress party's neglect of his accomplishments due to differences with Sonia Gandhi. The previous recipients of the Bharat Ratna under the Modi government have also been strategic choices, emphasizing political messaging and highlighting certain individuals' contributions.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code bans polygamy: Is the practice more prevalent among Muslims?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ucc-bans-polygamy-is-the-practice-more-prevalent-among-muslims-9153803/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly has passed the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024, which aims to bring uniformity in personal laws regarding marriage, divorce, and inheritance across communities in the state, excluding tribals. The bill extends the rule of monogamy to the Muslim community, disallowing men from having more than one wife. Data on polygamy in India is obtained from sources like the census and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), but both have limitations. The census infers polygamy based on the difference in the number of married men and women, while the NFHS directly asks women if their husbands have other wives. The most recent census was conducted in 2011, and the NFHS-5 surveyed less than 1% of households in India. A 1974 study found that Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus had higher rates of polygamy than Muslims. Overall, the prevalence of polygamy has decreased in recent years. According to the NFHS-5, Christians reported the highest incidence of polygamy, followed by Muslims and Hindus. A study by the International Institute of Population Sciences showed a decline in polygynous marriages among the whole population from 1.9% in 2005-06 to 1.4% in 2019-21.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna P V Narasimha Rao: 4 things you did not know about the man who changed India’s economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/things-to-know-bharat-ratna-p-v-narasimha-rao-9153578/</link>
			<description>Former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao has been posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He is recognized for his extensive service to India and his visionary leadership in advancing the country's economy. Here are four key points about Narasimha Rao:

1. After his passing, Narasimha Rao's body was not allowed inside the Congress headquarters for ordinary workers to pay their respects, causing controversy. His funeral in Hyderabad also made headlines as his half-burnt body was shown abandoned with stray dogs nearby.

2. Narasimha Rao had a strained relationship with Sonia Gandhi, attributed to personal, political, and ideological differences. Their disagreements included the distribution of a Rajya Sabha ticket, progress in the investigation of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, and the Congress party's defeat in the 1996 Lok Sabha election.

3. Narasimha Rao considered converting Ayodhya into a Union Territory with a Vatican-like status. He even contemplated building a temple at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid but later decided to wait until after the 1996 elections.

4. Atal Bihari Vajpayee referred to Narasimha Rao as the "true father" of India's nuclear program. Narasimha Rao was actively involved in the program and, despite international speculation, he considered conducting nuclear tests in Pokhran but ultimately postponed them due to various factors, including the 1996 elections.

In summary, P V Narasimha Rao's contributions to India as a leader, his complicated relationship with Sonia Gandhi, his thoughts on Ayodhya, and his involvement in the nuclear program shaped his legacy.</description>

			<title>Test tube rhinos: Why rebuilding doomed species is a desperate race against time</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/test-tube-rhinos-why-rebuilding-doomed-species-is-a-desperate-race-against-time-9135853/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the efforts of scientists to rebuild the northern white rhino population through in vitro fertilization (IVF). They have achieved the first-ever rhino pregnancy by transferring a lab-made rhino embryo into a surrogate mother. The process of preparing a surrogate mother, particularly a southern white rhino, is complex and requires careful monitoring of the fertile window for implanting the embryo. However, even with successful IVF and surrogacy, the genetic viability of the northern white rhino population remains a challenge. One potential solution is to create sperm and eggs from stem cells extracted from preserved tissue samples. The article also highlights the importance of raising the first batch of IVF northern white calves with northern white adults to learn the social and behavioral skills of the species. The project is funded by the German government and other donors, but there have been questions raised about whether resources should be allocated to other endangered species. The article emphasizes the urgency of conservation efforts, as the northern white rhino was declared extinct in the wild in 2008.</description>

			<title>Why a Chemistry professor suggested adding salt to tea for the perfect cup</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/salt-in-tea-bitter-taste-effect-science-9127798/</link>
			<description>A new book called "Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea" by Michelle Francl has caused a debate between Americans and the British regarding the best way to prepare tea. Francl suggests adding a pinch of salt to tea to reduce its bitterness, which sparked disagreement. The US Embassy in the UK clarified that adding salt to tea is not official US policy. The UK's Cabinet Office responded with humor, stating that tea can only be made using a kettle. 

Tea is beloved in Britain since it arrived from China during the colonial era, while the US is primarily a nation of coffee drinkers. Both tea and coffee have a slight bitterness due to caffeine and tannin compounds. The salt tip seems to work because taste receptors on the tongue prevent the brain from confusing bitter and sweet flavors. Mixing salt with bitter compounds can mask the bitterness. However, the exact mechanism behind this is not well-known.

Francl's book explores over 100 chemical compounds in tea and provides brewing advice. She recommends using short and stout tea cups to retain heat, heating the cup separately for more aromatic compounds, and preferring loose tea over teabags for better circulation of tea leaves. Microwaves are discouraged for tea preparation. When using tea bags, large ones should be used and steeped quickly with dunking and squeezing to reduce sour-tasting tannins.

To avoid curdling, warmed milk should be added after pouring the tea. Francl also suggests adding a small amount of lemon juice to remove floating scum formed from chemical elements in the tea and water. The book connects the chemistry of tea with fundamental scientific discoveries, such as Emil Fischer's Nobel Prize-winning work on caffeine and George de Hevesy's isotopic tracing research.

In unrelated news, an IAS officer in Chandigarh ordered the sealing of establishments and suspension of liquor licenses for ten major vendors. As a result, the Home department transferred him out of the Excise department.</description>

			<title>January 26, 1950: How India observed its first Republic Day</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/january-26-1950-when-india-became-republic-9127785/</link>
			<description>On January 26, 1950, India became a sovereign and democratic republic, marking the end of British rule in the country. After two years of independence, the newly drafted Constitution of India came into effect, replacing the British-era Government of India Act of 1935. Dr Rajendra Prasad became the President of India, and the Constituent Assembly became the Parliament until the first general elections took place in 1951-52. To showcase state authority and prestige, India continued the tradition of military parades started during the British Raj. The Republic Day celebrations included a grand military parade in New Delhi, with participation from the armed forces and the Delhi Police. The parade featured a 31-gun salute, celebratory gunfire, and aerial displays by Indian Air Force planes. The President's horse-drawn carriage was flanked by the President's Bodyguard, and after the event, the President returned to Government House. Despite the celebrations, leaders recognized the challenges ahead, as inequality persisted in social and economic life. In a speech, Dr B R Ambedkar emphasized the need to address this contradiction for the success of political democracy.</description>

			<title>What are Odisha’s famous black tigers, and why is the state planning a safari around them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-black-tigers-safari-naveen-patnaik-9127455/</link>
			<description>Odisha's Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik, has announced the development of a melanistic tiger safari near the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR), which will be the first of its kind in the world. This new safari aims to showcase the rare and majestic melanistic tiger species found exclusively in Odisha. The plan has received approval from the technical committee of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and is expected to be ready for visitors by October this year.

The STR, located in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district, is Asia's second-largest biosphere and the only habitat for melanistic royal Bengal tigers in India. These tigers have black and yellow interspersed stripes due to a unique lineage with higher-than-normal levels of melanin. However, they are more accurately described as being pseudo-melanistic since they are not entirely black.

Research conducted by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NBCS) suggests that a single mutation in the Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) gene results in the broadened or spread stripes seen in the Similipal black tigers. Genetic analyses indicate that these tigers may have originated from a small founding population and are inbred due to their isolation from other tiger populations.

The proposed melanistic tiger safari will encompass around 200 hectares of land near the Dhanbad-Balasore National Highway-18, approximately 15 km away from the STR. It will feature an open enclosure housing three melanistic tigers from the Nandankanan zoo and other rescued tigers unsuitable for the wild but suitable for display. The park will also include veterinary care facilities, a rescue center, staff infrastructure, and visitor amenities.

The safari's objective is to enable wildlife conservationists, researchers, and enthusiasts to observe these rare big cats up close and raise awareness about the need for their conservation. As the sighting of tigers is challenging in the expansive STR, the safari will enhance the attraction for visitors to Similipal.

The project requires further feasibility studies by an NTCA committee and other statutory clearances, including approval from the Central Zoo Authority. The state government's ongoing tiger survey suggests a higher number of royal Bengal tigers in the STR than reported by the NTCA, with their findings soon to be released.</description>

			<title>Moti Mahal vs Daryaganj: Who invented butter chicken? Delhi HC to decide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/moti-mahal-daryaganj-who-invented-butter-chicken-9126175/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court is currently handling a dispute between two restaurant chains, Moti Mahal and Daryaganj, over the claim of who invented butter chicken and dal makhani. Moti Mahal asserts that its founder, Kundal Lal Gujral, brought these dishes to India after Partition from Peshawar's Moti Mahal restaurant. However, Daryaganj, known for its appearance on Shark Tank India, also started advertising itself as the inventor of these dishes, attributing it to their forefather, Kundan Lal Jaggi. Moti Mahal filed a lawsuit against Daryaganj, alleging trademark infringement and passing off.

Moti Mahal's suit seeks a temporary injunction against Daryaganj, which would require them to refrain from certain actions until the court makes a decision. Moti Mahal claims that Daryaganj is misleading the public by falsely claiming to have invented butter chicken and dal makhani and by using a manipulated photograph of the Peshawar restaurant on its website. They want Daryaganj to stop claiming any association with Moti Mahal and using their trademarked tagline.

In response, Daryaganj argues that the photograph in question was jointly used by both parties' predecessors and that Moti Mahal has no exclusive rights to it. They claim that they cropped the picture to exclude the term "Moti Mahal" and avoid trademark infringement. While they agreed to remove the disputed photograph, Daryaganj is yet to file its complete response to the lawsuit.

The article explains that a trademark provides exclusive rights to its owner and its unauthorized use can be considered infringement. A trademark can be violated even if the infringing mark is not identical but is deceptively similar. Passing off is another form of infringement where one party tries to benefit from the reputation established by another in a trade or business. Moti Mahal argues that Daryaganj's claims and use of the manipulated photograph amount to passing off their trademark as their own.

In cases of trademark infringement, the owner can initiate legal action, seeking remedies like injunctions, damages, and accounts. An injunction is an official court order to prevent someone from doing something. The Delhi High Court has asked Daryaganj to file its response within 30 days, and the matter is scheduled for a hearing on May 29.

The article concludes with unrelated information about filmmaker Rohit Shetty, stating that he made a film called Cirkus during the pandemic to provide jobs for his associated workers but would not make the same film given a choice today.</description>

			<title>Why Thailand seeks an ambitious trade deal with EU, what the hurdles are</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/eu-thailand-trade-deal-significance-9126857/</link>
			<description>The European Union (EU) and Thailand are set to hold a second round of talks on a free trade agreement. Bangkok aims to finalize the negotiations by early 2025, hoping to revive its sluggish economy. The deal would solidify the EU's focus on Southeast Asia, as it has already secured trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore, while negotiating with Indonesia and the Philippines. However, discussions between the EU and Thailand may face challenges, particularly regarding the protection of their respective fishery industries. The EU is seeking a more comprehensive deal than Thailand's previous trade pacts, and both sides are expected to address concerns related to market access, intellectual property, government contracts, environmental standards, and agricultural and fishery imports. Thailand considers the EU trade agreement a top priority and hopes to conclude the deal within the specified timeframe.</description>

			<description>Operation Sarvashakti is a military operation launched by the Indian Army in the Rajouri-Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir. The objective of the operation is to target terrorists who have been carrying out attacks on security forces in the area. The operation involves deploying additional troops to increase the density of forces and enhance the chances of contact with terrorists. This operation is reminiscent of a previous operation called Operation Sarpvinash, which took place in the same forests over two decades ago. During that operation, Indian forces successfully flushed out terrorists who had infiltrated from across the border and had set up camps in the region. The current operation aims to eliminate the threat posed by terrorists in the area and restore peace.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/the-rooftop-solar-plan-indias-solar-power-capacity-target-and-the-way-forward-9124675/</link>
			<description>The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, recently announced the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, a program aimed at installing rooftop solar systems on 1 crore (10 million) houses. The objective of this initiative is to reduce electricity bills for the poor and middle classes while making India self-reliant in the energy sector. The target for rooftop solar installations had been set at 40 GW by 2022, but it has been missed. The new program focuses on individual households, which have great untapped potential for solar energy. The details of the program have not been released yet, but it aims to accelerate the adoption of decentralized solar power in the country.</description>

			<description>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent figure in India's fight for independence, had a remarkable escape from house arrest in Calcutta during World War II. He traveled from Calcutta to Gomoh to Peshawar to Kabul to Russia, changing his identity three times along the way. Bose's escape involved careful planning and the assistance of individuals like Mian Akbar Khan. Eventually, he reached Berlin with the help of the German embassy and the support of Italy and Russia. It was a daring and resourceful journey that allowed Bose to continue his efforts for India's freedom.</description>

			<title>Sri Lankan Catholic church moves to declare Easter attack victims as ‘saints’: What this means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sri-lankan-church-easter-attack-saints-meaning-9122350/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Catholic church in Sri Lanka is planning to declare the 273 people who were killed in the 2019 Easter Sunday suicide bombings as "saints." The process of declaring saints in the Catholic Church involves verifying their virtuous lives, any miracles they may have performed, and their ascension to heaven after death. The bishop of their diocese initiates the process, and it is then reviewed by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Vatican. If approved, the person is recognized as a "Servant of God" and later as "Venerable" by the Pope. Beatification and canonization require the confirmation of miracles attributed to the person. Martyrs, on the other hand, can be beatified without a verified miracle but still require canonization to be declared saints. In the case of the Easter Sunday victims, the Catholic church plans to declare them as saints on April 21, 2024, five years after their sacrifice.</description>

			<title>What we know about multivitamins and memory</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/multivitamins-memory-impact-health-9120654/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, the study mentioned in the article found that adults aged 60 and older who took a daily multivitamin for two years scored higher on memory and cognitive tests compared to those who took a placebo. The study suggests that multivitamins can be a safe and accessible approach to protecting cognitive health in older adults. However, experts caution that the benefits were small and it's unclear if they would translate to tangible improvements in people's lives. It's important to note that more research is needed to understand who specifically benefits from taking multivitamins.</description>

			<title>Davos meeting 2024: 5 key takeaways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/davos-meeting-2024-5-key-takeaways-9120670/</link>
			<description>At this year's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, held from January 15 to January 19, several key themes emerged. One prominent topic of discussion was Artificial Intelligence (AI), with conversations focusing on its transformative potential for human welfare, as well as concerns about regulation, job losses, misinformation, and inequality. Overall, the sentiment leaned towards the belief that the benefits of AI outweigh the negatives. Another significant theme was the fragility of the geopolitical situation, including wars in the Middle East and Europe, threats to global supply chains, and uncertainty around food security. However, no concrete plans for peace were offered regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict. Climate change also took center stage, emphasizing the need for businesses to adapt and countries to unite in taking action. China's economy, facing a slowdown, sought to attract more investment from the West. Finally, India's transformation as one of the fastest-growing economies and its contributions to women's health and gender equity were highlighted.</description>

			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, the study conducted by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) found that rainfall during the southwest monsoon has increased in 55% of India's tehsils in the past 10 years. However, 11% of tehsils have experienced a decrease in rainfall. The study also highlighted that monsoon patterns in India have been shifting and erratic, mainly due to the accelerating rate of climate change. These changes in rainfall patterns can have implications for agriculture output and ecosystems. Additionally, the study mentioned that there has been an increase in heavy rainfall events, which can lead to flash floods.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the recent missile strikes between Iran and Pakistan, as well as the attacks on Indian shipping in the Red Sea, highlighting the interconnected insecurities of the Subcontinent and the Gulf. It mentions five key trends in security interdependence that have emerged. These include the fragility of Pakistan's western borderlands, regional power politics involving dissident groups, Balochistan's geopolitical significance in the Gulf, Afghanistan's potential involvement in the Gulf, and India's growing economic and security stakes in the Middle East.

			<title>Markets crash: Causes, what retail investors should do</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/markets-crash-causes-what-retail-investors-should-do-9116077/</link>
			<description>The stock market in 2023 showed resilience, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gaining around 20%. This was driven by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, improved corporate sector performance, the expectation of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in 2024, and higher inflows from foreign portfolio investors. However, the rally did not last long, as domestic equity indices plummeted in January due to factors such as fears of rate cut delay by the Fed, weaker quarterly results from HDFC Bank, a rise in US bond yields, profit booking, and foreign portfolio investor outflows. Experts suggest that short-term volatility should not worry retail investors. It is important for investors to have a long-term vision and not try to time the market.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: Did we know 2023 was going to be the warmest year? Why climate warnings need to improve</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/2023-warmest-year-why-climate-warnings-need-to-improve-9112389/</link>
			<description>The year 2023 was the warmest on record, with each day being more than 1℃ above average. The future is uncertain, and the information provided by the climate community is not actionable at local levels. The warming trend is expected to continue in 2024, but the location and intensity of climate-related events may vary. Factors like reduced sulphate aerosols, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires likely contributed to the record warming. El Niño is forecasted to dissipate, and a La Niña may emerge in 2024, which could absorb heat from the atmosphere. It is challenging to predict the impact of global warming on the Cold Tongue region. Early warnings are crucial for crisis management, especially for food, water, energy, and transportation. Location-specific outlooks are necessary to plan for events like erratic monsoons, heatwaves, and fog episodes.</description>

			<title>Why the Tamil Nadu CM and Governor’s posts on Thiruvalluvar Day sparked a row, again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/tamil-nadu-cm-governor-thiruvalluvar-saffron-9111878/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the depiction of Thiruvalluvar, a philosopher-poet in Tamil Nadu, during the celebration of Thiruvalluvar Day. The Governor's office shared an image of Thiruvalluvar in saffron-colored clothes, which drew criticism from the ruling DMK party, accusing the governor of "saffronisation." The Chief Minister, on the other hand, shared an image of Thiruvalluvar in white robes. Thiruvalluvar is a revered figure in Tamil Nadu, and his teachings are considered essential by Tamilians, regardless of their religion. The article also mentions the historical ambiguity surrounding Thiruvalluvar's life and the various political groups that have shaped his depictions over time. The controversy is taking place in the context of recent archaeological findings that support the ancient history of Tamil Nadu.</description>

			<title>Who are the shankaracharyas — and who was Adi Shankara?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/shankaracharyas-adi-shankara-ram-temple-9110633/</link>
			<description>The four shankaracharyas, who head the four Hindu mathas, have announced that they will not attend the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on January 22. While the seers from Dwarka and Sringeri have not given reasons, the shankaracharyas of the Joshimath and Puri mathas have cited their concerns. One of them expressed that there is no reason to rush the consecration before the completion of the temple. The shankaracharyas are religious teachers who belong to a line of teachers going back to Adi Shankara, an important figure in Hinduism. The mathas are believed to have been established by him, although there is little historical evidence prior to the 14th century. Adi Shankara is known for his contributions to Advaita Vedanta, a school of Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the unity of consciousness and ultimate reality. His mathas are seen as keepers of Hindu faith and traditions.</description>

			<title>Ahead of Ram Temple consecration, Odisha to unveil its own ambitious project at Jagannath Temple</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/odisha-jagannath-temple-puri-project-corridor-9110431/</link>
			<description>The Odisha government is set to inaugurate a Rs 800-crore heritage corridor project around Puri's Jagannath Temple. The project aims to enhance infrastructure for visiting devotees and transform Puri into a world-class heritage city. The corridor includes a 75-meter corridor surrounding the temple complex. The project faced hurdles such as clearing structures and legal challenges, but it received permission from the National Monument Authority. The Odisha government has invited representatives from nearly 1,000 temples for the grand opening. The project is part of the state's flagship 5T initiative, with plans for the development of other major temples in the state as well.</description>

			<title>Delays at Delhi airport: Apart from the fog, what else is causing the chaos</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/delhi-airport-delays-fog-what-else-is-causing-chaos-9110487/</link>
			<description>Flight operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi were heavily disrupted due to dense fog. Passengers experienced long delays, cancellations, and even physical altercations. The complex nature of airline operations, with multiple flights and crew serving different sectors, compounded the problems caused by fog. On Sunday, over 500 outbound flights were delayed and 87 were cancelled, while inbound flights faced delays and cancellations as well. The situation improved on Monday as visibility improved. The airport's runway maintenance and construction activity further worsened the situation. The cascading effect of disruptions was also seen at the Mumbai airport, despite being unaffected by fog. Airlines with dense networks and high aircraft and crew utilization levels were particularly affected. Delays and congestion led to passengers being stuck in aircraft for hours. The congestion also affected the parking availability for incoming aircraft. Flight crew exceeding their Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) due to delays and long hours of waiting can result in crew shortage for airlines.</description>

			<title>Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Lohri and more: Significance of these festivals, celebrated across India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/makar-sankranti-pongal-lohri-significance-rituals-9109065/</link>
			<description>Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Magh Bihu are cultural celebrations held in different states of India on January 14. These festivals mark the transition from winter to warmer months and the beginning of longer days. Makar Sankranti follows the solar cycle and is celebrated almost on the same day every year. On this day, worshippers take a bath in sacred rivers, offer prayers to Lord Surya (Sun god), perform rituals, and break their fast during Punya Kaal. Regional variations exist in the way these festivals are celebrated. For example, in Tamil Nadu, the Pongal festival includes cleaning the house, making decorative kolam, and honoring the toil of bulls. In Karnataka, there is a tradition of eating a mixture of sesame seeds and jaggery and speaking good words. In northern India, sesame and jaggery ladoos or chikkis are distributed, and bonfires are organized. Kite-flying and sky lanterns are also part of the celebrations in certain regions.</description>

			<title>Hydroxychloroquine: How a new study links the COVID ‘cure’ to 17,000 deaths</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hydroxychloroquine-covid-medicine-new-study-9108866/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, I can summarize that hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, was briefly promoted as a potential treatment for COVID-19. However, researchers have linked it to an increased mortality rate of up to 11%. The World Health Organization conducted trials but found no clinical improvements in patients. It is important to note that repurposing drugs in a panic, without sufficient evidence, can be hazardous. While hydroxychloroquine is generally safe, its effects need to be evaluated differently when given preventively to a large number of healthy people. The drug was hailed as a "miracle cure" by some, including former US President Donald Trump, but its use was cautioned against by the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. Small-scale studies reported side effects, but larger studies are needed to determine the precise cause. A recent systematic review linked hydroxychloroquine to 17,000 deaths, but there is no consensus yet as different studies may have used conflicting methods. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders like lupus. It is important to consult healthcare professionals for accurate and up-to-date information on the use of hydroxychloroquine.</description>

			<description>William Lai, also known as Lai Ching-te, from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won the presidential election despite China's warnings. Lai, the current vice president, secured around 40% of the vote share. He grew up in a poor coal-mining village and pursued medicine before entering politics. China considers him a "separatist" due to his views on Taiwan's sovereignty. Lai aims to protect Taiwan from China's interference and maintain peace while strengthening ties with the United States and other democracies. The reaction from China and potential tensions remain uncertain.</description>

			<title>Voluntary freezing of trading accounts: How will SEBI’s new norms safeguard investors?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/voluntary-freezing-of-trading-sebi-investors-9107735/</link>
			<description>Starting July this year, investors in India will have the ability to freeze or block their trading accounts if they suspect any suspicious activity. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has instructed stock brokerages to establish a framework for this by April 1 and implement it from July 1, 2024. Currently, investors can only voluntarily block or freeze their demat accounts (which hold financial instruments electronically), not their trading accounts (which execute trades in the stock market). SEBI has recognized the need for a facility to block trading accounts, similar to blocking ATM or credit cards, to protect investors from potential fraud. The guidelines will be developed by the Brokers' Industry Standards Forum in consultation with SEBI and stock exchanges. The guidelines will include processes for clients to request the blocking of their trading accounts and the actions trading members need to take upon receiving such requests. Stock exchanges must ensure compliance by trading members and submit a compliance report to SEBI by August 31, 2024.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The United States and the United Kingdom conducted strikes against Houthi groups in Yemen on January 11. These strikes were in response to the Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, a vital maritime trade route. The Houthis have been attacking ships in protest of the Israeli military's actions in Gaza. The strikes targeted multiple Houthi locations and were supported by several countries. The Red Sea attacks have raised concerns about the conflict involving other countries and groups. The peace negotiations in Yemen may also be affected by these recent developments.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hafiz-abdul-salam-bhuttavi-let-9106693/</link>
			<description>Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi, a founding member of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and a key conspirator in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, has been confirmed dead by the United Nations Security Council. He passed away due to cardiac arrest on May 29, 2023, while in the custody of the Pakistani government. Bhuttavi, who was born in 1946, played a significant role in establishing LeT's base in Lahore and served as the acting chief on multiple occasions when Hafiz Saeed, the chief and mastermind behind the Mumbai attack, was detained. He was also involved in issuing fatwas and preparing terrorists for the Mumbai attacks. Bhuttavi had been serving a 16-year sentence in a terror financing case and was in prison since 2019.</description>

			<title>What happened in Bhutan’s elections — and are the results a win for India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bhutans-elections-india-china-9106431/</link>
			<description>The People's Democratic Party (PDP) and its leader Tshering Tobgay emerged victorious in the runoff election in Bhutan, defeating the Bhutan Tendrel Party (BTP). The PDP secured 30 seats in the national legislature, with a significant voter turnout. Bhutan's elections have been relatively fair and peaceful, despite the recent transition to a parliamentary democracy. However, there are concerns about media censorship, discrimination against minorities, and lack of accountability in the political system. The election took place amidst economic challenges, including a struggling tourism industry and high youth unemployment. Tobgay focused his campaign on addressing these issues and attracting investment to boost the economy. India, Bhutan's largest donor and ally, plays an important role in Bhutan's economic recovery, while China's influence in the region remains a point of contention. Tobgay is considered pro-India, strengthening India's strategic interests in the area. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Tobgay on his victory and expressed a desire to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries.</description>

			<title>Genocide case against Israel: Who were the Amalek, whose mention by Netanyahu came up at the ICJ</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-were-the-amalek-netanyahu-gaza-israel-icj-9105643/</link>
			<description>The Amalekites were an ancient biblical nation mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical accounts, they were the first to attack the Jewish people after their escape from Egypt. The story of the Amalekites has been used by Israeli politicians to justify violence against Palestinians. The invocation of Amalek evokes collective memories of historical persecution and serves as a justification for brutal reprisals. For example, in 1994, an Israeli extremist named Bharuch Goldstein gunned down unarmed Palestinians, believing them to be the Amalekites. It is concerning that the identification of Palestinians with Amalekites has had deadly consequences.</description>

			<description>India and the US will address various trade issues in their trade policy forum meeting. These include India's request for the restoration of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) revoked by former US President Donald Trump and the US's objection to India's laptop import monitoring system. The meeting is crucial as the US is India's largest trade partner, and India relies on US demand for export earnings. Closer trade ties could attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) and help resolve trade tensions. The US is concerned about India's monitoring system for laptop imports, questioning its purpose as a non-tariff measure. India also seeks a liberal visa regime and a totalisation agreement for social security benefits for Indian professionals working in the US.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, a 22 km bridge over the sea that connects Sewri and Chirle. The bridge, also known as Atal Setu Nhava Sheva Sea Link, will reduce travel time between the two locations to under 20 minutes. The project, which was conceptualized six decades ago, aims to improve connectivity in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and promote economic development. The bridge is expected to benefit commuters and facilitate greater integration of Navi Mumbai with other areas, including the under-construction Navi Mumbai International Airport. However, concerns remain regarding the toll fees and the lack of public transport facilities on the bridge.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. Indore has been ranked as the cleanest city in India for the seventh consecutive year in the Swachh Survekshan Awards 2023. The ranking is based on citizen feedback and field assessment. Indore achieved this by implementing a sustainable system of garbage collection, processing, and disposal. They made changes to the sanitation and waste collection system, popularized initiatives among citizens, and focused on segregation and disposal of waste. The city also cleared and treated legacy waste and constructed transfer stations. Efforts were made to install new toilets and dustbins, and citizens were encouraged to build better habits around cleanliness. The city also imposed fines for littering and other offenses to deter habitual offenders.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is holding a hearing to decide whether to order "provisional measures" in a case filed by South Africa against Israel for alleged violations of the Genocide Convention in relation to Palestinians in Gaza. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and settles legal disputes between states. The Genocide Convention is an international human rights treaty that defines genocide and codifies the crime for the first time. South Africa is asking for urgent relief to protect the rights of the Palestinian people and prevent further harm. The court will make a provisional measures order within weeks, which will be binding on all states. Israel has called the case "baseless," while Palestine and several other countries have welcomed it. This is not the first case the ICJ has heard under the Genocide Convention.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. India has officially joined the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project, which aims to build the world's largest radio telescope. India has been contributing to the project for several years and has now become a full member by signing an international treaty and making a financial commitment. The SKA will consist of thousands of dish antennas operating as a single unit, providing a large effective area for collecting radio waves. The project is being implemented in South Africa and Australia, and once completed, it will be significantly more powerful than existing radio telescopes. Although the SKA facilities are not located in India, the country's participation as a full member offers scientific and technological benefits, including preferential access to the facilities and opportunities for research and capacity building. The project also involves advanced technologies and intellectual property that will be accessible to all member countries. Indian scientists have identified various research areas, including the evolution of the early universe, galaxy formation, neutron star physics, and solar sciences, to utilize the SKA telescopes.</description>

			<title>Why 2023 was the warmest year ever, and what happens now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-2023-was-the-warmest-year-ever-9102355/</link>
			<description>According to the article, 2023 was the warmest year on record since 1850, surpassing the previous record set in 2016. Temperatures in 2023 likely exceeded those of any year-long period in at least the last 100,000 years. Rising temperatures in 2023 led to numerous extreme weather events worldwide, including heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires. The main driver behind this extreme warming is the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is suggested that 2024 could be even hotter than 2023, and there is a possibility of surpassing the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold for the entire calendar year.</description>

			<title>Gabriel Attal: Who is the new PM of France, what changes with his appointment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gabriel-attal-new-pm-france-what-changes-9102260/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. France's President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Gabriel Attal as the new Prime Minister, making him the youngest person to hold the post at the age of 34. This decision comes after the resignation of the previous Prime Minister, Elisabeth Borne. Macron's appointment of Attal is seen as an effort to rejuvenate his government ahead of the European Union Parliament elections, where his ratings have been trailing. Attal, who previously served as the Minister of Education, is a popular figure both within the ruling coalition and in opposition circles. He is also France's first openly gay Prime Minister. While the President holds greater powers in France's political system, Attal's personal popularity and energy may help the Macron government overcome recent challenges and move forward. It is worth noting that there are other serving gay Prime Ministers in the world, such as Ana Brnabić of Serbia, Leo Varadkar of Ireland, and Xavier Bettel, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg.</description>

			<title>Politics and piracy: How Houthi attacks in Red Sea are different from the earlier Somali hijackings</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/houthi-attacks-red-sea-somali-piracy-hijacking-comparison-9102168/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia on merchant ships in the Red Sea. These attacks have raised concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains, as shipping firms face the choice between higher insurance premiums for the risky Red Sea route or taking the longer and costlier route around the Cape of Good Hope. A US-led force has been deployed in the Red Sea to counter these attacks, but the dangers to shipping persist. The Houthis have targeted certain types of ships, particularly automobile carriers, while generally leaving oil tankers alone. The article also mentions the Houthis' support for Hamas and their links to Iran. It highlights the decline in piracy in the Gulf of Aden since 2016 due to international efforts in military cooperation and intelligence-sharing.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/private-us-spacecraft-land-moon-9100677/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. A private US company has launched a spacecraft carrying scientific instruments from NASA with the goal of becoming the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon in over 50 years. The mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, which involves private space companies in the Artemis program for lunar exploration. The spacecraft, called Peregrine, developed technical problems after launch, but the company is working to rectify them. The mission aims to reach the Moon on February 23 and will carry out various exploratory activities, including detecting water. The payloads will remain active for ten days after landing. This mission marks a significant step in the US's return to the Moon and its plans for longer stays and establishing a permanent base camp. NASA is collaborating with the private sector through the CLPS initiative to leverage American companies for lunar exploration. This launch is the first under the CLPS initiative and is seen as a giant leap for humanity.</description>

			<description>In Eastern Orthodox traditions, Christmas is celebrated on different dates due to the use of different calendars. While most Orthodox churches celebrate Christmas on December 25th, some follow the Julian calendar and celebrate it on January 7th. This includes the Russian Orthodox Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, Georgian Orthodox Church, and some others. In Ukraine, the observance of Christmas on January 7th has political implications, as it asserts national identity and independence from Russia. In the United States, Orthodox churches may vary in their observance, with some following the December 25th date and others following the January 7th date. The specific traditions and worship services may also vary among different Orthodox communities.</description>

			<description>Aditya-L1, launched by ISRO, is a mission to observe and understand the Sun. It is placed at the L1 point, which is the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point. The mission aims to study the Sun's energy production, the corona, solar wind, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. Aditya-L1 has seven instruments to observe radiation and charged particles. Its location at L1 allows uninterrupted observations. L1 is a stable point between the Earth and the Sun, where the gravitational forces cancel each other out. Aditya-L1 will remain in orbit around L1, providing a continuous view of the Sun. Placing the spacecraft at L1 ensures an uninterrupted view of the Sun, which is crucial for its mission.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bangladesh-elections-india-9097172/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the close relationship between India and Bangladesh, highlighting the importance of a stable and friendly Bangladesh for India's national security and economic interests. The incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is seen as a close friend and ally of India, having improved security cooperation and cracked down on anti-India elements during her tenure. Bangladesh's economic rise has also strengthened ties with India, with Bangladesh becoming the second-largest economy in South Asia and a significant export destination for Indian goods. India also sees Bangladesh as a potential hub for regional cooperation in the Bay of Bengal, connecting South and Southeast Asia. While there have been concerns about democratic backsliding in Bangladesh, Hasina's leadership is considered crucial for maintaining stability and peace in the region. The article also mentions the complex relationships between Bangladesh, the US, and the UK, with the US showing some signs of toning down its criticism of Hasina's government. Overall, India hopes for a fair and non-violent election process in Bangladesh to further strengthen bilateral relations.</description>

			<title>More than 100 years ago today, why Henry Ford doubled employees’ wages and how it helped him</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/henry-ford-1914-wages-on-this-day-history-9096927/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. In 1914, Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motors, announced a significant increase in the minimum daily wage for his workers, raising it from $2.34 to $5. This move garnered attention and sparked various reactions at the time. Ford had implemented a new method of production called the moving assembly line, which increased efficiency and reduced the time it took to build a car. Despite concerns about worker retention, the higher wages helped Ford retain employees and improve productivity. The decision proved to be a successful cost-cutting move, leading to increased profits for Ford Motors.</description>

			<title>Elections in Bangladesh: Why both India and China are backing Sheikh Hasina</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-elections-india-china-back-sheikh-hasina-9096924/</link>
			<description>Hmm, Bangladesh is currently at an inflection point both economically and geopolitically. Its growing economy, valued at $400 billion and with a growth rate of 7.1% in 2022, has attracted the attention of major powers. These powers, such as India, China, the United States, and Russia, see Bangladesh's growth and stability as crucial to advancing their own strategic interests in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.

The national elections in Bangladesh, which took place on January 7, have become a significant arena for various ambitions to play out. India and China, in particular, have high stakes in the outcome and credibility of the election process. Both countries have robust economic ties with Bangladesh and have wider regional rivalries. How Bangladesh manages the partnership expectations from these two Asian giants will be closely watched internationally.

India and Bangladesh have a strong trade relationship, with bilateral trade exceeding $15 billion in 2021-22. India recognizes Bangladesh as an important buffer state and provides critical support in ports and power grid access. On the other hand, Bangladesh's trade with China surpassed $25 billion in 2022. Bangladesh aligns strategically with China, which is helping transform its landscape through mega projects and has made significant investments in BRI-financed infrastructure projects.

Bangladesh follows a nuanced approach in its relations with India and China, prioritizing mutually beneficial relationships that align with its national interests. It leverages socio-economic, trade, and cultural ties with India for growth while maintaining significant military relations with China. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's handling of multiple partnerships has been adept, showcasing Bangladesh's strategic autonomy and its ability to cooperate and collaborate with major regional powers.

The intersection of geopolitics and economics is evident in Bangladesh's pursuit of developed nation status by 2041. The country strategically harnesses the economic and technological strengths of both India and China, granting them port access and fostering modernization. Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific outlook emphasizes engagement with regional and global stakeholders for human security, connectivity, and the blue economy, while avoiding geopolitical tensions.

The January 7 elections in Bangladesh hold significance for both India and China. The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the elections, raising concerns about the credibility of the election results. Both India and China, deeply invested in Bangladesh's stability, are wary of potential political and economic risks post-election. China's $38 billion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) initiatives depend on the continuity of the ruling party, while India may need to explore alternative strategies if Prime Minister Hasina were to be unseated.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like to know about Bangladesh or if you have any other questions.</description>

			<title>Paralympic star turned murderer released on parole: Who is Oscar Pistorius — and what did he do?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/oscar-pistorius-parole-9096717/</link>
			<description>Former South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has been released on parole after serving more than seven years for the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, known as the "Blade Runner" for his carbon fiber prosthetic legs, won medals in both the Paralympics and the Olympics. He claimed that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired four shots at a locked bathroom door in his home. While initially convicted of culpable homicide, the Supreme Court later found him guilty of murder and increased his sentence. Pistorius will live with his family in Pretoria and must attend rehabilitation programs while on parole.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/burj-khalifa-billboard-new-year-9095433/</link>
			<description>Dubai's Burj Khalifa, developed by Emaar Properties, celebrated its 14th anniversary. Standing at a height of 829.8 meters, it is the tallest man-made structure and serves as a luxury hotel, residences, restaurants, and observatories. The building's exteriors act as a giant advertising platform, attracting attention from around the world. Placing an advertisement on the Burj Khalifa's facade can cost between $70,000 and $100,000 for a few minutes. The building's LED display, installed in 2014, consists of over 1.2 million pixels, making it the world's largest electronic display. However, running the display at full capacity consumes a significant amount of electricity.</description>

			<title>Who was Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri, killed in a drone strike in Beirut?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-leader-saleh-al-arouri-killed-9093929/</link>
			<description>Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in an Israeli drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon. The attack targeted a Hamas office in the southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, resulting in six deaths. While the Israeli government has not publicly claimed responsibility, Israeli and US officials confirmed Israel's involvement. Al-Arouri, a former Hamas military wing member, played a significant role in the group's operations and had strong connections to both Iran and Hezbollah. He was accused of planning the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in 2014. Al-Arouri's death is a major blow to Hamas, but the group claims it won't be deterred. Analysts predict that the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah may escalate, with Hezbollah vowing retaliation. Israel is preparing for potential attacks, including long-range precision-guided missile strikes on major cities, which could escalate into a regional war.</description>

			<title>A brothel ‘customer’ can be charged under ITP Act: What the Kerala HC has said</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/brothel-customer-itp-act-kerala-hc-9093242/</link>
			<description>The Kerala High Court ruled on December 21, 2023, that a customer in a brothel can be charged under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. The court observed that a "consumer" falls within the purview of Section 5 of the Act, which punishes those who 'procure', 'induce', or 'take' people for prostitution [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/1999/03/01/broken-people).

The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, was enacted to prevent the commercialization of vices and the trafficking of females. Section 2 of the Act defines a "brothel" as any place used for sexual exploitation or abuse for the gain of another person or for the mutual gain of two or more prostitutes. The Act defines "prostitution" as the sexual exploitation or abuse of persons for commercial purposes [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/1999/03/01/broken-people).

Section 5 of the Act penalizes anyone who procures or attempts to procure a person, with or without their consent, for prostitution purposes. It also punishes those who induce persons to go from any place for prostitution purposes or become inmates of a brothel. The offense of causing or inducing persons to engage in prostitution is punishable with rigorous imprisonment for 3-7 years, along with a fine of Rs 2,000. If the offense is committed against a person's will or a child, the maximum sentence can be extended to fourteen years or life [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/1999/03/01/broken-people).

In the present case, the petitioner was found as a customer in a brothel and was arrested. The accused filed a plea seeking discharge, arguing that as a customer, he cannot be implicated for any offense under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act. The district court rejected the plea, and the petitioner moved the Kerala High Court against the lower court's order. The High Court upheld the lower court's order, stating that a consumer also falls within the purview of Section 5 of the Act [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/1999/03/01/broken-people).

The Kerala High Court ruling has expanded the meaning of the term "procure" in Section 5 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. It now includes holding customers liable in addition to pimps/brothel-keepers who hire persons for prostitution. Previously, different high courts had expressed differing opinions on whether a brothel customer can be held liable under the Act [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/1999/03/01/broken-people).

It is important to note that the Kerala High Court ruling has not held the petitioner guilty under Section 5 of the Act; it has simply held that he can be charged under it. The petitioner will now face trial. The High Court discharged the petitioner of offenses under Sections 3, 4, and 7 of the Act [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/1999/03/01/broken-people).</description>

			<title>What are VVPATs, and why has Jairam Ramesh written to EC about them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-are-vvpats-9093505/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has written to Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar requesting a meeting to discuss the use of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines. The INDIA alliance, of which Ramesh is a part, passed a resolution calling for 100% verification of VVPAT slips. VVPAT machines were introduced in 2017 to provide an audit trail for voters to verify their choices. The Election Commission (EC) has gradually increased the use of VVPATs in elections, and in 2019, 100% of EVMs were attached to VVPATs. The EC has also consulted with political parties and the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) to determine the sample size for counting VVPAT slips. The INDIA alliance resolution suggests that VVPAT slips should be handed over to voters and 100% counting should be done. However, the EC argues that 100% verification is time-consuming and prone to human error. The EC has received few complaints about VVPATs since their introduction, and no cases of vote transfer have been detected.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking | Nrega, Nyay and PM-Kisan: Why do politicians rush to give direct benefits (cash) to the poor</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explain-speaking-nyay-direct-benefits-9093190/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the revival of the "NYAY" (Nyuntam Aay Yojana) scheme by the Indian National Congress party in preparation for the upcoming 2024 general election in India. The NYAY scheme, which was a central component of the party's 2019 manifesto, aims to provide a minimum income of at least Rs 60,000-70,000 annually to women if the party comes to power. The scheme was originally intended to benefit the poorest 20% of Indian families, providing a guaranteed payment of Rs 72,000 to each eligible family. However, the article highlights that the NYAY scheme and similar schemes like PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri – Kisan Samman Nidhi) are not Universal Basic Income (UBI) programs. Unlike UBI, these schemes do not involve the removal of existing subsidies, the amount provided is smaller, and they are targeted at specific sections of the population rather than being universal. The article also explores the economic arguments for direct cash transfers and the potential benefits they can bring in terms of poverty alleviation and development. However, it acknowledges that implementing UBI on a large scale is challenging due to affordability and the political implications of reducing existing subsidies. The article concludes by discussing the need for effective implementation and the guiding principles for successful direct benefit transfer programs.

			<title>Supreme Court gives 3 months to SEBI to wrap up Adani probe. What is SEBI probing in Adani Group?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/supreme-court-sebi-adani-probe-explained-9093171/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing investigations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) into allegations made by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group. The investigations focus on two aspects: the ownership of 12 foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) who hold stakes in Adani Group companies and the trading patterns or short positions in Adani shares during January 18-31, 2023, around the time of the release of the Hindenburg report. The Supreme Court has refused to hand over the probe to a Special Investigation Team and has instructed SEBI to continue its investigations and complete them within three months [[1]](https://www.reuters.com/business/indias-adani-group-hindenburg-report-intended-create-false-market-2023-01-29/).

SEBI is conducting the investigations to determine if there has been a violation of Section 19A of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, which requires a minimum of 25% public shareholding in listed companies. The regulator has faced challenges in establishing the economic interest shareholders of the 12 FPIs due to the entities being located in tax haven jurisdictions. Efforts are still being made to gather details from five foreign jurisdictions [[1]](https://www.reuters.com/business/indias-adani-group-hindenburg-report-intended-create-false-market-2023-01-29/).

In addition to these ongoing investigations, SEBI has completed 22 other investigation reports, which have been approved by the competent authority in the regulatory body. These reports cover various aspects, including failure to disclose transactions with related parties, manipulation of stock prices, and possible violations of insider trading regulations.

The Supreme Court has also set up a six-member expert committee to investigate if there was a regulatory failure in dealing with the alleged contravention of laws pertaining to the securities market in relation to the Adani Group or other companies. SEBI has been asked to probe if there was a violation of minimum public shareholding norms, failure to disclose transactions with related parties, and manipulation of stock prices [[1]](https://www.reuters.com/business/indias-adani-group-hindenburg-report-intended-create-false-market-2023-01-29/).

It is important to note that the Adani Group has denied the allegations made by Hindenburg Research and has provided a detailed rebuttal to the short sellers' claims. The group has emphasized the robust disclosure system in place in India and has highlighted the drop in promoter pledge positions across portfolio companies [[1]](https://www.reuters.com/business/indias-adani-group-hindenburg-report-intended-create-false-market-2023-01-29/).

Overall, the investigations by SEBI into the allegations made by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group are ongoing, and the Supreme Court has instructed SEBI to complete the probe within three months</description>

			<title>Why has the Indian Science Congress been postponed?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/why-has-the-indian-science-congress-been-postponed-9093145/</link>
			<description>The Indian Science Congress, the largest gathering of scientists and students of science in India, has been postponed this year. This is an unprecedented move, as the congress has been held every year since 1914, with the exception of the two years following the Covid-19 pandemic. The reason for the postponement is a disagreement between the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) over funding and alleged financial irregularities.

The Indian Science Congress is a significant event that brings together scientists, researchers, teachers, and students from premier institutions and laboratories in the country. It provides a platform for interaction and discussion on matters related to science. The congress has a rich history and has been inaugurated by the Prime Minister, who addresses the event and emphasizes the importance of scientific knowledge for societal needs.

However, the Science Congress has been facing challenges in recent years. It has been criticized for controversies and the promotion of pseudoscience by some speakers. Many credible scientists have chosen to avoid the event, and leading scientific institutions have a limited presence. There have been calls for reforms and even discontinuing government support for the congress.

The government's dilemma lies in its association with the Science Congress. While the ISCA is an independent body, the government provides financial support and perceives the event as closely associated with it. The government has been scaling down its involvement in the congress but has been cautious about completely withdrawing support due to concerns about being seen as "anti-science" and the opportunity it provides for students to interact with scientists.

The postponement of this year's Science Congress does not necessarily mean the end of the event. The ISCA remains hopeful that it can be organized before March 31, and discussions for collaboration and funding for future events are ongoing. Scientists have suggested the development of an alternative forum that invites top Indian and global scientists to discuss the latest developments in the scientific world. Such an alternative forum could help make Indian science more competitive and foster collaboration with leading scientific groups and institutions.

Overall, the postponement of the Indian Science Congress is a significant development due to its historical continuity and importance in the scientific community. It highlights the challenges and controversies the event has been facing and the need for reforms to ensure its relevance and credibility in the future.</description>

			<title>Why the UK has stopped some postgraduate students from bringing family members</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-govt-immigration-dependants-students-policy-9092516/</link>
			<description>#### Summary of the Article: "UK's New Immigration Policy and Its Impact on Foreign Students and Workers"

The United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, announced a new immigration policy on January 1, which restricts the ability of foreign university students to bring family members to the UK. This policy is part of a broader effort to curb legal migration to the UK. Home Secretary James Cleverly emphasized the need to reduce migration to the country, citing recent data from the Office for National Statistics that showed a decrease in net migration from 745,000 in 2022 to 672,000 in 2023.

One significant aspect of the new policy is the prevention of international students from switching from the student route to work routes before completing their studies. This change aims to address the rise in net migration, which has been attributed to the growth in migrant workers in the health and social care sector and the increasing number of international students.

The government's measures also include reducing the number of student visas being issued and removing the right for international students to bring dependents unless they are enrolled in specific postgraduate courses designated as research programs. These actions align with the Conservative Party's goal, led by Rishi Sunak, to lower net migration, a key concern that was also prominent during the Brexit campaign.

The Migration Advisory Committee's 2023 annual report highlighted the significant role of migrant workers in the health and social care sector, which accounts for 63% of all entry Skilled Worker visas granted. While this has been beneficial in addressing shortages in the sector, concerns have been raised about potential exploitation and abuse, as well as the impact on healthcare staff in lower income countries.

The report also noted the fiscal cost to the UK of migrants bringing dependent children, but acknowledged the substantial public value provided by the health and social care sector. Opposition Labour Party MP Yvette Cooper expressed the need for immigration curbs and domestic worker training, emphasizing the importance of a fair, effective, and economically linked immigration system.

Overall, the article discusses the UK's new immigration policy, its impact on foreign students and workers, and the various perspectives and concerns surrounding these measures.

			<title>Why the Israel embassy in South Korea had to take down ‘imaginary Hamas attack’ video</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-embassy-south-korea-hamas-attack-video-9092555/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

Israel's embassy in South Korea created a video depicting an imaginary scenario where Seoul was attacked by Hamas. The video showed a young mother witnessing an air raid warning, followed by gunfire and explosions. The mother is then kidnapped, leaving behind her daughter's red mittens. The video aimed to help South Koreans understand the Israeli perspective on the conflict. However, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs deemed the video inappropriate and asked the embassy to take it down. South Korea's history of colonial violence by Japan has influenced some South Koreans to support Palestine. South Korea has not openly supported Israel in the conflict, as it seeks to maintain its growing economic ties with the Middle East, particularly with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</description>

			<title>Why a Bangladesh court has sentenced Nobel prize winner Muhammad Yunus to jail</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-nobel-prize-winner-muhammad-yunus-jail-9092292/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been sentenced to six months in jail by a court in Bangladesh for violating the country's labor laws. Yunus, known as the "Banker to the Poor," is credited with pioneering the system of microfinance loans to help impoverished people. His supporters claim that the case against him is politically motivated, as he shares a frosty relationship with Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus is also facing other charges involving alleged corruption and fund embezzlement. The Grameen Bank, which Yunus founded, has lifted millions out of poverty by disbursing collateral-free loans. Banks based on this model now operate in more than 100 countries. Yunus and Grameen Bank jointly received the Nobel Prize in Peace in 2006. The mounting litany of cases against Yunus has garnered global concern, with international figures denouncing the "continuous judicial harassment" he faces [[1]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-67858016).

#### Background:
Muhammad Yunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, Bangladesh. He received his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States in 1969 and became an assistant professor at Middle Tennessee State University. After Bangladesh was formed in 1972, Yunus returned to his homeland and was appointed head of the economics department at Chittagong University. As Bangladesh struggled to stabilize its economy and tackle poverty in the post-independence years, Yunus came up with the idea of providing small loans to entrepreneurs who wouldn't normally qualify for bank loans. This led to the establishment of the Grameen Bank in 1983, which has since disbursed collateral-free loans of $34.01 billion among 9.55 million people, with a recovery rate of 97.22% [[10]](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/muhammad-yunus-bangladeshi-nobel-laureate-sentenced-jail-by-court-2482880-2024-01-01).

#### Legal Troubles:
Yunus has been facing a wide array of legal troubles in Bangladesh. In 2011, he was removed as the managing director of Grameen Bank for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He has also been accused of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. In 2015, he was summoned by Bangladesh's revenue authorities over non-payment of taxes amounting to $1.51 million. Additionally, he has been put on trial for allegedly receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize award and royalties from a book. Yunus is said to be facing more than 150 cases, which has raised concerns globally. In 2020, 160 international figures, including former US President Barack Obama and ex-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, signed a joint letter denouncing the "continuous judicial harassment" of Yunus and expressing concern for his safety and freedom [[10]](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/muhammad-yunus-bangladeshi-nobel-laureate-sentenced-jail-by-court-2482880-2024-01-01).

#### Recent Sentencing:
The recent sentencing of Muhammad Yunus to six months in jail is related to labor law violations by Grameen Telecom, a company he founded as a non-profit. The court found that the company did not make 67 employees permanent as required, did not create employees' participation and welfare funds, and did not distribute 5% of the company's dividends to staff as per company policy. Yunus, as the chairman of Grameen Telecom, and three other company directors were convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. Grameen Telecom owns 34% of Bangladesh's largest mobile phone company, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor. Yunus was present in court and was granted bail pending appeal.

#### Conclusion:
Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate and founder of Grameen Bank, has been sentenced to six months in jail for labor law violations. His supporters claim that the case against him is politically motivated. Yunus has been instrumental in pioneering microfinance loans to help impoverished people, and his work has had a significant impact on poverty reduction globally. The mounting legal troubles Yunus faces have raised concerns among international figures, who have denounced the "continuous judicial harassment" he is experiencing [[2]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-01/bangladesh-sentences-nobel-winner-yunus-to-6-months-in-prison)</description>

			<title>Meet Arun Yogiraj, one of the three sculptors who made Ram Lalla’s idol for Ayodhya temple</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/arun-yogiraj-sculptors-ram-lallas-ayodhya-9092271/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

The Ram temple in Ayodhya is set to be inaugurated on January 22, and Arun Yogiraj, one of the three sculptors who made idols of Ram Lalla (Lord Ram in his childhood), has been receiving congratulations from Karnataka BJP leaders. While the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust has not yet announced which idol will be placed in the sanctum, many BJP leaders, including former chief minister BS Yedyiurappa and Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, have claimed that Yogiraj's work has been selected [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/arun-yogiraj-sculptors-ram-lallas-ayodhya-9092271/).

Arun Yogiraj, 38, is a highly sought-after sculptor in India. Despite having an MBA degree and briefly working in a different field, he returned to his family profession of sculpting. He has been assisting his father in sculpting since he was 11 years old. Yogiraj's family has been involved in sculpting for the past five generations, and his grandfather, B Basavanna Shilpi, was patronized by the kings of Mysore. Yogiraj has a team of 15 artisans and volunteers who learn the art from him. He has also trained many students free of cost through the Brahmarshi Kashyapa Shilpakala Shala trust in Mysuru.

Some of Yogiraj's famous works include a 28-feet monolithic black granite stone sculpture of freedom fighter Subhash Chandra Bose for Delhi's India Gate, a 12-feet Adi Shankaracharya idol for Kedarnath, Uttarakhand, and India's largest 10-feet monolithic white marble stone sculpture of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa in Mysuru. He has also created sculptures of various deities installed in temples across India.

For the Ram Lalla idol, Yogiraj and the other two sculptors were given stones from different places, including Nepal</description>

			<title>Why truck drivers across states are protesting against new law for hit-and-run cases</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/truck-drivers-protesting-against-new-law-hit-and-run-9091719/</link>
			<description>#### Summary of Nationwide Transportation Strike

The nationwide transportation strike, which began on January 1, has entered its second day, leading to significant disruptions in various states across India. The strike was initiated by truck, bus, and tanker drivers to protest the stringent jail and fine regulations under the newly implemented Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) for hit-and-run cases.

#### New Law on Hit-and-Run Cases
Under the new law, drivers who cause a serious road accident by negligent driving and flee the scene without informing the authorities can face punishment of up to 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs 7 lakh.

#### Reasons for Protest
Private transport operators claim that the new law discourages drivers and may lead to unjust punishments. They also express concerns about the potential for drivers to face mob violence when attempting to transport the injured to hospitals. The All India Motor &amp; Goods Transport Association President emphasized the lack of prior consultations with stakeholders and the need for discussions on the issue.

#### Impact of the Strike
The strike has led to road blockades and disruptions in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh, affecting vehicle movement and fuel supply. Reports indicate lengthy queues at petrol pumps in various states, including Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra. In Madhya Pradesh, nearly five lakh vehicles were reportedly impacted by the strike [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/truck-drivers-protesting-against-new-law-hit-and-run-9091719/).

The strike has caused significant disruptions in the transportation and fuel supply sectors, prompting widespread concern and inconvenience for the public [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/truck-drivers-protesting-against-new-law-hit-and-run-9091719/).

			<title>How China and the US first established diplomatic ties 45 years ago, why Taiwan became a sticking point</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-china-diplomatic-ties-history-9091388/</link>
			<description>Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden exchanged greetings on the anniversary of diplomatic ties being established between their countries. The normalization agreement was signed in 1979 after years of attempts at a formal relationship. Efforts from diplomats, leaders, and allies on both sides led to the establishment of Liaison Offices in Beijing and Washington, which functioned as informal diplomatic posts. The 1972 Shanghai Communique acknowledged the desire for closer ties and referred to Taiwan as part of China. Normalization was delayed due to changes in political leadership on both sides, but eventually happened in 1979. The US Congress approved the Taiwan Relations Act, allowing informal relations between the US and Taiwan and for US arms sales to the island. Despite obstacles and disagreements, strong leadership in both countries led to success in ending thirty years of diplomatic estrangement by focusing on mutual interests rather than ideology.</description>

			<title>Is 2024 a leap year? Why does a leap year not come every four years?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/is-2024-a-leap-year-why-does-a-leap-year-not-come-every-four-years-9090829/</link>
			<description>A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of the usual 365 days. The extra day, February 29, is added to the calendar to account for the fact that the Earth takes approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds to revolve around the Sun. Without the addition of a leap day every four years, the calendar and the seasons would gradually get out of sync, causing confusion with crop cycles and seasons starting at different times of the year [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/is-2024-a-leap-year-why-does-a-leap-year-not-come-every-four-years-9090829/) [[2]](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/which-years-are-leap-years-can-you-have-leap-seconds) [[3]](https://www.almanac.com/when-next-leap-year).

The concept of a leap year was introduced by scholars engaged by Julius Caesar in 46 BC and was made more precise from 12 AD. The Julian calendar, which was in use at that time, had a year that was usually 365 days long, with a 366th day added once every four years. However, this method was not error-free, as the calculation of six hours for the extra time was slightly different from the actual 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. This discrepancy led to the calendar year being slightly longer than the solar year [[2]](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/which-years-are-leap-years-can-you-have-leap-seconds).

In the 16th century, it was realized that the calendar years until then had accumulated 10 extra days. To address this, Pope Gregory XIII ordered a drastic compensation by dropping 10 days from the calendar in 1582. This adjustment, known as the Gregorian calendar reform, also introduced a new leap year system. According to the Gregorian calendar, every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100. However, years that are divisible by 400 are still considered leap years. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were leap years [[2]](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/which-years-are-leap-years-can-you-have-leap-seconds) [[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year).

The next leap year after 2024 will be in 2028 [[2]](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/which-years-are-leap-years-can-you-have-leap-seconds) [[5]](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html).</description>

			<title>Gangster Goldy Brar declared designated terrrorist under UAPA: What this means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/goldy-brar-designated-terrrorist-uapa-sidhu-moosewala-9090652/</link>
			<description>**Title: Gangster Goldy Brar Declared Designated Terrorist Under UAPA**

#### Summary:
Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, has been declared a designated terrorist by the Indian government under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). This designation allows the government to take action against individuals involved in acts of terror. The UAPA defines a "terrorist act" as any act committed with the intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security, economic security, or sovereignty of India, or to strike terror in the people. The 2019 amendments to the UAPA empower the government to designate individuals as terrorists and take necessary measures to combat terrorism. The designation of an individual as a terrorist can lead to sanctions such as travel bans and freezing of assets. The amendment also provides avenues for individuals to challenge the government's order through review committees and the courts.

#### Key Points:
- Gangster Goldy Brar, responsible for the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, has been declared a designated terrorist under the UAPA.
- The UAPA defines a "terrorist act" as any act committed with the intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security, economic security, or sovereignty of India, or to strike terror in the people.
- The 2019 amendments to the UAPA allow the government to designate individuals as terrorists if they are found involved in acts of terror.
- The designation of an individual as a terrorist can result in sanctions such as travel bans, freezing of assets, and an embargo on procuring arms.
- The amendment also provides individuals with the right to challenge the government's order through review committees and the courts.

			<title>Japan earthquake triggers tsunami warning: What is a tsunami, why does it keep forming in the island country?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/japan-tsunami-earthquake-9090621/</link>
			<description>#### Summary of "Tsunami waves hit several parts of Japan’s coastal areas and urgent evacuation warnings were issued after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook the country’s north-central region on Monday (January 1)"

On Monday (January 1), Japan experienced a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in its north-central region, leading to tsunami waves hitting several coastal areas. Urgent evacuation warnings were issued, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida urged citizens to closely follow evacuation orders and warned of the possibility of more powerful quakes and tsunami waves. Tsunamis are giant ocean waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the ocean. They can reach hundreds of feet in height and travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, slowing down when reaching shallow waters. Japan is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis due to its location along the 'Pacific Ring of Fire', the most active earthquake tectonic belt in the world. This region experiences frequent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis due to the constant meshing and colliding of tectonic plates.

The 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan resulted in around 18,000 deaths, displaced tens of thousands, and led to a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, causing the most severe nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union.

**Key Points:**
- Japan experienced a 7.6-magnitude earthquake in its north-central region on Monday, leading to tsunami waves hitting several coastal areas.
- Urgent evacuation warnings were issued, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida urged citizens to closely follow evacuation orders and warned of the possibility of more powerful quakes and tsunami waves.
- Tsunamis are giant ocean waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the ocean.
- Japan is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis due to its location along the 'Pacific Ring of Fire', the most active earthquake tectonic belt in the world.

			<title>Remembering independent India’s ‘Jallianwala Bagh’: The Kharsawan massacre of 1948</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/kharsawan-massacre-jharkhand-tribal-9090377/</link>
			<description>#### Summary of the Kharsawan Massacre

On January 1, 1948, the town of Kharsawan in present-day Jharkhand experienced a tragic massacre when police opened fire on a crowd gathered for a protest and the weekly market, resulting in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of Adivasis. This event has left a lasting impact, with many in Jharkhand observing New Year’s Day as a day of mourning and remembrance.

**Struggle for an Adivasi State**
The demand for a separate tribal state in the region dates back to 1912, and it gained momentum over the years. Despite official recognition by the Simon Commission in 1930, the Adivasis' demands remained unheard. The Adivasi Mahasabha, led by Jaipal Singh Munda, continued the struggle for a separate Adivasi state.

**Events Leading to the Massacre**
At the time of Independence, Kharsawan and neighboring Saraikela decided to accede to the Union of India and join the state of Orissa, despite the majority of Adivasis opposing this merger. In protest, a large gathering was called at Kharsawan on January 1, 1948, the day of the merger and the weekly market. The absence of Jaipal Munda, the leader of the Adivasi movement, and the large and enthusiastic crowd spooked the Orissa military police, leading to a tragic turn of events.

**The Massacre**
The police opened fire on the crowd, resulting in a significant loss of life. The exact number of casualties remains a point of contention, with the Orissa government confirming only 35 deaths, while other accounts suggest a much higher toll, possibly reaching thousands. The responsible party behind the massacre remains unclear, with no definitive report on the matter.

**Aftermath**
To this day, there is no consensus on the number of lives lost in the massacre, and the responsible party remains unidentified. A memorial now stands at the marketplace in Kharsawan, serving as a "political pilgrimage" site in the state, with various state leaders visiting it on New Year’s Day over the years.

This tragic event serves as a poignant reminder of the struggles and sacrifices made by the Adivasi community in their quest for recognition and autonomy.</description>

			<title>ISRO launches XPoSat: What is the mission and its significance?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/isro-launches-xposat-9090416/</link>
			<description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) into a precise circular orbit of 650 km. This is the world's second satellite-based mission dedicated to making X-ray polarimetry measurements. XPoSat is India’s first mission dedicated to analyzing the polarization of X-rays emanating from bright celestial sources in the medium frequency band. The spacecraft comprises two payloads, including Indian X-ray Polarimeter (POLIX) and X-ray Spectroscopy and Timing (XSPECT). These payloads will observe sources that emit polarized X-rays, such as magnetars or neutron stars, during the eclipse period. POLIX is designed to operate in the medium X-ray energy band of 8 to 30 kilo electron Volt (keV), while XSPECT will conduct fast timing and high spectroscopic resolution in a soft X-ray energy band of 0.8-15 keV. XPoSat will observe persistent sources and transient sources out in space, which get polarized due to multiple causes such as strong magnetic fields or interactions with material present around black holes. The mission aims to improve understanding of celestial bodies and unravel some unknown mysteries of the Universe by studying polarized X-rays emanating from these sources.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the changes in food inflation and agricultural policies during the first and second terms of the Narendra Modi government. During Modi 1.0, there was low inflation and surplus agricultural commodities, leading to various policy responses such as increased foodgrain allocation and sugar exports. However, during Modi 2.0, food inflation has increased, leading to changes in import duties on edible oils and pulses. The article also mentions the enactment of farm reform laws in June 2020, which were later repealed in November 2021 due to changing supply situations. The government's priority now is to ensure that more cane goes for food (sugar) than for fuel (ethanol). The article concludes by stating that restrictions on exports and stock limits are likely to remain until the Lok Sabha polls scheduled in April-May 2024.</description>

			<title>Red Sea attacks: Why many US allies have not joined its Op Prosperity Guardian</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/red-sea-attacks-arab-us-op-prosperity-guardian-9089791/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

The United States military, as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian, opened fire on Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. The USS Gravely destroyer shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired at a Maersk ship. The recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea have led to a pause in the movement of cargo. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attacks, which were launched in protest against Israel's military strikes on the Gaza Strip. The joint security initiative, announced by US Secretary of State Lloyd Austin, aims to aid the safe movement of ships. However, some US allies have yet to commit to the operation. The reluctance of other countries to join the mission may be due to concerns about getting involved in a global flashpoint and criticism over their prior stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Saudi Arabia, in particular, has played a role in supporting anti-Houthi forces in the Yemen civil war and is pursuing closer ties with Iran, believed to be backing the Houthis. Several countries have joined Operation Prosperity Guardian, but they are not publicly declaring themselves as partners. Australia, for example, is tripling its contribution to the Combined Maritime Forces instead of sending a ship or a plane. The operation will be coordinated by the Combined Task Force 153, which was established to improve maritime security in the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden.</description>

			<title>South Africa files genocide case against Israel at ICJ: Why the African nation supports Gaza so strongly</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-south-africa-filed-genocide-case-israel-icj-9089770/</link>
			<description>#### South Africa's Action Against Israel at the International Court of Justice

South Africa has taken the unprecedented step of approaching the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to seek an urgent order declaring that Israel is in breach of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention. This move comes amid international criticism of Israel for its continued bombing of Gaza [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-south-africa-filed-genocide-case-israel-icj-9089770/).

#### Reasons for South Africa's Sympathy to Gaza and the 1948 Genocide Convention

**South Africa's Solidarity with Gaza:** South Africa's solidarity with Gaza can be traced back to its own history of discrimination and disempowerment, which has made the country sensitive to the plight of Palestinians dominated by the Israelis. This solidarity is also rooted in the country's historical experience of colonialism and occupation, similar to that of Palestine [[6]](https://press.un.org/en/2023/gapal1454.doc.htm).

**The 1948 Genocide Convention:** The 1948 Genocide Convention, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, defines genocide as specific acts committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group. These acts include killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction, imposing measures to prevent births, and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-south-africa-filed-genocide-case-israel-icj-9089770/).

#### South Africa's Application to the ICJ and Israel's Response

**Application to the ICJ:** South Africa's application to the ICJ urges for a hearing and the issuance of "provisional measures" to prevent the violence in Gaza. The country's presidency stated that it was obliged "to prevent genocide from occurring" [[5]](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/29/middleeast/south-africa-icj-israel-genocide-intl/index.html).

**Israel's Reaction:** Israel has reacted strongly to South Africa's move, rejecting the allegation with disgust and describing it as "baseless" and a "blood libel" [[2]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67844551).

#### South Africa's Historical Position and Current Stance

**Historical Position:** South Africa's historical position was largely the same as many other African countries after the creation of Israel. However, over time, many African nations, including South Africa, softened their stand towards Israel due to various factors such as trade and technological advancements.

**Current Stance:** Despite potential gains from a good relationship with Israel, South Africa has stayed steadfast in its support of Palestine due to its deep links with anti-discrimination activism and its resistance to a worldview governed by the West's stand on important matters.

In summary, South Africa's application to the ICJ against Israel and its accusation of genocide are rooted in historical solidarity with Gaza and a commitment to preventing genocide, as defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention. This move has added to the criticism Israel has been facing from various non-West quarters and reflects South Africa's historical position and current stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.</description>

			<title>Security for 2002 Gujarat riots witnesses withdrawn: Everything you need to know about witness protection in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

The Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) re-investigating nine 2002 Gujarat riots cases has withdrawn police and paramilitary protection to all the witnesses, except for Zakia Jafri, the widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who filed a complaint against then-CM Narendra Modi. The term "witness" is widely used in criminal law but hasn't been properly defined in the statute books. However, Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allows investigating police officers to examine anyone "supposed to be acquainted" with the case's facts and circumstances. Witness protection schemes have been discussed in various reports and bills, including the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2003, and the Justice VS Malimath Committee Report (2003). The Supreme Court drew up a nationwide Witness Protection Scheme in December 2018, which operates by categorizing threat perceptions for witnesses and providing protective measures. The scheme was finalized in consultation with the National Legal Services Authority [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/).

#### Withdrawal of Witness Protection in Gujarat Riots Cases:

The Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) re-investigating nine 2002 Gujarat riots cases has withdrawn police and paramilitary protection to all the witnesses, including retired judge Jyotsana Yagnik. The only exception has been made for Zakia Jafri, the widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who filed a complaint against then-CM Narendra Modi [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/).

#### Definition of a Witness:

The term "witness" is widely used in criminal law but hasn't been properly defined in the statute books. However, Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allows investigating police officers to examine anyone "supposed to be acquainted" with the case's facts and circumstances. It also states that the witness is bound to answer all questions "truly" but needn't answer questions that expose them to criminal charges, penalties, or forfeiture [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/).

#### Witness Protection Schemes in India:

Section 398 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, which has replaced the CrPC, states that every state government shall prepare and notify a Witness Protection Scheme for the state to ensure the protection of witnesses. Various reports and bills have discussed the need for witness protection, including the Fourteenth Report of the Law Commission in 1958, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2003, and the Justice VS Malimath Committee Report (2003). The Supreme Court drew up a nationwide Witness Protection Scheme in December 2018, which operates by categorizing threat perceptions for witnesses and providing protective measures [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/).

#### Efforts to Protect Witnesses:

The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2003, proposed amendments to sections 161, 162, and 344 of the CrPC to prevent witnesses from turning hostile. However, the bill didn't address the lack of power trial courts have in protecting witnesses. The Justice VS Malimath Committee Report (2003) recommended enacting a law for witness protection similar to laws in the USA and other countries. The Delhi government notified a witness protection scheme in July 2015. The Supreme Court directed the Centre, states, and UTs to enforce the witness protection scheme "in letter and spirit" until a law is enacted on it [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/).

#### Witness Protection Scheme:

The Witness Protection Scheme, finalized in December 2018, operates by identifying three categories of threat perceptions for witnesses. Category A includes cases where threats extend to witnesses or their families' lives during an investigation, trial, or after. Categories B and C relate to cases where threats extend to the witness's safety, reputation, or property during the investigation or trial, and cases where there is a moderate threat perception, like harassment or intimidation of the witness or their family, respectively. The scheme provides various protective measures, such as ensuring witnesses and accused don't come face-to-face during the probe, protection of identity, relocation of witnesses, confidentiality and preservation of records, and recovery of expenses [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/).

#### Conclusion:

Efforts have been made in India to protect witnesses, including the establishment of a nationwide Witness Protection Scheme in December 2018. However, the recent withdrawal of witness protection in the 2002 Gujarat riots cases raises concerns about the safety and well-being of witnesses. The need for witness protection has been recognized in various reports and bills, and steps have been taken to address this issue. It is important to ensure the effective implementation of witness protection measures to uphold the integrity of the criminal justice system and provide a safe environment for witnesses to come forward and testify [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/witness-protection-india-9089178/)</description>

			<title>Ayodhya airport named after Valmiki: 5 interesting facts about the poet-sage</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/ayodhya-airport-valmiki-poet-sage-9088727/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Maharishi Valmiki Airport in Ayodhya, which is named after the author of the oldest version of Ramayana. Valmiki is referred to as Adi Kavi, or the “first/original poet” in Sanskrit and is credited with composing the Ramayana. The epic is divided into 7 cantos, and Valmiki himself makes an appearance in the first and last chapters. There are many versions of the Ramayana, but Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas is more popular today. There is a debate surrounding Valmiki's caste, with some sources identifying him as a Brahmin and others claiming he was from a lower caste. His popular origin story involves his transformation from a feared dacoit and hunter to a great sage after encountering Sage Narada.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: How the Northeast was ‘invented’, 52 years ago</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/northeast-invented-52-years-9088425/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the "invention" of Northeast India as an administrative concept and the creation of the North-Eastern Council in 1971. Prior to this, the region was part of colonial Assam, with Manipur and Tripura as princely states. Sikkim, although juridically independent, became part of the Northeast in 2001. The article highlights the region's unique position as a frontier province with distinct governance and security concerns. It also mentions the challenges faced by Northeasterners, including racial stereotypes and misrecognition. The naming and governance structure of the region were ad hoc decisions that aimed to address national security concerns but created new problems as well.

#### Creation of Northeast India
The North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act and the North-Eastern Council Act were enacted by Parliament on December 30, 1971, officially establishing Northeast India as an administrative concept. This replaced the previous unit of public imagination, Assam.

#### Composition of Northeast India
Northeast India comprises eight states: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura. These states are part of the North-Eastern Council, a statutory advisory body involved in development planning and region-level policy making.

#### Historical Background
Before Independence, five of the present-day states in Northeast India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram) were part of colonial Assam. Manipur and Tripura were princely states, while Sikkim was juridically independent but under British paramountcy. Sikkim became part of the Northeast in 2001.

#### Frontier Province and Security Concerns
Colonial Assam was a "frontier province" in British India, with a different political and legal setup compared to the rest of the country. The region's borders became international after Independence, and national security concerns were heightened in the 1960s due to the border war with China, the Naga independence movement, and conflicts with Pakistan. The creation of the state of Nagaland in 1963 was an attempt to address the rebellion and marked the beginning of a new governance structure.

#### Challenges Faced by Northeasterners
Northeasterners have often faced racial slurs and misrecognition based on phenotypic stereotypes. The term "Northeasterner" is commonly used outside the region, but self-identification is usually based on specific ethnic or regional identities. This highlights the othering of the region and the hierarchical relation between Northeast India and the rest of the country.

In summary, the article discusses the establishment of Northeast India as an administrative concept in 1971 and the unique historical and governance background of the region. It also highlights the challenges faced by Northeasterners in terms of racial stereotypes and misrecognition</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand CM forms panel to examine 2022 land law committee report: What is the issue — and what did the report say</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/uttarakhand-land-law-9088443/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand Chief Minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, has formed a five-member committee to study a 2022 draft report that recommended amending the state's land laws. This decision came after social organizations in Uttarakhand held a rally demanding stricter land laws to prevent the large-scale sale of land to outsiders. They also called for an increase in the minimum number of years required for non-Uttarakhand residents to obtain domicile certificates.

The issue began in 2003 when the then Chief Minister, ND Tiwari, introduced restrictions on land purchases in hilly areas by non-Uttarakhand residents. However, these restrictions were lifted in 2017 by Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat, triggering discontent among the locals. Responding to the pressure, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami formed a committee to examine the state's land laws.

The committee, headed by ex-chief secretary Subhash Kumar, submitted a report with 23 recommendations. One key recommendation was the introduction of an 'essentiality certificate' similar to Himachal Pradesh, which would be required for non-agriculturists or non-residents wishing to purchase land in Uttarakhand. The committee also recommended strict action against illegal structures or religious places on rivers, forest areas, pastures, or public land.

While the recommendations have not been implemented yet, the Uttarakhand government has formed a new committee to conduct a detailed study of the report submitted by the previous committee.</description>

			<title>Navy unveils new epaulettes for Admirals: What are the changes, what do they signify?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/navy-new-epaulettes-shivaji-9088379/</link>
			<description>The Indian Navy has introduced a new design for epaulettes worn by senior officers as part of its efforts to move away from colonial legacies in customs and traditions. The new design is drawn from the naval ensign and inspired by the Rajmudra of Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, reflecting the rich maritime heritage of the Marathas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the new design during his Navy Day address, and it includes a new golden Navy button carrying the new naval crest, a red octagon backing the national emblem, and symbols representing national power, winning wars, and long-term vision. The change aligns with efforts to discard colonial-era vestiges, customs, and traditions within the Indian Armed Forces, including allowing Indian attire in officers' mess and wardrooms, reviewing British-inherited ranks, and incorporating more indigenous texts in military training. Additionally, last year's Beating Retreat ceremony replaced the Christian hymn Abide With Me with Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon, and there are efforts to restrain the use of foreign names for military exercises and call signs.</description>

			<title>Donkey routes: En route Europe, how Indians visit several countries to create ‘travel history’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/donkey-routes-europe-9087898/</link>
			<description>According to an article, Serbia changed its visa rules last year under pressure from the European Union. The reason for this change was that Serbia was being used as an illegal transit route to Europe by many, including Indians. The visa-free regime for Indians, along with nationals from Turkey, Tunisia, Cuba, and Burundi, was being exploited to enter bordering countries like Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and ultimately reach Italy and France. To address this issue, Serbia withdrew visa-free arrivals from these countries in October 2022.

The transit phenomenon came to light when European authorities recorded over 130,000 illegal immigrants in the first 10 months of 2022, many of whom were nationals of the countries allowed visa-free arrivals by Serbia. In the case of Indians, migrants were asked to enter Serbia after visiting other destinations such as Nepal, Dubai, and Armenia to show a "considerable travel history" on their passports and appear as genuine travelers to immigration authorities. This pattern of creating a travel history to come across as tourists to immigration authorities has been observed in other cases as well.

In most cases, migrants are connected with people smugglers, known as "donkers," upon arrival in the transit country. These donkers help migrants enter their final destination illegally, often charging exorbitant fees for their services. Many of these migrants are transported in harsh and inhuman conditions, hiding in cramped containers and delivery vehicles, without food, water, or proper ventilation. Tragedies, such as drowning in unsafe vessels or suffocating in overcrowded trucks and ships, have been reported. Those who do reach their destination often find themselves trapped in cycles of exploitation and abuse.

The article also mentions that a significant number of Indians are believed to be stranded in Spain, where they entered illegally, and are now seeking general amnesty. Indian detainees have also been reported in countries like Ukraine, Turkey, Slovakia, Malaysia, Romania, and Poland, presumably on their way to Western European countries. However, reliable data on the number of Indians staying or working illegally in foreign countries is not available.

It is important to note that the information provided is a summary of the article and may not include all the details. For more comprehensive information, it is recommended to refer to the original article.</description>

			<title>ULFA peace accord: history of its 44-year-long insurgency, peace talks</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/ulfa-peace-accord-history-of-its-44-year-long-insurgency-peace-talks-9088017/</link>
			<description>The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) signed a historic tripartite peace deal with the Government of India and the state government of Assam. The article provides a background on the ULFA, which was established in 1979 as a response to the influx of migrants into Assam and the resulting competition for resources. The group sought to establish a sovereign Assamese nation through armed struggle against the Indian state. Over the years, ULFA has been involved in kidnappings, extortion, executions, and bomb blasts, leading to tragic loss of life. The Indian state has responded with operations and arrests, and there have been allegations of support for certain factions of ULFA. The group also has links to other insurgent outfits in the Northeast and Myanmar, as well as Islamic terror outfits like Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami and Al-Qaeda. Despite internal divisions and opposition to peace talks from some members, a pro-talks faction submitted a 12-point charter of demands to the central government in 2012, leading to discussions and ultimately the tripartite peace agreement signed in April. The article concludes with differing opinions on how fruitful the agreement will be and statements from Assam's Chief Minister and Union Home Minister expressing confidence in the potential for peace in Assam.</description>

### Intersection of Politics, Sports, and Elections
The year 2024 marks both the general elections in India and the Paris Olympics, creating a connection between excellence in sports and the government's performance in policy, planning, and execution.

### Future of Indian Cricket and Dhoni's Role
The article raises questions about the future of Indian cricket, including the leadership of players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, as well as the potential roles of players like Hardik Pandya. It also speculates on the future involvement of veteran cricketer MS Dhoni, considering possibilities such as coaching, mentoring, or a larger role in Indian cricket.

			<title>Donald Trump has been disqualified from two US states’ election ballots. Can he become President again?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-disqualified-election-ballots-president-9087789/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

Former US President Donald Trump has been disqualified from appearing on the presidential primary ballot in the state of Maine, making it the second state to remove him from the ballot after Colorado. The disqualification is related to Trump's alleged role in the January 6, 2021 attacks on the US Capitol. Trump has been accused of inciting an insurrection by spreading false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and calling for his supporters to march on the Capitol. The disqualifications raise questions about Trump's candidacy for the 2024 Presidential elections. While no law bars convicted candidates from running for office, the disqualifications under the 14th Amendment are unique and have never been invoked against a former President before. The case could potentially reach the Supreme Court, where larger legal questions about the 14th Amendment and the power of courts to order candidates off the ballots would need to be considered. The ruling is expected to go in Trump's favor, given the current majority of conservative judges on the Supreme Court. The removal of Trump from the primary ballot in Maine and Colorado could impact his prospects in the November elections, particularly in Maine where he won one of the state's four Electoral College votes in 2020. However, in traditionally Democratic-leaning Colorado, Trump's removal would not significantly impact the election results.

#### Reasons for Disqualification:

The disqualifications of Trump from the primary ballots in Maine and Colorado are based on his alleged role in inciting the January 6, 2021 attacks on the US Capitol. Trump's spreading of false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and his call for his supporters to march on the Capitol are seen as incitement to insurrection. The disqualifications are based on the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that any person previously elected to government offices who took part in an insurrection or rebellion cannot hold office again.

#### Legal Differences from Other Cases:

The disqualifications of Trump from the primary ballots are different from other legal cases against him, such as those related to his payments to a former adult film star and not handing over official documents after leaving office. In those cases, the question was whether a conviction would prevent him from running for President, and the general view among legal scholars was that a conviction would not necessarily bar him from running. However, the disqualifications based on the 14th Amendment raise unique legal questions about whether a Presidential candidate can be barred from being elected again and whether courts have the power to order candidates off the ballots.

#### Impact on Trump's Prospects:

The removal of Trump from the primary ballots in Maine and Colorado could impact his prospects in the November elections. In Maine, where Trump won one of the state's four Electoral College votes in 2020, his removal from the ballot could affect his ability to garner a significant number of votes. However, in traditionally Democratic-leaning Colorado, Trump's removal would not ultimately impact the election results. The case is currently on hold as Trump looks to appeal in a trial court in Maine. If the case reaches the Supreme Court, it could have significant political implications, and a ruling that Trump is disqualified from the presidency would be a momentous step.

#### Potential Supreme Court Considerations:

If the case reaches the Supreme Court, several larger legal questions will need to be considered. These include whether the 14th Amendment can bar a Presidential candidate from being elected again and whether courts have the power to order candidates off the ballots. The current majority of conservative judges on the Supreme Court suggests that the ruling is expected to go in Trump's favor. A ruling that Trump is disqualified from the presidency would have seismic political implications.

			<title>Why are pro-Kannada groups protesting signboards in Bengaluru?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kannada-groups-protest-signboards-bengaluru-9087540/</link>
			<description>A pro-Kannada organization in Bengaluru vandalized hoardings and billboards to protest the use of English in advertisements and signboards. The Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) took out a march and protests took place in multiple business hubs, leading to 53 arrests. The protests were in response to a BBMP order mandating Kannada in signs across the city by February 28, 2024. The ongoing issue over languages used in signboards has been a long-standing demand of several pro-Kannada organizations. The state government has responded by proposing an ordinance to ensure that 60% of space on signboards is dedicated to Kannada, with the rest left to other languages. This is based on the Kannada Language Comprehensive Development Act of 2022.</description>

			<title>Can Southeast Asia afford to retire its coal plants?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/southeast-asia-coal-plants-retire-9086706/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

Indonesia and Vietnam have announced their plans for utilizing funds from the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), a G7-backed investment scheme for sustainable development. Indonesia aims to increase the share of renewable energy in its power generation to 44% by 2030 and has identified 400 priority projects that would require a significant portion of the JETP funds. However, the plan is still in the draft stage, and stakeholder inputs are being collected for the formulation of a final investment plan. Vietnam, on the other hand, plans to cap peak greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 2030 and limit the capacity of coal-fired power plants. Both countries have received funding commitments from various international partners and private financial institutions. However, there have been concerns about the proportion of grants versus loans in the funding packages and the exclusion of certain power plants from the targets.</description>

			<title>Govt announces steps to revive stuck housing projects in Noida, Greater Noida: Why, who benefits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/steps-to-revive-stuck-housing-projects-in-noida-greater-noida-explained-https-indianexpress-com-article-cities-delhi-legacy-stalled-projects-noida-buyers-9083681-9086910/</link>
			<description>The Noida and Greater Noida Industrial Development Authorities have approved the adoption of the Amitabh Kant committee recommendations on legacy stalled projects. These measures aim to help developers complete projects that have been stuck for years. The approved measures include a two-year 'zero-period' relief, a three-year time extension without any fee, provision to bring in a co-developer if the builder is unable to complete the project, relaxation in conditions to mortgage, and payment of land dues in installments over three years [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/legacy-stalled-projects-noida-buyers-9083681/).

The relief to builders includes a waiver of interest and penal interest for a specified period of two years, and the installments will be shifted beyond this period. The builder will have to deposit 25% of the outstanding amount (land dues) within 60 days to begin the registration of flats. The remaining 75% will be deposited with simple interest over three years. The builder will also be allowed to mortgage the land after paying 25% of the dues [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/legacy-stalled-projects-noida-buyers-9083681/).

These measures were announced because many developers have been unable to provide fully constructed flats to buyers in Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Authority due to reasons such as non-availability of funds, increasing dues on builders, litigations, fund diversions, and criminal cases against the realtors. As a result, buyers have been unable to pay due installments to the builder, and banks and financial institutions have been hesitant to provide loans for stalled projects. This has created a deadlock that has not been resolved for years.

The committee set up to resolve the issue was chaired by Amitabh Kant, the ex-CEO of Niti Aayog, and was directed to provide solutions for legacy stalled projects. The committee held five meetings with various stakeholders and submitted its report on July 24. The Uttar Pradesh government deliberated on the report and approved its implementation in a cabinet meeting on December 19. About 50% of the committee's recommendations have been accepted with amendments.

The relief measures are expected to benefit around 2.40 lakh homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida, which accounts for over 35% of the total delayed housing units in the country. It is estimated that around 67,000 flat buyers in Noida, 147,000 buyers in Greater Noida, and 14,358 buyers in Yamuna Authority will benefit from this scheme. The order states that for flats in which families are staying, the registry, with or without occupancy certificate, should be completed within three months [[2]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/uttar-pradesh-govt-approves-recommendations-of-amitabh-kant-committee-real-estate-sector-welcomes-move-101702978810250.html).

In conclusion, the Noida and Greater Noida Industrial Development Authorities have approved the adoption of the Amitabh Kant committee recommendations on legacy stalled projects. These measures aim to provide relief to homebuyers and help developers complete projects that have been stuck for years. The relief includes a two-year 'zero-period' waiver, time extension, provision for co-developers, relaxation in conditions to mortgage, and payment of land dues in installments over three years. These measures are expected to benefit a significant number of homebuyers in the Noida and Greater Noida region [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/legacy-stalled-projects-noida-buyers-9083681/) [[2]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/uttar-pradesh-govt-approves-recommendations-of-amitabh-kant-committee-real-estate-sector-welcomes-move-101702978810250.html).</description>

The Indian government expressed shock at the verdict and announced that it would explore all legal options. The case has been of high importance to India, given the confidential nature of the proceedings and the fact that the accused are former Indian defense personnel. India has been employing both legal and diplomatic channels to secure the release of the men. Qatar is an important partner for India, with deep economic, defense, and people-to-people ties [[4]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67191248).

#### Commutation of Death Sentence:
An appellate court in Qatar has commuted the death sentence of the eight former Indian Navy officers. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India has noted the verdict and stated that the detailed judgment is awaited. The MEA is in close touch with the legal team and the family members of the sentenced men to decide on the next steps. The commuting of the death sentence is a significant development as it provides hope for the release of the former Navy officers. However, the specific details of the commutation and the reduced sentences have not been mentioned in the available sources [[2]](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/death-sentence-to-eight-indians-in-qatar-commuted-2827799) [[3]](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/qatar-court-commutes-death-sentence-of-8-ex-navy-personnel-9086281/).

#### Importance for India:

Firstly, it provides hope for the release of the eight former Indian Navy officers who have been in custody since August 2022. The Indian government has been exploring all legal options and has filed an appeal against the verdict. The commuting of the death sentence is a positive development in this regard.

The release of the former Navy officers would help in maintaining and strengthening this relationship. Lastly, Qatar has a significant Indian migrant population, and remittances from Qatar play an important role in India's economy. The commuting of the death sentence would be a relief for the families of the sentenced men and the Indian community in Qatar [[4]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67191248) [[7]](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/8-ex-indian-navy-officers-get-death-penalty-in-qatar-9000475/).

			<title>Qatar court commutes ex-Navy men’s death sentence: How many Indians are in jails abroad, what help they get</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/qatar-ex-navy-death-sentence-indians-in-jails-abroad-9086599/</link>
			<description>An appellate court in Qatar has commuted the death sentence of eight former Indian Navy personnel who were arrested on charges of espionage. The Ministry of External Affairs has acknowledged the verdict of the Court of Appeal of Qatar, but the detailed judgment is still awaited.

According to data from the Ministry of External Affairs, there are currently over 9,500 Indians in jails abroad, with three out of every five being held in the Middle East. Qatar has the third-largest population of Indian prison inmates in the region, with 752 Indian prisoners.

The highest number of Indian prisoners abroad is in Saudi Arabia, with 2,200 inmates, followed by the United Arab Emirates with 2,143. Other countries with significant numbers of Indian prisoners include Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman.

Indian Missions and Posts abroad closely monitor incidents of Indian nationals being jailed for alleged violations of local laws. They provide consular assistance, legal aid, and support to ensure the welfare of Indian prisoners. The Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) is set up at Missions and Posts abroad to assist overseas Indian nationals in distress situations, including financial assistance for legal aid and repatriation [[3]](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005).

India has signed agreements on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (TSP) with 31 countries, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. These agreements allow for the transfer of Indian prisoners to serve the remainder of their sentences in India and vice versa.

Since 2014, the Indian government's efforts have resulted in 4,597 Indian nationals receiving pardons or reductions of their sentences by foreign governments. However, some countries do not share data on the grant of pardons or reductions of sentences.

In conclusion, an appellate court in Qatar has commuted the death sentence of eight former Indian Navy personnel accused of espionage. Qatar has a significant population of Indian prisoners, with the highest number of Indian prisoners being held in Saudi Arabia. The Indian government provides consular assistance, legal aid, and support to Indian prisoners abroad, and has signed agreements with several countries for the transfer of sentenced persons. Efforts by the Indian government have resulted in thousands of Indian nationals receiving pardons or reductions of their sentences by foreign governments [[3]](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005)</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/qatar-commutes-death-sentence-indian-navy-veteran-9086293/</link>
			<description>The Court of Appeal of Qatar has commuted the death sentence of eight former Indian Navy personnel who were arrested last year in connection with an alleged case of espionage. The men were working for a private company called Dahra Global in their personal capacity to oversee the induction of Italian U212 stealth submarines in the Qatari Emiri Naval Force. The exact nature of the allegations against them is not publicly known. The Ministry of External Affairs of India has been closely monitoring the situation and has provided support to the arrested sailors. The Indian government has taken up the matter at various diplomatic and political levels, and negotiations for the repatriation of the prisoners to India will be the next step.

Here is a brief timeline of the case and the response of the Indian government:
- August 30, 2022: The eight men, along with two others, were arrested on undeclared charges and put in solitary confinement.
- October 1, 2022: India's Ambassador in Doha and Deputy Head of Mission met the eight naval veterans.
- October 3, 2022: First consular access was granted, and the CEO of Dahra Global, Khamis al-Ajmi, who came to get his officials out, was arrested himself.
- March 1, 2023: The last of multiple bail pleas filed for the veterans was rejected.
- March 25, 2023: Charges were filed against the eight men.
- March 29, 2023: The trial, under Qatari law, began.
- May 30, 2023: Dahra Global closed its operations in Doha, and all former employees, primarily Indians, have since returned home.
- August 4, 2023: The arrested men were moved from solitary confinement and put in a jail ward with their colleagues.
- October 26, 2023: The court awarded the death penalty to all eight men.
- Late October-Early November 2023: External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met family members of the sentenced men and assured them that the government would make all efforts to secure their release.
- November 7, 2023: India gets another round of consular access to the men.
- November 9, 2023: The Ministry of External Affairs announces that it has filed an appeal and has details of the charges.
- December 28, 2023: The Qatar court of appeals commutes the death sentence.

The Ministry of External Affairs has stated that it will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance to the arrested sailors and will take up the matter with the Qatari authorities. Efforts will now focus on negotiating the prisoners' repatriation to India. In addition to the Indian government's efforts, the families of the former Navy personnel have also filed a Mercy Plea to the Emir of Qatar, who is known to grant pardons during Ramadan and Eid</description>

			<title>Why more Indians seem to be travelling to Nicaragua, what the visa process is like</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indians-nicaragua-visa-process-immigration-9086309/</link>
			<description>Interest in traveling to Nicaragua has increased among Indians in recent months, with many approaching travel agents and the Nicaraguan representative office in India for visa-related queries However, there are concerns that some individuals may be using Nicaragua as a springboard to illegally enter the United States and Canada In the case of a recent flight from the UAE to Nicaragua, which was detained in France due to an anonymous tip-off about human trafficking, 25 Indian passengers sought asylum in France.

Obtaining a visa for Nicaragua can be tricky for Indian passport holders due to the lack of clarity in the public domain regarding the country's visa and immigration rules Nicaragua does not have an embassy in India, and the honorary consul general's office in India is not authorized to issue visas or authenticate related documents Indian passport holders are technically eligible for a visa on arrival in Nicaragua, but the process is unclear Indians with valid visas for the US, Canada, and Schengen countries can reach Nicaragua and obtain a visa on arrival after paying the visa fee Those without valid visas to these countries are advised to apply for travel authorization directly with the Nicaraguan Ministry of the Interior.

There are additional challenges for Indian travelers to Nicaragua, including a language barrier as Spanish is the prevalent language and limited understanding of English among the local population [[1]](https://www.state.gov/?post_type=state_briefing&amp;%3Bp=92333). Furthermore, Nicaragua has not traditionally seen a significant influx of Indian travelers, which may result in immigration officials being less familiar with the regulations for Indian citizens.

The honorary consul general's office in India has advised those interested in traveling to Nicaragua to directly approach the Nicaraguan Ministry of the Interior and provide their details, passport copies, itinerary, and hotel bookings via email to seek further information on the visa on arrival process.

In summary, interest in traveling to Nicaragua has increased among Indians, but obtaining a visa can be challenging due to the lack of clarity in the visa and immigration rules. Indian passport holders are advised to apply for travel authorization or contact the Nicaraguan Ministry of the Interior for further information.</description>

			<title>Israel Embassy blast: How an investigation into a similar case in 2021 led nowhere</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/blast-embassy-israel-2021-case-investigation-9085915/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

On December 26, 2023, a low-intensity explosion occurred near the Israeli Embassy in New Delhi. The incident reminded people of a similar blast that happened in January 2021 near the embassy. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the investigation and found CCTV footage showing two masked men walking near the blast site. The NIA traced the autorickshaw driver who dropped the suspects off in Jamia Nagar but did not find any CCTV cameras in that area. The NIA issued posters and announced a reward for the identification of the suspects. The investigation revealed a possible "Iranian link" and a letter addressed to the Israeli embassy ambassador was found at the blast spot, claiming the attack was in retaliation for the killings of Iranian figures Qasem Soleimani and Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Forensic examination determined that the explosive used was Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a military-grade explosive. Four students from Kargil were initially detained but were later released due to a lack of evidence.</description>

			<title>On Congress Foundation Day, a brief history of the INC</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/congress-foundation-day-brief-history-inc-9086083/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:
The Indian National Congress (INC) was founded on December 28, 1885, by Allan Octavian Hume, a retired British civil servant, along with Dadabhai Naoroji and Dinshaw Wacha. Initially, the aim of the INC was to influence British policies in favor of Indians, rather than seeking independence. However, over time, the party's goals evolved, and under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, it became the largest mass movement in history, working towards complete independence and addressing social issues such as caste discrimination and poverty. The INC played a significant role in India's struggle for independence and formed most of India's governments after independence. However, its dominance declined over the years, and it faced internal party politics and electoral setbacks. The Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as a national alternative to the Congress, leading to a shift in India's political landscape [[2]](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/this-day-in-history-dec28/).

#### Detailed Summary:
The Indian National Congress (INC) was founded on December 28, 1885, by Allan Octavian Hume, along with Dadabhai Naoroji and Dinshaw Wacha. The first session of the INC was held in Bombay, where 72 social reformers, journalists, and lawyers congregated at the Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College [[1]](https://www.inc.in/brief-history-of-congress).

Initially, the aim of the INC was not to seek independence from British rule but to influence British policies in favor of Indians. It provided a platform for Indians to air their grievances and frustrations. The party consisted mainly of educated, upper-class individuals, many of whom had studied abroad. However, it faced criticism from both the British for upsetting the status quo and Indians for not doing enough.

In 1906, differences within the party emerged, leading to a split between the moderates, led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Surendranath Banerjea, and the extremists, led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The moderates were willing to engage cordially with the British, while the extremists favored boycotts and demonstrations.

The party reunited in 1915, coinciding with the entry of Mahatma Gandhi into the scene. Gandhi rapidly became the most influential figure in the party and transformed its politics. Under Gandhi's leadership, the INC became a social movement, working towards eradicating caste discrimination, poverty, and ethnic differences. It also declared "Purna Swaraj" (complete independence) as its ultimate goal at the 1929 Lahore session of the Congress.

In 1947, India achieved independence, but it was accompanied by the bitter reality of Partition. The INC played a significant role in the national movement and formed most of India's governments after independence. Under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, the party embraced secularism, socialistic economic practices, and a non-aligned foreign policy. However, internal party politics and power struggles emerged after Nehru's tenure, leading to splits within the party.

The Congress faced its first electoral loss on the national stage in the 1977 general elections, following the period of Emergency (1975-77). It returned to power in subsequent years but experienced setbacks and a decline in dominance. The Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as a national alternative to the Congress, and the political landscape shifted. The Congress has since faced electoral challenges and reduced seat numbers in recent elections [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress).

Overall, the Indian National Congress has a rich history in India's struggle for independence and post-independence politics. While it has faced challenges and changes over the years, it remains one of the major political parties in India [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress).</description>

			<title>Who can drink in dry Gujarat: Here are the exemptions allowed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/who-can-drink-in-dry-gujarat-exemptions-9085526/</link>
			<description>The recently announced relaxation of the Gujarat Prohibition Act in the limits of GIFT City in Gandhinagar adds to the list of exempted categories of drinkers in Gujarat. The state of Gujarat controls the manufacturing, sale, and consumption of liquor through a system of state-issued licenses and permits. Consumers are required to obtain permits, while manufacturers and sellers must obtain licenses. There are seven different types of permits available for consumers, including health permits and non-health permits. Health permits require the applicant to be over 40 years of age, have a monthly income of over Rs 25,000, and have a medical reason for applying. The cost of a health permit can be up to Rs 4,000, with an annual renewal fee of Rs 2,000. Non-health permits have varying costs and validity periods. The state has also fixed the monthly quantity of liquor that can be availed by health permit holders based on age. Other permits include permits for temporary residents, tourist permits, and visitor permits. Group permits are available for participants in conferences and conventions, while emergency/tatkal permits can be availed by residents of Gujarat for possessing and using brandy, rum, or champagne for their family members. Permits can be issued by designated officials and authorities in different locations, such as GIFT City and licensed liquor shops. The popularity of health permits has increased among Gujarat residents over the age of 40 in recent years. Between 2018 and 2022, a total of 76,135 permits were issued, with health permits accounting for 78% and non-health permits accounting for 22% of the total.</description>

			<title>Can retailers charge you for carry bags? Here’s what consumer court orders say</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/can-retailers-charge-for-paper-carry-bags-9085364/</link>
			<description>The Delhi Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (DCDRC) recently ordered fashion brand Lifestyle to pay a customer Rs 3,000 for charging him Rs 7 for a paper carry bag. This is not an isolated incident, as other retailers have also been fined for similar practices. The issue stems from the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules of 2011, which initially mandated that no carry bags be provided free of cost by retailers to consumers. However, retailers began charging for paper and cloth bags as well, exploiting a loophole in the rules. Despite amendments to the rules in 2016 and 2018, the issue remains unresolved. Retailers argue that there is no law explicitly stating that carry bags must be supplied for free to customers. However, consumer courts have ruled that charging consumers for bags without informing them beforehand is illegal. In some cases, courts have also ruled that retailers must provide free carry bags with their logo printed on them, but can charge for plain bags with prior consent from customers.</description>

			<title>Strategy and foreign affairs for India in 2024: dealing with realities, looking at opportunities</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/strategy-and-foreign-affairs-for-india-in-2024-dealing-with-realities-looking-at-opportunities-9085554/</link>
			<description>The article discusses various conflicts and challenges that India is facing in its foreign policy and international relations. Here are the key points:

1. Middle East Crisis: The article highlights the disruption caused by the Hamas attack in the Israel-Arab reconciliation process. Israel's response has been criticized for its disproportionate use of force, leading to a high number of casualties. The future of Gaza remains uncertain.

2. Stress in India-US Ties: The relationship between India and the US is facing challenges due to allegations of an Indian official's link to an assassination plot against a Khalistani separatist in the US. India has responded differently compared to its response to Canada's suggestion of an Indian government link to another Khalistani's murder. India is committed to the rule of law and is willing to investigate if provided with more information.

3. Russia-Ukraine War Fatigue: The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is entering its third year, and the West is facing funding challenges in providing assistance to Ukraine. Putin's re-election as Russia's President is expected, and the proximity between Moscow and Beijing is a concern for the West.

4. India's Maldives Challenge: The Maldivian government, which is considered close to China, has asked India to withdraw its military personnel stationed in the Maldives and has expressed its intention to terminate a water survey pact.

5. China as the Biggest Worry: China remains India's biggest strategic challenge, with the border standoff continuing for the fourth winter. The dependence of India's strategic defense partner, Russia, on China for economic survival, and the growing closeness between the Maldives and China in the Indian Ocean, add to India's concerns.

6. G20 and Global South Positioning: India's success in negotiating a joint declaration at the G20 summit and mobilizing developing and less developed countries under the umbrella of the Global South is seen as a surprise and a continuation of India's Non-Alignment leadership.

7. Engagement in Kabul: India's engagement with Afghanistan is evolving, with a change of guard in the Afghanistan embassy in New Delhi. While India is cautious in its engagement with the Taliban, it is providing passport and visa services to Afghan nationals. China has also posted a full-time envoy in Kabul.

The article also discusses upcoming challenges and issues that India will face in its foreign policy, including its relationships with the US, Canada, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and West Asia. The outcomes of these relationships will impact India's strategic and foreign policy posture. The article emphasizes that irrespective of the election mandate, there will be continuity in India's foreign policy choices, with some nuanced changes.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-janman-scheme-particularly-vulnerable-tribal-groups-9085355/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN), which was approved by the Union Cabinet in India.

			<title>Why Israel has imprisoned an 18-year-old ‘conscientious objector’, what the term means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/conscientious-objector-muhammad-ali-tal-mitnik-9085249/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the case of Tal Mitnik, an 18-year-old who refused to serve in the Israeli military and participate in its assault on Gaza. Mitnik stated in a public statement that he did not want to contribute to the oppression and bloodshed and instead wanted to work towards finding a solution. However, Israeli law mandates that all citizens serve in the military for a certain duration, and those who refuse to do so are socially ostracized and persecuted by the state.

The concept of a conscientious objector is explored in the article. A conscientious objector is an individual who refuses to perform military service based on their conscience, often due to ideological or religious reasons. Throughout history, there have been individuals who have refused to serve in the military, citing their personal beliefs.

The earliest documented conscientious objector was Maximilianus, who refused to serve as a soldier in the Roman army in 295 CE and was later executed for his refusal. The first self-identified conscientious objectors appeared during World War I, when conscription was used by most belligerents. It is estimated that more than 16,000 conscientious objectors refused military service in the UK, and about 4,000 in the US during the war.

Explicit conscientious objection legislation emerged in Western countries during and after World War I. However, countries struggling to meet their manpower requirements either completely forbade conscientious objection or allowed it in very limited circumstances. For example, during World War I, most of the 16,000 British conscientious objectors, who were primarily pacifist Quakers, were refused any exemption and sent to prison if they continued to resist military service.

The right to conscientious objection is enshrined in international law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. The 1976 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights further emphasizes this right. In 1995, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights explicitly advocated for conscientious objection as a right.

However, despite the recognition of conscientious objection as a right by the UN and other human rights organizations, it does not have a legal basis in most countries with conscripted militaries. Even in countries where it is legally recognized, it is often highly restricted. For example, in Israel, the right to conscientious objection is only extended to Haredi Jews studying religious scriptures in traditional yeshiva schools.

The article also mentions famous examples of conscientious objectors. Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector during World War II, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his role as a medic despite refusing to touch a weapon due to his religious beliefs. Muhammad Ali, the renowned boxer, refused induction into the military during the Vietnam War, stating that it went against the teachings of the Quran. He was convicted of draft evasion but later had his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court.

In summary, the article discusses the case of Tal Mitnik, a conscientious objector who refused to serve in the Israeli military. It explores the concept of conscientious objection, its historical context, and the legal and social challenges faced by conscientious objectors. It also highlights famous examples of conscientious objectors, such as Desmond Doss and Muhammad Ali.</description>

			<title>‘Robert Vadra stayed at London house bought with proceeds of crime’: What the ED said in court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/robert-vadra-ed-case-cc-thampi-explained-9085209/</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

A special court in New Delhi has taken cognizance of a prosecution complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against CC Thampi, an alleged aide of Robert Vadra, in connection with a money laundering probe against fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. The ED has alleged that Vadra renovated and stayed in properties bought by Thampi in London, indicating close financial links between the two. The ED has also investigated the alleged role of real estate dealer Harbans Lal Pahwa in the probe. Vadra is also involved in other cases, including the Gurgaon and Bikaner land deal cases. The cases against Vadra pertain to fraudulent and fictitious claims and allotments in relation to land acquired for the Mahajan Field Firing Range Bikaner, which is used by the Army.

#### Allegations against CC Thampi and Robert Vadra:

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged that CC Thampi, a close associate of Robert Vadra, purchased properties in London that Vadra renovated and stayed in. The ED claims that Vadra and Thampi also purchased a significant amount of land in Faridabad and had financial transactions with each other. The ED has stated that Thampi deposited a large sum of cash to Harbans Lal Pahwa, a real estate dealer, who had financial dealings with Sanjay Bhandari. The ED has concluded that Vadra is a friend of both Thampi and Bhandari.

#### London property matter:

The ED raided premises associated with Skylight Hospitality, a firm linked to Robert Vadra, in connection with a money laundering case registered against Sanjay Bhandari for holding undisclosed assets abroad. The ED claimed that Bhandari bought a property at Bryanston Square in London using money that flowed into a UK-based company named Santech. The ED alleged that a significant amount of money was siphoned off into another company named Vortex and then used by Bhandari to buy the Bryanston Square property. The property is currently held by Skylight FZE, which is promoted by CC Thampi.

#### Faridabad property matter:

The ED has found that Harbans Lal Pahwa, a real estate dealer who was previously a director in a company owned by Robert Vadra, purchased land in Faridabad and sold it to Vadra at almost the same price within months of the purchase. The same parcels of land were subsequently sold back to Pahwa by Vadra at a substantial profit. The ED discovered that around the time of these transactions, Thampi made a large cash payment to Pahwa. The ED has concluded that Thampi, who had financial dealings with Sanjay Bhandari, deposited cash to Pahwa, which was used for several land dealings. Vadra received Rs 15 crore from DLF for the sale of the Faridabad land, but the deal did not go through due to legal issues.

#### Petroleum ministry deal:

The petroleum ministry deal is related to a petrochemical complex being built by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in Dahej, Gujarat. Samsung Engineering Ltd, which hired Sanjay Bhandari's firm Santech International FZC for consultancy services, implemented one of the projects in the complex. After the contract was awarded, Samsung paid USD 49.9 lakh to Santech. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case of corruption against Bhandari, Samsung Engineering Ltd, and unknown officials of ONGC based on information provided by the ED.

#### Other cases against Vadra:

Apart from the Sanjay Bhandari case, Robert Vadra is also involved in the Gurgaon and Bikaner land deal cases. In the Gurgaon case, Vadra, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, DLF, and Onkareshwar Properties have been booked on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, fraud, forgery, and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Bikaner case involves FIRs filed by three different agencies, including the Rajasthan police and the CBI. The cases revolve around fraudulent and fictitious claims and allotments in relation to land acquired for the Mahajan Field Firing Range Bikaner, which is used by the Army.

			<title>Red Sea attacks, Panama Canal drought: How trouble at two shipping choke points could impact global trade</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/red-sea-attacks-shipping-global-trade-panama-canal-9083539/</link>
			<description>The recent drone attack on the Chemical tanker MV Chem Pluto in the Red Sea has raised tensions among Indian oil importers and exporters of commodities like basmati and tea. These attacks have been carried out by Yemen-based Houthi rebels as a protest against Israel's military offensive in Gaza. The disruption in maritime transport, including the Red Sea route and the Panama Canal, poses a significant concern for global trade. Over 80% of global goods trade is carried by sea, and any blockage or longer alternate routes can push up freight rates and impact prices of agricultural products. The drought conditions at the Panama Canal have led to a drop in shipping, forcing ships to use the longer Suez Canal route. This situation has raised concerns about prolonged canal bottlenecks. While global oil and petroleum product flows through the Red Sea have declined, India has not faced a disruption in its Russian oil imports. The attacks have caused a slight increase in the price of benchmark Brent crude, but it is not expected to significantly impact international oil prices. Shipping firms have imposed war risk surcharges, which could lead to higher freight rates for Indian shipments to Europe and Africa. The European Union, one of India's major export destinations, has experienced slowing demand, affecting sectors like textiles, gems, and jewelry exports. Maersk, a shipping giant, is preparing to resume operations in the Red Sea, but ship traffic may still be diverted depending on safety conditions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/how-christmas-is-celebrated-in-homes-across-india-9081344/</link>
			<description>In India, Christmas celebrations reflect the regional diversity of the country. While urban areas may have decorations like tinsel and fake trees, Indian Christians often adorn their Christmas trees with indigenous decorations such as papier maché stars, bells, and painted wooden ornaments. Traditional decorations like kolams, rangolis, and akashkandeels are also popular. Christmas songs are sung in regional languages, and nativity plays and choral concerts showcase the cultural diversity of India. Feasting is a significant part of Christmas, with regional specialties like roast duck, stew, appams, beef fry, pork vindaloo, sorpotel, biryanis, curries, and sweets being enjoyed. Each region has its own variations of Christmas cakes and sweets, incorporating local ingredients and flavors. The celebrations in India have their own unique traditions and are not solely influenced by Western customs.</description>

			<title>Is the climate fight lost? 5 reasons to be hopeful it is not</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-fight-5-reasons-to-be-hopeful-9081313/</link>
			<description>Hmm, it's great to see that there are reasons to remain hopeful despite the challenges we face in addressing climate change. The study highlights several positive trends, such as the mainstream awareness of climate change and increased discussions among the population. It's encouraging to see young people leading global calls for urgent action and the rise of climate litigation against states and companies. Additionally, the goal of achieving a net-zero economy is gaining traction, with many countries, regions, and cities setting targets for full decarbonization. Businesses and investors are also responding to societal pressure and recognizing the risks posed by climate change. Renewable energy costs have significantly decreased, making them the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation in most parts of the world. The electrification of transport and heating is also playing a crucial role in decarbonization efforts. While there is still much work to be done, these trends provide hope for addressing the climate crisis.</description>

			<description>PV Narasimha Rao, the former Prime Minister of India, was paid homage by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on his 19th death anniversary. Kharge highlighted Rao's contributions to India's transformative journey through economic reforms, as well as his achievements in the nuclear program and foreign policy, including the 'Look East' policy. Rao's political journey took a turn when he was chosen as the next Congress President after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Despite other aspirants for the position, Rao's experience, support from President R Venkataraman, and the backing of Congress MPs from peninsular India played a significant role in his selection. He went on to become the Prime Minister of India.</description>

			<title>‘Dunki’ and immigration: How the first modern passports came to be</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/dunki-immigration-history-passport-visas-travel-9079283/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. "Dunki" is a film by Shahrukh Khan and Rajkumar Hirani that explores the issue of immigration. The title of the film is derived from the term "donkey journey," which refers to the challenging and often perilous routes people take to immigrate to their desired destinations. The film also touches upon the history of passports and visas, highlighting that these documents are relatively modern, dating back around 70 years. Passports have existed for centuries, with examples found in ancient texts like the Hebrew Bible. France had an established passport system before the French Revolution, and similar systems were in place in other countries like the United Kingdom. In India, the practice of issuing passports began during World War I under the British government's Defense of India Act. The need to secure borders and regulate travel during the World Wars led to the development of modern passports with features like photographs and descriptions of physical traits. The League of Nations held a conference in 1920 to standardize passport regulations, and the British system became widely adopted. In the 1920s, countries like the US also implemented passport laws, partly in response to increased immigration. Despite their origins in wartime measures, passports have become an essential aspect of modern citizenship.</description>

			<title>Why the White House is opposing Japan firm’s bid to acquire US steelmaker</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-the-white-house-is-opposing-japan-firms-bid-to-acquire-us-steelmaker-9079196/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the opposition faced by Japanese steel major Nippon Steel's plans to acquire US Steel. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, as well as the Joe Biden Administration, have expressed concerns about the deal. Critics argue that the acquisition could impact US national security and union jobs in Pennsylvania. The United Steelworkers union, which endorsed Biden's presidential run, has also opposed the deal. The White House has stated that the proposed acquisition deserves serious scrutiny in terms of its potential impact on national security and supply chain reliability. However, there are multiple factors to consider. Nippon Steel is the largest steelmaker in Japan, which is a close ally of the US. The acquisition could bring stability to US Steel's operations and restore some of its past glory. The terms of the deal seem reasonable, and Nippon Steel has been operating in the US for four decades. The deal still needs to meet shareholders' approval and may face regulatory hurdles.</description>

			<title>National Mathematics Day: Remembering the legacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/national-mathematics-day-srinivasa-ramanujan-9079116/</link>
			<description>Srinivasa Ramanujan, a legendary mathematician, was born on December 22 and National Mathematics Day is celebrated in his honor. Despite his short life, Ramanujan's ideas continue to inspire mathematicians. He excelled in mathematics from a young age, but struggled in other subjects. Ramanujan's work was substantial and often used novel methods. He gained popularity in Madras' mathematical circles and eventually received a clerical position at the Madras Port Trust. With the help of GH Hardy, he went to Britain and enrolled in Trinity College, Cambridge. Ramanujan's lack of formal training was compensated by his intuition and inspired thinking. He became a member of the London Mathematical Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society. Unfortunately, Ramanujan faced health issues and returned to India, where he passed away. His genius was compared to Euler and Jacobi, and his work in number theory, particularly in the partition function, is highly regarded. Ramanujan left behind notebooks and unpublished results that mathematicians continued to study. In 2012, December 22 was declared National Mathematics Day in his honor.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/who-was-leonard-bernstein-the-celebrated-conductor-in-maestro-9077731/</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: Leonard Bernstein, the subject of the motion picture "Maestro," was a multifaceted and influential musician in the history of Western classical music. He was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1918 to Jewish parents who had emigrated from Russia. Bernstein's musical journey began with piano lessons at the age of 10, and he later studied conducting at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. He gained recognition after substituting for Bruno Walter at the New York Philharmonic and went on to have a triumphant career, performing all over Europe and becoming the first American-born conductor to lead the orchestra. Bernstein had a passionate conducting style and was known for his animated performances. He married Felicia Montealegre and had three children, but he also had relationships with both women and men throughout his life. Bernstein was politically active, protesting the Vietnam War and advocating for civil rights. He passed away in 1990 due to complications from emphysema.</description>

			<title>Kejriwal skips ED summons for Vipassana: 10 things you need to know about the meditation practice</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kejriwal-ed-summons-vipassana-meditation-9076604/</link>
			<description>Vipassana is an ancient meditation technique derived from the teachings of the Buddha. It is a way of self-transformation through self-observation, aiming to achieve true peace of mind and lead a happy, useful life. The practice of Vipassana disappeared from India for centuries but was reintroduced in the 19th century by the influential monk Ledi Sayadaw and spread globally in the 20th century. SN Goenka brought Vipassana back to India in 1969 and established numerous Vipassana centers worldwide. The most popular course is a 10-day residential course where students have no contact with the outside world and follow a strict Code of Discipline. It is important to note that Vipassana is not limited to Buddhists and does not involve religious practices. The training involves three steps: morality, Anapana meditation focusing on the breath, and the actual practice of Vipassana. The daily schedule includes meditation sessions, interactions with the teacher, and discourses on Vipassana. The courses are run solely on a donation basis.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/india-arctic-year-round-manning-expedition-9072693/</link>
			<description>Himadri, India's Arctic Research Station at Ny-Ålesund in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, will now operate throughout the year. India recently sent its first winter expedition to Himadri, consisting of four scientists from different institutions. The region above the Arctic Circle offers pristine environments for various scientific research, including atmospheric, oceanic, biological, geological, glaciological, and earth sciences. The Arctic region has been experiencing rising temperatures, with a 4-degree Celsius increase on average over the last century. The melting sea ice in the Arctic can have global impacts, such as rising sea levels and changes in atmospheric circulation. India, along with other countries, is actively involved in Arctic research and has its permanent research station, Himadri, which has been operational since 2008. The recent winter expedition aims to study atmospheric sciences, astronomy, astrophysics, and climate studies.</description>

			<title>The more fertile you are, the sooner you may die: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/fertile-die-study-gene-antagonistic-pleiotropy-hypothesis-9070888/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided article, scientists believe that aging may be a consequence of how we evolved to reproduce. The study analyzed the genes of over 276,000 participants and found that individuals carrying gene variances promoting reproduction are less likely to survive to old age. This supports the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, which suggests that mutations promoting reproduction are more likely to reduce lifespan. It's interesting to note that genetic variances promoting reproduction increased over generations from 1940 to 1969, indicating ongoing human evolution. However, the article also mentions that the decline in reproductive performance with age is not fully understood from an evolutionary perspective. The benefits of fertility in early life may come at the cost of aging later on. This hypothesis suggests that certain traits and genetic variants that are beneficial in youth can become problematic in old age, leading to fragility and health issues. For example, menopause and fertility loss in women can accelerate aging. Overall, this study provides evidence supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis and its potential implications for understanding aging-related diseases.</description>

			<description>The Post Office Bill, 2023, was brought to the Lok Sabha for consideration on December 13. It aims to consolidate and amend the law relating to the Post Office in India. The Bill allows the Centre to intercept, open, or detain any item in the interest of state security, public order, or contravention of other laws. It also empowers post officers to hand over postal items to customs authorities if they are suspected to contain prohibited items. The Bill removes penalties and offences under the 1898 Act and regulates private courier services for the first time. Some members of the Opposition have criticized the Bill for retaining draconian provisions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/vijay-diwas-1971-war-india-pakistan-bangladesh-9070725/</link>
			<description>In December 1971, Lt Gen AAK Niazi of the Pakistan Eastern Command signed the Instrument of Surrender, ending a 13-day war and leading to the birth of Bangladesh. The war began earlier in 1971 with the Pakistan Army's Operation Searchlight, targeting political opposition in the East. This led to widespread violence, sparking resistance from Bengali civilians and the formation of the Mukti Bahini guerrilla force. India supported the resistance movement by arming and training the Mukti Bahini, leading to a lengthy preparation before direct military involvement. The Indian Army executed a successful three-pronged assault, gaining control of the air and sea and ultimately forcing the surrender of Lt Gen Niazi.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/surat-diamond-bourse-sdb-gujarat-9070608/</link>
			<description>The Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) is a newly-built complex in Gujarat, India. It is claimed to be the world's biggest office space in a single project, surpassing the capacity of the Pentagon in the United States. The SDB aims to expand and shift the diamond trading business from Mumbai to Surat, which is known for its cutting and polishing of diamonds. The complex consists of nine towers with a total of about 4,200 offices, ranging from 300 square feet to 7,500 square feet each. It will serve as a hub for diamond-related activities, including the sale of rough and polished diamonds, diamond manufacturing machinery, diamond planning software, diamond certificate firms, lab-grown diamonds, and more. Additionally, there will be 27 retail outlets for diamond jewelry. The SDB has implemented strict security measures, including over 4,000 CCTV cameras and biometric access for employees. The project was completed in five years, with a total cost of Rs 3,200 crore.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/arctic-hottest-summer-climate-change-9069590/</link>
			<description>According to the article, the 2023 summer in the Arctic was the warmest on record. The Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the globe since 1979 due to climate change. This has led to various consequences, including the thawing of subsea permafrost, which releases greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and ocean acidification. Food insecurity has also been a concern, with extremely low numbers of Chinook and chum salmon in Western Alaska, impacting Indigenous communities that rely on salmon for food. Raging wildfires, severe flooding, and the melting of Greenland's ice sheet are other severe consequences of the soaring temperatures in the Arctic.</description>

			<description>The BSE Sensex rallied 1.34%, or 930 points, and closed above 70,000 on Thursday, following the United States Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged and hint at cuts in 2024. This surge has been attributed to sustained investment from retail investors, with the number of active demat accounts on the CDSL platform crossing 10 crore last month. The higher-than-expected GDP growth of 7.6% in the quarter ended September 2023 has also raised sentiment among investors, who are factoring in expectations of an early rate cut by the Fed and a fall in the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds.

The prospect of political stability after the 2024 Lok Sabha election is seen as a positive factor, encouraging market analysts to anticipate low election-linked market volatility. The surge in demat accounts indicates the entry of many new investors into the markets, with a notable increase in retail AUM and the number of retail portfolios. Additionally, FPIs have made a major comeback in December, investing more than Rs 39,260 crore so far this month.

Moreover, caution is advised as new investors tend to chase low-grade small caps, and retail investors have a tendency to buy overvalued small and mid-cap stocks. Experienced investors take this as a sign of caution, and it's important to be mindful of the potential risks associated with market corrections.</description>

			<title>Beyond Jammu and Kashmir: Why many states in India enjoy special provisions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-many-states-in-india-enjoy-special-provisions-9068631/</link>
			<description>In India, the governance structure is quasi-federal, meaning that while states have autonomy, the power to legislate is tilted towards the Centre. The Constitution contains different lists that prescribe subjects for legislation by the Centre and states. In case of a conflict, the Union law prevails. Some states in India have special statuses, such as Jammu and Kashmir, which had Article 370 formalizing its relationship with India. Other states like Nagaland and Mizoram also enjoy negotiated autonomy. These special provisions are considered features of asymmetric federalism, providing varying degrees of autonomy and relationship with the Centre. Delhi also has a unique arrangement for administration under Article 239AA.</description>

			<title>‘Bizarre’ reason for not holding Pune bypoll: Why the Bombay HC pulled up the Election Commission</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/pune-bypoll-why-bombay-hc-pulled-up-election-commission-9068569/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court directed the Election Commission of India to conduct a bypoll for the Pune Lok Sabha constituency following a petition filed by a 25-year-old law graduate, Sughosh Joshi. The petition challenged the delay in conducting the bypoll and argued that the constituents had been without representation in Parliament, contrary to the Representation of People Act. The High Court held that the petitioner had the legal standing to file the writ petition and criticized the ECI's argument for not conducting the bypoll due to preparations for the 2024 General Elections. The ECI was directed to immediately proceed with the election, but it has the option to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court. Currently, there are 18 vacant Lok Sabha seats, with 13 vacated due to winning state Assembly elections and 5 due to untimely deaths and other circumstances.</description>

			<title>Allahabad HC allows survey of Mathura Idgah: What is this plea in the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/allahabad-hc-mathura-idgah-sri-krishna-janmabhoomi-case-9068278/</link>
			<description>The Allahabad High Court has allowed an application to appoint a commission to inspect the Shahi Idgah mosque complex in Mathura, India, as part of a dispute between Hindu petitioners and the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and the Shahi Idgah mosque committee. The Hindu petitioners seek the removal of the construction on the land in dispute and its handover to the Shree Krishna Janmbhoomi Trust. The dispute revolves around the location of the Shahi Idgah mosque, believed to have been built on the place where Lord Krishna was born. The complex history of the land includes the mosque being built by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1670 on the site of an earlier temple, and subsequent ownership changes and legal actions. The Allahabad High Court has consolidated multiple suits related to this dispute.</description>

			<description>The recent Supreme Court ruling upheld the Centre’s abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. The court examined key issues in the challenge to the government's decision, including the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir, the temporary or permanent nature of Article 370, the legality of its abrogation, and the action taken during President's rule. The court unanimously upheld the constitutional validity of the Presidential Orders CO 272 and 273 of August 5 and 6, 2019, making the entire Constitution of India applicable to J&amp;K and declaring all provisions of Article 370 inoperative.</description>

			<title>What was the Bommai judgment, which the SC relied on in its Article 370 ruling?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-was-the-bommai-judgment-which-the-sc-relied-on-in-its-article-370-ruling-9064090/</link>
			<description>In the case of SR Bommai v Union of India, the Supreme Court interpreted Article 356 of the Constitution regarding the proclamation of President's rule. The Court ruled that the President's decision can be subject to judicial review and established guidelines for when and how President's rule can be imposed. This case has been invoked in recent challenges to President's rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. The Bommai ruling also emphasized the importance of parliamentary approval for imposing President's rule and highlighted the significance of center-state relationships. It is worth noting that the Bommai verdict led to a decrease in the frequency of President's rule being imposed. In the context of the Kashmir case, the Supreme Court relied on the Bommai ruling to validate the actions of the President in abrogating Article 370. The Court held that the President's actions are constitutionally valid and subject to judicial review based on varying standards set by different judges in the Bommai case.</description>

			<title>What was Karan Singh’s Proclamation of 1949, cited by SC to uphold abrogation of Article 370?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/karan-singh-proclamation-1949-sc-uphold-abrogation-article-370-9063745/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370, ruling that Jammu and Kashmir did not retain an element of sovereignty after joining the Union of India. In his judgment, Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud referred to a proclamation by Yuvraj Karan Singh in November 1949, reflecting the surrender of J&amp;K's sovereignty to India. The proclamation stated that the Constitution of India would govern the constitutional relationship between J&amp;K and the Union of India, superseding all other constitutional provisions inconsistent with it. Karan Singh later clarified that the proclamation was issued to eliminate ambiguity regarding J&amp;K's integration with India. The Supreme Court's ruling aligns with the Center's argument that the 1949 proclamation surrendered sovereignty to the Indian Constitution.</description>

			<title>Recalling Syama Prasad Mookerjee, fierce Nehru critic who fought for J&amp;K’s integration with India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/syama-prasad-mookerjee-jammu-kashmir-integration-9063688/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, an influential figure in Indian politics, particularly regarding the abrogation of Article 370 and the integration of Kashmir with the Indian Union. Dr. Mookerjee was a prominent academic, barrister, and politician known for his staunch opposition to Kashmir's special status and his advocacy for a unified India. He founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the precursor to the BJP, and played a key role in shaping the Hindu right's political ideology. His strong stance on the integration of Jammu and Kashmir with the Indian Union led to his untimely demise, which some believe was part of a conspiracy to suppress the movement in Kashmir.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370 by the Centre in 2019 and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul recommended setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for human rights violations in J&amp;K since the 1980s. He emphasized the need for impartiality, expeditiousness, and dialogue, and discussed the historical burden carried by the people of Jammu and Kashmir due to conflicts since 1947. He also highlighted the involuntary migration of a part of the state's population, the army's role, and the feeling of distrust among the youth in the Valley. Justice Kaul expressed hope for systemic reforms and the return of those compelled to migrate with dignity.</description>

			<description>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, approved by the UN General Assembly 75 years ago, is a significant document that lays out fundamental rights and freedoms. It consists of a preamble and 30 articles that establish principles such as the equality and dignity of all individuals, the right to life, liberty, and security, and the prohibition of slavery, torture, and discrimination. The declaration was created in response to the atrocities of World War II and the Holocaust, with the aim of guaranteeing the rights of every individual. While it is not legally binding, its principles have influenced international human rights law and inspired numerous human rights treaties. Despite challenges and abuses, the declaration remains relevant, and its successes should be honored while learning from its failures.</description>

			<title>De-extincting the dodo: Why scientists are planning to bring back the bird to Mauritius</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/dodo-mauritius-extinct-genomic-9059974/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses an ambitious project to bring back the dodo bird, which went extinct in the 17th century. The project is a collaboration between Colossal Biosciences and the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation. The dodo's genome has been sequenced using DNA from a skull, and it is being compared to the genome of its closest relative, the Rodrigues solitaire. The Nicobar pigeon's primordial germ cells will be edited to express the physical traits of a dodo, and then inserted into the embryos of chickens acting as surrogates. The restored dodo will physically resemble the original species. However, there are challenges in recreating a species from DNA, and it may take years of selective breeding to enhance the bird. The project also faces challenges in reintroducing the dodo to its once-native habitat in Mauritius, as the environment has changed. The project aims to restore the dodo's fragile ecosystem and inspire conservation efforts.</description>

			<title>Who is a citizen, who is an ‘illegal immigrant’: Questions before SC in Assam Citizenship Act case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-assam-citizenship-act-6a-9058138/</link>
			<description>A five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court began hearing pleas challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, which was introduced following the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985. The Accord was signed between the Rajiv Gandhi government and the All Assam Students' Union to address concerns about migrants from Bangladesh entering Assam. The ongoing hearing involves questions of citizenship, "illegal immigrants," and the rights of indigenous Assamese citizens.

The challenge before the Constitutional bench questions one of the core elements of the Assam Accord, which determines who is considered a foreigner in the state. Section 6A of the Citizenship Act was inserted as an amendment to accommodate this, establishing March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date for entry into the state. Those entering after that date would be considered "illegal immigrants." The plea before the bench seeks to establish 1951 as the cut-off date instead of 1971 and argues that Section 6A is discriminatory and violative of the rights of indigenous Assamese people.

The petitioners argue that the application of Section 6A has led to a change in the demographic pattern of Assam and reduced the people of Assam to a minority in their own state. They claim this is detrimental to the economic and political well-being of the state and acts against the cultural survival, political control, and employment opportunities of the people.

The final National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, published in 2019, became a point of contention. The Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha (ASM), the primary petitioner, referred to an order by a two-judge bench led by then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, suggesting that the NRC could be updated according to their requested terms.

The constitutional issues involved in the case were framed by a two-judge bench in 2014, consisting of 13 questions on Section 6A for deliberation by a constitutional bench. The outcome of the ongoing hearing will have implications for citizenship, illegal immigration, and the rights of indigenous Assamese people in Assam.</description>

			<title>Apollo Hospitals accused of being involved in ‘cash for kidney’ racket: 6 things you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/apollo-hospitals-cash-for-kidney-racket-9056660/</link>
			<description>Apollo Hospitals chain has been accused of participating in an international 'cash for kidney' scheme, according to an investigation by the UK's Telegraph newspaper. Impoverished individuals from Myanmar are allegedly being enticed to sell their kidneys for profit, with the hospital group facilitating the process. The racket involves fabricating identity documents and false family photographs to present donors as relatives of patients. Patients without family members who can donate organs are able to find strangers willing to donate through Apollo's Myanmar offices. The hospital allegedly collaborates with the patient to select a donor and arrange payment. Apollo's Myanmar operation provided an expenses document outlining costs related to kidney transplantation. The total expenses mentioned amounted to Rs 1,79,500 but did not include the sum given to the donor, which could reach 70 or 80 lakh in most cases. The system is manipulated by making an upfront cash payment to the donor, who is then flown to India. The transplant authorization committee, responsible for verifying the relationship between recipient and donor, is claimed to be a mere facade, asking superficial questions. Family trees, household documents, marriage certificates, and photos are forged to establish familial links between patients and paid donors. Dr Sandeep Guleria, a surgeon at Apollo, has been named in the report as the person who performed the transplants. A previous incident in 2016 involved two secretarial staff members at Apollo's Indraprastha Hospital, who were arrested along with brokers and donors for their alleged involvement in a kidney racket. The investigation into the accused is still ongoing. Apollo Hospitals vehemently denied these allegations, calling them false, ill-informed, and misleading.</description>

			<title>Sensex, Nifty soar: Political, other factors driving the rally</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-sensex-nifty-soaring-political-other-factors-9055865/</link>
			<description>Indian equities have experienced a surge of over 2.6% in the last two trading sessions, reaching new highs following the BJP's victory in three out of four Assembly elections. This outcome has boosted market sentiments and raised optimism among investors that the national party will be re-elected in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, leading to policy continuity and long-term growth.

The rise in benchmark indices coincides with a rally in the domestic market due to stronger-than-expected GDP growth, lower crude oil prices, ease in US bond yields, increased foreign portfolio investments (FPI), and expectations of an early rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. Since November 1, the Sensex and Nifty have jumped by approximately 9%.

The BJP's decisive victories in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have instilled confidence in the market regarding political stability at the Centre, resulting in heavy buying from investors. The government's pro-growth initiatives such as infrastructure development, digital India, and 'Make in India' have been well-received by the market.

Economically, higher-than-expected GDP growth of 7.6% in Q2 of FY '24 has further boosted investor sentiment. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury has fallen, making markets like India more attractive for foreign flows. Additionally, falling crude oil prices have led to expectations of controlled inflation in the US, potentially prompting the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates earlier than anticipated.

Foreign institutional investors (FII) have shifted their strategy from selling Indian shares in September and October to becoming net purchasers in November and December. FPIs have bought Rs 15,462 crore of shares in December compared to Rs 9,001 crore in November.

Overall, the Indian equity market reflects strong optimism driven by both political and economic factors, with expectations of continued growth and a positive outlook for the Indian economy.</description>

			<title>Karni Sena chief killed: Who was Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, and what was the outfit he headed?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/karni-sena-chief-killed-who-was-gogamedi-9055777/</link>
			<description>Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, the president of Shri Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena (SRRKS), was shot dead in Jaipur, along with one of the three assailants who attacked him at his home. The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon in Jaipur's Shyam Nagar, and Gogamedi was pronounced dead at the hospital. SRRKS is a splinter group that split from the Shri Rajput Karni Sena (SRKS). Gogamedi was formerly associated with SRKS but was expelled in 2015 by its founder, Lokendra Singh Kalvi, which led to the formation of SRRKS.

Gogamedi and his group gained notoriety for their violent opposition to various issues over the years, including the protests against the Bollywood movie 'Padmaavat.' They were involved in assaulting director Sanjay Leela Bhansali during the film's shooting in 2017. In April 2021, they demanded an increase in the economically weaker sections (EWS) quota for general castes.

The murder of Gogamedi is allegedly claimed by a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, currently imprisoned in Tihar jail. The SRKS was initially formed in 2006 as a response to the Rajputs' struggle against their rivals, the Jats, following a dispute involving a notorious gangster. The SRKS aimed to oppose social and political malice against Rajputs, promote Rajput unity, and prevent the misrepresentation of historical figures, named after the revered Karni Mata goddess.

Further details regarding the motive behind Gogamedi's murder are yet to be revealed.</description>

			<title>Why Moody’s cut China’s economic outlook to ‘negative’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/china-moodys-cut-economy-outlook-explained-9055615/</link>
			<description>Moody's, the ratings agency, has downgraded China's credit rating outlook from 'stable' to 'negative'. The downgrade is a result of several challenges faced by the Chinese economy, including a manufacturing slowdown worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. China's strategy of implementing strict lockdowns in response to Covid-19 impacted economic activity. Moody's also cited concerns about lower medium-term economic growth and the downsizing of the property sector as reasons for the downgrade.

China's property sector has been experiencing funding constraints, with real estate giants like Country Garden and Evergrande recently defaulting on their loans due to decreased demand for homes. There are worries that these issues could have broader implications for the economy. Additionally, there are concerns about the government's finances as it may need to spend billions of dollars to support struggling sectors.

Moody's predicts China's annual GDP growth to slow to 4.0% in 2024 and 2025, with an average of 3.8% from 2026 to 2030. Credit rating agencies evaluate the financial health of companies and governments based on official data and interactions with relevant stakeholders. These ratings help investors make informed decisions and influence borrowing costs.

While Moody's retained China's A1 long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings, the downgrade in outlook suggests a potential future downgrade. The last downgrade of China's economy occurred in 2017. China's Finance Ministry expressed disappointment with the downgrade, stating that Moody's concerns were unnecessary.

It is worth noting that Moody's also recently lowered the outlook on the US credit rating from "stable" to "negative" due to rising interest rates, a growing debt burden, and political gridlock in Congress. However, the US retained its AAA rating.</description>

			<title>Lalduhoma &amp; ZPM: behind the remarkable result in Mizoram assembly elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/lalduhoma-zpm-behind-the-remarkable-result-in-mizoram-9054643/</link>
			<description>The Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) has achieved a significant victory in the Mizoram Assembly election, defeating the long-standing Mizo National Front (MNF) and securing the opportunity to form the next government. The emergence of the ZPM is groundbreaking as it marks the first time a party other than the MNF or the Congress has come into power in Mizoram.

Formed in 2017, the ZPM is a coalition of six small regional parties and civil society groups that aimed to combat corruption in governance. One of the key parties within the coalition is the Zoram Nationalist Party, founded by Lalduhoma, who is expected to become the Chief Minister.

During the 2018 Assembly elections, the ZPM was not officially recognized as a political party. However, they supported 38 Independent candidates, eight of whom were victorious, making the coalition the primary opposition to the MNF. The ZPM outperformed the Congress, which had been in power for two previous terms but only managed to secure five seats in the 2018 elections. Lalduhoma himself defeated the incumbent Congress Chief Minister at the Serchhip constituency.

Over the past five years, the ZPM has seen significant changes. In 2019, it gained recognition as a political party and transformed from a loose coalition into a viable alternative. It has since achieved notable victories, including Lalduhoma winning the Serchhip by-election in 2021 after being disqualified as an Independent candidate. The party also won all 11 seats in the Lunglei municipal council and all seven seats in the Zemabawk local council by-elections, both crucial wins.

The ZPM has attracted young candidates, including local celebrities like Jeje Lalpekhlua and Lalnghinglova Hmar, who have defeated sitting ministers. Lalduhoma, with a history in politics dating back to his time in the Indian National Congress and later the ZNP, has played a significant role in the party's progress.

Traditionally, power in Mizoram has alternated between the MNF and Congress. However, the ZPM has disrupted this cycle by presenting itself as a corruption-free alternative. It capitalized on accumulated anti-incumbency against both established parties and promised administrative reforms, land reforms, and economic reforms, including support prices for local crops.

While positioning itself as a fresh force, the ZPM acknowledged similarities with the MNF, particularly regarding Mizo nationalism. Both parties supported the unification of Zo territory, challenging the perception that Mizo nationalism belongs exclusively to the MNF. The ZPM differentiated itself as the authentic regional voice, accusing the MNF of losing its regional identity by aligning with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.

Overall, the ZPM's victory represents a significant shift in Mizoram's political landscape, breaking away from the dominance of the MNF and Congress and offering a viable alternative focused on combating corruption and addressing key issues.</description>

			<title>Navy Day: As PM Modi praises Shivaji’s naval prowess, a look at the Maratha Navy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/navy-day-modi-shivaji-navy-maratha-9054536/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the 17th-century Maratha king, at Sindhugarh fort in Maharashtra on Navy Day. Highlighting Shivaji's understanding of naval power, PM Modi announced that naval officers' epaulettes would soon feature Shivaji's emblem. Last year, the PM had introduced the Indian Navy's new Ensign based on Shivaji's seal. The Indian Navy has recognized the maritime skills of the Marathas and named its training establishment in Lonavla as INS Shivaji and the logistics hub in Mumbai as INS Angre, after Kanhoji Angre, a renowned Maratha naval commander. Shivaji established a navy to safeguard his territory and engage in maritime trading, believing that controlling the seas meant having power. Between 1661 and 1663, the Maratha Navy grew to include around 400 ships. Shivaji constructed multiple naval forts, including Vijaydurg, Sindhudurg, and Kolaba, to monitor approaching enemies. While formidable in coastal waters, the Marathas did not challenge European naval powers like the Portuguese or British on the high seas. After the decline of Portuguese influence, the British Royal Navy emerged as a dominant force. The Marathas lacked the resources to compete with these powerful navies.</description>

			<title>Pilatus PC-7 Mk II crash: 5 things to know about the trainer aircraft</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pilatus-pc-7-mk-ii-crash-9054386/</link>
			<description>Two Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots lost their lives in a tragic accident when their Pilatus PC-7 Mk II trainer aircraft crashed during a routine training sortie from the Air Force Academy at Dundigal, Telangana. The aircraft was found completely charred near Toopran, Medak district, about 40 km away. A Court of Inquiry has been initiated to determine the cause of the crash. This is the first incident involving this type of aircraft since its induction into the Air Force almost ten years ago. The Pilatus PC-7 Mk II is a trainer aircraft used for basic training of rookie cadets before they progress to more advanced planes.

The IAF currently operates 75 Pilatus PC-7 Mk II aircraft, including the one involved in the crash. These planes are utilized for initial flight training of cadets, followed by intermediate and advanced stages on other aircraft models. The HAL Kiran and BAE Hawk are the next phases in the training program, with 78 Kiran and 102 Hawk aircraft in the IAF's fleet. Additionally, the Pipistrel Virus is employed as a basic trainer for Flight Safety and Air Wing Cadets, with 72 of these aircraft being used by the IAF out of a total of 194 in service across various organizations.

Pilatus Aircraft Ltd, based in Switzerland, specializes in manufacturing short take-off and landing as well as trainer aircraft for air forces globally. The Pilatus PC-7 Mk II is a low-wing, turbo-prop aircraft with tandem seating. It has a Pratt &amp; Whitney turbo-prop engine, a maximum speed of 412 km/h, a ceiling of slightly over 10,000 m, and a range of 1,200 km without external tanks. The aircraft has been used as the initial trainer by more than 20 air forces worldwide, and some countries have also deployed it for combat operations.

The IAF procured 75 Pilatus aircraft in 2012 to address the shortage of trainer aircraft caused by grounding the indigenously developed HPT-32 in 2010 due to fatal crashes. The fleet was delivered between 2013 and 2015, and the option for an additional purchase of 38 more aircraft was not exercised due to a blacklisting of the Swiss manufacturer on corruption charges. However, the ban was partially lifted later to allow the IAF to maintain its existing fleet. In March, the Defence Ministry signed a contract with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd to acquire 70 HTT-40 trainer aircraft designed by HAL as a replacement.</description>

			<title>What is climate finance — and why developing countries need it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-climate-finance-cop-28-9054382/</link>
			<description>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has pledged $30 billion towards a new fund aimed at directing private sector capital to climate investments and improving financing for developing countries. This announcement was made during the ongoing COP28 climate summit hosted by the UAE. The fund, which aims to bridge the climate finance gap, is expected to stimulate an additional investment of $250 billion by 2030.

Climate finance refers to large-scale investments required to mitigate or adapt to the consequences of climate change. Adaptation involves taking actions to prevent or minimize damage from climate change effects, such as building infrastructure to protect coastal communities. Mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through measures like increasing renewable energy sources and expanding forest cover.

Developing nations demand climate finance because they argue that developed nations, whose historical emissions are responsible for the current climate crisis, should provide financial assistance. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated high-income countries to provide climate finance to the developing world. In 2009, developed countries committed to providing $100 billion annually to developing countries by 2020, with the establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2010 as a delivery mechanism. However, this pledge has not been fully met.

According to a UNFCCC analysis, developing countries need at least $5.8 trillion by 2030 to fulfill their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlined in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change impacts. This amounts to around $600 billion per year, significantly lower than the promised amount from developed countries. The lack of data and capacity for determining these needs may result in an underestimation. Furthermore, government expenses incurred to address extreme weather events caused by climate change are considered separately under the funding mechanism for loss and damage.

Renowned climate economist Nicholas Stern estimated that $2 trillion per year will be needed by 2030 to assist developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and coping with climate breakdown effects.

There is debate regarding the actual amount of climate finance being provided to developing nations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that developed countries provided $83.3 billion in 2020 as climate finance, but Oxfam disputed this figure, accusing developed countries of inflating their contributions by as much as 225% through dishonest accounting. Non-concessional loans have also been criticized, as they increase debt pressures. A study from CARE International revealed that over half of the climate finance provided by rich countries from 2011 to 2020 was redirected from development budgets, impacting critical priorities such as health, education, and women's rights.</description>

			<title>Cyclone Michaung intensifies into ‘severe’ cyclonic storm: Everything you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cyclone-michaung-intensifies-9054156/</link>
			<description>Cyclone Michaung, currently over west-central and coastal south Andhra Pradesh, has intensified into a 'severe' cyclonic storm and is expected to make landfall near Bapatla district on December 5th. This cyclone is unique because high-intensity storms are uncommon in December due to unfavorable ocean conditions. Initially predicted as a tropical cyclone, it was upgraded to a severe storm by the Met department. Michaung is projected to travel parallel to the south Andhra Pradesh coast before crossing between Nellore and Machilipatnam. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings of heavy rainfall in various districts of Andhra Pradesh, with potential crop damage and strong winds during the landfall. Storm surge and tidal waves are also expected. After crossing the Andhra coast, the cyclone is expected to move northwestwards towards southern Odisha. India's east and west coasts are prone to cyclones, with the Bay of Bengal experiencing more frequent cyclone development. Warm ocean temperatures and Tropical Cyclone Heat Potential contribute to the intensification and propagation of tropical cyclones. Factors such as atmospheric conditions, wind shear, and air-sea interaction also influence cyclone formation and intensification.</description>

			<title>RBI monetary policy: Why is the Monetary Policy Committee likely to leave repo rate unchanged?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-monetary-policy-committee-repo-rate-unchanged-reason-9052430/</link>
			<description>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to maintain the repo rate, its key lending rate, at 6.5% during its upcoming monetary policy review scheduled from December 6-8. This decision may be influenced by rising inflationary risks due to an increase in vegetable prices. The RBI is also likely to retain its stance of 'withdrawal of accommodation' in its monetary policy. Despite a better-than-expected second-quarter GDP growth rate of 7.6%, the RBI may revise its growth estimate for FY '24 upwards.

Economists predict that the six-member rate-setting panel of the RBI will not make any changes to the repo rate in the upcoming policy. The expectation is based on the anticipation of increased food inflation, particularly with the rise in onion and tomato prices. On the other hand, core inflation remains around 4%, providing no grounds for an interest rate hike. In October, consumer price-based inflation eased to 4.87% but remains above the RBI's target of 4%.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has emphasized the need for vigilant monitoring of inflation and maintaining a focus on the 4% target. With strong GDP growth in Q2 FY '24 and potential inflation risks due to food price volatility, experts expect the RBI to maintain a hawkish approach in its monetary policy. This would involve keeping the repo rate and stance unchanged, ensuring tight liquidity, and aiming to keep short-term rates around 6.85-6.90%.

This would be the fifth consecutive monetary policy where the MPC chooses to leave the repo rate unchanged at 6.5%. The previous rate hike occurred in February 2023 when it was raised from 6.25% to 6.5%. Analysts believe that the stance of the monetary policy will continue to be one of 'withdrawal of accommodation'.

Banks have responded to the cumulative 250 basis points hike in policy rates since May 2022 by increasing their lending rates. However, the transmission of the rate hikes has not been fully realized, as there is still a 50 basis points gap in lending rates. Banks have also raised their deposit rates. Overall, the RBI may slightly revise its FY '24 GDP growth forecast to 6.8% while keeping the headline inflation forecast unchanged at 5.4%, anticipating a decline in food inflation later in the fiscal year.

As the RBI is expected to maintain the policy rate at 6.5%, borrowers will receive relief as external benchmark lending rates linked to the repo rate will not increase, resulting in stable equated monthly instalments (EMIs).</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Green Credits Initiative during the COP28 climate talks in Dubai. The initiative aims to generate Green Credits through plantation on degraded wasteland and goes beyond carbon credits. The Green Credits Programme, launched by the Environment Ministry, seeks to create a market-based incentive for various environment-positive actions, not limited to carbon emission reductions. While carbon credits allow companies and nations to trade credits for reducing their carbon footprint, the Green Credits programme aims to replicate this system for actions like water conservation and soil improvements. The initiative can benefit individuals and communities, as well as industries and corporations. PM Modi proposed the concept to the international community, with the hope of establishing a global market for green credits similar to carbon credits.</description>

			<title>From Israel to China, how Henry Kissinger influenced US foreign policy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/henry-kissinger-dead-influence-us-foreing-policy-explained-9048332/</link>
			<description>Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State, died at the age of 100. He was a controversial figure who shaped American foreign policy in the 1970s. Kissinger played a significant role in improving relations between the US and the USSR and China during the Cold War. He advocated for realism, prioritizing strategic concerns over other considerations. Kissinger and President Nixon engaged in secret meetings to lay the groundwork for establishing diplomatic relations with China, hoping to leverage it against the USSR. Kissinger also supported Pakistan during the 1971 war with Bangladesh, while expressing contempt for then-Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Indians in general. The Vietnam War saw Kissinger's initial support for US involvement, including approving bombing raids in Cambodia. Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize for the Paris Peace Accords, the deal fell apart soon after being signed. Kissinger also played a role in aiding Israel in the Middle East, contributing to the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979.</description>

			<title>How Napoleon’s failed Egypt expedition gave birth to Egyptology</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/napoleon-egypt-expedition-egyptology-9044694/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the inaccuracies in Ridley Scott's film, which depicts Napoleon firing cannons at the pyramids of Giza. Historically, there is no evidence to support this claim, and scholars believe Napoleon held the pyramids and the Sphinx in high esteem. The French campaign in Egypt from 1798 to 1801 was primarily driven by Napoleon's colonial ambitions and a desire to prevent British influence in the region. Despite initial successes, the French operation eventually faltered, and Napoleon himself fled the country in 1799. However, his campaign had a lasting impact on Egyptology, as he brought around 160 scholars to document and understand Egypt. Their works, such as Dominique-Vivant Denon's Travels in Lower and Upper Egypt, provided detailed descriptions and illustrations of Egyptian monuments. The Description of Egypt, a 22-part publication, further contributed to the study of Egyptology. Napoleon's expedition also sparked a demand for Egyptian antiquities in Europe, leading to the seizure of artifacts from ancient Egyptian locations. Today, efforts are being made to repatriate these artifacts, but the illegal smuggling of relics remains a concern, with an estimated $3 billion worth of artifacts smuggled out of Egypt following the 2011 revolution.</description>

			<title>What is rat-hole mining, being done to rescue trapped Uttarkashi tunnel workers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rat-hole-mining-uttarkashi-tunnel-explained-9044515/</link>
			<description>Efforts to rescue 41 workers trapped in the collapsed Silkyara-Barkot tunnel faced another setback as the auger joint of the drilling machine broke. Rescuers spent two days removing a blade stuck inside the pipes. However, due to large metal pieces hindering the drilling, they now plan to use rat-hole mining to drill through the remaining debris. Parsadi Lodhi, a rat hole miner, will enter the pipes with hand-held tools to clear the exit. Vipin Rajput, another miner, will also assist. Rat-hole mining is a method used to extract coal from narrow seams and involves digging small pits into the ground. It is known for its safety and environmental hazards, including lack of regulations, land degradation, and water pollution. The practice was banned by the National Green Tribunal in 2014 and 2015 due to accidents and fatalities.</description>

			<title>Guru Nanak Jayanti: 5 things to know about Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/guru-nanak-jayanti-2023-life-9044213/</link>
			<description>This article is about Guru Nanak Jayanti, which celebrates the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. It highlights five key aspects of his life and teachings.

Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in Nankana Sahib, now part of Pakistan. From a young age, he showed an interest in philosophical questions about life and religion. He worked as an accountant before joining a Muslim minstrel named Mardana. Together, they sang hymns and provided food for people.

At the age of 30, Guru Nanak had a spiritual experience while bathing in a river. He described it as communion with God, who charged him with a mission to spread prayer and teach mankind. He disappeared for three days and nights and then reappeared, proclaiming, "There is no Hindu, there is no Mussalman."

Guru Nanak embarked on foot journeys, known as udaasis, to spread his teachings across different regions, including Sri Lanka, Baghdad, and Mecca. He engaged with people from various communities, preaching the concept of Oneness of God.

During his visit to Mecca, Guru Nanak unintentionally slept with his feet towards the holy Kaaba, which was considered disrespectful. When questioned about it, he replied that they should turn his feet towards a direction where there is no God or Kaaba.

Guru Nanak established a routine for his disciples in Kartarpur, involving early morning prayers, hymn-singing, and community service called sewa. In choosing his successor, he selected Lehna, renaming him Guru Angad, as his own sons were not interested in spirituality.

Guru Nanak passed away in 1539. A notable incident occurred during his funeral, where both Hindus and Muslims wanted to perform their respective rituals. Guru Nanak suggested placing flowers on both sides, and the next day, the flowers remained fresh for both communities, signifying harmony.

Overall, Guru Nanak's teachings emphasized the unity of God and the importance of spiritual devotion, service to others, and respect for all religions. His legacy continues to inspire Sikhs worldwide.</description>

			<title>Producing more from less: How Indian agriculture has grown with limited ‘factors of production’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/agriculture-production-india-factors-boost-explained-9044040/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the importance of technology in agriculture and its impact on productivity. The author identifies four factors of production in agriculture: land, water, labor, and energy. They explain that historically, agricultural production was limited by the availability and quality of land. However, with advancements in technology, the focus has shifted to the factors of technology.

The article highlights four factors of technology in agriculture: genetics, crop nutrition, crop protection, and agronomic interventions. Genetics refers to the development of high-yielding crop varieties through plant breeding. Crop nutrition has evolved through the use of chemical fertilizers with higher nutrient content, leading to increased crop yields. Crop protection involves the use of chemicals to protect plants from pests, diseases, and weeds. Lastly, agronomic interventions include mechanization and other techniques such as drip irrigation and intercropping.

The author emphasizes that these technological advancements have led to higher productivity in agriculture. Farmers are now able to achieve more output from the same or even fewer inputs, resulting in increased crop yield per acre, per worker, and per unit of water. The growth of agricultural production in recent years has been primarily driven by these technological factors rather than traditional factors of production.

Overall, the article highlights the transformative role of technology in agriculture and its ability to improve productivity and efficiency in the sector.</description>

			<title>Stampede at Kochi college kills 4: What went wrong and why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/stampede-at-kochi-college-kills-4-what-went-wrong-and-why-9043340/</link>
			<description>I'm sorry to hear about the tragic incident at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). During the annual technical festival, Dhishna, a stampede occurred at the entrance to the open-air auditorium where a musical show was scheduled to take place. The crowd outside the gate grew impatient, and when the gate was suddenly opened, students who were standing or walking down the stairs fell due to the push from the crowd behind. This resulted in multiple injuries and unfortunate loss of lives. The authorities believe that the delay in allowing entry for students and the steep stairs contributed to the tragedy. The government has ordered investigations into the incident and is planning to revise existing norms for the conduct of events attended by large crowds. CUSAT is a premier educational institution in Kerala, offering various courses in advanced research.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘Constitution is not a mere lawyers’ document… its spirit is always the spirit of Age’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-ambedkar-consitution-day-living-document-9043254/</link>
			<description>On November 26, President Droupadi Murmu commemorated Constitution Day by unveiling a statue of Dr. BR Ambedkar at the Supreme Court in New Delhi. Ambedkar played a crucial role as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of India, which was adopted on this day in 1949 and came into effect on January 26, 1950.

Ambedkar's statement, "Constitution is not a mere lawyers’ document, it is a vehicle of Life, and its spirit is always the spirit of Age," signifies the significance of the Constitution beyond legalities. This article explains the process by which the Constitution was adopted and highlights Ambedkar's pioneering role in ensuring its relevance for future generations.

The Constituent Assembly responsible for drafting the Constitution held its first session on December 9, 1946, with 389 members. The assembly took over three years to draft the constitution, spending more than 114 days deliberating its content. During this time, fundamental issues such as the language of government business, citizenship, and the country's name were debated.

Ambedkar chaired the Drafting Committee, one of the 17 committees of the Constituent Assembly. Among the numerous amendments proposed, around 2,400 were discarded during the committee's discussions. Ambedkar played a crucial role in these debates, ensuring diverse perspectives were considered to reach common conclusions.

One debate concerned the nature of the Constitution and how amendments would be made in the future. Some argued that making amendments difficult would lead to an obsolete Constitution, while others believed easy amendments would undermine states' interests. Ambedkar cited examples from other countries to argue that no constitution allows amendments by a simple majority alone.

In India's case, Ambedkar suggested three options for amendment procedures: some articles amendable by a simple parliamentary majority, others requiring a two-thirds majority, and a few needing two-thirds majority and ratification by half the states. The choice depended on whether the articles related to the Centre, states, or both.

Ambedkar emphasized that a Constitution aims not only to create state organs but also to limit their authority to avoid tyranny and oppression. Without limitations, chaos would ensue as the legislature could pass any law, the executive could make any decision, and the Supreme Court could interpret laws freely.</description>

			<title>Kambala comes to Bengaluru: How buffalo race’s popularity outran bans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/bengaluru-kambala-races-karnataka-explained-9042992/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the first Kambala race held in Bengaluru, India. Kambala is a traditional folk sport popular in coastal Karnataka districts. It involves racing pairs of buffaloes through specially made slush tracks. The Karnataka government amended legislation to allow the races to continue despite previous bans by the Supreme Court. The event attracted a large crowd, and it holds significance for families, particularly from the Bunt community.

Kambala is conducted under four categories: Negilu (plough), Hagga (rope), Adda Halage (jockeys on a horizontal plank dragged by buffaloes), and Kane Halage (wooden plank with water splashing determining the winner). While the popularity of Kambala is mainly limited to coastal areas, recent movies have increased interest in this folk sport across Karnataka.

The ban on Kambala, along with Jallikattu and bullock cart racing, was due to concerns about animal cruelty. Complaints included tying the buffaloes' noses with ropes and continuously whipping them during the race. However, in 2016, an exception was made for these events, subject to conditions aimed at reducing animal suffering. State governments, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra, also amended relevant laws to provide exemptions.

Critics argue that Kambala has been associated with caste discrimination. Historically, members of the Koraga community, considered "untouchable," were mistreated and sometimes forced to participate in the races instead of buffaloes. Today, it is asserted that dominant caste groups control the sport while individuals from lower-caste backgrounds end up performing menial tasks during the event.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand tunnel rescue: What is an auger machine, what went wrong, and what’s next?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/tunnel-rescue-what-is-an-auger-machine-what-went-wrong-and-whats-next-9042553/</link>
			<description>The operation to rescue 41 men trapped in the Uttarkashi tunnel encountered a setback when the auger joint of the drilling machine broke, blocking the passage. The article explains that horizontal auger machines are specialized tools used to create underground tunnels without disturbing the surface. These machines consist of a rotating helical screw blade called an auger, which cuts through materials underground. Hydraulic or mechanical systems power the rotation of the auger.

In the Silkyara-Barkot tunnel rescue operation, heavy excavators initially failed to remove the debris blocking the tunnel exit. Rescuers then decided to use an auger machine to create a passage through the debris with minimal surface disturbance. They pushed mild steel pipes along with the auger blade to maintain the passage, planning to retrieve the blade once it was complete.

The article mentions the American Auger 60-12000, a large and powerful horizontal directional drilling (HDD) machine being used in the operation. This machine is designed for heavy-duty drilling and can handle larger-scale projects that require the installation of bigger pipes or utilities underground.

However, the operation faced hurdles when a new obstruction was encountered. Attempts to pull out the machine revealed that the tip of the blade was stuck, and an auger joint broke while trying to remove it. Around 32 meters of the auger blade is now blocking the pipes, requiring rescuers to enter and manually cut it piece by piece. Gas cutters have been used to remove around 20 meters of the machine, and a plasma cutter from Hyderabad is expected to arrive at the site to speed up the cutting process.

Once the broken auger blade is removed, new blades will be used in its place.</description>

			<title>Four convicted for murder of Soumya Vishwanathan get life term: What was the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/soumya-vishwanathan-murder-case-9042456/</link>
			<description>I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to summarize articles or provide real-time updates on specific cases. My purpose is to assist with general information and answer questions to the best of my abilities based on the provided text. If you have any other questions related to Chatbase or any other topic, feel free to ask!A Delhi court has convicted four men for the murder of journalist Soumya Vishwanathan, who was killed 15 years ago. The court sentenced them to life imprisonment, while a fifth convict received a three-year jail term. The judge rejected the request for the death penalty, stating that the crime did not fall under the "rarest of rare" category. Soumya's mother expressed satisfaction with the ruling but not happiness, as her husband is currently in the ICU following a bypass surgery.

The incident occurred in September 2008 when Soumya, a journalist with India Today, was chased by robbers in a WagonR car and shot in the head. Six months passed without any breakthroughs in the case, as there were no CCTV cameras in the area, and witnesses couldn't identify the car's registration number. Three men who were arrested in connection with another robbery-murder case later confessed to their involvement in Soumya's murder during interrogation.

Police found evidence linking the arrested men to Soumya's killing, including the bullet matching the weapon recovered from them and the WagonR used in the crime. It was discovered that the men were serial offenders, targeting taxi drivers and women alone at night. In 2011, charges were introduced against them under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) to prevent them from receiving bail and threatening witnesses. After years of trial, the court finally pronounced the four men guilty of murder and organized crime, while the fifth convict was found guilty of receiving stolen property and conspiring to abet organized crime under the MCOCA.</description>

			<title>15 years of 26/11: 3 ways in which India’s strategy game has played out since Mumbai attacks</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/15-years-of-26-11-strategy-diplomacy-9042317/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks on India's strategy and relationships in the world. The attacks, carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives, were a turning point for India. Prior to this, India had been dealing with terrorism for decades but struggled to gain international recognition and support for its concerns. However, the global nature of the Mumbai attacks, with victims from multiple countries including the US, brought attention to the threat of terrorism from South Asia and Pakistan's involvement.

The article highlights that India was able to provide evidence of Pakistan's role in plotting and perpetrating terrorist attacks, which shifted international perception. It also mentions how the attacks occurred shortly after the Indo-US nuclear deal, which further strengthened India's alignment with Western countries. The author references various books by diplomats and historians to support these points.

Furthermore, the article notes that the attacks impacted Pakistan's relationship with the Bush administration, losing their sympathy and support. The trust deficit widened with incidents like the Abbottabad raid, reinforcing the idea that Pakistan was not being transparent or cooperative.

Regarding India's response, the article explains that the government chose restraint instead of immediate military action against Pakistan. This decision aimed to garner international cooperation and isolate Pakistan. It mentions how India received increased cooperation from Saudi Arabia, Persian Gulf countries, and even China in countering terrorist groups like LeT.

Lastly, the article acknowledges the strategic shift under the Modi government, where subsequent actions like surgical strikes in 2016 and the Balakot air strike in 2019 faced less international criticism due to India's previous display of restraint in 2008.

Overall, the article highlights the significant impact of the Mumbai terror attacks on India's strategy, international relationships, and the global perception of Pakistan's involvement in terrorism.</description>

			<title>15 years of 26/11: How Mumbai terror attacks changed India’s security infrastructure</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/15-years-of-26-11-how-mumbai-terror-attacks-changed-indias-security-infrastructure-9042075/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai on India's security concerns and the measures taken by the Indian government in response. The attacks exposed vulnerabilities in India's maritime and internal security, as well as its counter-terrorism infrastructure and local police. To address these issues, the government tightened maritime security, fixed loopholes in the intelligence grid, strengthened the legal framework against terrorism, and created special agencies to investigate terror cases.

The Indian navy was given charge of maritime security, while the Indian Coast Guard took responsibility for territorial waters and coordinated with new marine police stations along the coastline. It became mandatory for vessels longer than 20 meters to have an Automatic Identification System (AIS) for transmitting identification and other information. The Intelligence Bureau's Multi Agency Centre (MAC) was also strengthened to enhance intelligence exchange and coordination among central agencies, armed forces, and state police.

The article highlights that the definition of terrorism was expanded under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act was passed to establish a federal investigation agency. These changes were driven by public opinion and the pressure to address terrorism effectively. However, the proposed National Counter Terrorism Centre could not be implemented due to concerns about violating the existing federal structure of policing.

The focus on modernization of state police forces and allocation of more funds aimed to equip them with advanced technology, training, and better weapons. Crack commando teams were established within police forces, and four regional hubs of the National Security Guard (NSG) were set up across the country.

The 26/11 attacks also led to increased cooperation between the West and India on security matters. The US provided real-time information and prosecutable evidence during the attacks, including the arrest of David Coleman Headley, who conducted reconnaissance for the attacks. This cooperation helped expose Pakistan's involvement and isolate it internationally. India gained support from Saudi Arabia, Persian Gulf countries, and China in countering groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT).

However, the article highlights remaining gaps in India's security grid, with state police forces still ill-equipped, poorly trained, and subject to political interference. There are also challenges in tracking ships that do not transmit AIS signals, particularly smaller fishing vessels without transponders.

Overall, the 26/11 attacks prompted significant changes and improvements in India's security apparatus, but there is still work to be done to address the remaining vulnerabilities.</description>

			<title>China pneumonia outbreak: Here’s everything we know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/mysterious-pneumonia-outbreak-in-china-all-you-need-to-know-9042007/</link>
			<description>China is experiencing a surge in respiratory illnesses as it enters its first full winter season after lifting Covid-19 restrictions. The spike in reported cases of respiratory illnesses has resulted in a high number of hospitalizations, particularly in Beijing and Liaoning. Children are the most affected group, while the elderly and pregnant women may also be vulnerable. Chinese authorities attribute the increase in cases to known pathogens such as influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. This outbreak is not considered a new disease like Covid-19. Experts believe the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and the onset of winter are contributing factors. Authorities have urged the public to take precautionary measures, although people in China seem relatively calm about the situation. Chinese authorities expect the influenza peak to continue throughout the winter and spring, with mycoplasma pneumoniae remaining a concern. Although the outbreak is currently contained, vigilance is necessary, and vaccines and medicines are likely to be available if needed. It is emphasized that the world is better equipped now to handle infectious diseases due to the experience gained from the global pandemic.</description>

			<title>Does the Indian judiciary have a ‘patriarchy problem’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/indian-judiciary-fathima-beevi-women-justices-9041769/</link>
			<description>Justice Fathima Beevi, the first Indian woman to become a Supreme Court judge, has passed away at the age of 96. She was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1989, becoming the first Muslim woman judge of the Supreme Court and the first woman Supreme Court Justice in Asia. Despite acknowledging the patriarchal nature of the judiciary, she believed that her appointment paved the way for other women.

Since 1989, only 10 women have been appointed as Supreme Court judges. Currently, out of the 33 Supreme Court judges, only three are female. However, in 2021, the appointments of Justices Hima Kohli, Bela Trivedi, and BV Nagarathna made history by having four female judges serving simultaneously, the highest number so far. In total, there have been only 11 women judges out of the 268 judges in the Supreme Court's history, accounting for just 4.1% of all judges.

The situation in High Courts is not much better. Out of 1,114 sanctioned judges, only 782 are currently working, and among them, only 107 judges are female, constituting only 13% of the total. None of the country's 25 High Courts have a female Chief Justice, except for the Gujarat High Court, where Justice Sunita Agarwal was appointed due to the absence of any female Chief Justices.

The representation of women in the lower judiciary is relatively higher at 27%. However, there is still a glass ceiling when it comes to higher appointments such as district judges and high court judges. A study found that the percentage of women judges in the lower judiciary remains below 40%, except for a few states that have implemented quotas for women.

The lack of female representation in the judiciary can be attributed to factors such as an entrenched "old boys' club mentality," sexual harassment, lack of trust from clients, and inadequate supportive infrastructure. The lower judiciary has better representation compared to the High Court and Supreme Court, possibly because entry is through an examination rather than informal channels used in higher courts.

Despite efforts to improve gender diversity, there are still challenges in appointing more women judges. Some women advocates have declined offers due to domestic responsibilities, while others argue that men who refuse judgeship due to financial reasons have not hindered the collegium from appointing more male judges.</description>

			<title>How gene therapy will revolutionise treatment of sickle cell disease</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/sickle-cell-breakthrough-9041297/</link>
			<description>The UK drug regulator has approved a groundbreaking gene therapy called Casgevy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and thalassaemia. This therapy, based on the Nobel Prize-winning gene editing technology Crispr-Cas9, is the first licensed therapy of its kind in the world. Casgevy works by editing the faulty gene responsible for these blood disorders, potentially providing a lifelong cure. Previously, the only permanent treatment option was a bone marrow transplant, which required finding a closely matched donor.

Both sickle cell disease and thalassaemia are caused by errors in the gene for haemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Casgevy uses the patient's own blood stem cells and targets a gene called BCL11A, crucial for the switch from foetal to adult haemoglobin. By increasing the production of foetal haemoglobin, which lacks the abnormalities found in adult haemoglobin, Casgevy alleviates the symptoms of these conditions.

Sickle cell disease causes red blood cells to take on a crescent shape, hampering their movement through blood vessels and leading to blocked blood flow, severe pain, infections, anaemia, and strokes. In India alone, an estimated 30,000-40,000 children are born with this disorder annually. Thalassaemia, on the other hand, results in low levels of haemoglobin, causing fatigue, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeats, and the need for lifelong blood transfusions.

In clinical trials, Casgevy showed promising results. For sickle cell disease, 29 out of 45 patients experienced no severe pain crises for at least 12 months after treatment. In thalassaemia, 39 out of 42 patients did not require transfusion for the same duration, while the need for transfusion decreased by 70% in the remaining three patients.

Administering Casgevy involves collecting blood stem cells through apheresis, editing and testing them over a six-month period, and then performing a transplant to replace the patient's bone marrow. The patient typically stays in the hospital for at least a month to ensure successful integration of the edited cells.

Although the price of Casgevy has not been disclosed, it is expected to be high, possibly reaching $2 million per patient. This cost, along with the absence of local manufacturing facilities, poses challenges to widespread access, particularly in poorer countries. However, experts believe that as more research is conducted and local manufacturing becomes available, the prices of gene therapies are likely to decrease.

Overall, the approval of Casgevy represents a significant milestone in gene therapy, offering hope for patients with sickle cell disease and thalassaemia.</description>

			<title>‘Hell on Earth’: What is the humanitarian situation in Gaza?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hell-on-earth-what-humanitarian-situation-gaza-9041069/</link>
			<description>A four-day humanitarian pause in the conflict in Gaza has begun, providing an opportunity for aid agencies to increase deliveries to the besieged enclave. Food, fuel, drinking water, and medicine shortages have worsened in recent weeks, leading United Nations agencies to warn of potential mass disease outbreaks. Over 1.7 million people out of Gaza's population of 2.3 million are estimated to be internally displaced. Shelters run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency are overcrowded, with many civilians seeking refuge from Israeli bombardments. Hospitals in northern Gaza are not functioning normally due to ongoing attacks and fuel shortages. Only eight out of eleven facilities in the south remain operational, and only one can perform complex surgeries. The World Health Organization has reported a significant rise in premature births due to stress and trauma among pregnant mothers. While some aid supplies have entered through the Rafah crossing, all other crossings into Gaza remain closed. Fresh fuel deliveries have allowed some water wells and pumping stations in the south to resume operations, but the north is facing dehydration concerns as the water desalination plant and Israeli pipeline supplying water are not functional. Wastewater treatment plants are also not operating at full capacity, leading to sewage overflow in certain areas. Israel has allowed a limited amount of fuel to enter Gaza from Egypt, which is being distributed by the UNRWA to support critical services such as food distribution, hospitals, and sanitation facilities.</description>

			<title>OpenAI saga: Sam Altman’s firing, return, and future</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/openai-sam-altman-return-9041014/</link>
			<description>Sam Altman has been reinstated as the CEO of OpenAI after a five-day period of turmoil at the company. Altman was initially ousted by the board of directors, but an agreement between him and the company led to his return. The incident highlighted the ongoing debate about the deployment of AI and could signify a shift in OpenAI's focus towards rapid commercialization, potentially giving more influence to investors like Microsoft.

Altman's dismissal came after accusations of lack of transparency with the board. Greg Brockman, the president and co-founder, also lost his board seat and subsequently resigned in solidarity. This led to an uproar among OpenAI employees, with almost all 800 signing an open letter threatening to quit and follow Altman to Microsoft unless the board members who dismissed him were removed.

OpenAI later announced Altman's return and a reshuffling of the board. Three board members were removed, leaving only one holdover. Two new members were added, and the board might expand further. The ousting of Altman stemmed from a growing rift between him and other board members, including concerns about the potential risks of OpenAI's technology to society.

One specific issue involved Altman's disagreement with Helen Toner over her research paper that compared OpenAI's safety approach with rival company Anthropic. Altman tried to push out Toner but ended up being ousted himself when other board members joined forces against him. The board members also failed to agree on candidates to fill vacant seats, adding to the internal tensions.

The reshuffling of the board suggests a shift towards maximizing the commercial potential of AI at OpenAI. New board members may be more aligned with Altman's ambitions in this regard. OpenAI is expected to focus on developing its most powerful model, GPT-5, and face increasing competition from companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Anthropic. However, experts express concerns about the release of AI products without full understanding of their behavior, uses, and misuses, which could necessitate stricter regulation.

The safety concerns surrounding AI may prompt politicians to take regulatory measures. In the US, President Joe Biden recently signed an executive order requiring leading AI developers to share safety test results and other information with the government.</description>

			<title>Streaming HD videos from space? Why a NASA spacecraft fired a laser at Earth</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-spacecraft-laser-dsoc-9040533/</link>
			<description>NASA's Psyche spacecraft, en route to a metal-rich asteroid between Mars and Jupiter, has successfully fired a laser signal back to Earth. This asteroid is believed to be the core of an early planet, providing insight into our own planet's iron core. Additionally, the spacecraft is testing a revolutionary technology called Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC), which uses near-infrared laser signals for communication. This technology allows for data rates at least 10 times higher than current radio systems, enabling higher resolution images and streaming video. DSOC requires extremely precise pointing and compensates for the changing positions of Earth and the spacecraft. The successful implementation of DSOC could revolutionize communication in deep space, paving the way for future space exploration missions.</description>

			<title>Here’s what we know about the Israel-Hamas deal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-deal-details-explained-9040474/</link>
			<description>A temporary cease-fire agreement is expected to take effect between Israel and Hamas, mediated in part by Qatar. The deal involves a four-day pause in hostilities and an exchange of hostages and prisoners. Approximately 50 women and children abducted by Israeli officials on October 7 will be exchanged for 150 Palestinian women and minors imprisoned in Israeli jails. The specifics of the increased humanitarian aid from Qatar are unknown. During the pause, Israeli warplanes will not fly over southern Gaza, and there will be a six-hour daily restriction on flying over the northern part of the territory. The cease-fire is scheduled to start at 7 a.m. Gaza time on Friday, with the release of 13 hostages at 4 p.m. Each day, Israel and Hamas will exchange lists of hostages and prisoners through Qatar, with the International Committee of the Red Cross designated to receive the hostages. The hostages released by Hamas will be taken to hospitals, and their families will meet them there. Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli prisons will be transported by bus to their home districts. The Israeli government published a list of 300 names of Palestinians being considered for release, all of whom are described as "security prisoners." The list includes 32 women and girls, along with boys aged 14 to 18. It is unclear who among them will be released. Additionally, three Americans (two women and a toddler) are also expected to be released.</description>

			<title>How farm fires are counted, why the data has some limitations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-farm-fires-are-counted-punjab-stubble-burning-9040003/</link>
			<description>The farm fire season in the national capital is coming to an end, sparking debates about its contribution to pollution levels. Between September 15 and November 23, a total of 55,725 farm fires were recorded across six states in India. Punjab had the highest number of fires, with 36,323 recorded, including a single-day count of 3,230 on November 5. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute's (IARI) Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory collects data on paddy residue fires. They use three NASA satellites equipped with sensors to record land surface temperatures and identify paddy crop residue fires. The data is then processed and shared with various government agencies to help them take appropriate measures. However, limitations include the number of satellites available and weather conditions affecting data collection.</description>

			<title>How the Gulf is planning for a life after oil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/gulf-countries-after-oil-9039812/</link>
			<description>Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are embracing renewable energy and building large-scale renewable power plants to meet their emissions targets. This shift is driven not only by environmental concerns but also by the desire to maximize profits by freeing up fossil fuel reserves for export. The region's dependence on oil revenues poses a dilemma since burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change, which disproportionately affects the Gulf. To address this, the region is exploring carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, although its efficacy remains limited, with less than 0.1% of global emissions currently being captured. The annual UN climate summit, to be held in the UAE, will discuss CCS extensively. However, some nations, including the European Union, oppose focusing on abatement technologies and instead advocate for phasing out fossil fuels. Aware that reduced demand for oil may deplete their coffers in 15 years, Gulf countries are seeking alternative revenue streams. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are investing in green hydrogen production and renewable-powered commodity industries. Exporting solar power is also seen as an economic opportunity. Some states, like Oman, have ambitious plans to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by diversifying their economies through tourism, logistics, and manufacturing. Overall, the Gulf's transition to renewables relies on leveraging fossil fuel reserves to fund the shift, a paradox noted by environmentalists and human rights activists.</description>

			<title>What far right Islamophobe Geert Wilders’ surprise election success means for the Netherlands — and the rest of Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/geert-wilders-netherlands-election-far-right-9039421/</link>
			<description>Geert Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, has emerged as a strong contender to become the next prime minister. In the recent general elections, PVV secured 37 seats, making it the largest party in the 150-seat Dutch parliament. Wilders' success has surprised many and sent shockwaves across Europe, where far-right populist movements have been gaining momentum.

Wilders is known for his anti-immigration, anti-Islam, and anti-European Union stance. He has been a career politician since 1998 and founded PVV in 2006 after leaving the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). His controversial views on immigration from Muslim countries and his opposition to Islam have drawn attention both nationally and internationally.

The election campaign was largely centered around the issue of restricting asylum-seekers, which resonated with Wilders' message. He called for a halt to accepting asylum-seekers and advocated for stricter border control. Additionally, he has criticized the European Union and supported the idea of a Brexit-like referendum in the Netherlands.

Despite his hardline positions, Wilders has recently attempted to soften his rhetoric on Islam to appeal to potential coalition partners. The formation of a government requires the support of at least 76 MPs, and some parties have already ruled out working with Wilders. Coalition talks are ongoing, but incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to remain as caretaker PM until a government is formed.

Wilders' victory reflects the broader trend of populist and far-right parties gaining traction in European elections. Leaders such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and France's Marine Le Pen have praised Wilders' success, highlighting the growing discontent with the current state of the European Union and immigration policies.

As the Netherlands is often considered a bellwether for Europe, Wilders' rise to power raises questions about the future direction of the continent and its response to immigration and EU integration.</description>

			<title>25 years of the International Space Station: Why it was launched, what it does</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/25-years-international-space-station-9039051/</link>
			<description>The International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth 16 times a day and is often overlooked despite its scientific significance. It has been a hub for international collaboration and diplomacy for the past 25 years. The ISS was established with the launch of the Russian Zarya Control Module in November 1998, followed by the US Unity Node 1 module a month later. It has undergone 42 assembly flights to become what it is today and has been continuously inhabited since its inception.

The ISS consists of various living and working areas, including sleeping quarters, bathrooms, a gym, and a bay window with a 360-degree view. Its dimensions are impressive, measuring 109 meters end-to-end, comparable to an American football field or more than twice the length of an Olympic swimming pool. The solar array wingspan matches its overall length, while approximately 13 kilometers of electrical wires run through the station.

In addition to conducting scientific experiments that cannot be done on Earth, astronauts on the ISS perform regular spacewalks to install new components and conduct maintenance. They also follow a strict health regimen to counteract the negative impacts of microgravity, such as muscle and bone loss. Understanding how humans adapt to long-term space habitation is crucial, especially for future missions to the moon or Mars.

Numerous scientific experiments have been conducted on the ISS, some focusing on the astronauts themselves and others benefiting researchers on Earth. These experiments have led to breakthroughs in various fields, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, asthma, heart disease, drug development, water purification, and food production.

However, the future of the ISS became uncertain due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Several countries, including Russia itself, expressed intentions to develop their own independent space stations. Despite this, the US and Europe remain committed to the ISS until 2030, while NASA focuses on the Artemis program for lunar exploration, and the European Space Agency (ESA) works towards building a new space station called Starlab.

The future of space exploration continues to evolve, with various nations striving to make independent strides in this domain. The phrase "watch this space" takes on new significance as plans for the post-ISS era unfold.</description>

			<title>What is the new Investor Risk Reduction Access platform, and how it stands to benefit investors</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/investor-risk-reduction-access-platform-explained-9038876/</link>
			<description>The Investor Risk Reduction Access (IRRA) platform has been launched by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to provide a safety net for investors in case of technical glitches faced by trading members or stock brokers registered with SEBI. Developed jointly by all the major stock exchanges in India, including BSE, NSE, NCDEX, MCX, and MSE, the platform allows investors to close open positions and cancel pending orders in the event of disruption at the stock brokers' end.

The purpose of IRRA is to reduce risks for investors during technical glitches or unforeseen outages that make the trading member's site inaccessible. It offers investors the opportunity to square off/close their open positions and cancel pending orders using the platform. However, it is important to note that IRRA is not intended for taking fresh positions or orders; its sole function is to cancel pending orders.

The need for IRRA arose due to increasing reliance on technology in the securities market, which has led to an increase in trading system glitches and disruptions. In such instances, investors with open positions are at risk of not being able to close their positions if the markets are volatile and the trading member's systems are affected. To address this issue, SEBI announced the provision of a contingency service by stock exchanges in the event of such disruptions.

The IRRA platform can be invoked by trading members when they face technical glitches impacting their ability to serve clients across exchanges. It enables investors to view and cancel pending orders, close open positions, and cancel orders across segments and exchanges. The platform can be accessed through a secure login system using a Unique Client Code (UCC) or investor's PAN number, along with a one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered mobile numbers and email IDs for authorization.

To migrate to the IRRA platform, trading members need to restore their primary and disaster recovery sites before requesting the stock exchanges. Once the issue is fixed and sufficient testing is performed, the trading member can inform the exchanges to resume business from the original trading system. Reverse migration from IRRA to the trading member is only allowed once during a trading day.

Overall, the IRRA platform aims to provide a safety net for investors in case of technical glitches or disruptions faced by trading members, allowing them to manage their positions effectively and reduce potential risks.</description>

			<title>A political history of Rajasthan: A Congress-BJP revolving door</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/a-political-history-of-rajasthan-a-congress-bjp-revolving-door-9038524/</link>
			<description>Rajasthan, the largest state in India, has a history of stable governments with only three Chief Ministers in the last 33 years. The state has never witnessed a government collapse and power has consistently alternated between the Congress and the BJP since 1993. The state legislature consists of 200 seats, with reserved seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Assembly elections have often resulted in a near majority for one party, but the largest party has always managed to form a government by gathering support from other parties.

The Congress and BJP are the dominant parties in Rajasthan, with no other party ruling the state. However, there have been occasional emerging political forces that eventually merged with either Congress or BJP. Over the years, both parties have had significant victories in different elections, with the BJP's best performance being in 2013 when they won 163 out of 200 seats.

The state has witnessed the dismissal of elected governments three times by the central government. In 1977, the Morarji Desai government dismissed the Congress government in Rajasthan. The Chief Minister, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, was also sacked twice - once in 1980 by Indira Gandhi and again in 1992 by P V Narasimha Rao after the demolition of the Babri Masjid.

The political landscape in Rajasthan has seen influential leaders from various parties, including L K Advani, Sundar Singh Bhandari, Satish Agarwal, Jaswant Singh, and Ramdas Agrawal. While the state has occasionally seen the rise of third political forces, they have usually disappeared or merged with one of the major parties.

Elections in Rajasthan primarily revolve around the Congress and the BJP, with Ashok Gehlot and Vasundhara Raje as their respective prominent faces. Gehlot, an OBC Mali, has been a strong leader for the Congress, while Vasundhara Raje, who assumed office in 2003, remains the prominent leader for the BJP in the state. However, she has been sidelined in recent years.

The longest-serving Chief Minister in Rajasthan has been Sukhadia of the Congress, followed by Gehlot, Shekhawat, and Vasundhara. The state has seen leaders from various communities, including Brahmins, Vaishyas, Kayasthas, Muslims, and Rajputs, but no Jat or ST leader has become Chief Minister yet.

Overall, Rajasthan has a history of stable governments with power alternating between the Congress and the BJP. Despite occasional challenges and dismissals, the largest party has always managed to form a government by gathering support from other parties.</description>

			<title>Gujarat gets a state fish: Why ghol, the ‘fisherman’s lottery’, was chosen</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gujarat-state-fish-why-ghol-was-chosen-9038275/</link>
			<description>The black-spotted croaker, also known as the ghol fish, has been declared the state fish of Gujarat. The decision was made by the government based on its economic value and uniqueness. The ghol fish is predominantly found in the Indo-Pacific region, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Pacific Ocean. By declaring it the state fish, Gujarat aims to contribute to its conservation efforts. The selection process involved consultations with representatives from all districts, considering other species like ribbon fish, pomfret, and Bombay Duck. While the local consumption of ghol fish is not widespread, it has a significant market in China and other countries. It is considered a delicacy in many places and is used for medicinal purposes in others. The meat of the fish is exported to European and Middle-Eastern countries, while the dried air bladder is in high demand in Asian countries. A kilogram of ghol fish can fetch substantial prices, with the dried air bladder being the costliest. Gujarat's total fish production in 2021-22 was estimated at 8.74 lakh tons, worth Rs 11,221 crore, of which 2.3 lakh tons were exported, valued at Rs 5,233 crore.</description>

			<title>Who is Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the alleged target of a planned hit job in the US?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gurpatawant-singh-pannun-sikhs-for-justice-9038111/</link>
			<description>The article reports that the United States government uncovered a plot to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the leader of the Khalistani separatist organization Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), on American soil. The US government also issued a warning to the Indian government regarding their potential involvement in the conspiracy. It is unclear whether the US protest prompted the plotters to abandon their plan or if the FBI intervened to foil an already underway scheme. US federal prosecutors have filed a sealed indictment against at least one perpetrator in a New York district court.

Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in his mid to late 40s, hails from Khankot village near Amritsar and is an attorney in the US. He is known as the founder and leader of SFJ, which aims to achieve self-determination for Sikhs in the Indian-held Punjab region and establish a sovereign state called Khalistan. Pannun advocates for a peaceful approach, with the motto "ballots not bullets," but has been criticized for his ties to terrorists and controversial activities.

The SFJ gained attention through its "Referendum 2020" campaign among the Sikh diaspora worldwide, claiming significant support. However, skeptics question the legitimacy of the referendum due to the lack of reliable rules and verification processes. Despite limited traction for the Khalistan movement in Punjab and the Sikh diaspora, Pannun and SFJ remain in the news through periodic statements against the Indian state and in support of Khalistan.

The Indian government views Pannun and SFJ as secessionist and militant entities operating from foreign safe havens. Multiple cases, including sedition charges, have been registered against Pannun and SFJ in India. In January 2021, during the farmers' agitation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) initiated an investigation into their funding sources. Pannun has been labeled a "terrorist" by the Indian government and has faced legal action under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The Home Ministry issued a notification banning SFJ, accusing them of promoting secessionism and militant ideology in Punjab with support from foreign forces.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/vir-das-emmy-awards-types-9037509/</link>
			<description>Comedian Vir Das has become the first Indian to win an International Emmy Award in the comedy category for his Netflix show, "Vir Das: Landing on Monday." He shared the award with the British series "Derry Girls" season 3. Additionally, Ekta Kapoor, a producer, filmmaker, and co-founder of Balaji Telefilms, was honored with this year's Directorate Award for her outstanding contributions to international television.

The International Emmy Awards differ from the Primetime Emmy Awards, which are considered one of the most prestigious award events in television. The article provides an overview of the various types of Emmy Awards, their history, and the organizations responsible for presenting them.

The Emmy Awards were established in 1948, with the first ceremony taking place in 1949. Initially, six awards were presented, including categories such as Most Outstanding Television Personality and Most Popular Television Program.

In addition to the International Emmy Awards and Primetime Emmy Awards, the Emmys are also given in other categories, such as daytime, sports, news and documentary, technology and engineering, and regional awards. Each category is overseen by a different organization: the Television Academy administers the Primetime Emmy Awards, the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences oversees daytime, sports, news and documentary categories, and the International Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences is responsible for International Emmys.

The article explains that the word "Emmy" doesn't stand for anything specific and was chosen because it was more "feminine." Initially, the award was planned to be named "Immy," derived from the image-orthicon camera tube used in television technology. However, it was decided to change the name to "Emmy" as the statuette depicts a winged muse representing art uplifting the electron of science.

Overall, the Emmy Awards are highly esteemed honors for television and emerging media performances, recognizing excellence in various categories and promoting both American and international shows.</description>

			<title>Humanitarian pause in Gaza: How it is not the same as a ceasefire</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/humanitarian-pause-ceasefire-9037490/</link>
			<description>Qatar has announced a four-day humanitarian pause between Israel and Hamas, facilitated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States. The pause aims to provide relief to war-torn Gaza but is not a ceasefire. A humanitarian pause is a temporary cessation of hostilities for humanitarian purposes, limited to a specific area and time period. The exact geography is unspecified, but the pause will allow the release of hostages held in Gaza and the entry of humanitarian aid convoys. In contrast, a ceasefire is a longer-term agreement to stop fighting and engage in dialogue for a political settlement. Israel opposes a ceasefire as it believes it would benefit Hamas. The humanitarian pause offers some relief but allows Israel to continue its military assault. Critics argue that it is insufficient and prolongs the suffering. Advocates of a ceasefire call for lifting the siege on Gaza and genuine negotiations for an independent Palestinian state.</description>

			<title>Have we lost the fight against climate change</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/have-we-lost-the-fight-against-climate-change-9036934/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current state of the fight against climate change and highlights several concerning findings. It notes that global temperatures on November 17 exceeded the pre-industrial baseline by more than 2 degrees Celsius for the first time, indicating a significant spike in global warming. The article emphasizes that efforts to combat climate change have been largely ineffective, leading to an increase in weather-related disasters. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by at least 43% from 2019 levels by 2030 to limit the rise in global temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.

However, the latest Emissions Gap Report reveals that emissions are actually increasing. In 2022, global emissions were over a billion tonnes higher than in 2019, with only a decline observed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meeting the 2030 target would require an average annual reduction of almost 9%, which is deemed nearly impossible. Current climate actions are projected to result in just a 2% reduction in emissions by 2030, far below the necessary level.

As temperatures continue to rise, countries must adapt to a warmer environment and deal with the consequences of climate change. Developing countries, entitled to financial assistance under the Paris Agreement, expected support from wealthier nations. However, the availability of adaptation funds has declined by almost 15% while the combined requirements of developing countries amount to at least US$215 billion annually, more than ten times the current funding.

The article also mentions the importance of addressing "Loss and Damage," referring to the financial assistance needed by countries affected by climate disasters. Although a fund was established for this purpose, it currently lacks sufficient resources. The fight against climate change relies heavily on developed countries taking the lead, both in reducing emissions and providing financial support. However, the promise of US$100 billion annually made by developed countries in 2009 appears outdated and insufficient considering the current requirements.

The article concludes that meeting emission reduction targets by 2030, aligned with global climate goals, seems highly unlikely. Daily temperatures have already exceeded pre-industrial averages on numerous occasions this year, and 2023 is projected to be the warmest year ever recorded. While technological interventions like carbon dioxide removal may offer some solutions, they are not yet mainstream or economically viable. Crossing the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold would bring challenges, such as disruptions, loss of livelihoods, and increased vulnerability for marginalized populations, although notions of human extinction or the end of life on the planet may be exaggerated.</description>

			<title>The case from Netflix’s ‘Take Care of Maya’, and the $261 million awarded in damages over it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/netflix-take-care-of-maya-jury-case-explained-9036720/</link>
			<description>A jury in Florida has awarded $261 million in damages to a family who accused Johns Hopkins Hospital of false imprisonment, battery, and medical negligence. The charges stem from allegations that the hospital prevented the family from seeing their daughter while she was admitted there. The case gained further attention when the daughter, now 17 years old, leveled additional charges of assault and sexual abuse against the hospital, leading to a criminal complaint. The family's separation from their daughter, which lasted several months, is believed to have contributed to the mother's suicide in 2017. The family's story was featured in a Netflix documentary called "Take Care of Maya." The article also provides background on the initial symptoms the daughter experienced, her treatment with ketamine, and the hospital's response. A child abuse expert concluded that the child's illness was being fabricated, leading to a shelter order that separated the child from her parents. After the mother's death, the daughter was allowed to return home, and the family sued both the hospital and a child welfare service company. The article highlights the lack of oversight on such actors and Florida's aggressive approach to identifying child abuse.</description>

			<title>How the Dutch election may buck Europe’s populist trend</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/netherlands-election-explained-9036721/</link>
			<description>The upcoming Dutch election is causing uncertainty among voters in Tilburg, with many still undecided. The election will bring a new premier as Mark Rutte steps down after serving as prime minister since 2010. The three leading parties are polling closely, allowing for various coalition possibilities in the Dutch multiparty system. Even experienced voters like Rien Vissers are unsure, torn between a center-left alliance and the Christian democratic party. Pieter Omtzigt, known for exposing a child benefits scandal, has gained attention with his new party, New Social Contract (NSC). Omtzigt's anti-establishment stance and trustworthiness have resonated with voters who see him as an alternative to the status quo. Although not a populist party, NSC represents those dissatisfied with the political establishment. Omtzigt has attracted support from the left, center-right, and far right due to his broad appeal. His prominence has contributed to a calmer tone and greater focus on content in this election season. Despite Omtzigt's success, caution is advised against generalizing it to European politics. As EU elections approach in June 2024, it remains uncertain if Omtzigt's rise can predict broader trends.</description>

			<title>November 21, 1962: Why China called ceasefire in a war it was winning against India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/why-china-ceasefire-in-1962-india-war-9036686/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ceasefire declared by China in its war with India in 1962. China's dominance in the conflict led to territorial gains, capturing Aksai Chin in the west but withdrawing behind the McMahon Line in the east. Experts attribute the war to factors such as India's "Forward Policy" and granting sanctuary to the Dalai Lama. The war ended due to China's stretched supply lines and the potential escalation of international support for India. China's decision to fight back was aimed at striking a peace with its neighbor.</description>

			<title>What is tantalum, the rare metal found in Sutlej?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/tantalum-metal-sutlej-use-9036349/</link>
			<description>Tantalum is a rare metal with the atomic number 73. It is grey, heavy, very hard, and highly corrosion-resistant. When exposed to air, it forms an oxide layer that is difficult to remove. Tantalum is ductile and has a high melting point. It was discovered in 1802 by Anders Gustaf Ekenberg, a Swedish chemist. The metal is named after the Greek mythological figure Tantalus. Tantalum is widely used in electronics and semiconductors due to its high capacitance and small size. It is also used in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, aerospace, and medical equipment. Additionally, a composite of tantalum carbide and graphite is used in high-speed machine tools.</description>

			<title>Which countries recognise Hamas as a ‘terrorist’ organisation?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/israel-countries-recognise-hamas-terrorist-list-9036186/</link>
			<description>Israel has designated Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) as a terrorist organization, emphasizing its role in the killing of hundreds of Indian civilians. The move coincides with the 15th anniversary of the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai and Israel's conflict with Hamas. Israel's Defense and Foreign Affairs ministries collaborated to expedite LeT's listing, highlighting the need for a unified global front against terrorism. This action is seen as a nudge to India to designate Hamas as a terrorist organization, as Israel seeks international support for its campaign in Gaza. Only a few jurisdictions currently designate Hamas as a terrorist group. The article also mentions the six countries and the European Union that consider Hamas a terrorist organization. Designating a group as a terrorist organization involves specific criteria and can lead to various restrictions, such as asset freezes and property takeovers.</description>

			<title>How a NASA experiment will study ‘air glow’ to understand Space weather, why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-experiment-study-air-glow-atmospheric-waves-explained-9035757/</link>
			<description>NASA is set to launch the Atmospheric Waves Experiment (AWE) to study one of the important drivers of Space weather – the Earth's weather. Space weather, like terrestrial weather, is influenced by solar flares and emissions from the Sun, as well as the prevailing matter in space. Extreme events in Earth's weather can also impact space weather, affecting satellite-based communication, radio communication, and navigation systems. Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs) are vertical waves generated by extreme weather events or disturbances in the atmosphere. AGWs play a role in space weather and their understanding is crucial for improving weather forecasts. AWE, a NASA mission mounted on the International Space Station, will study the interactions between terrestrial and space weather by measuring airglow in the upper atmosphere. It aims to understand the forces that drive space weather and their connection to terrestrial weather. AWE will provide valuable data for weather modeling and enhance our understanding of space weather.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand tunnel collapse: ‘In building Himalayan tunnels, support and monitoring key’, say experts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/experts-on-uttarakhand-tunnel-collapse-in-building-himalayan-tunnels-support-and-monitoring-key-9035350/</link>
			<description>The collapse of the Silkyara-Barkot tunnel in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand has raised questions about the support structures and monitoring during the excavation process. Experts emphasize the importance of providing adequate support to weak rock and closely monitoring the tunnel construction. Weak rock masses are common in the Himalayas, and when movement occurs between two rocks, shear zones are created. These zones can contain crushed rock that behaves differently under stress. Measures such as forepoles and rock bolts are taken to protect weak sections, depending on their length and strata. Data collected during construction will be crucial in determining the cause of the collapse.

To investigate the collapse, the Uttarakhand government has formed an expert committee consisting of representatives from various institutions. The committee aims to gather data and understand why the collapse occurred. Identification of weak zones typically occurs during geological mapping before excavation, and appropriate protection measures should be taken. Periodic monitoring is essential due to the possibility of unforeseen geological occurrences. Monitoring can be done using instrumentation and sensors to record any displacement.

Experts highlight the significance of having an escape tunnel in tunnel construction projects. The escape tunnel is excavated simultaneously with the main tunnel and provides valuable information about the geology ahead of the main tunnel. It also serves as a means of emergency exit in case of incidents like fires. Guidelines on safety practices recommend marking specific escape routes in contingency planning.

The presence of the Barkot thrust, a prominent fault, in the area may have contributed to the existence of shear zones in the tunnel. The geology report on the tunnel mentioned that rocks near the Barkot bend are weak to moderately strong and slightly to moderately weathered. Experts suggest that the collapse may have been due to a lack of necessary emergency preparedness and safety measures.</description>

			<title>What Javier Milei’s win in Argentina’s Presidential election means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-javier-mileis-election-means-for-argentina-9035348/</link>
			<description>Javier Milei, a 53-year-old libertarian and political outsider, has won the national elections in Argentina, securing 56% of the vote. Similar to former US President Donald Trump, Milei tapped into voter anger against the country's political establishment and promised a new political era. This result has been labeled a "protest vote" by experts due to Argentina's history of economic mismanagement and corruption, resulting in high inflation, a depreciating currency, rising poverty, and empty government coffers. The blame is largely placed on the left-leaning Peronists who have dominated Argentine politics since the 1940s. Milei, known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), has advocated for radical economic measures such as abolishing the central bank, reducing government spending, and dollarizing the economy. While this may provide short-term stability, it would relinquish control over monetary policy to Washington decision-makers, which is unprecedented for a country the size of Argentina. Milei is also known for his flamboyant and provocative style, having gained fame as a television personality before entering politics. He is anti-abortion, skeptical of human-driven climate change, supports looser gun laws, and has criticized Pope Francis. Despite his victory, Milei's policies have raised concerns among some voters.</description>

			<title>A brief history of OpenAI — and what led to Sam Altman’s ouster</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/history-openai-sam-altman-9035175/</link>
			<description>Microsoft has hired OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to lead a new advanced AI research team, according to an announcement by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. This comes shortly after Altman's sudden ouster from OpenAI, which surprised both employees and investors. OpenAI was established in 2015 as a non-profit organization with the goal of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity. The organization released a report in 2017 introducing Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), which gained significant attention. In 2019, OpenAI transitioned into two organizations, one for-profit and one non-profit. Despite establishing a for-profit subsidiary, OpenAI continued to prioritize its mission to control AGI development for the benefit of humanity. OpenAI made headlines with the release of ChatGPT, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, which garnered significant interest. Tensions among OpenAI's leadership ultimately led to Altman's removal, with the board having the power to decide leadership independently of investors. Following Altman's dismissal, more than 500 OpenAI employees signed an open letter calling for the board's resignation.</description>

			<title>Why have Houthis seized an India-bound ship, how this is linked to the Gaza war</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-houthis-seized-india-bound-ship-gaza-war-9035068/</link>
			<description>The Yemen rebel group Houthis has seized an Israel-linked ship bound for India, raising concerns about the ongoing Gaza conflict. The ship, Galaxy Leader, was hijacked by Houthi fighters who took all 25 crew members hostage. The Houthis had previously stated that they would attack Israel-linked ships if Israel continued its actions in Palestine. Israel has claimed that the ship is British-owned and Japanese-operated, calling the hijack "another Iranian act of terrorism." The ship is linked to an Israeli billionaire, and Japan is involved as the ship was operated by a Japanese firm. The Houthis are a rebel group in Yemen backed by Iran, and their support for Palestine stems from their opposition to Israel and the West. Their involvement in the conflict could potentially draw in Iran and escalate the situation.</description>

			<title>‘UFO’ spotted over Imphal airport: A brief history of the term, and the unending curiosity around it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ufo-imphal-airport-india-meaning-explained-9034834/</link>
			<description>Flight operations at Bir Tikendrajit International Airport in Imphal, Manipur were disrupted due to the presence of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) hovering above the airport. Two flights were diverted and three departing flights were delayed before operations resumed. The term "UFO" refers to any aerial phenomenon that cannot be easily identified. The US Air Force coined this term in 1952, initially defining it as objects that remain unidentified after investigation. However, it is now used more broadly to describe any unidentifiable object. The US government has shown significant interest in UFOs, with former President Barack Obama acknowledging their existence and footage and records depicting objects in the skies that defy explanation. Project Blue Book, a government initiative from 1952 to 1969, compiled thousands of reports, classifying only a small percentage as unidentified. Despite limited data, recent reports suggest that these sightings often occur near US training and testing grounds. UFOs can have various origins, including birds, balloons, natural atmospheric phenomena, or even foreign adversary systems. The heightened interest in UFOs emerged during the Cold War, when the US was focused on protecting itself from Soviet threats. India has not experienced significant UFO culture, but with the proliferation of televisions and cameras, the number of claims has increased. Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray depicted aliens in his work, inspiring Hollywood films like Steven Spielberg's E.T. The term "UAP" (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) is now being used as a broader and newer alternative to "UFO", aiming to avoid confusion and speculation. NASA has also adopted this term and plans to study UAPs from a scientific perspective. While gaining clarity on these phenomena will require time, better data gathering, and scientific scrutiny, there is a recognition that unexplained aerial phenomena have had an impact on national security, affecting pilots' training and operations.</description>

			<title>Batters and bowlers, but only one all-rounder: Why a great Indian team stumbled in the final</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/india-lost-world-cup-final-9034924/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's performance in the ODI World Cup, where they were considered the best team but lost to Australia in the final. Despite the defeat, the Indian team is recognized as one of the greatest in ODIs. They won 10 games in a row, had exceptional batting with high averages and strike rates, and impressive bowling performances. However, the team had flaws, such as a top-heavy batting lineup and lack of a sixth bowling option. These weaknesses were exploited in the final, where India struggled to accelerate and set a below-par target. The article emphasizes the importance of batting depth for allowing the best batters to play freely without fear of exposing the tail. This conservative approach was not unique to the final, as it was evident throughout the tournament. Overall, the article highlights India's statistical success but also points out the flaws that ultimately cost them in the final match.</description>

			<title>The other oil imports India needs to worry about</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-other-oil-imports-india-needs-to-worry-about-9033930/</link>
			<description>India's edible oil imports have increased by almost 1.5 times and more than doubled in rupee value over the past 10 years. Imports of vegetable oils reached a record 16.5 million tonnes in the year ended October 2023, up from 14 million tonnes in the previous year. However, the value of imports fell due to a crash in global prices. India's edible oil production from domestically grown oilseeds and alternative sources amounted to around 10.3 million tonnes in 2022-23, with imports making up the remaining share. The self-sufficiency ratio has declined over the years, and if production is not boosted, annual imports could exceed 20 million tonnes. The two largest contributors to India's edible oil production are mustard and soybean, followed by cottonseed and rice bran. Other oils, such as coconut, sesame, sunflower, and safflower, have seen declines in domestic output. The high import dependence makes both producers and consumers vulnerable to international price fluctuations. Increasing domestic edible oil production would help insulate Indian farmers and households from excess global price volatility. This would require openness to technology, including genetically modified hybrids, and government support for oilseed growers.</description>

			<description>India's cricket team suffered a defeat to Australia in the World Cup final. Australia's well-executed plan, adaptability to the conditions, and strong fielding contributed to their victory. India had chosen a slow pitch, which ultimately worked against them. Australia's bowlers utilized the pitch by making the ball stop on the batsmen using a variety of deliveries. The fielders also played their part by making accurate throws from the outfield. India's pace attack initially showed promise, but the pitch eased later on, leading to Australia's comfortable win. Australia's victory showcased their ability to perform in big moments and handle pressure.</description>

Sports, including cricket, have the power to unite people and inspire change. Nelson Mandela once said that sports can create hope and break down racial barriers. Sports generate awe through impressive feats, and they are often linked to regionalism and nationalism. In South Africa, rugby was seen as a symbol of apartheid, but Mandela's efforts helped change the perception of the rugby team. Despite criticism, Mandela believed in reaching out to bring the diverse groups of the nation together. The team's victory in the 1995 Rugby World Cup final brought common celebrations, but it didn't heal the deep divisions overnight. The underrepresentation of black players in the rugby team highlighted a lack of progress in achieving true reconciliation and economic freedom for all.</description>

Despite this setback, SpaceX obtained valuable dataSpaceX's Starship spacecraft, designed to transport astronauts to the moon and beyond, experienced a failed test launch in Texas on Saturday. The launch appeared to be successful initially, but the booster exploded shortly after separating from the ship. The rest of the spacecraft continued on track. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stated that there were no injuries or property damage and will investigate the incident. SpaceX made several changes following a failed launch in April, including reinforcing the launch pad. The company aims to use Starship for Mars colonization, while NASA plans to return humans to the moon. Both SpaceX and NASA consider such failures part of the development process.</description>

			<title>Why HC has struck down Haryana’s private sector quota, and what happens now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-struck-down-haryana-jobs-quota-explained-9033493/</link>
			<description>The Punjab and Haryana High Court has struck down a law passed by the Haryana government in 2020 that provided 75% reservation in private jobs for residents of the state. The court ruled that the law violated fundamental rights outlined in the constitution and deemed it ineffective from the date it came into force. The law required private sector companies to reserve 75% of jobs with a monthly salary of less than Rs 30,000 for residents of Haryana. The Faridabad Industries Association and other Haryana-based associations challenged the law, arguing that it infringed on the constitutional rights of employers and violated the federal structure of India. The Haryana government argued that it had the power to create such reservations under Article 16(4) of the constitution. The court also criticized certain provisions of the law, such as requiring employers to submit reports on local candidates employed and granting immunity to authorized officers. The decision by the high court comes after the Supreme Court set aside an earlier stay on the law and directed the high court to decide its validity within four weeks. Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala has stated that the Haryana government will move the Supreme Court and file a Special Leave Petition in response to the high court's order.</description>

			<title>Chhath Puja: What is it, what makes it the most important festival of Bihar</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/chhath-puja-what-is-it-9033496/</link>
			<description>President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with other political leaders, extended their wishes for the Chhath Puja on November 19. This four-day festival is celebrated to honor the sun and involves fasting and making offerings to the rising and setting sun. Chhath Puja has become more visible across the country in recent years, with TV channels broadcasting celebrations taking place even outside of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. The festival holds great religious significance in Bihar and is deeply rooted in tradition. It is believed to have originated from a time when nature was worshipped, and there are stories from Hindu mythology that associate Lord Ram, Goddess Sita, Draupadi, and Karna with the observance of Chhath. The festival brings together the entire community, with everyone contributing to its success, from cleaning river banks to preparing the ritual food, known as thekuas. Chhath Puja is observed on the sixth day of the Kartik month and sometimes in the month of Chaitra as well. It is a time for devotees to feel a sense of divinity and devotion. The festival is unique in many ways, including the absence of priests and the direct worship of a visible god by devotees. People from all castes can participate, and both men and women observe the fast. The essence of the festival lies in the message that everyone is equal in the eyes of God, and nature deserves reverence.</description>

			<title>Governor’s right to withhold assent: The constitutional question before Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/governor-right-to-withhold-assent-tamil-nadu-supreme-court-9033420/</link>
			<description>Tamil Nadu's Governor R N Ravi's decision to withhold assent to 10 pending Bills has sparked legal questions about the powers of the Governor. This issue arises as several opposition-ruled states, including Tamil Nadu, have approached the Supreme Court seeking clarification on the Governor's powers in the lawmaking process. The Tamil Nadu Assembly readopted all the Bills in a special sitting five days after the Governor withheld assent.

The powers of the Governor regarding granting assent to Bills are governed by Articles 163 and 200 of the Constitution. Article 200 specifies that the Governor can grant or withhold assent to a Bill, return it for reconsideration, or reserve it for the President's consideration. However, there is a proviso in Article 200 stating that non-money Bills can be returned for reconsideration, but once they are reconsidered and sent back to the Governor, the Governor must not withhold assent.

Opposition-ruled states have been engaged in a tug-of-war with the Governors due to the ambiguity in the proviso. Raj Bhavans (Governor's residence) have taken advantage of this ambiguity to indefinitely delay Bills without returning them to the state legislature. This indefinite timeline can effectively paralyze the elected government. Nevertheless, giving assent to Bills is an area where the Governor can exercise discretion, but this discretion must be exercised in accordance with the Constitution and based on cogent reasons, rather than personal preference.

The Supreme Court's landmark ruling in the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly case (Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix vs Deputy Speaker) in 2016 discussed the Governor's role in returning Bills to the Assembly with recommendations for amendments.

Apart from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, and Punjab have also sought the Supreme Court's intervention in this matter. Kerala argued that Bills have been pending with the Governor for more than a year or two, while Telangana stated that several key Bills are pending with the Governor for approval since September 2022. Tamil Nadu alleged that the Governor's refusal to sign various orders and Bills is causing a halt in the administration and creating an adversarial attitude by not cooperating with the state government.

Now, the Supreme Court has been called upon to decide whether it can impose a timeline on Governors to give assent to Bills, which would essentially mean determining if it can set limits on an office exercising constitutional powers. In the past, the court has reluctantly set timelines for the Speaker's office to decide disqualification cases. It should be noted that a Governor cannot be directly made a party before the Supreme Court, so notices are issued to the Secretary of the Governor in such disputes.</description>

			<title>Why the Maldives President requested India to withdraw its troops from the island</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/maldives-president-india-withdraw-military-muizzu-9033345/</link>
			<description>Mohamed Muizzu, the newly elected President of Maldives, has formally requested the Indian government to withdraw its military personnel from the country. Muizzu stated that the Maldivian people had given him a strong mandate to make this request, and he hoped that India would honor the democratic will of the Maldivian people. During a meeting with India's Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju, Muizzu discussed the presence of Indian military personnel in Maldives for medical evacuation and counter-drug trafficking purposes. The Indian government confirmed that the two governments would discuss workable solutions for continued cooperation. Muizzu's request is part of the larger debate in Maldives about the role of foreign powers, particularly China and India. China has been deepening its ties with Maldives in recent years, while India considers Maldives part of its regional sphere of influence. The 'India out' campaign, which alleged that India had sent a large military contingent to Maldives, was prominent during Muizzu's election campaign. However, India and Maldives have also deepened cooperation in other areas, including the development of a harbour and the greater male connectivity project.</description>

			<title>How Vladimir Putin has resorted to homophobia to consolidate his hold on Russia</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vladimir-putin-resorted-homophobia-russia-9032542/</link>
			<description>The Russian Ministry of Justice has filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court to ban the LGBTQ+ "international public movement" due to alleged extremist activities and incitement of social and religious conflict. The lawsuit's target is unclear, whether it aims at specific organizations or the entire LGBTQ+ community. Experts express concerns that this legal action could lead to widespread persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals in Russia, resulting in criminal prosecution based solely on sexual orientation or gender identity.

This move follows a decade-long crackdown on gay rights under President Vladimir Putin's regime, which emphasizes "traditional family values." In 2013, Russia implemented the controversial "gay propaganda" law, prohibiting the non-critical portrayal of "nontraditional sexual relations" among minors. This law was later expanded to include all adults by December 2022.

As support for the prolonged Ukrainian campaign wavered domestically, the Kremlin intensified its homophobia to further the dichotomy between the "decadent" West and Putin's regime, which claimed to protect traditional values. The Russian Orthodox Church, led by Patriarch Kirill and a longstanding Putin ally, supported this anti-LGBTQ+ crusade by linking it to issues like Ukraine's rejection of gay pride parades.

The Russian Orthodox Church, with over 100 million followers in the country, historically maintains close ties with the Kremlin. Conservative movements often use LGBTQ+ rights as punching bags, characterizing them as threats to traditional values. For authoritarian populists, these rights become Trojan horses that help consolidate power by polarizing the debate between gay rights and "family values."

After the Soviet Union's fall, Russia experienced a period of liberalization socially and economically, including progress in LGBTQ+ rights. However, discontent arising from this liberalization, such as poverty and corruption, contributed to the rise of Vladimir Putin and his conservative agenda. Putin's strategic conservatism relies on appeals to faith, family, and tradition, which have been historically used by dictators as a last resort to maintain control.

Overall, the lawsuit against the LGBTQ+ movement in Russia raises concerns about potential persecution and criminalization of sexual orientation and gender identity, adding to the ongoing crackdown on gay rights under Putin's regime.</description>

			<title>Why Osama bin Laden’s 2002 ‘Letter to America’ is gaining traction on social media now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/osama-bin-laden-letter-america-9032539/</link>
			<description>Social media platform TikTok has announced that it will ban content promoting Osama bin Laden's 2002 "letter to America," in which the late Al-Qaeda leader attempted to justify the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Guardian recently removed the full translated text of the letter from its website, as it had been widely shared on social media without proper context. The letter has gained traction on platforms like TikTok due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Bin Laden criticized American support for Israel, accused Americans of financing Palestinian oppression, and made anti-Semitic remarks in the letter. Some users on TikTok have used the letter to critique US foreign policy and claim it changed their perspective. It is unclear what triggered the recent sharing of the letter. Some analysts and politicians have accused TikTok of radicalizing users and pushing propaganda, while others see it as a reflection of the fast-paced nature of social media. In the letter, bin Laden justifies the 9/11 attack by highlighting American support for Israel and the violence perpetrated against Muslims in various regions.</description>

			<title>What is a ‘halal’, and who certifies a product as being so?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/halal-certificate-up-ban-9032320/</link>
			<description>The Uttar Pradesh government in India is considering a statewide ban on products sold with halal certificates. This decision comes after a complaint was filed alleging that some companies are using halal certification to increase sales among a specific community, which is seen as a manipulation of public faith. Halal refers to food that is procured, processed, and traded in accordance with Islamic beliefs. It involves specific slaughtering techniques and requirements for the source and processing of meat. Halal certificates indicate whether a product meets these requirements and are issued by various certifying agencies. In India, there is no official regulator for halal certification, but certain agencies have gained recognition from Muslim consumers and regulators in Islamic countries. These certifications are particularly important for products intended for export to Islamic nations.</description>

			<description>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been fired by the company's board of directors. Mira Murati, the Chief Technology Officer, has been named interim CEO. Greg Brockman, the president and co-founder, also quit shortly after the announcement. OpenAI stated that new leadership was necessary, and Murati is qualified to step into the role. The reasons for Altman's firing are not clear beyond the board's statement that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board. The sudden management change has surprised employees and may impact the company's fundraising prospects. Altman was known for his fundraising abilities, securing billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft. Analysts believe that Altman's departure will not hamper OpenAI's dominance in the field of generative AI. Murati, a mechanical engineer, played a crucial role in developing products like ChatGPT and DALL-E.</description>

			<title>How the mandatory reporting provision under POCSO works</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/mandatory-reporting-pocso-9031361/</link>
			<description>The Himachal Pradesh High Court has ruled that failure to report sexual crimes against minors is a bailable offense. The ruling came in the case of a hotel manager who was accused of failing to report an offense committed against a minor, as mandated by the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The court stated that since the act does not specify whether the offense is bailable or not, the nature of the offense must be determined based on the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the classification of offenses under the Code, offenses punishable with imprisonment of less than three years are bailable and non-cognizable. Since Section 21 of the POCSO Act prescribes imprisonment of 6 months to a year, the court deemed it a bailable offense.

In the case at hand, the main accused raped and recorded a video of a minor schoolgirl in a hotel. He was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, as well as under Sections 6 and 21 of the POCSO Act. The hotel manager was also named in the First Information Report (FIR) due to the mandatory reporting provision under the POCSO Act.

The POCSO Act mandates that anyone who has knowledge or apprehension of an offense under the act must report it to the police or special juvenile police unit (SJPU). Failure to report such offenses is punishable with imprisonment of six months to one year, or a fine, or both. Notably, children cannot be held liable for failing to report sexual offenses.

The Supreme Court has previously held that failure to report sexual crimes against minors is a serious crime. In a 2013 ruling, the court stated that the non-reporting of such crimes is a serious offense. The court has also placed a greater obligation on certain professionals, such as medical practitioners and those in charge of educational institutions, to report cases of child sexual abuse.

A recent Supreme Court ruling attempted to strike a balance between the mandatory reporting provision under the POCSO Act and the confidentiality provision under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. The court recognized that minors or their guardians might be reluctant to seek out registered medical practitioners for safe termination of pregnancies due to the mandatory reporting requirement. To address this, the court exempted registered medical practitioners from disclosing the minor's identity and personal details when providing medical termination of pregnancy, to prevent any conflict between the statutory obligation to report under the POCSO Act and the minor's privacy and reproductive autonomy.</description>

			<description>India's External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, has discussed the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary David Cameron. The FTA will serve as a template for an agreement with the European Union (EU). The UK is hesitant to offer work permits to Indian service sector workers under the FTA due to concerns related to Brexit, but the size and potential of the Indian market could compensate for the loss of access to the European Single Market. A trade deal could revive Indian textile exports and offer deeper access for British goods such as cars, whisky, and wine in Indian markets. However, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and a potential carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) could impact Indian exports to the UK.</description>

			<title>COP28 in Dubai: What to expect from climate meeting</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/cop28-in-dubai-what-to-expect-from-climate-meeting-9031592/</link>
			<description>The upcoming COP28 conference in Dubai is expected to address the inadequate collective commitment of nations in combating climate change. Climate change impacts have been evident for years, and this year is set to be the warmest ever recorded. Current climate action plans are projected to result in only a 2% reduction in emissions by 2030, far from the necessary 43% reduction recommended by the IPCC for the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

A UN report highlights the declining availability of funds for developing countries to invest in adaptation measures, with only $21 billion flowing in compared to the required $215 billion annually. Financial resources remain a challenge for these countries, despite facing the highest climate risks. While short-term solutions to halt climate deterioration may be limited, the focus is on avoiding a completely hopeless situation.

Tripling the world's installed capacity of renewable energy by 2030 is a crucial objective. This would significantly increase the generation of electricity from renewable sources, accounting for nearly 70% of total electricity compared to the current 28%. The International Energy Agency estimates that achieving this could avoid 7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2030.

The proposal to triple renewable energy capacity has already received support from G20 countries, and more countries are expected to endorse it at the Dubai meeting. However, the issue of climate finance remains unresolved, as developed countries failed to meet their promise of mobilizing $100 billion annually from 2020. While progress on this goal would be an achievement, the challenge lies in raising additional funds beyond $100 billion each year.

The creation of a loss and damage fund, intended to assist countries affected by climate change impacts, was a positive outcome of the previous climate meeting. Although the fund was established last year, no funding has been provided yet. The Dubai conference aims to allocate some funds to address the concerns of small island countries, who would benefit the most from this fund.

The meeting in Dubai will also feature the presentation of findings from the first stocktake exercise, which assesses countries' progress in fighting climate change and identifies future actions. The phase-down or phase-out of fossil fuels, particularly coal, remains a contentious issue that is unlikely to be resolved at the conference.

Overall, while the current level of commitment to climate action is insufficient, COP28 in Dubai is expected to deliver meaningful outcomes such as increased renewable energy capacity, potential funding for the loss and damage fund, and discussions on future actions against climate change.</description>

			<title>The new flare-up in Myanmar</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-new-flare-up-in-myanmar-9031588/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of External Affairs expressed concern over the ongoing fighting in Myanmar's Chin State, near the border with India. The conflict began after the military seized power on February 1, 2021, leading to a resistance movement comprising Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) and People's Defence Forces (PDFs). In recent weeks, resistance forces have captured towns close to the India-Myanmar border, resulting in an influx of refugees into Mizoram.

The resistance forces, including the Three Brotherhood Alliance, have launched coordinated attacks on military outposts and seized control of crucial border towns and checkpoints. The rebels are pushing towards the capital of Shan state's Kokang region. Fighting has also broken out in other parts of Myanmar, including Rakhine State, Kayin State, Sagaing region, and Chin State.

Despite a crackdown by the junta, the resistance forces continue to challenge its control. The coordination among rebel groups and the military's inability to respond adequately distinguish this offensive. Morale is low among the military, with entire battalions surrendering without a fight.

The junta remains in control of Central Myanmar, while the resistance in Shan State appears to be receiving tacit support from China. The rebels' objective is to eradicate the military dictatorship, and the operation seems to have gained some Chinese support due to an incident that infuriated China involving guards at a scam compound.

India, while expressing concern about the interruption of democracy in Myanmar, has walked a fine line between engagement with the junta and protecting its interests. The influx of Myanmarese nationals into the border states of Northeast India is a significant concern, especially considering the volatile situation in Manipur. The anti-junta forces have captured two important towns near the India-Myanmar border, affecting the proposed trilateral highway project between India, Myanmar, and Thailand.</description>

			<title>What is the BDS movement, led by Palestinian groups against Israel?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bds-movement-palestine-israel-explained-9031211/</link>
			<description>An article published in a German newspaper accused Indian poet and curator Ranjit Hoskote of "anti-Semitism" and sympathizing with the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. As a result, Hoskote resigned from the Finding Committee for Documenta 16, a prestigious art exhibition held in Germany, and all members of the committee eventually resigned as well.

The BDS movement, launched in 2005 by Palestinian groups, aims to gain international support for Palestinian rights through boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel. It draws inspiration from the South African anti-apartheid movement and seeks nonviolent pressure on Israel until it complies with international law.

BDS has three demands for Israel: ending its occupation and colonization of Arab lands, recognizing the rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality, and respecting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. The movement targets multinational companies such as McDonald's, Puma, Google, Disney, and Amazon, urging people to boycott them.

The article mentions that Israel justifies the construction of the separation wall between Israeli and Palestinian settlements in the West Bank for security purposes, while Palestinians argue that it allows for further annexation of territory. The International Court of Justice has called on Israel to cease the construction of the wall, stating it violates international obligations.

UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, addresses the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and receive compensation. BDS advocates for boycotting Israeli government entities, cultural institutions, and companies engaged in human rights violations against Palestinians. Divestment campaigns encourage withdrawing investments from Israel, while sanctions aim to pressure governments to fulfill their legal obligations and suspend Israel's membership in international forums.

Although Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has linked BDS to anti-Semitism, BDS argues that criticizing Israel's actions does not equate to anti-Semitism. The movement insists that everyone has the right to criticize a state's unjust actions.

The impact of BDS on Israel's economy is difficult to assess, given the longstanding policy of Arab states boycotting Israel. However, BDS believes it can be a powerful tool in ending Western support for what they describe as Israeli apartheid and settler colonialism.</description>

			<title>Explained: Art historian B N Goswamy’s work on Indian miniature painting tradition</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/b-n-goswamy-miniature-painting-tradition-9031162/</link>
			<description>Brijinder Nath Goswamy, a renowned Indian art historian and critic, passed away at the age of 90 due to prolonged illness. He was best known for his scholarship on Indian miniature painting tradition. Goswamy gained attention with his groundbreaking article in 1968, where he revealed family lineages of renowned artists who contributed to the development of miniature painting in India. This was a significant contribution to the history of Indian miniature paintings. Goswamy's research expanded to include various regions in northern and southern India, and he reconstructed entire dynasties of previously unknown artists, restoring their identities and honor. He received the Padma Bhushan award and was a former IAS officer. Indian art is characterized by intricate and highly detailed paintings on a small scale, using bright colors, intricate patterns, and elaborate detailing. The tradition of miniature painting in India dates back to the Buddhist Pala dynasty and began to thrive during the Mughal empire. Mughal miniatures were tiny, square-inch paintings that depicted religious texts and manuscripts. The tradition declined during the reign of Aurangzeb, leading to the emergence of new traditions in places like Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, Rajathan, and the Deccan region. The roots of Goswamy's research lay in his exploration of the Pahari painting style, where he discovered that the style was based on family lineage rather than the state of production. He reconstructed family networks and traced the contributions of artists and their descendants using inscriptions on miniatures and historical records. Goswamy's contributions expanded our knowledge of Indian miniature painting and restored the identities of previously obscure artists.</description>

			<title>The Beast vs the Red Flag: Comparing the cars of Biden and Xi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/the-beast-red-flag-biden-xi-9030960/</link>
			<description>During a bilateral meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden complimented Xi's red flag car, comparing it to a Cadillac. The meeting aimed to improve the US-China relationship, which has been deteriorating in recent years. The article compares the official cars of the two leaders, providing basic specifications. The Beast, used by Biden, is a mobile safety room with extensive armor and safety features. It has a 6.5-liter Duramax diesel engine and can withstand various threats. On the other hand, Xi's red flag car likely has inferior armor but compensates with speed, boasting a V8 or V12 engine that can reach speeds above 200 kmph. Hongqi, the luxury car brand, has been associated with high-ranking officials in China.</description>

			<title>Tiger 3 and earlier: A short history of the portrayal of Pakistan in Bollywood</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/tiger-3-history-portrayal-pakistan-bollywood-9030880/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the trend of Hindi films in Bollywood that engage with India's relationship with Pakistan. It highlights previous films like "Pathaan," "Gadar 2," "Ek Tha Tiger," and "Tiger Zinda Hai" that tackled the India-Pakistan question. The article explores why Pakistan was rarely mentioned in Hindi films until the 1990s when movies began to address the aftermath of Partition more openly. It mentions films like "Sarfarosh" as one of the first mainstream Hindi films to explicitly name Pakistan as India's enemy. The trauma of Partition initially made it difficult for Bollywood to depict Pakistan directly.

The article then explains how a generational change in Bollywood during the 1990s allowed for multidimensional discussions around Partition. Films started exploring Pakistani society, politics, and the military, showcasing relationships between Indians and Pakistanis. It also mentions the historical context of the four wars between India and Pakistan and how post-liberalization prosperity in India coincided with increased separatism and violence in Jammu and Kashmir. The article discusses the impact of terrorist attacks and the hardening of India's position towards Pakistan.

Furthermore, it mentions films like "Bajrangi Bhaijaan," which depicted Pakistan positively but highlights a tonal shift in Bollywood's portrayal of Pakistan after the terrorist attacks. From 2017 onward, Pakistan has been portrayed mostly as the evil enemy without redeeming features in Indian films. This depiction aligns with the nationalist Hindutva discourse prevalent in India's mainstream political discourse. However, the success of "Tiger 3" is seen as an outlier in this trend.</description>

			<title>Why water reserves in southern India are fast depleting in 2023</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/water-reserves-south-india-depleting-2023-9030349/</link>
			<description>Water levels in the reservoirs of India's southern states are expected to decrease further in the coming months, raising concerns as stocks are already low this year. The Central Water Commission (CWC) reported that water levels in these states' reservoirs are lower compared to last year and other regions of the country. Currently, the water stocks stand at 44% of the total capacity, compared to 87% last year. The southern states monitored by the CWC include Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. The low water reserves will have an immediate impact on irrigated farming, particularly paddy cultivation in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and will also affect the availability of drinking water. The situation may lead to drought declarations in some states and pose a challenge for the new state governments in addressing the agricultural crisis caused by water shortage.</description>

			<title>Why ‘hallucinate’ is the Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year for 2023</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/hallucinate-meaning-cambridge-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2023-9030317/</link>
			<description>The word "hallucinate" has been chosen as the Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2023. This decision was made due to its new meaning in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Previously, the definition of "hallucinate" referred to seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling something that does not exist, usually due to a health condition or drug use. However, with the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard, which use large language models (LLMs), the term has taken on an additional meaning. The Cambridge Dictionary now includes the definition of "hallucinate" as "when an artificial intelligence produces false information." 

Generative AI, while capturing people's imagination, is still in its early stages with limitations and flaws. Hallucinations in AI occur when the system produces nonsensical but seemingly plausible falsehoods. This happens because generative AI tools rely on past data to generate responses based on prompts. While they excel at extracting specific information and consolidating it, when asked to be more original, they are more likely to go astray. AI systems can learn from inaccurate sources or produce inaccuracies while processing information, leading to real-world consequences. For example, a US law firm using ChatGPT for legal research cited fictitious cases in court, resulting in a fine of $5,000.

The Cambridge Dictionary Word of the Year has been chosen annually since 2015 based on popular word usage and cultural significance. The selection of "hallucinate" for 2023 reflects the ongoing discussions around AI. Generative AI is a powerful tool, but people are still learning how to interact with it safely and effectively, considering both its strengths and weaknesses.</description>

			<title>What is Documenta, the art show from which curator Ranjit Hoskote has resigned?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/troubled-history-of-documenta-art-show-that-ranjit-hoskote-has-quit-9029880/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Cultural theorist and curator Ranjit Hoskote has resigned from the Finding Committee of Documenta, a prestigious art exhibition, following accusations of anti-Semitism. Hoskote's resignation came after Israeli artist Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger also resigned due to the rejection of her request to delay proceedings because of the war in Gaza. The German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung accused Hoskote of sympathizing with the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, which opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. Documenta is a non-commercial art exhibition held every five years in Kassel, Germany, and is known for inviting artists who may not be well-known in Europe. The exhibition has faced criticism in the past for its Nazi connections and accusations of anti-Semitism. The next edition of Documenta will be held in 2027, and the Finding Committee now includes Gong Yan, Simon Njami, Kathrin Rhomberg, and María Inés Rodríguez.</description>

			<title>Farmer dies by suicide in Kerala over debt: What ails the state’s paddy cultivation sector?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/farmer-suicide-kerala-debt-paddy-sector-problems-explained-9029174/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A farmer's suicide in Kerala has brought attention to the struggles faced by the paddy sector in the state. The farmer blamed the government and banks for denying him a farm loan. Paddy cultivation in Kerala has been declining despite rice being a staple food in the region.

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for paddy in Kerala consists of two components: one fixed by the Union government and an additional incentive provided by the state government. Last year, the MSP was Rs 28.20 per kg, with the Union government contributing Rs 20.40 and the Kerala government providing Rs 7.80. This season, while the Union government increased its share to Rs 21.83, the state government reduced its share to Rs 6.37, resulting in a total procurement price of Rs 28.20. The cost of cultivation per hectare in 2021-22 was Rs 75,430, making it challenging for farmers to make profits.

To encourage paddy cultivation, the state government introduced various incentives such as input assistance, support from local self-government bodies, and a royalty scheme for farmers who engage in paddy cultivation for consecutive years. However, many farmers complain about the inconsistency of these incentives.

Labour scarcity is a major problem in Kerala, especially during planting seasons. Women used to form a significant part of the workforce, but the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has led to their absence in the paddy sector. Farmers now rely on migrant workers from West Bengal, but their availability is limited. Scattered paddy tracts and conflicting interests among farmers also make mechanization impractical in many areas.

Erratic monsoons and wildlife attacks, particularly by wild boars, further disrupt paddy cultivation and reduce yields. Additionally, there are issues with the paddy procurement process, including delays in payment and disputes between the government and rice mills over the paddy-to-rice conversion ratio. These challenges have resulted in private rice mills being reluctant to procure paddy from farmers.

Overall, the paddy sector in Kerala faces significant difficulties, including rising cultivation costs, labour shortages, erratic weather, and procurement issues. These factors contribute to the unprofitability of paddy cultivation for many farmers in the state.</description>

			<title>Why UK Supreme Court rejected Tory policy to send undocumented asylum-seekers to Rwanda</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-supreme-court-tory-policy-asylum-seekers-rwanda-9029106/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has rejected Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's immigration policy, which aimed to deport undocumented asylum-seekers to Rwanda. The Court of Appeal had previously ruled against the policy, citing the risk of human rights breaches and the potential for refugees to be wrongly assessed or returned to their countries of origin where they may face persecution. The policy, which was signed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, aimed to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda to be assessed for eventual resettlement. However, refugee and human rights organizations opposed the scheme, arguing that it treated people as commodities and lacked sufficient safeguards. The United Nations Refugee Agency also expressed its opposition to the scheme, stating that refugees should not be transferred to third countries without proper protections. The European Court of Human Rights intervened to stop the first plane from departing the UK for Rwanda, leading to the cancellation of the flight and a legal battle against the scheme. The UK government argued that Rwanda had made progress in terms of stability and economic development, but the Supreme Court upheld the previous rulings, citing Rwanda's human rights record and the risk of asylum-seekers being returned to their unsafe home countries. The court concluded that there was a real risk of ill-treatment for genuine refugees if they were deported to Rwanda.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the rise of deepfake audios, which are created using generative AI technology. Such audios can clone someone's voice and be used to spread misinformation, particularly in the field of electoral politics. The article mentions an Instagram account that creates AI voice clones of political leaders and highlights the potential danger of sharing such doctored content without proper attribution. It explains that AI voice clones can be created easily using online tools and provides examples of such tools. The article also mentions that earlier audio deepfakes were easy to detect but recent advancements in technology have made them more realistic. The authorities are urged to crack down on social media platforms to tackle deepfake content, and the Indian government has advised social media intermediaries to remove deepfake information or face penalties. The article suggests using digitally signed videos to verify the authenticity of content and emphasizes the need for vigilance and proactive measures when encountering video or audio clips on social media. The spread of deepfake audios during elections can influence public opinion, damage the reputation of candidates, and manipulate the democratic process. Lastly, the article mentions that spreading misinformation and fake news through deepfake audios can be punishable under the Indian Penal Code and IT Act.</description>

			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that the article discusses the recent summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco. The focus of the summit was to organize a truce in the conflictual relationship between the two countries. However, it is important for India to pay attention to areas of US-China engagement, such as regulating artificial intelligence, as it may have long-term implications for global AI rules. Additionally, India should monitor the follow-up on regional security issues in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East crisis, and the Ukraine war. The article also mentions that China seeks to woo back US business leaders and that India should prioritize productive engagement with Western capital. Overall, the article suggests that India should take advantage of new possibilities to strengthen ties with the US, maintain ties with Russia, and manage its relationship with China.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: What led to the Uttarakhand tunnel collapse — and how it could have been avoided</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/to-build-tunnel-rock-must-be-thoroughly-examined-more-time-spent-on-studies-9028352/</link>
			<description>An under-construction tunnel on the Yamunotri National Highway in Uttarakhand collapsed, trapping 40 workers inside. The collapse could have been caused by a loose patch of rock or seepage of water. Tunnels are excavated using either the drill and blast method or tunnel-boring machines (TBMs). TBMs are safer but more expensive. The method of excavation depends on the type of terrain, with TBMs being used for rock covers up to 400 meters tall. The Himalayan region is not too fragile for tunneling, as there are technical solutions to fix any issues. Thorough investigation of the rock is crucial before building a tunnel, and monitoring and testing of supports are necessary for stability. More time should be spent on studies before starting construction in India.</description>

			<title>Is Virat Kohli the ODI (batting) GOAT?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/virat-kohli-odi-batting-goat-9028229/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the question of whether Virat Kohli is the greatest of all time (GOAT) in One Day International (ODI) cricket. It acknowledges that comparing players from different eras is challenging and analyzes five ODI greats, including Kohli, to make a case for each of them being the GOAT.

The first player discussed is Sir Viv Richards, who dominated ODI cricket during his career (1975-91) and had a significant impact on the West Indies team. Despite playing in a different era, his record still holds up compared to modern-day batters.

Next, Sachin Tendulkar's sustained excellence and ability to remain among the best batters for over two decades are highlighted. His mix of aggression and consistency, as well as the burden he carried for the Indian team, make a strong case for him as the GOAT.

Sanath Jayasuriya's contribution to changing how ODI cricket is played is emphasized. His aggressive batting at the start of an innings had a significant impact, particularly during the 1996 World Cup when he helped Sri Lanka win as underdogs.

AB de Villiers is praised for his versatility and range of shots, which set a new standard for ODI cricket. His exceptional strike rate and average make a strong case for him as the GOAT.

Finally, the article focuses on Virat Kohli and his perfection in batting in a 50-over game. His ability to adapt to any game situation and lead his team to victory makes him a formidable player. With his impressive records and dedication to fitness, Kohli has a good chance of adding more achievements to his resume.

The article concludes by stating that comparisons between these great players will always remain subjective, considering the different eras they played in and the unique contributions they made to the game.</description>

			<title>The story of Subrata Roy’s crumbling business empire</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/story-of-subrata-roy-crumbling-business-empire-9028105/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Subrata Roy, the founder of Sahara Group, built a business empire by collecting deposits from millions of poor and rural Indians. However, his empire faced challenges when the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused him of illegal fund mobilization. Sahara Group owned various assets including an airline, an F1 team, hotels in London and New York, financial companies, mutual funds, and a life insurance company. These assets have either been sold or are under attachment to repay investors.

The trouble for Sahara began when SEBI investigated the mobilization of funds through two companies, Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd (SHICL) and Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd (SIRECL). SEBI ordered Sahara to refund the collected money in 2010, but only a small number of investors came forward to claim their refunds. Subsequently, Roy was sent to jail for contempt for not depositing a sum of Rs 10,000 crore with SEBI.

Despite facing regulatory bans, Sahara purchased overseas properties such as Grosvenor House in London and the Plaza Hotel and Dream New York hotels in New York. However, in 2017, these properties were sold to clear the group's dues to SEBI. The Aamby Valley township near Pune, spread over 6,700 acres, was also scheduled for auction but has faced difficulties in finding buyers.

Sahara's ventures in airlines, F1 team ownership, mutual funds, and life insurance did not succeed either. Sahara Airlines, later renamed Air Sahara, was acquired by Jet Airways, leading to financial troubles for both companies. The F1 team Sahara Force India underwent an asset sale and became Racing Point Force India. Sahara Mutual Fund had its registration cancelled, and Sahara India Life Insurance faced governance issues.

In 2023, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) ordered the transfer of Sahara India Life Insurance's shareholding to another "fit and proper" promoter due to questions of financial propriety. However, the Securities Appellate Tribunal stayed the order, halting the transfer of policy liabilities and assets to SBI Life Insurance Company.

Overall, Subrata Roy's Sahara Group faced legal and financial challenges due to allegations of illegal fund mobilization, leading to the sale of various assets and legal disputes with regulatory bodies.</description>

			<title>Why adultery was struck off IPC, and why a House panel wants to make it a crime again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/adultery-ipc-bns-house-9027529/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Parliamentary Committee on Home Affairs has recommended that adultery should be reintroduced as a crime in the proposed Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, which will replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. The committee adopted reports on three bills meant to replace the IPC, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Indian Evidence Act. Previously, Section 497 of the IPC defined adultery as a criminal offense but only punished men. However, in 2018, the Supreme Court struck down this section, citing discrimination and violation of fundamental rights. Now, the committee suggests reinstating adultery as a criminal offense but making it gender-neutral, meaning both men and women could be punished. This recommendation aims to address the discriminatory nature of the previous law. However, the Supreme Court's decision is the law of the land, and while Parliament cannot contradict it directly, they can pass a law that removes the basis for the court's judgment.</description>

			<title>Explained: The debate over appropriate age of admission to Class 1</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/appropriate-age-admission-class-1-9027925/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the age criteria for admission to Class 1 in schools in Delhi, India. Despite recent letters from the Union government urging all states to align their age requirements with the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP), schools in Delhi will continue to admit students below the age of 6 years. According to the NEP, a child should be 6 years old after completing three years of early childhood education to be eligible for admission into Class 1.

The Union Education Ministry has been reminding states to align their age requirements with the NEP, which leads to media attention whenever the issue arises. Last year, when Kendriya Vidyalayas increased the age of admission to Class 1 to align with the NEP recommendations, some parents challenged the decision in court. The Delhi High Court ultimately dismissed their plea, and this decision was upheld by the Supreme Court.

In terms of the legal framework, the Right to Education (RTE) Act guarantees education from the age of 6 to 14 years, meaning that a child is expected to begin elementary education (Class 1) at the age of 6 years. This age was selected based on international practices, as most countries admit children into grade one at the age of 6 or 7.

Research suggests that early introduction of formal literacy lessons may not improve children's reading development and could even have negative effects. A study comparing children who started formal literacy lessons at ages 5 and 7 in New Zealand found no difference in reading ability by the age of 11, but the group that started later had more positive attitudes toward reading and better text comprehension.

Across the world, the standard age for starting primary school is 6 in East Asia and most European countries. However, the USA and the UK stand out as outliers, where children generally start school at 5. Scandinavian countries start at 7 due to their universal child care system, which differs from the patchy and expensive childcare provision in England and the USA.

The article highlights the ongoing debate about the appropriate age for children to begin formal education and the need to align with national policies.</description>

			<title>A tunnel-in-a-tunnel: How the new method to rescue trapped workers in Uttarakhand will work</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/uttarakhand-tunnel-collapse-trapped-workers-rescue-plan-explained-9027528/</link>
			<description>Rescuers in Uttarakhand, India are attempting a new method to reach 40 workers trapped inside a collapsed tunnel. Traditional digging methods have been unsuccessful due to loose rock and debris falling and blocking the passage. Rescuers are now using a "trenchless" technique, using an auger machine to create a stable passage with mild steel pipes for the workers to crawl through. This method minimizes surface disruption and reduces environmental impact. The auger machine drills through the debris, creating a tunnel or passage, and the pipes are inserted to create an escape route. Safety measures such as securing the pipes and using harnesses are being employed.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Gaza Strip's largest hospital, al-Shifa, is no longer functioning due to a loss of power and water supply, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The hospital, which used to be the cornerstone of Gaza's healthcare system, has been encircled by Israeli forces who allege that it is being used as a headquarters by Hamas militants. However, Hamas and Gaza's health ministry deny these claims. About 650 patients and thousands of displaced civilians are trapped inside the hospital, and they are under constant fire from snipers and drones. The situation is dire, with 40 patients already dead, including three premature babies whose incubators shut down when the electricity went out.

			<title>Offshore Leaks to Cyprus Confidential, a decade of offshore investigations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/offshore-leaks-to-cyprus-confidential-a-decade-of-offshore-investigations-9027034/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses a series of investigations conducted in collaboration with various media partners, including the Indian Express and ICIJ, to expose tax evasion through offshore entities. 

The investigations include:
1. Offshore Leaks (2013): Data leaks from service providers and banks in tax havens revealed offshore investments of 612 Indians.
2. Swiss Leaks (2015): Leaked files from HSBC's Swiss private banking arm identified 1,195 Indian clients, double the number provided by French authorities in 2011.
3. Panama Papers (2016): Documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca exposed shell entities used for fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering.
4. Paradise Papers (2017): Records from Bermuda firm Appleby and Singapore-based Asiaciti Trust unveiled tax avoidance and evasion strategies, with Indian-controlled companies being the majority.
5. Mauritius Leaks (2019): Data obtained from law firm Conyers Dill &amp; Pearman disclosed multinational companies' use of Mauritius as a tax haven to avoid paying taxes globally.
6. FinCEN Files (2020): Suspicious activity reports filed by global banks, revealing potential financial crimes, high-risk profiles, and red flags raised by banks for law enforcement.
7. Pandora Papers (2021): Leaked documents highlighted the use of offshore companies by powerful individuals, including heads of state, for estate planning purposes and asset ownership concealment.
8. Cyprus Confidential (2023): A trove of 3.6 million documents from offshore service providers in Cyprus, exposing potential tax evasion activities.

These investigations have played a significant role in helping governments crack down on tax evaders and sparked debates on the use of tax havens and offshore structures.</description>

			<title>Secrecy and no tax — reason why Indians look at Cyprus</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/secrecy-and-no-tax-reason-why-indians-look-at-cyprus-9027035/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article titled "Cyprus Confidential: Investigating Offshore Companies and Tax Havens" discusses a global offshore investigation that uncovered 3.6 million documents in English and Greek related to companies incorporated in Cyprus by the wealthy and influential individuals from around the world. The investigation, conducted in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), involved over 270 journalists from more than 60 media houses across 55 countries and territories.

The data obtained includes information on Indian investors who obtained Cypriot citizenship through the Golden Passport scheme, as well as documents concerning entities established by prominent businesses to take advantage of Cyprus' favorable tax system. The investigation aims to expose the secrecy surrounding these offshore companies and bring transparency to government and regulatory agencies.

Setting up an offshore company in Cyprus is not illegal, and India has double-taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs) with several countries, including Cyprus, which offer low tax rates. Companies utilize their tax residency certificates in such countries to legally benefit from tax advantages. These jurisdictions typically have lenient regulatory oversight and strict secrecy laws.

The article highlights three phases of India's tax arrangement with Cyprus over the past two decades:

1. Prior to 2013: India and Cyprus had a tax treaty that exempted investors from capital gains tax, while Cyprus also did not impose capital gains tax. This made Cyprus an attractive destination for setting up entities and investing in India.

2. Since 2013: India classified Cyprus as a Notified Jurisdictional Area (NJA), imposing a higher withholding tax rate of 30% on payments received by entities registered there. Transactions with NJA entities are subject to Indian transfer pricing regulations.

3. Since 2016: A revised DTAA was signed between India and Cyprus, rescinding Cyprus as an NJA with retrospective effect from November 1, 2013. The new treaty introduced source-based taxation of capital gains from the sale of shares, with a grandfathering clause for investments made prior to April 1, 2017.

The article also explains the tax benefits and exemptions available for offshore companies in Cyprus. Offshore branches managed from Cyprus are taxed at 4.25%, while offshore branches managed from abroad and offshore partnerships are completely tax-exempt. There is no withholding tax on dividends, and beneficial owners are not subject to additional taxes on dividends or profits. Additionally, there is no capital gains tax on the sale or transfer of shares in an offshore company.

The use of Cyprus as a jurisdiction for tax planning allows foreign investors to establish investment firms in Cyprus and benefit from the DTAA when investing in India. The article mentions that Cyprus has become an alternative to Mauritius for setting up offshore entities for Indian investments.

Furthermore, the article discusses the Cyprus International Trust Law, which allows offshore trusts to avoid estate duty and pay no tax on income and gains if they are registered with Cypriot trustees and the settlor and beneficiaries are not permanent residents of Cyprus.

Despite having a DTAA, the Indian tax authorities still have the right to deny tax treaty benefits if they determine that a company was inserted as the owner of shares solely to evade taxes. In such cases, the entire transaction can be questioned by the tax authorities.</description>

			<title>Secrecy plus no tax, why Indians line up for Cyprus</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/secrecy-plus-no-tax-why-indians-line-up-for-cyprus-9026864/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the findings of the Cyprus Confidential investigation, which uncovered a trail of offshore entities incorporated by wealthy individuals in tax haven Cyprus. The investigation reveals that these entities, which have offshore residency, were controlled from India, with instructions for financial transactions given by individuals in India. While it is not illegal to set up an offshore company in Cyprus, Indian companies use their Cyprus tax residency certificates to avoid paying taxes. The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Cyprus allows for the use of Cyprus as a jurisdiction for tax planning. However, the Indian Income Tax department can deny tax treaty benefits if it is determined that a company has been inserted as the owner of shares in India solely to avoid taxes.</description>

			<title>‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’: How the rallying call began, why it is criticised</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/from-the-river-to-the-sea-palestine-history-explained-9026728/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the origin and criticism of the slogan "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free." The slogan calls for the liberation of Palestine, referring to the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. Historically, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire before coming under British rule. After World War II and the mass migration of Jewish people to Palestine, Israel was established in 1948.

The context of the statement changed over time. Palestinians rejected the proposed two-state solution in 1947, considering all of Palestine as their homeland. Following a war in which many Palestinians were displaced, Israel gained control, leading to the weakening of Palestinians' rights. The slogan emerged in the 1960s, representing the desire for total liberation.

Over the years, Palestinian groups like Fatah and the PLO shifted their stance from calling for a single state to supporting a two-state solution. However, Hamas emerged with a more militant ideology, championing the idea of complete control from the river to the sea. While Hamas's charter had a hardline stance on Jews, its 2017 revision clarified that it was against the Zionist project but not against Judaism or Jews.

The slogan has faced criticism from various sources. Some argue that it promotes violence and the destruction of Israel, while others view it as antisemitic. US Democrat Rashida Tlaib defended the slogan, stating it symbolizes freedom, human rights, and coexistence. However, the US House of Representatives censured her, claiming it was a genocidal call to violence. The UK's recently sacked interior minister also described the statement as a staple of antisemitic discourse.

While pro-Palestine groups have used the slogan, it has also been adopted by Israeli politicians. Likud, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, included a version of the slogan in its party platform, asserting Israeli sovereignty between the sea and the Jordan River. Overall, the slogan has stirred debate and controversy, with differing interpretations and opinions regarding its meaning and implications.</description>

			<title>Why a Rahman song from Pippa has offended many in Bengal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/rahman-pippa-song-kazi-nazrul-islam-9026542/</link>
			<description>Roy Kapur Films, the production company behind the Hindi film Pippa, has issued an apology for any unintended distress caused by a song in the film. The song, titled Karar Oi Louho Kopat, was written by Bengali poet Kazi Nazrul Islam in 1922 as a nationalist anthem against British colonial rule. It has been set to a new tune by composer A R Rahman for Pippa, which has received criticism in West Bengal and Bangladesh.

Pippa, directed by Raja Krishna Menon, stars Ishaan Khatter and Mrunal Thakur and tells the story of Capt (later Brig) Balram Singh Mehta, a hero of the tank battle of Garibpur during the 1971 war with Pakistan. The film premiered on Amazon Prime Video on November 10.

In a statement posted on Instagram, Roy Kapur Films clarified that their rendition of the song is an artistic interpretation made with the necessary adaptation rights from the estate of Kazi Nazrul Islam. They expressed deep respect for the original composition, acknowledged the emotional attachment audiences may have to it, and offered sincere apologies if their interpretation had hurt sentiments or caused distress.

Karar Oi Louho Kopat is a revolutionary song written by Nazrul after the imprisonment of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das by the British in 1922. The song's refrain, "Break down those iron gates of prison, make them disappear," reflects its protest and patriotic fervor. While the filmmakers obtained consent from Nazrul's family to use the song, some Bengalis have objected to Rahman's version, claiming it deviates from the original's spirit and cultural heritage.

Protesters include Taslima Nasrin, a Bangladeshi writer who demanded the preservation of the original music, and Hindustani classical vocalist Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty, who expressed disappointment in Rahman's rendition. Other Bengali singers and composers also criticized the alteration of the iconic song.

Despite the controversy, Roy Kapur Films stated that they faithfully followed the license agreement for the lyrics, allowing them to use the song with a new composition. The dispute continues as supporters of Nazrul's work argue for the inclusion of the original music in the film.</description>

			<title>Mount Etna erupts: Why some volcanoes just keep spewing lava</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/mount-etna-lava-eruption-volcanoes-explained-9026467/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the frequency of volcanic eruptions around the world, highlighting that while only major eruptions make headlines, there can be as many as 50 to 80 fresh eruptions in a given year. The article mentions that 56 volcanoes erupted in the first six months of 2023, with concerns raised about the possibility of a volcanic eruption in Iceland following a series of earthquakes. The focus then shifts to Mount Etna in Italy, which is Europe's most active volcano and has erupted over 200 times since 1500 B.C. The current eruptions at Mount Etna have resulted in flight cancellations and a ban on the use of cars and motorbikes due to ash accumulation on the roads. The article also briefly mentions other long-term eruptions such as Kilauea in Hawaii, Dukono in Indonesia, Santa Maria in Guatemala, and Yasur in Vanuatu. It explains that volcanoes are openings where lava, tephra, and steam erupt onto the earth's surface, and they are influenced by the movement and collision of tectonic plates. The article concludes by mentioning that the Pacific Ring of Fire is home to many active volcanoes, and scientists can predict volcanic eruptions to some extent using seismographic data, ground monitoring, and gas emissions analysis.</description>

			<title>Why China may see a spike in Covid-19 cases this winter</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/china-spike-covid-cases-9026346/</link>
			<description>Chinese respiratory disease experts are warning of an increase in COVID-19 infections during the winter, leading them to urge the elderly and vulnerable populations to get vaccinated as soon as possible. China recently experienced a small resurgence of severe cases and deaths in October due to the XBB variants. Despite China's previous success with a zero-COVID strategy, the abrupt end to this policy in 2022 has left a large portion of the population susceptible to infection. The efficacy of the Chinese vaccines Sinovac and Sinopharm may also be a factor in the increase in cases, as booster shots have not been widely administered. The XBB variant, a recombinant of two Omicron sub-variants, is more immune evasive and can potentially cause reinfections or breakthrough infections. However, it is not associated with more severe disease, hospitalizations, or deaths.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/xi-biden-apec-summit-explained-9026038/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place in San Francisco, United States, with leaders from various countries attending. US President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping will have their first in-person meeting in a year on the sidelines of the summit. The summit will address issues of trade, which have been a major point of contention in US-China relations. India's Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, is also attending the forum, although India is not a member of APEC. APEC is a regional economic forum established in 1989, aiming to promote regional economic integration and prosperity. It consists of 21 member economies, including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Russia, the United States, and others. APEC has been a champion of free trade and economic liberalization, contributing to the development of a growing middle class in the Asia-Pacific region. India has expressed interest in joining APEC, but there has been an informal moratorium on expanding membership for many years. The highlight of the summit is the meeting between Biden and Xi, where they hope to discuss progress on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</description>

			<title>Easing wheat prices, rising rice prices: What’s behind them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/easing-wheat-rising-rice-9025623/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the diverging trends in global wheat and rice prices. Wheat prices reached a record high in March 2022 but have since more than halved. The decline in wheat prices can be attributed to improved availability, lower international prices, and efficient management of government stocks. Russia's wheat exports have played a significant role in reducing global prices.

On the other hand, rice prices have risen due to export restrictions implemented by India, the world's largest rice exporter. India has banned the export of white non-basmati rice and imposed minimum export prices and duties on basmati and parboiled non-basmati rice shipments. These measures have increased prices and impacted global trade dynamics, benefiting Pakistan as an alternative exporter.

In terms of inflation, cereal inflation in India surpassed general retail inflation and consumer food price inflation in October. The inflation rates of rice and wheat are influenced by domestic production, with wheat imports being economically viable but politically challenging due to electoral considerations.

Contrary to the situation in cereals, edible oil imports in India have increased, leading to a collapse in global prices. The normalisation of supplies from Indonesia and Russia-Ukraine resulted in a decrease in the value of edible oil imports and negative retail edible oil inflation in October.

The future course of cereal inflation will depend on the crop size harvested by Indian farmers. Meanwhile, the import flexibility is limited for rice, given India's position as a major exporter.</description>

			<title>What are active and passive equity funds — and how much inflows did they receive in the July-Sept quarter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/active-passive-equity-funds-9025381/</link>
			<description>Active equity funds were popular among mutual fund investors in the July-September quarter, with net inflows of about Rs 74,000 crore. These funds rely on professional fund managers who actively decide on buying, holding, or selling securities, and aim to generate higher returns than the benchmark index. On the other hand, passive equity funds saw inflows of Rs 9,000 crore, and arbitrage funds received Rs 29,000 crore. Passive funds replicate a stated index or benchmark and require minimal stock selection by the fund manager. Passive large cap funds were particularly favored by investors in this quarter. Overall, the mutual fund industry recorded net inflows of approximately Rs 51,000 crore, with active equity funds leading the way.</description>

			<title>On bail, tracked by satellite: How GPS anklets work</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-gps-anklets-work-9025226/</link>
			<description>A prisoner in Jammu and Kashmir has been released on bail while being monitored with a GPS tracking device, marking the first time this technology has been used in India for this purpose. The individual, Ghulam Mohammad Bhat, is accused of offenses under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and was ordered by a special court to wear a GPS tracker anklet on his foot. The device allows law enforcement and security agencies to monitor the wearer's movements in real-time and is tamper-proof, setting off an alarm if tampering is attempted. GPS trackers are commonly used for monitoring animals and are available for purchase online for around Rs 1,000.

The decision to use a GPS tracker on Bhat was made to closely monitor his movements during the period of his bail, with the aim of curbing narco-smuggling and terror activities. While GPS trackers are a precondition for bail in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia, there are currently no specific legal provisions allowing their use in this way in India. Human rights activists argue that tracking individuals with GPS devices violates their fundamental right to privacy and emphasize the need for standards and ethics in electronic monitoring. They suggest implementing a system of informed consent and procedures to address unethical and illegal practices concerning surveillance.</description>

			<title>David Cameron to be new UK Foreign Secretary: Who is the former Prime Minister?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/david-cameron-new-uk-foreign-secretary-profile-9024931/</link>
			<description>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has sacked Suella Braverman, the Secretary of State for Home Department, following her controversial comments about the policing of pro-Palestinian protests in the UK. James Cleverly, the current Foreign Secretary, will replace Braverman as the Interior Minister. In a surprising move, former Prime Minister David Cameron has been appointed as Foreign Minister, marking his return to politics. Cameron, who served as Prime Minister from 2010 to 2016, hopes to utilize his experience in helping the current Prime Minister address critical challenges. Throughout his political career, Cameron focused on modernizing and reforming the Conservative Party. He won two general elections in 2010 and 2015 before resigning following the Brexit referendum in 2016. Despite his opposition to Brexit, Cameron agreed to hold the referendum, which resulted in the UK voting to leave the European Union. Since leaving office, Cameron has been out of the political sphere but expressed regret over not being able to sway public opinion during the Brexit campaign. Additionally, in 2014, Cameron successfully campaigned against Scottish independence as the Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom.</description>

			<title>Why has British PM Rishi Sunak sacked his most visible minister, Suella Braverman?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/rishi-sunak-sacked-suella-braverman-9024817/</link>
			<description>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has sacked his Interior Minister Suella Braverman following her criticism of the police's handling of pro-Palestinian marches in London. Braverman, a hardline conservative, frequently made controversial comments on migrants, protesters, the police, and the homeless. The decision to remove her came after growing pressure from opposition lawmakers and members of Sunak's own Conservative Party. Braverman had accused the police of a "double standard" in their treatment of protests in an article published in The Times. She alleged that pro-Palestinian demonstrators were largely ignored while right-wing protesters were met with a stern response. On the day of the pro-Palestinian march, clashes broke out between far-right counter-protesters and the police. The opposition Labour Party claimed that these clashes were sparked by Braverman's comments. Members of the Conservative Party have also criticized her, expressing despair at Sunak's delay in sacking the minister. Braverman, a lawyer of Indian origin, had previously served as Attorney General for England and Wales and was a junior minister in the Brexit department under former Prime Minister Theresa May. She campaigned to leave the EU and has taken a hard line on immigration, advocating for deportation to Rwanda.</description>

			<title>Hospitals have special protection under the rules of war. Why are they in the crosshairs in Gaza?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hospitals-war-gaza-srael-rules-conflict-9024380/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the impact on hospitals in the region. Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest and most advanced hospital, has become a battleground as Israeli tanks move through Gaza City. Israel claims that Hamas militants are using hospitals as shields, but Palestinians and rights groups accuse Israel of recklessly harming civilians seeking shelter.

The Israeli military alleges that Hamas operates its command headquarters beneath Shifa Hospital, while Hamas and the hospital director deny these claims. The Israeli army states that if Hamas fighters use hospitals to fire at them, they will respond accordingly. However, there is no evidence provided by Israel to support these allegations.

Many Palestinian families seek refuge in medical compounds, believing them to be safer than other alternatives. Shifa Hospital has become overcrowded with patients, medical workers, and displaced people. The hospital experienced a blackout, leading to the deaths of several patients, including a newborn in an incubator. Palestinian medical workers accuse Israel of targeting infrastructure to punish the population.

The article also explores the implications of international humanitarian law. Hospitals have special protections during war, but they can lose this status if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons. However, there must be sufficient warning before attacks to allow for the safe evacuation of patients and medical workers. Even if Shifa Hospital conceals a Hamas command center, international law still requires steps to protect innocent civilians.

International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan warns combatants that claiming hospitals have lost their protected status due to military use carries a high burden of proof. If there is doubt about a civilian object's protective status, attackers must assume it is protected until proven otherwise.</description>

			<title>Airfares are sky-high in Europe and much of the world. Is that a good thing?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/airfares-high-europe-world-explained-9023265/</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: The article discusses the significant increase in airfare prices since the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions that average airfares across Europe in summer 2023 were between 20% and 30% higher compared to 2019. The rise in prices can be attributed to increased demand for travel and disrupted supply chains. Airlines have experienced record profits due to the surge in demand, but their lack of capacity has led to higher prices. Supply chain issues, including delays in aircraft production and parts, have contributed to the price increase. Additionally, staffing problems at airports have also impacted costs. While some accuse airlines of price-gouging, airlines argue that prices reflect the current state of the industry. The article suggests that prices are unlikely to fall soon due to ongoing supply chain challenges and the industry's transition to more sustainable aviation fuels, which are more expensive. Some governments have considered interventions, such as capping airfares or setting minimum prices, to address the environmental impact of air travel.</description>

			<title>How a 500-year-old collection of pressed flowers sheds light on demography, human movements</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/herbarium-italy-discovery-history-plants-flowers-study-9023264/</link>
			<description>A recent article published by the Royal Society delves into the historical significance of a 500-year-old herbarium, a collection of pressed flowers and plant parts, created by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi between 1551 and 1586. The herbarium contains 5,000 carefully preserved specimens and provides insights into the history of Italy, particularly Bologna. Researchers studying the herbarium discovered evidence of human disturbance, habitat loss and transformation, climate change, and the invasion of alien species over the past five centuries. The paper highlights the impact of events like the discovery of America on floristic patterns in Europe and identifies extinct or unknown species. Ulisse Aldrovandi, who hailed from a noble family and demonstrated great curiosity, created the herbarium while tending to Bologna's botanical garden until his death. The herbarium also contains the oldest known specimens of various plant species introduced from the Americas, Africa, and Asia, providing a glimpse into the transformation of European flora and habitats over time.</description>

			<title>What WHO’s report has said on reduction in deaths due to TB in India, coverage of its treatments</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/indias-tb-mortality-report-2023-explained-9023266/</link>
			<description>India has made positive strides towards eliminating tuberculosis (TB) by 2025, but still has the highest incidence of the infection globally. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global TB Report 2023, India accounts for 27% of total TB cases worldwide. However, the report also highlights two positive trends in India. Firstly, there has been an increase in the reporting of TB cases, surpassing pre-pandemic levels with 24.2 lakh cases reported in 2022. Secondly, the coverage of treatment for TB has increased to 80%. 

A significant drop in TB mortality was also noted in the report due to the WHO accepting India's Sample Registration System dataset for calculations, resulting in a reduction of TB deaths from 4.94 lakhs in 2021 to 3.31 lakhs in 2022. This lowered India's contribution to global mortality from 36% in previous years to 26% in 2022.

The Indian government presented newer evidence and data, including in-country mathematical modeling and information from the government's ni-kshay portal, to support these revised estimates. The WHO reviewed and appreciated these efforts, leading to the publication of revised estimates in the global TB report.

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, India's reporting of TB cases has improved and exceeded pre-pandemic levels. India reported 24.2 lakh cases in 2022, similar to the number in 2019. It is worth noting that there is often a gap between the estimated number of TB cases based on mathematical models and the actual number of diagnosed individuals receiving treatment in a country.

Additionally, India was the only country to have completed a national TB prevalence survey since 2019, which informed the estimates of TB incidence in the country. The report also highlighted India's achievements in increasing TB treatment coverage by 19% compared to the previous year, with over 80% treatment coverage achieved, which is higher than the global pre-pandemic level of 70%.

The Indian government has undertaken several initiatives towards TB elimination, including active case finding, scaling up molecular testing, and engaging the private sector. The ni-kshay mitra program, which provides nutritional support to TB patients, has resulted in the adoption of over 11 lakh TB patients. India has set a target of no more than 44 new TB cases per lakh population by 2025 and aims to reduce mortality to 3 deaths per lakh population by the same year.

Achieving these targets will be challenging, as the current estimates indicate a higher number of cases and mortality than initially anticipated in the national strategic plan. However, India remains committed to its goal of eliminating TB and has made significant progress in increasing reporting and treatment coverage.</description>

			<title>The iconography of Goddess Lakshmi, from the Vedas to the modern masters of Indian painting</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/diwali-goddess-lakshmi-artists-paintings-culture-explained-9023269/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the various interpretations and visual representations of Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth and prosperity, across different regions and time periods in India. Lakshmi is commonly depicted resting on a lotus, accompanied by elephants. The Rig Veda mentions Lakshmi as a symbol of good fortune, while the Atharva Veda further develops her personality. One legend associates her with Vishnu's 'Kurma' avatar, where she emerges from the churning of the primeval ocean along with divine treasures. Coins from different periods depict Lakshmi standing on a lotus or flanked by elephants.

Portrayals from the second century at the Sanchi stupa show Lakshmi adorned with jewelry and seated on a lotus. At the Ellora caves, she is seen with her husband Vishnu and his mount Garuda. During the Gupta period, Lakshmi was highly revered and appeared on numerous coins, sometimes seated on a lion. The lotus is a significant symbol associated with Lakshmi, representing purity and enlightenment.

Today, the most common representation of Lakshmi is as Gaja Lakshmi, either seated or standing on a lotus, holding the flower in her hand, and accompanied by elephants. In North India, coins often flow from her hands, symbolizing material and spiritual wealth. In West Bengal, she is associated with a snowy owl, while in Eastern India, she bestows eight specific blessings known as Ashta Lakshmi. South Indian Tanjore paintings frequently depict her on a golden couch surrounded by lotuses and elephants.

The advent of the printing press made Lakshmi's imagery more accessible through affordable prints. Raja Ravi Varma's popular oleograph print portrays Lakshmi standing on a lotus in a stream, wearing a pink saree, and moderately adorned. Over time, artists like M.F. Husain and Atul Dodiya incorporated Lakshmi into their works, offering different interpretations and styles.</description>

			<title>As thousands of earthquakes rock Iceland, a volcanic eruption to follow?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/earthquake-swarm-iceland-volcanic-eruption-9023297/</link>
			<description>Iceland has declared a state of emergency after experiencing a swarm of 800 earthquakes in under 14 hours on the Reykjanes peninsula. Over 24,000 earthquakes have been recorded in the area since late October. The most powerful quake had a magnitude of 5.2 and occurred about 40 km from the capital city, Reykjavík. Iceland is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, making it prone to seismic activity. Scientists from the Iceland Met Office believe that the recent seismic activity is a precursor to a volcanic eruption. The movement of magma close to the Earth's surface exerts force on the surrounding rock, causing earthquake swarms. The Fagradalsfjall volcanic system, located southwest of Reykjavík, is the likely site of the eruption. The magma is currently about 800 meters below the Earth's surface, and an eruption could occur within days. The town of Grindavík has been evacuated as a precaution. Iceland is home to 33 active volcanoes, and eruptions are a common occurrence in the country.</description>

			<title>Moody’s lowers US credit rating outlook to ‘negative’: What does it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/moodys-us-credit-rating-outlook-negative-9023051/</link>
			<description>Moody's, a credit rating firm, has changed the US credit outlook from "stable" to "negative," indicating an increased chance of downgrading America's creditworthiness. This change could worsen fiscal concerns as it may make borrowing money more costly for investors and increase the government's debt repayment expenses. Moody's cites three main reasons for this decision: the threat of rising interest rates, a mounting debt burden, and a polarized Congress that is unable to agree on addressing the budget deficit. The firm believes that without effective fiscal policy measures, the US will continue to have large deficits, significantly weakening debt affordability. Political polarization further raises the risk of governments failing to reach consensus on a fiscal plan. The Biden administration blames the Republican Party for this outlook change, while the Republicans criticize President Biden's spending agenda. Other rating firms, such as Fitch, have also downgraded their outlook on the US. Credit ratings agencies analyze financials, business models, and economic management to rate companies and governments. These ratings help investors assess the risk associated with bonds and other debt instruments.</description>

			<title>Tonight, the spirits descend on earth: Ahead of Diwali, celebrating Bhoot Chaturdashi in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/diwali-bhoot-chaturdashi-narakasura-9022815/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Diwali, the festival of lights and the celebration of Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya, is associated with various traditions and rituals across India. The day before Diwali, known as Chhoti Diwali or Bhoot/Naraka Chaturdashi, holds significance in different regions. In Goa, effigies of the demon king Narakasura are burned to symbolize his defeat by Lord Krishna. This tradition gained prominence after Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule.

In West Bengal, on the day before Diwali, people observe Bhoot Chaturdashi, where it is believed that the souls of deceased ancestors visit their living relatives. To welcome them and ward off evil spirits, 14 oil lamps are placed in houses, and 14 different types of leafy vegetables are consumed.

In some places, Aghoris, Shaivite ascetics, perform puja and Tantric rituals on Bhoot Chaturdashi, often in cremation grounds. They may collect bones for use in their rituals. 

In Gujarat, on Kali Chaudash (the day before Diwali), a ritual called "kaklat kadhvo" takes place. Women offer fried snacks made from black gram flour to the souls of those who died unnatural deaths. The belief is that by performing this ritual, clamor and troubles will be eliminated.

On Bestu Varsh, the Gujarati New Year celebrated after Diwali, women perform Alas Kadhvi. They clean the house and dispose of household garbage outside the village while clanking an earthen pot, symbolizing the arrival of Goddess Lakshmi.

Gujarati businesses close their financial year and perform Chopda Poojan, worshipping traditional account books on Diwali. No business transactions occur until Labh Paacham, the fifth day of the new year, which is considered auspicious for opening new account books and launching new businesses.</description>

			<title>Can go all the way to Amarnath shrine by car, says BRO — here’s how</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/can-go-all-the-way-to-amarnath-shrine-by-car-says-bro-heres-how-9022265/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is working on restoring and improving the road to the Amarnath cave shrine in Kashmir's Lidder Valley. The BRO recently announced that motor vehicles were able to drive all the way to the holy cave for the first time after the upgradation of the Baltal road. The shrine, located at an altitude of 13,000 feet, can be reached through Pahalgam or Sonamarg. While the initial 16 km from Pahalgam to Chandanwari is motorable, the rest of the way is usually covered by trekking or riding a pony. The route from Sonamarg via Baltal is shorter and takes around eight hours on foot or less than six hours on a pony. Pilgrims can also reach the shrine by helicopter, although these services were stopped due to ecological concerns. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari announced a plan to improve access to the shrine, including the development of a motorable road and a tunnel. The project is expected to be tendered by the end of the year. The BRO has taken over the maintenance and improvement of the pedestrian tracks leading to the shrine.</description>

			<title>Baler: a machine for off-site management of farm stubble</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/baler-a-machine-for-off-site-management-of-farm-stubble-9022266/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The problem of farm fires in Punjab has led to a demand for machines that facilitate off-site stubble management. The use of baler machines, which compress agricultural residue into manageable bales, has become popular among farmers. These machines allow farmers to immediately plough the field and sow the next crop, effectively managing the stubble without resorting to burning it. Currently, there are around 2,000 baler machines operating in Punjab, with 1,268 of them highly subsidized under the crop residue management scheme. However, the number of balers is still inadequate to cover a significant portion of the rice fields in the state. Despite the initial lack of sales in the first two years, the last three years have seen an increase in the number of balers sold under subsidy.</description>

			<title>How baler machines help manage stubble?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/baler-a-machine-for-off-site-management-of-farm-stubble-9022266/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is addressing the issue of farm fires in Punjab, leading to a demand for machines that facilitate off-site stubble management. One such machine is the baler, of which there are currently around 2,000 operating in Punjab. The Centre's Crop Residue Management scheme subsidizes 1,268 of these machines. Farmers burn the stubble left behind after harvesting, causing significant air pollution. Environmentally-friendly methods, such as incorporating the stubble into the soil, have their drawbacks, including increased vulnerability to insect attacks. Baler machines compress the agricultural residue into bales, which can be transported to factories or dumping sites. This allows farmers to immediately plough the field and sow the next crop. However, the number of available balers in Punjab can only cover 15-18% of the rice fields. Despite being included under the Crop Residue Management scheme, no balers were sold in the first two years, but there has been an increase in sales in recent years, with 500 balers added this year.</description>

			<title>How rains in Delhi helped improve its air quality</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/rains-delhi-improve-air-quality-aqi-pollution-9021912/</link>
			<description>Light showers of rain in Delhi on Tuesday night and Wednesday led to clearer skies and improved air quality after days of high levels of pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in early November reached a severe level of 471, but improved to 376 on Friday morning, still classified as very poor. Rain can help reduce air pollution by washing away certain pollutants, particularly PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles. These particles, which are smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter respectively, come from sources such as vehicular pollution, factory emissions, construction activities, and road dust. After the rain, PM 2.5 levels decreased from 310 to 174, and PM 10 levels dropped from 400-480 to 291. However, the impact of rain on air pollution is temporary, and significant rainfall is needed to effectively wash away pollutants.</description>

			<title>Why will Saturn’s rings briefly ‘disappear’ from view in 2025?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/saturn-rings-disappear-2025-9021942/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the upcoming temporary disappearance of Saturn's rings from view in 2025. The reason for this phenomenon is due to Saturn's tilt and an optical illusion. Just like Earth, Saturn's axis of rotation is tilted, causing its ring system to also be tilted to the plane of Saturn's orbit. As Saturn revolves around the Sun, its rings appear to nod up and down when observed from Earth, resulting in a changing view of the rings.

Saturn takes 29.5 years to complete an orbit around the Sun, and every 13 to 15 years, the edge of its rings aligns directly with Earth. At this position, the rings reflect very little light and become essentially invisible. In March 2025, Saturn's rings will not be visible from Earth because they will be perfectly aligned with our line of sight. However, the rings will gradually reappear as Saturn continues its revolution around the Sun.

According to a 2018 report by NASA, Saturn may eventually lose its rings completely within the next 300 million years or even sooner. This would occur as the rings are being pulled into the planet by its gravity, causing ice particles to rain down under the influence of Saturn's magnetic field. The report estimates that an amount of water products equivalent to filling an Olympic-sized swimming pool could be drained from Saturn's rings in just half an hour.

Saturn acquired its rings relatively late in its four-billion-year lifespan, and the rings are not older than 100 million years. The report suggests that we are fortunate to witness Saturn's ring system during its middle lifetime, but it raises the possibility that we may have missed out on seeing giant ring systems around Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, which currently only have thin ringlets.</description>

			<title>A plan to join the Red Sea with Mediterranean — an alternative to the Suez Canal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ben-gurion-canal-suez-israel-9021520/</link>
			<description>Israel's desire to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza Strip and control the Palestinian enclave may be driven by the opportunity to create an alternative to the Suez Canal. The proposed Ben Gurion Canal Project would cut through the Negev Desert, connecting the Gulf of Aqaba to the Eastern Mediterranean coast. This would challenge Egypt's monopoly over the shortest route between Europe and Asia. The Suez Canal is currently congested and has been a source of conflict for decades. However, the Ben Gurion Canal Project faces logistical, political, and funding challenges, making it unlikely to be realized. The project would be complex, expensive, and longer than the Suez Canal. Additionally, the constant military threat in the region poses a risk to the operation of the canal.</description>

			<title>Delhi govt plans ‘cloud seeding’ to induce rains amid pollution: What is this process?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/delhi-rain-cloud-seeding-pollution-explained-9021286/</link>
			<description>The Delhi government is considering cloud seeding, also known as "artificial rain," to address the high levels of pollution in the city. Cloud seeding involves injecting clouds with salts like silver iodide, potassium iodide, or sodium chloride, which act as nuclei for the formation of cloud droplets. These droplets grow and eventually fall as rain, taking pollutants down with them. However, cloud seeding requires specific cloud conditions, such as a sufficient number of clouds and certain depths, which are more commonly present during the monsoon season. The success of cloud seeding in reducing pollution levels is uncertain, and further research is needed to understand its effectiveness in India's unique climate and complex cloud systems. While cloud seeding has been attempted in India before to combat drought conditions, it has never been specifically used to mitigate pollution. If successful, cloud seeding could provide temporary relief from pollution by washing away pollutants with rainfall.</description>

			<title>A political history of Madhya Pradesh, set for another straight BJP vs Congress fight</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/a-poltical-history-of-madhya-pradesh-set-for-another-straight-bjp-vs-congress-fight-9020839/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.#### Summary:

The state of Madhya Pradesh was created in 1956 through the merger of five different regions in central India. These regions included Central Provinces and Berar, Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, the princely state of Bhopal, and the Sironj tehsil of Rajasthan's Kota district. The States Reorganisation Commission advocated for the creation of a "compact, strong, and prosperous unit in Central India" [[1]](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1957-01-01_3_page002.html). The first Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh was Ravishankar Shukla, a Congress leader from Raipur. Since then, Madhya Pradesh has had several Chief Ministers from different political parties, including Kailash Nath Katju, Bhagwant Rao Mandloi, D P Mishra, and Shyama Charan Shukla.

In 2000, Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh as a separate state. Currently, Madhya Pradesh has a unicameral legislature with 230 seats and 29 Lok Sabha and 11 Rajya Sabha seats.

#### Historical Background:

Madhya Pradesh has a complex political history with various political parties vying for power. The Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), the precursor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was active in the state from the beginning. The Congress party dominated the political landscape, but the BJS gained strength over time. The Congress suffered setbacks in the 1962 Assembly polls, and the BJS won 78 seats in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. The Congress split in 1967, leading to the formation of the first non-Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, the Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD) government, led by Govind Narain Singh. However, the Congress returned to power in the state after a short period [[2]](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_01.pdf).

#### Chief Ministers and Political Shifts:

Madhya Pradesh has seen several Chief Ministers from different political parties. Notable Chief Ministers include Ravishankar Shukla, Kailash Nath Katju, Bhagwant Rao Mandloi, D P Mishra, Arjun Singh, Motilal Vora, Digvijaya Singh, Uma Bharti, and Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The Congress party and the BJP have been the main contenders for power in the state. The BJP formed its own government in Madhya Pradesh in 1990, but it was dismissed after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. The Congress returned to power in 1993, but the BJP regained power in 2003 and held it until 2018. In 2018, the Congress won the state elections, but due to political developments, Shivraj Singh Chouhan returned as Chief Minister in 2020 [[2]](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_01.pdf).

#### Current Political Scenario:

Currently, Madhya Pradesh is led by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who returned to power in March 2020 after the collapse of the Congress government led by Kamal Nath. The Congress party, led by veterans Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, is aiming to challenge the BJP's dominance in the upcoming 2023 Assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections [[2]](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_01.pdf).

Overall, Madhya Pradesh has witnessed political shifts, party dominance, and changes in leadership over the years, reflecting the dynamic nature of Indian politics.

			<title>Expert Explains | Regulating political funding: Rules around the world, India’s challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/expert-explains-political-funding-india-electoral-bonds-9020575/</link>
			<description>The recent Supreme Court hearing in India regarding the constitutionality of electoral bonds has brought attention to the issue of funding political parties, which is crucial to Indian democracy. Unlike the United States, where elections focus on individual candidates' campaigns, India's parliamentary system centers around parties. A comprehensive campaign finance framework for India should consider four key aspects: regulation of donations, expenditure limits, public financing, and disclosure requirements.

Donation limits aim to prevent a party from being influenced by a few large donors, including foreign citizens or companies. Various countries impose contribution limits on different types of donors, whereas others rely on expenditure limits. Expenditure limits ensure that political parties are not engaged in a financial arms race, freeing them from the pressure to compete for money instead of votes.

Public financing of political parties can be implemented through predetermined criteria based on their importance in the political system. For example, Germany provides public funds to parties based on past election performance, membership fees, and private donations. Another approach is the use of "democracy vouchers," as seen in Seattle, where eligible voters receive publicly funded vouchers they can donate to their preferred candidates. However, public funding alone does not address the challenge of regulating private money unless private funding is entirely banned.

Disclosure requirements serve as a less intrusive form of regulation, nudging voters against electing politicians involved in quid pro quo arrangements. Disclosures assume that providing information and subjecting it to public scrutiny can influence politicians' decisions and voters' choices. Striking a balance between transparency and donor anonymity is critical. Anonymity protects donors from potential retribution or extortion by those in power. Some jurisdictions allow anonymity for small donors while requiring disclosures for larger donations to address this concern.

India faces challenges in its campaign finance framework. Currently, individuals and organizations can donate unlimited amounts to political parties without any donation limits. There are no legal expenditure limits for parties, allowing them to spend as much as they want on campaigns. Parties only need to disclose donations above Rs 20,000, except when made through electoral bonds. This creates a loophole as parties can split large donations into smaller ones to avoid disclosure requirements.

Electoral bonds introduced in 2017 enable large donors to hide their contributions if they use official banking channels, undermining public scrutiny. The scheme also allows the party in power to access information about donors from other parties, contradicting the purpose of electoral bonds. Furthermore, the rise of political consultancies, campaign groups, and civil society organizations involved in online and offline political campaigns necessitates rethinking the assumptions underlying India's political funding framework.

In conclusion, a robust campaign finance framework for India should address donation regulation, expenditure limits, public financing, and disclosure requirements. Striking the right balance between transparency and anonymity is crucial, considering the challenges of private funding and the changing landscape of political campaigns.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hollywood-actors-writers-strike-deal-explained-9020526/</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: The strike in Hollywood involving the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has finally reached a tentative deal with film studios and streaming platforms. The strike, which lasted for about four months, caused a halt in the production of new films, TV shows, and other related activities. The deal aims to address issues related to workers' rights in the entertainment industry, particularly in the context of the growing influence of streaming platforms and the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. While the full details of the deal are yet to be released, it is expected to include compensation increases, provisions to protect members from AI threats, and improvements in pension and health benefits. The deal will undergo review by the SAG-AFTRA National Board and will be subject to a ratification vote by the members. Once approved, production is expected to resume, with projects like 'Deadpool 3' and a 'Gladiator' sequel among the first to restart.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court has issued guidelines to monitor the speedy disposal of criminal cases against Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs). The court called for the setting up of a "special bench" to monitor such cases and for the suo motu registration of cases by high courts. The directions were given in response to a plea filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, which sought speedy disposal of cases involving lawmakers and a lifetime ban on convicted politicians from contesting elections. The court ruled that priority should be given to cases punishable with death or life imprisonment, as well as cases punishable with 5 years imprisonment or more. The court also stated that high courts can issue similar orders and directions for effective disposal of such cases.</description>

			<title>How political funding influences electoral outcomes: what studies say</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/how-political-funding-influences-electoral-outcomes-what-studies-say-9020392/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is currently reviewing petitions challenging the validity of electoral bonds, with the ruling government claiming that they were introduced to make political funding more transparent. However, opposition parties argue that the system is transparent only for the ruling party. Available data shows that from 2017 to 2022, the BJP received 57% of all electoral bonds, amounting to over Rs 5,200 crore, while the Congress received only 10% of the funds (Rs 950 crore).

A study by the Centre for Media Studies revealed that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the most expensive ever, costing around Rs 55-60,000 crore, with the BJP accounting for 45% of the expenditure. Research suggests a linear relationship between political funding and electoral outcomes. Candidates from competitive parties were found to be approximately 20 times wealthier than candidates from non-competitive parties. Wealthier candidates had a higher likelihood of winning elections.

Similar correlations between electoral funding and election outcomes have been observed in studies conducted outside of India, including in US congressional elections and legislative elections in Taiwan.

The Supreme Court raised concerns about selective anonymity in the electoral bonds scheme, where the ruling party could identify donors while the opposition could not. The Election Commission of India and the Reserve Bank of India also expressed objections to the scheme, citing the potential for misuse and the involvement of shell companies to channel black money into politics. However, the ECI later supported electoral bonds.

In addition to the electoral bonds scheme, several other laws were amended, including the Reserve Bank of India Act, Companies Act, Income Tax Act 1961, Representation of the People Act, and Foreign Contribution Regulations Act. These amendments increased the role of political funding in electoral outcomes by removing restrictions on the percentage of profits a company could donate and eliminating the requirement for companies to have three years of profits before making political donations.</description>

			<title>Why Mumbai will not host the Indo-Pak semi final (if it happens)</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/mumbai-wankhede-india-pakistan-cricket-shiv-sena-9020286/</link>
			<description>India and Pakistan may have a chance to face each other in the World Cup semifinals. India is currently at the top of the leaderboard, while Pakistan needs to secure the fourth spot to set up a clash with India. However, if this match does happen, it will be played in Kolkata instead of Mumbai due to security concerns. Pakistan is currently tied with New Zealand in terms of points but behind in net run rate. If New Zealand loses their final game, Pakistan can simply defeat England to qualify for the semis. Otherwise, they would need to win by a significant margin to overtake New Zealand. In any case, Pakistan can only qualify as the fourth-placed team, leading them to face India in the semifinal. As per an arrangement with the Pakistan Cricket Board, any semifinal featuring Pakistan will be played in Kolkata instead of Mumbai due to previous security concerns. The Shiv Sena, a political party in Maharashtra, has been strongly opposed to Pakistan and Indo-Pak cricket matches due to historical reasons. They have previously disrupted matches and expressed their disagreement with playing against Pakistan. Due to these security concerns and past incidents, Pakistan's matches have been scheduled in venues other than Mumbai.</description>

			<title>Why Kerala’s contributory pension scheme was under review, and what a govt committee has said on retaining it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-govt-committee-nps-pension-scheme-report-9019907/</link>
			<description>A report from a committee appointed by the Kerala government to review the state's contributory pension scheme has been made public following a Supreme Court ruling. The committee was formed in 2018 to examine the legal and financial implications of revoking the scheme, which was implemented in Kerala in 2013. The report, submitted in April 2021 but only recently disclosed, suggests increasing the state government's contribution to the scheme from 10% to 14%. It also recommends allowing death-cum-retirement gratuity for employees enrolled in the contributory pension scheme. The report highlights that continuing the scheme would reduce pension expenditure as a percentage of total revenue receipts by 2040. However, if the government decides to revoke the scheme, pension expenditure will remain above 20% of total revenue receipts until at least 2060. The article mentions concerns about low annuities received by those retired under the scheme and the potential risks associated with investment in assets. Some states in India have reintroduced a statutory pension scheme in response to demands from government employees to return to the old system.</description>

			<title>1 year of Project Cheetah: Hits, misses and paradigm shift ahead</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-year-of-project-cheetah-9019478/</link>
			<description>India's Project Cheetah, which aims to introduce African cheetahs into the wild in India, has reported short-term successes. These include a 50% survival rate for introduced cheetahs, the establishment of home ranges, the birth of cubs in Kuno, and revenue generation for local communities. However, there are concerns about the project's long-term success. Many cheetahs have spent limited time in the wild, falling short of the expected months. The project has lost 40% of its adult population due to deaths and unfit individuals. Only three cheetahs have spent an extended period in the wild, while others have been kept in enclosures. Reproduction has occurred, but one female was captive-raised and her cubs were born in captivity. The project has boosted local livelihoods but faces challenges in maintaining genetic diversity and establishing a self-sustaining population. The solution may lie in creating a meta-population scattered across central and western India, aided by periodic translocations to maintain genetic viability. However, this approach could weaken the case for natural wildlife dispersal and forest connectivity.</description>

			<title>Possible answer to farm fires: New rice variety can replace Pusa-44</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/possible-answer-to-farm-fires-new-rice-variety-can-replace-pusa-44-9019491/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ordered the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to immediately stop the burning of crop stubble in order to reduce pollution. The court specifically mentioned a paddy variety grown mostly in Punjab as a major cause of stubble burning. Although the article doesn't name the variety, it is likely referring to Pusa-44, which is a long-duration variety that takes 155-160 days to mature. Due to the limited time for field preparation before sowing the next wheat crop, farmers resort to burning the remaining stubble after harvesting.

Pusa-44 is attractive to farmers because it is a high-yielding variety, producing 35-36 quintals per acre. However, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) has developed an improved version called Pusa-2090 that matures in just 120-125 days while maintaining high yields. Pusa-2090 is a cross between Pusa-44 and CB-501, an early-maturing Japonica rice line obtained from the International Rice Research Institute. The new variety combines the benefits of higher yields and shorter maturation period.

Pusa-2090 has been tested in various trials and farmer fields in the Delhi-NCR region, and it has been officially approved for cultivation in Delhi and Odisha. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are also advocating for its release, as it can provide the same yields as Pusa-44 but with a shorter duration. One farmer in Punjab has already test-planted Pusa-2090 and reported good yield results.

In the current season, Punjab farmers have planted over 5 lakh hectares with Pusa-44, accounting for more than 17% of the state's total paddy area. The problem of stubble burning is less prevalent in basmati varieties, which produce softer straw and have been grown in a smaller area this year. The only variety cultivated in a larger area than Pusa-44 is PR-126, bred by the Punjab Agricultural University. However, it has lower yields compared to Pusa-44.

Overall, the development of the Pusa-2090 variety provides a potential solution to stubble burning and its associated pollution problems.</description>

			<title>What’s Gaza’s Ministry of Health — and how does it calculate the death toll?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gaza-ministry-of-health-9019316/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the death toll in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel's bombings and the role of Gaza's Ministry of Health in providing casualty estimates. The ministry, controlled by the Hamas government, is responsible for supervising health services in Gaza. Its casualty estimates are widely cited by news organizations, human rights groups, and international entities like the United Nations.

While Gaza's Hamas government controls the health ministry, it operates separately from its political and security agencies. The Palestinian Authority (PA) retains power over health and education services in Gaza, even though Hamas defeated it in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. The PA administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has its own health ministry in Ramallah. It still provides medical equipment, pays salaries to the ministry's employees, and handles patient transfers from Gaza to Israeli hospitals.

The ministry calculates the death toll by collecting data from hospital administrators who record every wounded person and dead body. This information is entered into a computerized system shared with the health ministry's spokesperson. The ministry also receives data from other sources such as the Palestinian Red Crescent. It releases casualty updates every few hours, providing the number of dead and wounded categorized by gender but without disclosing names, ages, or locations. However, in response to doubts raised by the US, they released a detailed report listing every Palestinian killed in the war so far.

According to Human Rights Watch, the ministry's figures are generally accurate based on their past investigations of Gazan casualties. In previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas, UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Palestinian Red Crescent have also relied on these numbers.

			<title>How climate change is displacing animals</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-displacing-animals-9019249/</link>
			<description>A new analysis suggests that extreme weather events linked to climate change have a more detrimental impact on native species compared to non-native species. The study, published in the journal Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, analyzed 443 studies on the responses of native and non-native species to extreme weather. It found that non-native species tended to show more positive responses or fewer negative responses to extreme weather, while native species suffered population decline, loss of geographic distribution, and struggled to recover. The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of global warming on biodiversity. However, some researchers caution that the study's conclusions may be biased due to the limited representation of regions and species in the analyzed studies. Nonetheless, the study underscores the need to protect native species and focus on their recovery in areas affected by extreme weather events.</description>

			<title>Mobile phones might cause lower sperm count: what new research shows</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/mobile-phones-lower-sperm-count-research-9019250/</link>
			<description>A recent study from Switzerland suggests that there may be a link between mobile phone use and declining sperm counts. After analyzing semen samples from over 2,800 young men, researchers found that those who reported higher mobile phone usage had lower sperm concentration. However, there was no difference in sperm motility or morphology between different types of phone users, nor did the storage location of the phone affect sperm concentration. The study was conducted between 2005 and 2018, and the association between high phone use and low sperm count was more significant during the earlier years of the study. The researchers believe this may be due to the transition from older to newer technologies with lower phone output power.

This study adds mobile phones to a growing list of factors that have been found to potentially impact fertility, including smoking, obesity, alcohol, stress, and certain chemicals. Previous research on this topic has mainly been conducted on mice or sperm in vitro, making this study particularly valuable as it was carried out in real-world conditions. However, some experts caution that other factors related to lifestyle or occupation may be influencing these results and that there is currently no confirmed explanation for the observed decline in sperm quality among frequent phone users.

While the findings may cause concern for men planning to have children, researchers advise against making any drastic changes based solely on this study. Keeping phones in a bag and reducing usage can be relatively easy steps to take, but there is no evidence yet that these actions improve sperm quality. Further research, such as randomized controlled trials, is needed to better understand the biology and mechanisms behind this potential association. In the meantime, individuals are encouraged to make informed decisions regarding their phone use while keeping in mind that the current evidence is inconclusive.</description>

			<title>SC says cracker order applies to country, not just NCR: What types of fireworks are allowed, and where</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/diwali-fireworks-sc-green-crackers-9019216/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has clarified that its ban on the use of barium and other banned chemicals in firecrackers applies to the entire country, not just the National Capital Region. The court's order, which was reiterated in October 2021, bans the production and sale of all crackers except "green crackers" and those with reduced emissions. It also prohibits the use of barium salts in fireworks and sets limits on noise levels. Barium and other chemicals are banned due to their harmful impact on human health, including respiratory irritation, skin allergies, breathing difficulties, and cancer. Green crackers, which emit less-harmful chemicals and release water vapor as a dust suppressant, were developed by a network of CSIR labs. These crackers fall into three categories: SWAS, which releases water vapor when burst; STAR, which emits reduced particulate matter and sound intensity; and SAFAL, which minimizes the use of aluminum and emits less noise.</description>

			<title>India’s Energy Conservation Building Code, 2017: Why the IEA called it a ‘notable exception’ among developing countries</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/energy-conservation-building-code-2017-iea-9018786/</link>
			<description>India has been recognized as a standout among developing economies for its energy efficiency building codes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The agency's World Energy Outlook 2023 report highlighted India's Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), which sets minimum energy standards for commercial buildings. Currently, 23 states in India have rules in place to enforce ECBC compliance, while larger states like Maharashtra and Gujarat are still in the process of drafting rules. Buildings in India account for 30% of total electricity consumption, a figure expected to rise to 50% by 2042. The ECBC aims to enable energy savings of 25-50% in compliant buildings and covers components such as building design, lighting systems, HVAC systems, and electrical power systems. The updated 2017 code includes priorities such as renewable energy integration and passive building design strategies. While ECBC acts as a national standard, states have the flexibility to modify the code to suit regional needs. However, not all states have fully implemented the code, with five states yet to notify ECBC rules. The IEA recognizes India's efforts in building codes and highlights the potential for significant energy savings in the sector. The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022 expands the scope of building codes in India and makes the residential building energy code mandatory. The government is expected to update the residential building code in the coming months.</description>

			<title>Electoral Bonds and Electoral Trusts: What are they, and how do they differ?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/electoral-bonds-electoral-trusts-9018591/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has reserved its judgment on the challenge to the Indian government's Electoral Bonds Scheme after a three-day hearing. The controversial scheme, introduced in 2018, replaced the previous Electoral Trusts Scheme. Under the new scheme, donor anonymity is ensured, whereas under the previous scheme, electoral trusts were required to submit reports on contributions and donations to political parties. The number of registered trusts has ranged from three to 17, but only a few make donations each year.

The Electoral Trusts Scheme requires trusts to donate 95% of contributions received to registered political parties. The scheme provides transparency regarding contributors and beneficiaries when there is only one contributor and one beneficiary. However, when multiple contributors and recipients are involved, it is difficult to determine which company is funding which party.

On the other hand, Electoral Bonds are exempt from disclosure requirements, providing privacy for donors. Political funding through both schemes increased after the introduction of Electoral Bonds, with the majority of donations coming through this newer scheme. From 2017-18 to 2021-22, parties received a total of Rs 1,631 crore through Electoral Trusts, while Rs 9,208 crore was donated through Electoral Bonds.

Between March 2018 and October 2023, electoral bonds worth over Rs 14,000 crore were sold by the State Bank of India. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) received 72% of the total funds donated through electoral trusts, higher than its share of funding through electoral bonds (57%). The Congress received 10% of the total funding from electoral bonds and 9.7% from electoral trusts. The Trinamool Congress received 8.3% of electoral bond funds, while the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) received about 1% of total funds given by trusts.

According to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms, more than 55% of political party funding comes through electoral bonds. For some parties, these bonds have become the sole source of contributions, as seen with the BJD declaring that its entire income in 2021-22 came from electoral bonds.</description>

			<title>How ignored landslide warnings led to Subansiri running dry</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-ignored-landslide-warning-led-to-subansiri-river-running-dry-explained-9018295/</link>
			<description>The Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project in India experienced another setback after a portion of the hill next to the dam collapsed into the reservoir. This blocked the only functional diversion tunnel and halted the flow of water downstream. Construction of the project, which began in 2005, has faced delays due to local opposition and design changes. The deadline for commissioning the first two units has been extended multiple times, with the current deadline set for March 2024. The project authority is now focusing on slope stabilization and may build a temporary barrier to isolate the under-construction spillway gates. The potential impact on the riverine ecosystem and aquatic life forms remains uncertain.</description>

			<title>India’s hypertension map: How different states, regions fare</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/india-hypertension-state-district-wise-break-up-9018281/</link>
			<description>A recent analysis of data from the National Family Health Survey in India, published in the journal JAMA, reveals significant variations in the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension within Indian states and districts. The study indicates that national mean values of hypertension mask substantial variation at the district level. The researchers recommend implementing targeted and decentralized solutions to address this issue.

The study highlights the existing knowledge among doctors that a large number of individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed. Even among those diagnosed, many do not initiate treatment, and among those who do, few are able to effectively control their blood pressure. The data shows that only one in three individuals receive a diagnosis, one in five receive treatment, and one in twelve achieve blood pressure control.

At the state level, the prevalence of hypertension in southern states was higher than the national average, with 29.9% of the population affected compared to 26.8% across India. However, the proportion of people diagnosed, treated, and under control in these states was higher than the rest of the country.

There were also significant variations within states at the district level. For instance, in Meghalaya, the prevalence of hypertension was similar across districts, but the proportion of those diagnosed varied significantly. Similarly, in Karnataka, different districts demonstrated varying levels of treatment and control despite similar prevalence rates.

The study also examined the impact of age, gender, socio-economic conditions, and education level on hypertension. While men are more likely to have hypertension, the data surprisingly showed that women are more likely to be diagnosed, receive treatment, and have their blood pressure under control. Older individuals had higher rates of prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control compared to younger individuals. Among socio-economic conditions, the wealthiest fifth of the population had the highest rates of prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control. Additionally, while the prevalence was similar between those with no schooling and those who completed Class 11, the latter group had higher rates of diagnosis, treatment, and control.

The district-level breakdown of data can assist state governments in allocating resources for healthcare. By identifying districts with higher prevalence or lacking screening and diagnostic facilities, local governments can plan interventions accordingly. The paper emphasizes the importance of continuum of care rather than just screening and diagnosis for managing chronic conditions like hypertension. It suggests that regular availability of medicines, closer healthcare centers, digitization of records, and follow-ups are crucial aspects of hypertension management.

According to a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO), India could prevent nearly 4.6 million deaths by 2040 if half of all hypertensive individuals achieve blood pressure control. In line with this, the Indian government has launched an initiative to provide treatment to 75 million people with hypertension or diabetes by 2025. Successfully controlling hypertension will require not only increased infrastructure but also active screening, timely treatment, accessible medicines, and regular follow-ups.</description>

			<title>Jharkhand launches drive to grant land titles under FRA: Why now, challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-land-titles-fra-9017751/</link>
			<description>The Jharkhand government has launched a special drive called Abua Bir Dishom Abhiyan to provide land title certificates to individuals and communities under the Forests Rights Act. The act grants self-cultivation and habitation rights to Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers. The drive comes after nine years and aims to address the low number of titles distributed compared to other states like Chhattisgarh. The government is setting up a dedicated website and mobile application for stakeholders to track the application process. It has also instructed the formation of Forest Rights Committees at the village level and monitoring committees at higher levels. However, challenges include changing the mindset of forest officials who view forest dwellers as encroachers, as well as hierarchical issues in the verification process. The government is working with partners such as the Foundation of Ecological Security and the Indian School of Business to overcome these challenges.</description>

			<title>Trump ahead of Biden in key US states, finds survey: What it means, why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/doanld-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-support-explained-9017695/</link>
			<description>A recent survey conducted by Siena College and The New York Times found that former US President Donald Trump is leading current President Joe Biden as the preferred choice for voters in five out of six swing states. These swing states, which are crucial for securing a victory, were all won by Biden in the 2020 election. The survey included over 3,662 voters from these states and revealed that 48% would vote for Trump in the next election, while 44% supported Biden's re-election bid. Additionally, 59% of respondents disapproved of Biden's handling of his job as president, and 67% believed the country is headed in the wrong direction. Despite this, 56% of voters held an unfavorable view of Trump. The survey also found that economic issues were the most important factor for voters when deciding on a candidate, with 57% citing jobs, taxes, or the cost of living as their top concern. Furthermore, 52% of voters described the current state of the US economy as "poor," despite its attempts to recover from the pandemic. The survey also highlighted that while many voters had concerns about Trump's impact on democracy, they believed he would do a better job than Biden on the economy, immigration, national security, and the Israel-Palestine issue. The article also noted that Biden's traditional voting base, including women, younger people, and people of color, seemed to be less supportive in these swing states. The article concludes by mentioning that pre-election polling has often been inaccurate, and despite the current polls, the results could still turn out differently. It also highlights the decline in Biden's approval rating since taking office, which currently stands at around 38%. However, Democrats have defended their record, pointing out that they performed better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections.</description>

			<title>Ten things Delhi-NCR needs to do to tackle air pollution: What an IIT Kanpur study said</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ten-things-delhi-ncr-needs-tackle-air-pollution-9017406/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has criticized the governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan for not stopping farmers from burning stubble, as poor air quality continues to affect the Delhi-NCR region. The court also directed the Delhi government to prevent the burning of municipal solid waste. These measures, along with the implementation of the odd-even car scheme, may help reduce pollution levels, but a comprehensive approach is needed to address the problem. A report by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur suggests ten steps that should be taken to control air pollution in the region. These include stopping the use of coal in hotels and restaurants, promoting the use of LPG for cooking, ending municipal solid waste burning, and covering construction materials at construction sites. The report also recommends the use of windbreakers and telescopic chutes during concrete batching, promoting the use of electric and BS-VI vehicles, installing de-sox-ing and de-nox-ing systems at power plants, and installing vapour recovery systems at petrol pumps. Additionally, biomass burning should be limited, and measures should be taken to tackle fly ash.</description>

			<title>A daily glass of goat milk? Here’s what you need to know.</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goat-milk-gujarat-9017201/</link>
			<description>The Agriculture Minister of Gujarat, Raghavji Patel, has requested a proposal on branding and marketing goat milk, which is currently sold informally. A meeting was held with representatives from various organizations on October 26 to discuss the potential for goat milk in the state. A survey estimated Gujarat's goat population at 50.55 lakh in 2021-22, with goat milk production accounting for 2% of the state's total milk production. The Gujarat State Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which owns Amul, expressed interest in processing and marketing goat milk if the Surendranagar District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union agrees to collect it. Procurement by Amul could benefit goat and sheep herders by providing a formal mechanism for selling their produce. Pastoralists currently sell goat milk to tea stalls and hotels or use it to make mava, an ingredient for sweets. The involvement of large dairy federations like Amul could spur the establishment of organized goat farms and create a potentially large market for goat milk. However, it is unlikely that goats will become primarily milk-producing animals due to the limited quantity of milk they produce daily. Goats are traditionally reared for both milk and meat. Despite the separate branding and marketing of goat milk increasing pastoralists' earnings, some goats will still end up in slaughterhouses to maintain the viability of the herd. Goat meat is in high demand, with thousands of goats being traded every week in Ahmedabad's goat market. Additionally, goat milk has health benefits such as being easily digestible and suitable for neonates and lactose-intolerant individuals.</description>

			<title>PM 2.5, Sulphur Dioxide, and more: What are the pollutants in our air, and how they impact health</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/air-pollution-aqi-source-health-impact-explained-9016879/</link>
			<description>Air pollution levels in North India have raised concerns about the air quality index (AQI), with Delhi recording an AQI score of over 400, categorizing the air as 'severe' pollution. The AQI is a measure that simplifies complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number for better understanding. The pollutants measured in the AQI include PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, carbon, etc. Fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 can easily enter the circulatory system and cause chronic diseases like asthma, heart attacks, and respiratory problems. Nitrogen dioxide is emitted from fuel burning sources like vehicles and power plants, and short-term exposure to high levels can worsen respiratory diseases such as asthma. Ozone, usually present in the upper atmosphere, becomes a significant air pollutant at surface levels and increases the risk of hospital admissions for certain pulmonary diseases. Sulphur dioxide, mainly emitted by burning fossil fuels, can harm the cardiovascular system and cause respiratory illnesses. Ammonia, largely released by fertilizer use and livestock waste in India, contributes to aerosol pollution that is damaging to human health and also harms plants and water quality. Lead, a toxic metal, can cause intellectual disability and behavioral disorders, particularly in children. Carbon monoxide, a dangerous gas released by the burning of carbon-containing fuels, can lead to unconsciousness or death in high levels and long-term exposure increases the risk of heart disease.</description>

			<title>Can Delhi’s odd-even policy help in preventing health issues? Here’s what experts, studies say</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/delhi-odd-even-policy-health-impact-pollution-explained-9016616/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Experts argue that implementing an odd-even vehicle restriction policy may not effectively address health-related impacts of pollution. While there is some evidence suggesting that this policy can reduce pollutant levels during daytime hours, the available evidence lacks consistency. Dr. Sagnik Dey, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, states that odd-even is not a long-term solution as it does not significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the road and the reduction in emissions does not always translate to a reduction in air concentrations. Dr. Karan Madan, from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Delhi, adds that even a 20% decrease in PM2.5 levels is still harmful to health. Long-term exposure to pollution is associated with various health risks. Studies have shown a decrease in particulate matter levels when odd-even schemes are implemented, but the reduction is typically only around 5 to 10%. The reduction in PM levels could be due to reduced car numbers, faster traffic, and reduced engine idling time. The highest reductions are observed during mid-day, not early morning when cold temperatures keep pollutants close to the ground. Measures such as phasing out vehicles and promoting electric vehicles are expected to show results in the future. In the meantime, regional implementation of pollution control measures and the use of air purifiers at schools are suggested.</description>

			<title>Odd-even scheme back in Delhi: Has it helped bring down air pollution in the past?</title>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi government has announced the return of the odd-even road apportioning scheme for a week after Diwali to combat severe air pollution. The average air quality index (AQI) reading in Delhi was 421 on Monday, with PM 2.5 being the prominent pollutant. The odd-even scheme allows cars to ply on alternate days based on their registration number, aiming to reduce the number of cars on the road by roughly half. The scheme was previously implemented in 2016 and 2019. Several categories of vehicles are exempt from the scheme. The details of the new scheme have not been announced yet.</description>

			<title>Delhi odd-even scheme: Its impact on vehicular pollution levels, and why it is not a silver bullet</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-pollution-odd-even-scheme-no-silver-bullet-given-the-exemptions-but-cuts-toxic-emissions-9016425/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the limitations of reducing the number of vehicles on the road as a solution to air pollution. While this action can help reduce peak pollution levels, it is not a comprehensive solution because two-wheelers and taxis, which contribute significantly to emissions, are exempted. Transport is the top contributor to pollutants, so it cannot be ignored when air quality is severe. However, experts find it difficult to estimate exactly how much pollution would come down with this scheme due to various factors such as emissions from outside Delhi and exemptions within the subset of vehicles affected by the restrictions. A study on a previous odd-even scheme implemented in Delhi showed that it had failed to mitigate air pollution effectively. The article emphasizes that emergency actions like reducing vehicle numbers are not a silver bullet and should be seen as part of a larger set of measures to address air pollution.</description>

			<title>Sri Lanka’s batter Angelo Mathews timed out: What is the rule?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/sri-lanka-angelo-mathews-timed-out-9015903/</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: In the recent World Cup clash between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews faced a unique situation. He was timed out, which is a first in international cricket. Mathews was not ready to face his first delivery after coming in at No 6 for Sri Lanka due to an issue with the strap on his helmet. According to the playing conditions of the men's cricket World Cup 2023, a batsman must be ready to receive the ball within 2 minutes of a dismissal or retirement. Failure to do so results in being considered out. It's worth noting that the bowler does not receive credit for the dismissal in such cases. This incident brings back memories of a similar situation involving Sourav Ganguly during a test match between South Africa and India in 2007. Ganguly was close to being timed out due to a delay in entering the field after the fall of early wickets. The Indian team was not aware of the situation, leading to confusion. However, the South Africa team decided not to appeal, considering the exceptional circumstances.</description>

			<title>GRAP Stage 4 implemented in Delhi-NCR amid severe air pollution: What does it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/grap-stage-4-delhi-pollution-9015845/</link>
			<description>The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has invoked measures under Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India due to the severe air pollution. GRAP is a set of emergency measures that are implemented when air quality reaches a certain threshold. Stage 4 is activated when the Air Quality Index (AQI) rises to the 'Severe+' category, which is above 450. As part of these measures, diesel four-wheelers that are not BS-VI compliant and trucks are prohibited from entering Delhi, while petrol cars can continue to operate. Construction and demolition activities are also banned, and state governments have the option to discontinue physical classes and implement work-from-home policies. The Delhi government has directed schools to suspend physical classes, except for classes 10 and 12, until November 10, and will reintroduce the odd-even scheme from November 13-20.</description>

			<title>Bhutan King’s India visit: Recalling Operation All Clear, which Bhutan launched against Assam’s insurgent groups</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bhutan-king-visit-india-recalling-operation-all-clear-9015464/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk of Bhutan will be meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after completing a three-day visit to Assam, marking the first-ever visit by a Bhutanese monarch to the state. The visit is significant as it comes after a tense period in which the relationship between Assam and Bhutan became complicated due to the presence of insurgent groups from Assam in Bhutanese territory. Bhutan launched its first military operation in 140 years, called "Operation All Clear," in 2003 to flush out the militants. During the operation, the Royal Bhutan Army dealt a crippling blow to the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, and the Kamatapur Liberation Organization (KLO). The presence of these groups had strained diplomatic relations between Bhutan and India, as well as impacted development and economic activities in Bhutan. The crackdown was prompted by the direct threat to Bhutan's sovereignty and national security posed by the insurgents. Additionally, there were fears that the insurgent groups would supply arms to the ethnic Nepalese Lhotshampas, potentially fueling an ethnic insurgency in southern Bhutan. The operation resulted in the capture or killing of at least 650 insurgents, including top leaders of ULFA, KLO, and NDFB. The Indian army provided logistical and medical assistance during the operation and sealed the Indo-Bhutan border to prevent militants from escaping into India.</description>

			<title>The double-whammy from India’s falling farm exports</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-double-whammy-from-falling-farm-exports-9015094/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India's agricultural exports have declined by 11.6% year-on-year in April-September, partly due to the government's restrictions on shipments of various commodities and a decrease in global prices. The value of farm commodity exports was $23.6 billion in April-September 2023, compared to $26.7 billion in the same period last year. Imports also decreased from $19.3 billion to $16.2 billion, resulting in a slight dip in the agricultural trade surplus. India's farm exports reached record highs in 2021-22 and 2022-23 but are expected to decline in 2023-24 due to lower global prices and improved supply situations. The government's bans and restrictions on exports, driven by domestic availability and inflation concerns, have also contributed to the decline in agricultural exports. The effects of these measures can be seen in the significant drop in wheat, rice, and sugar exports. Declining international prices not only affect the competitiveness of India's agricultural exports but also make farmers more vulnerable to imports, as seen in cotton and edible oils. The focus on controlling food inflation ahead of national elections has led to continued imports of edible oil and pulses while restricting exports of cereals, sugar, and onions, which negatively impacts farmers.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains | Bhutan’s King in India as Beijing-Thimpu speed up border talks: What’s happening, why New Delhi is concerned</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bhutans-king-in-india-beijing-thimpu-border-talks-9014771/</link>
			<description>The King of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, visited New Delhi, India, receiving a warm welcome from the External Affairs Minister. This visit comes at a time when Bhutan is engaged in border talks with China, causing some concern in New Delhi. Bhutan's Foreign Minister recently made declarations in Beijing expressing a desire to settle the border dispute quickly and establish diplomatic relations with China. This has caught India off guard. Talks between Bhutan and China were suspended after the Doklam standoff in 2017, but engagement continued during this period. Bhutan sees several benefits in normalizing relations with China, including the opportunity to establish diplomatic ties with a P5 country. India's main concern is the strategic implications of Bhutan normalizing relations with China, particularly the potential loss of control over the Doklam plateau. Experts in China celebrate the perceived success in their relationship with Bhutan and view it as a diplomatic breakthrough in South Asia.</description>

			<title>India to bring in a National Security Strategy: what is it, why is it important?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-to-bring-in-a-national-security-strategy-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-9014489/</link>
			<description>India has started the process of developing a national security strategy, which is being compiled by the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) with inputs from various central ministries and departments. The exact timeline for completion is unknown, but multiple ministries have already submitted their inputs. This is the first time India is creating such a strategy, which will outline the country's security objectives, including traditional and non-traditional threats, and the measures to address them. The strategy will likely cover a range of challenges, such as financial and economic security, information warfare, and vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure. Developed countries like the US, the UK, and Russia already have national security strategies, and China and Pakistan have also established their own. The need for a national security strategy in India has been discussed for years, and it is hoped that this strategy will provide a framework for military and security reforms. The lack of a strategy in the past may have been due to hesitation at the political level and concerns about accountability in defense management.</description>

			<title>Despite govt’s efforts, why onion prices remain high</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/despite-govts-efforts-why-onion-prices-remain-high-9014412/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has been taking measures to control the rising prices of onions, including imposing an export duty of 40% and a minimum export price of $800/tonne. Additionally, the government has formed a buffer stock of 5 lakh tonnes of onions. However, these interventions have had limited success in reducing prices. The delay in the monsoon and extensive damage to the harvested crop earlier in the year have caused higher than usual onion prices. The late arrival and delayed transplanting of the kharif crop have further worsened the supply chain mismatch. As a result, onion prices are expected to remain high until the new crop arrives at the end of the month.</description>

			<title>Pakistan’s complicated relationship with the two Talibans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistans-relationship-taliban-ttp-9014085/</link>
			<description>Pakistani forces have successfully thwarted a terrorist attack on the Mianwali Training Air Base of the Pakistan Air Force. The Tehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan (TJP), an affiliate of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attack. This comes at a time when Pakistan is forcibly expelling Afghan refugees, drawing criticism from the UN and rights groups. Militant and terrorist activity in Pakistan has surged in recent years, with the TTP becoming the largest militant organization fighting against the Pakistani state. The rise of the TTP can be traced back to Pakistan's support of Islamic fundamentalism and its delicate balancing act between supporting the Taliban and appeasing the US. Despite friendly relations with the Afghan Taliban, they have not helped Pakistan deal with the TTP, leading to increased attacks on military installations.</description>

			<title>Can a trans woman invoke the Domestic Violence Act? SC to consider</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-trans-woman-domestic-violence-act-9013661/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has agreed to examine whether a transgender woman who underwent sex-reassignment surgery can be considered an "aggrieved person" under the Domestic Violence Act. The case involves a trans woman who filed for interim maintenance under the Act, claiming to fall under the definition of an aggrieved person. The husband appealed against this, arguing that the trans person did not fall within the definition of "aggrieved person" as it was conferred on women in domestic relationships. The court will now consider whether the trans woman can be recognized as a woman under the Act.</description>

			<title>Hypertension: How its prevalence, diagnosis, control, and treatment varies across India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hypertension-care-india-9013493/</link>
			<description>A recent study analyzing national family health survey data in India has revealed significant variation in the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension among different states and districts. The study emphasizes the need for localized decision-making to ensure continuous care and control of hypertension. The national data shows that a large proportion of individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed, and among those diagnosed, many do not initiate treatment or fail to control their blood pressure effectively. The study also highlights the variability of hypertension care at the state and district levels. The prevalence of hypertension in southern states was higher than the national average, but the proportion of people on treatment and with controlled blood pressure was higher in these states. The study also found considerable variability within districts. Factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic conditions, and education level also play a role in the continuum of care for hypertension. The study suggests that analyzing inter-state and inter-district variability can help state governments allocate resources more effectively. Local governments need to ensure that medicines are readily available, improve access to screening and diagnostic facilities, and implement regular follow-ups. The study underscores the importance of a continuum of care for hypertension, beyond just diagnosis and screening, and calls for active screening, availability of medicines, and proper follow-up to control hypertension effectively in India.</description>

			<title>Elvish Yadav case: How is snake venom used as a recreational drug?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/elvish-yadav-snake-venom-recreational-drug-9013339/</link>
			<description>Reality television show Bigg Boss OTT winner and YouTuber Elvish Yadav has been booked by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police for allegedly selling snake venom at rave parties in the National Capital Region. The police recovered a significant amount of snake venom, as well as various snakes, from the accused. Snake venom is commonly used as a recreational drug and is part of a multimillion-dollar illicit industry. The smuggling of snake venom was highlighted in November 2022 when the Border Security Force in West Bengal seized a large quantity of venom. However, there is a lack of scientific study on the recreational use of snake venom. In previous cases, snake bites were deliberately inflicted on consumers, resulting in effects such as jerky movements, blurring of vision, and blackouts, followed by a heightened sense of well-being that lasted weeks. The venom's neurotoxic properties are believed to cause analgesia and bind with receptors in the brain associated with euphoric experiences. Using snake venom as a recreational drug is not only addictive but also potentially dangerous, as the fatal dosage for humans is not well understood.</description>

			<title>What is the Advocate-on-Record system in the Supreme Court?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/advocate-on-record-supreme-court-9013055/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently dismissed a public interest litigation and reprimanded an advocate-on-record (AOR) for filing a frivolous case. The court emphasized that an AOR should not just be a signing authority. The Supreme Court also called for a comprehensive plan to reform and improve the AOR system, involving collaboration with the bar.

An AOR is a special category of advocates who are eligible to file cases before the Supreme Court. They act as a link between the litigants and the highest court of the country. AORs are elite Delhi-based lawyers who primarily practice before the Supreme Court but can also appear before other courts. The Supreme Court has specific eligibility criteria, including clearing an examination and training with a court-approved AOR for at least a year.

To become an AOR, an advocate needs to score at least 60% in the exam, with a minimum of 50% in each subject. The exam covers subjects such as practice and procedure, drafting, professional ethics, and leading cases. Approximately 200-250 lawyers clear the exam to become AORs. Additionally, an AOR must have an office in Delhi within a 16-kilometer radius of the Supreme Court and employ a registered clerk within one month of registration.

The AOR system is influenced by the British practice of barristers and solicitors. Barristers argue cases while solicitors take up cases from clients. In the federal court, agents would take up cases, and in high courts, the arguing counsels were referred to as pleaders. Senior advocates in India are designated by the court and wear a distinct gown. They are only briefed by other lawyers, such as AORs, and cannot solicit clients.

The Supreme Court has the power to make rules and regulate its own procedures for hearing cases under Article 145 of the Constitution. The AOR system was established when the Supreme Court was inaugurated, taking into account the rules of the court and the names of all advocates and agents of the previous federal court.</description>

			<title>Operation Cactus: When India prevented a coup in Maldives</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/operation-cactus-india-prevented-coup-maldives-9012435/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the 1988 coup attempt in the Maldives and India's intervention to prevent it. The coup was led by Maldivian businessman Abdullah Luthufee and supported by Uma Maheswaran, the leader of a militant Sri Lankan Tamil organization. On November 3, 1988, 80 fighters, including members of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), arrived in Malé, armed with heavy weapons. They successfully captured key infrastructure in the city, while President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom escaped to a safe house.

As the coup unfolded, SOS messages were sent to countries around the world, leading to Indian intervention. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi chaired a crisis committee meeting, and the Indian army was mobilized. Indian paratroopers, led by Colonel Subhash C Joshi, were deployed to Malé. They landed at the main airport on Hulhulé, which caused the rebels to overestimate Indian troop numbers and subsequently flee. The paratroopers secured the airport and proceeded to rescue President Gayoom on the adjacent island of Malé. Some rebels escaped on a hijacked merchant vessel and were pursued by the Indian Navy. After negotiations and the firing of warning shots, the rebels surrendered and were taken aboard an Indian ship.

The coup attempt resulted in the deaths of 19 people. The captured rebels were arrested, interrogated, and put on trial in the Maldives. Four, including Luthufee, were initially sentenced to death but had their sentences commuted at the request of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Indian paratroopers remained in Malé for over two weeks.

Despite rising anti-India sentiments in recent years, the Maldives continues to remember and appreciate India's intervention in the 1988 coup. The article concludes by noting that even the newly elected President Mohamed Muizzu has sought to enhance bilateral relations with India.</description>

			<title>Israel-Hamas war: Is Russia benefiting from the conflict?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-russia-benefit-9012443/</link>
			<description>Russia has officially blamed the US for the recent Hamas-Israel conflict and tensions in the wider Middle East, but experts suggest that Russia actually benefits from the conflict and is interested in seeing it continue. Russia's close ties with the Islamic world could be demonstrated through the conflict, despite not having significant influence in the region. However, some experts argue that the conflict could harm Russia politically, especially considering recent anti-Semitic attacks in Muslim-majority Russian regions. Additionally, Russia may not benefit economically from the conflict as rising oil prices have not occurred. While Russia's contact with Hamas may not have a significant impact on peace in the region, it may serve other goals, such as sending a message to Israel. However, this behavior could harm Russia's standing in Israel, especially among Russian-speaking Israelis who are growing concerned.</description>

			<title>Experts Explain: How to fix Mumbai’s air</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/experts-explain-how-to-fix-mumbais-air-9012581/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the poor air quality in Mumbai and the factors contributing to it. Between October 1 and 30, there were 66 instances of poor Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded in 16 areas of the city. Sion had bad air for 10 days, followed by Andheri and Mazagaon for nine days each. Some days, the overall AQI readings in Mumbai were worse than Delhi's. Last winter, from November 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, the AQI in Mumbai was poor or worse for 66 days.

Despite being surrounded by the sea, strong winds that would typically sweep away pollutants, a combination of natural and man-made factors is affecting Mumbai's AQI. The city has been experiencing calm air since the retreat of the southwest monsoon in October, which has contributed to delayed wind reversal. Experts believe this is a temporary problem and that the AQI will improve once construction projects are completed.

The article also suggests the need for better monitoring systems to address the issue. All 21 monitoring stations in Mumbai use Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Systems (CAAQMS), but sensor-based AQI monitoring units should also be considered to provide hyperlocal data. These units would empower authorities to take immediate action, such as penalizing violators who don't follow pollution norms. However, the article highlights the challenge of jurisdictions, as the municipal commissioner of Mumbai may not be able to take action against pollution sources in nearby areas.

To address this issue, experts suggest setting up an independent commission for AQI management, similar to what has been done in Delhi. This commission should have the power to take action against violators regardless of geographical borders. The article also emphasizes the importance of involving engineers, scientists, health experts, and legal advisers in finding solutions, as well as conducting emissions studies and implementing emissions-based policies.

The article mentions examples from other cities, such as Delhi and London, where more monitoring stations and research institutions have been involved in addressing air pollution issues. It also highlights the implementation of sensor-based monitoring stations in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which have significantly improved data collection in those regions.

Dr. Gufran Beig and Dr. Sachchida Nand Tripathi, both renowned air pollution experts, share their insights and recommendations throughout the article.</description>

			<title>Farm fires and weather behind choke; respite likely in 4 days</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/farm-fires-and-weather-behind-choke-respite-likely-in-4-days-9012568/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the increase in incidents of agricultural waste burning in Punjab, which is contributing to the smog and haze situation in Delhi. This annual practice typically lasts for about two weeks, but this year the burning events started on October 31. With a significant amount of land still left to be harvested, the burning is expected to continue. The current meteorological conditions are exacerbating the situation by trapping pollutants near the surface of the atmosphere. However, a western disturbance event expected around November 7 could potentially improve the air quality. The article also highlights the role of winds in transporting pollutants from Punjab and Haryana to Delhi. The boundary layer, which affects the dispersion of pollutants, has become shallower, further worsening the situation. While rainfall or better wind speed could provide relief, both remain unlikely in the near future. The article suggests that the best-case scenario would be a change in wind systems during the western disturbance event, which could lead to the dispersion of pollutants and potential relief. The air quality is expected to remain in the severe category until at least Monday, with no significant improvement expected until the fire counts in Punjab decrease.</description>

			<title>Delhi chokes on pollution: Will masks protect you?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/masks-protect-delhi-air-pollution-9012318/</link>
			<description>Air pollution in India has become a recurring problem, especially during the winter months, leading to the widespread use of masks. However, most cloth and surgical masks cannot effectively protect against the small pollution particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. According to a report in The Lancet, around 1.67 million deaths in India in 2019 were attributed to air pollution, accounting for 17.8% of total deaths. While deaths due to household air pollution have decreased, deaths due to ambient air pollution have increased significantly.

Doctors say that N-95 masks, when worn properly, can offer some protection against small particulate matter. However, the high pollution levels in India make it practically impossible to wear an N-95 mask 24/7. The World Health Organization advises that face masks are generally not seen as a suitable measure for health protection, but they may be useful in certain circumstances, such as prolonged commuting or outdoor activities in hazardous air quality conditions. Studies from the USA and Vietnam have shown that N-95 masks can reduce exposure to particulate matter.

However, masks cannot protect against gaseous pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Activated carbon filters have been developed, but they are difficult to maintain. A recent study from AIIMS, Delhi found that even short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide led to a significant increase in emergency room visits. Surgical and cloth masks are not effective against pollutants, so N-95 or N-99 masks with a good fit and a proper seal over the nose are recommended.

To ensure the effectiveness of a mask, it should be properly worn, covering the nose and mouth, and the metal pin on the nose should be pinched to create a seal. Masks should be changed frequently, and cracked or wet masks should be avoided. N-95 masks can be reused as long as they are not cracked, but frequent removal can lead to faster deterioration.</description>

			<title>Delhi’s air pollution steadily worsening since 2021: Four key findings of a new air quality study</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-air-pollution-pm-level-study-9012253/</link>
			<description>According to a new study by Respirer Reports, Delhi, the capital of India, had the highest level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in October for the past five years among eight major state capitals that face an air pollution crisis. The analysis revealed a consistent rise in PM 2.5 levels in Delhi since 2021, with an increase of 4.4% in October 2023 compared to the previous year. The study also examined air quality in cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Bengaluru, and Chennai. 

The study's release coincides with Delhi experiencing severe air quality, with its Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 476, classified as "severe", which is a significant cause for concern. Mumbai has also witnessed very poor or severe air quality in October, with areas like Vile Parle being highly affected. 

PM 2.5 is a harmful atmospheric pollutant that can easily enter the human circulatory system, potentially causing chronic diseases like asthma, heart attacks, bronchitis, and respiratory problems. 

Here are four key findings from the study: 

1. Delhi's air pollution has been worsening over the past two years, with PM 2.5 levels increasing by about 54% from October 2021 to October 2023, which is well above safety limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board and the World Health Organisation. 

2. Mumbai's air quality has steadily deteriorated from 2019 to 2023, with PM 2.5 levels increasing by 110% over the past four years. 

3. Hyderabad and Kolkata have also experienced a rise in PM 2.5 levels. Hyderabad witnessed an 18.6% spike in October 2023 compared to the previous year, while Kolkata's pollution levels rose by 40.2% this October. 

4. Lucknow, Patna, Bengaluru, and Chennai saw a decrease in PM 2.5 levels in October 2023 compared to the previous year. Among these cities, Chennai had the least pollution, with a reduction of over 23%. 

It is important to note that this study highlights the concerning trend of increasing air pollution in major Indian cities and the potential health risks associated with it.</description>

			<title>Direct listing on foreign exchanges: What does it mean for Indian companies?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/direct-listing-foreign-exchanges-indian-companies-9012238/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has announced that certain Indian companies will now be allowed to directly list on select foreign stock exchanges. This move aims to enable these companies to access global capital and boost capital outflows. The provision, which came into effect on October 30, allows listed and unlisted domestic companies to directly list their equity shares on the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Ahmedabad. The government has the power to exempt such listings from certain procedural requirements. Domestic companies can use depository receipts, such as American Depository Receipts (ADR) or Global Depository Receipts (GDR), to list in the overseas market. This new provision will allow domestic companies to raise funds, offer better valuation and exposure to trade in foreign currency, benefit startups and unicorns, and add to India's foreign exchange reserves. However, more details are needed regarding which classes of public companies can use this route, the classes of securities that can be listed, the foreign jurisdictions and permitted stock exchanges, and the exemptions provided to these companies in terms of procedural compliances.</description>

			<title>What is the impact of air pollution on economic growth?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/impact-air-pollution-economic-growth-9012092/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided article, air pollution in India has a direct and detrimental impact on GDP growth and per-capita income levels. It affects worker output, consumer footfall in consumption-led services, asset productivity, and leads to increased health expenses and welfare allocations. The Reserve Bank of India's Department of Economic and Policy Research suggests that up to 4.5% of India's GDP could be at risk by 2030 due to lost labor hours from climate change issues. Additionally, a study estimates that air pollution costs Indian businesses about $95 billion annually, which is approximately 3% of India's GDP. The costs of poor air quality manifest in lower labor productivity, lower consumer footfall, lower asset productivity, increased health expenses, welfare losses, and premature mortality. It is crucial for India to address air pollution urgently, as many of the world's most polluted cities are located in the country. Delhi, in particular, experiences severe air pollution, leading to significant economic losses. The impact of air pollution is not limited to outdoor work sectors but also affects indoor jobs, such as call center workers, where productivity is negatively impacted.</description>

			<title>Delhi chokes on pollution: What is AQI — and how is it measured?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-aqi-9011917/</link>
			<description>The air pollution in Delhi-NCR and surrounding areas has worsened for the second day, bringing attention to the Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI is a measure of air quality, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. On Friday morning, the AQI in Delhi averaged at 471, while the previous day it had reached the "severe" category, surpassing a score of 400. The color-coded AQI index, launched in India in 2014, helps both the public and the government understand the severity of the air quality and take appropriate actions. The AQI is calculated by the Central Pollution Control Board, using data on various pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon. The impact of these pollutants, especially PM2.5, can lead to serious respiratory problems and chronic diseases. The government responds to the AQI levels by implementing measures, such as the Graded Response Action Plan, which restricts the use of certain vehicles in order to prevent further deterioration of air quality.</description>

			<title>What happens if you ignore a summons by the ED?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/ignore-ed-summons-arvind-kejriwal-9011774/</link>
			<description>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has declined to appear before the enforcement directorate for questioning, stating that the summons were unclear and seemed to be a fishing expedition. He had been summoned in connection with the investigations into the Delhi excise policy case. The enforcement directorate had filed a preliminary complaint alleging that Kejriwal had spoken in a video call with one of the main accused, Sameer Mahendru, and asked him to continue working with another accused, Vijay Nair. Kejriwal has asked the investigation officer to recall the summons, but the enforcement directorate is likely to issue a fresh notice. If Kejriwal continues to refuse to appear, the enforcement directorate can either seek a non-bailable warrant or question him at his residence and proceed with an arrest if concrete evidence is found.</description>

			<title>8 Indian Navy veterans sentenced to death in Qatar: 3 options India could explore</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/8-indian-navy-veterans-sentenced-to-death-in-qatar-3-options-india-could-explore-9011311/</link>
			<description>In a shocking turn of events, a Qatari court has sentenced eight Indian nationals to death on charges of espionage. This comes as a surprise to the Indian government, as Qatar rarely imposes death sentences. The accused individuals were employees of Doha-based Dahra Global and were working privately to oversee the induction of Italian submarines for the company. Two Qatari nationals, including the CEO of Dahra Global, were also charged in connection with the case. The charges against the Indians were reportedly related to spying for Israel, although no official confirmation was provided by the Indian side.

The arrested individuals had been working at Dahra Global for several years, providing defense services to the Qatari Emiri Naval Force. The Indian Embassy in Doha was informed about the arrests in mid-September, and consular access was granted shortly after. The last bail plea was rejected, and on October 26, 2023, Qatar's court announced the verdict of death sentence for all eight Indians.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs expressed shock at the verdict and stated that it is exploring all legal options while providing assistance to the families and the detainees. India has previously supported its citizens facing the death penalty overseas, and it plans to challenge the sentence in higher courts and seek reprieve from the Emir of Qatar through a mercy petition.

India's diplomatic efforts in this matter will test its relationship with Qatar, with whom it shares strong economic ties, substantial investments, and robust defense cooperation. The Indian community in Qatar is generally seen as law-abiding, which may help leverage support within the Qatar establishment. However, the allegation of spying for Israel adds geopolitical sensitivities to the case, making negotiations challenging for India.</description>

			<title>Electoral bond scheme: Six years in limbo to six sessions over three days</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/electoral-bond-scheme-six-years-in-limbo-to-six-sessions-over-three-days-9011256/</link>
			<description>In the past six years, multiple petitions challenging the electoral bonds scheme have been filed in the Supreme Court of India. Despite this, the legislation has not been stayed, with the court stating that the weighty issues raised by the petitioners require a thorough hearing. However, when the case was finally heard by a constitution bench, it only took three days to conclude the hearing and reserve the verdict. The court emphasized that repeated applications seeking the same relief should not be entertained, especially if they concern matters that occur periodically. Critics argue that the delay in hearing such crucial cases involving the government indirectly benefits the government. This case is also linked with the question of whether the law could be introduced as a money bill, which is pending before another constitution bench. Delays in setting up constitution benches are common, as they require five-judge benches to sit for extended periods, putting other regular cases on hold.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan is forcing lakhs of Afghan migrants to leave</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-pakistan-is-forcing-lakhs-of-afghan-migrants-to-leave-9010945/</link>
			<description>Pakistan has ordered undocumented migrants, primarily Afghan refugees, to leave the country. The government had set a deadline of October 31 for them to leave, and those without documents have been rounded up and faced expulsion. Over 4 million Afghans live in Pakistan, with an estimated 1.7 million being undocumented. Many have fled Afghanistan due to the Soviet war and have limited ties and opportunities in their home country. Pakistan argues that it needs to prioritize its own economic affairs and security, and accuses Afghan migrants of involvement in terror attacks and organized crimes. The deportation order has faced criticism, and the Taliban has asked for more time to prepare for the return of Afghans. The timing of the deportations is problematic due to the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and the approaching winter.</description>

			<title>Bletchley Park: Where ‘computers’ helped the Allies win WWII, now hosting the world’s first AI summit</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bletchley-park-computers-ai-summit-wwii-9010886/</link>
			<description>The world's first global summit on artificial intelligence (AI) is being held at Bletchley Park, an English country house known as the birthplace of modern computing. During World War II, Bletchley Park played a significant role in breaking the "unbreakable" Enigma code used by the Nazis. The Turing bombe, an electro-mechanical device invented by British mathematician Alan Turing, expedited the code-breaking process. Another machine called the Colossus was built at Bletchley Park to break the German Lorenz cipher. Bletchley Park's contributions shortened the war by two years and left a technological legacy that continues to inform modern computing and AI. The role of women in Bletchley Park's operations, who made up over 70% of the staff, is often overlooked. They operated the machines and formed the backbone of the organization. The article also mentions that Facebook donated 1 million pounds to support the upkeep of Bletchley Park during the pandemic.</description>

			<title>AI Summit: Why new global pact on tackling Artificial Intelligence risks is a big deal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/new-global-pact-artificial-intelligence-risks-9010265/</link>
			<description>The world's first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Summit took place at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, known for being the top-secret base of codebreakers during World War II. The summit involved global leaders, computer scientists, and tech executives who agreed to establish a shared understanding of the opportunities and risks posed by frontier AI. Twenty-eight major countries, including the United States, China, Japan, France, and India, signed a declaration acknowledging the potential risks of AI and the need for global action.

The Bletchley Park Declaration highlighted the risks of intentional misuse or unintended control issues related to frontier AI, such as cybersecurity, biotechnology, and disinformation. It emphasized that international cooperation is essential to address these risks. South Korea will co-host a virtual AI summit, and France will host an in-person summit as part of the agreement on international collaboration.

The summit followed US President Joe Biden's executive order aimed at safeguarding against AI threats and exerting oversight over safety benchmarks used by AI companies. The order requires companies to share test results with the federal government before releasing new AI capabilities to the public. The government can enforce changes or abandonment of products deemed unsafe. Watermarks and precautions for biotechnology firms using AI were also included in the order.

Different countries have varying approaches to regulating AI. The EU proposed a new AI Act to classify AI based on invasiveness and risk, while the UK aims to foster innovation with a lighter-touch approach. The US is somewhere in between, working on defining an AI regulation rulebook. China has released its own set of measures to regulate AI.

Tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, called for a pause in AI development due to concerns about systems that are difficult to control. Musk warned of AI being one of the biggest threats and an existential risk.

India has shifted its stance on AI regulation, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling for a global framework on ethical AI tools. The country is actively formulating regulations based on a risk-based approach and seeking collaborations with international agencies. TRAI, the apex telecommunications regulator, has recommended setting up a domestic statutory authority to regulate AI in India.

Overall, this summit and related developments highlight the growing recognition of the risks associated with AI and the need for international cooperation to mitigate them. Different countries are taking varied approaches to AI regulation, and India is actively working on formulating regulations based on a risk-based framework.</description>

			<title>A ‘land bridge’ across Thailand’s Kra Isthmus: What is this centuries-old idea, resurrected again?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/land-bridge-thailand-kra-isthmus-9009594/</link>
			<description>The Prime Minister of Thailand, Srettha Thavisin, has proposed a land bridge project known as the Thai Land Bridge. This project aims to reduce the sailing distance between the Indian Ocean and East Asia by cutting across the Isthmus of Kra in Thailand. Unlike a canal, the land bridge would consist of road and rail networks connecting deep sea ports on each coast. The project is expected to save transport costs, reduce piracy risks, and alleviate congestion in the busy Strait of Malacca. It could also create jobs and boost Thailand's economic growth. However, the project faces challenges such as securing funding, as it is estimated to cost around $27.44 billion. The Prime Minister hopes to attract investments from China, although this could potentially impact Thailand's relationships with other countries. Concerns have also been raised about the project's viability and potential negative impacts on the environment and tourism.</description>

			<title>In Tripura-Bangladesh railway link, new opportunities and old connect</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-tripura-bangladesh-railway-link-new-opportunities-and-old-connect-9009936/</link>
			<description>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina virtually inaugurated a rail link connecting northeast India with Bangladesh. The Agartala-Akhaura project will significantly reduce travel time between Agartala and Kolkata, from 31 hours to 10 hours. This project is expected to boost tourism, trade, and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

The railway line spans 12.24 km, with 5.46 km on the Indian side in Tripura and 6.78 km in the Akhaura Upazila in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh. The train will start from Agartala and move to Nischintapur, where immigration checks will take place at the Indian-Bangladesh border. Gangasagar will be the first station on the Bangladesh side.

A trial run of goods trains was successful, and discussions between the governments of both countries will determine the start of passenger trains. Following the completion of the trial run, full-fledged train services between Agartala-Akhaura and Agartala-Chittagong are expected to commence. The project's budget was revised due to cost escalation, and the final project cost is estimated at Rs 1255.10 crore, funded entirely by India.

The project faced delays due to land acquisition issues and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it holds great practical and emotional significance for Tripura, as the state shares an 856-km international border with Bangladesh and played a significant role in sheltering refugees during the Indo-Pakistan war and the creation of Bangladesh.

This rail link is part of ongoing efforts to strengthen connectivity between India and Bangladesh. The Bandhan Express, Maitree Express, and Mitali Express are already running between West Bengal and Bangladesh. The Bandhan Express reconnects Kolkata and Khulna, the third-largest city in Bangladesh. The Maitree Express has been operating between Kolkata and Dhaka Cantonment since 2008, and the Mitali Express was announced during Prime Minister Modi's visit to Dhaka in 2021, connecting Siliguri with the Bangladesh capital.</description>

			<title>India’s own CAR-T cell therapy: What is it, when will it be available, and at what cost?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indias-own-car-t-cell-therapy-what-is-it-when-will-it-be-available-and-at-what-cost-9009776/</link>
			<description>The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has granted market authorization for Nexcar19, India's first indigenous CAR-T cell therapy, developed by ImmunoAct. This approval allows for the commercial launch of the therapy in India at a much lower cost compared to other countries. CAR-T therapy is a groundbreaking treatment that modifies T-cells into cancer-fighting cells. Unlike chemotherapy and immunotherapy, CAR-T therapy aims to cure cancer and provide lifelong benefits. Nexcar19 specifically targets cancer cells carrying the CD19 protein, and it has shown promising results in patients with B-cell lymphomas who did not respond to standard treatments. The therapy involves a patient's blood being genetically modified in the lab before being reintroduced into the body. Early results have shown a 70% response rate, with approximately 50% of patients achieving a complete response. Clinical trials for pediatric patients are currently underway, and the therapy has received approval for patients aged 15 years and older. Nexcar19 has demonstrated lower toxicity levels and minimal cytokine release syndrome compared to other CAR-T therapies. ImmunoAct is in the process of obtaining licenses and partnerships with hospitals to make the therapy available to more patients. The cost of treatment is currently around Rs 30-40 lakh, but efforts are being made to reduce it to Rs 10-20 lakh in the future. Discussions will also be held with insurers and the government to clarify the extent of insurance coverage for the therapy.</description>

			<title>Why Yemeni Houthis’ attack on Israel has many worried</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/yemeni-houthi-attack-israel-iran-saudi-arabia-9009521/</link>
			<description>Yemen's Houthi rebels have launched drones and missiles at Israel, declaring their support for Palestine. While the attacks pose little actual danger to Israel, they have raised concerns in the region. The Houthis, backed by Iran, are part of an anti-Israel and anti-West coalition called "The Axis of Resistance." The civil war in Yemen is seen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Houthi attack is the latest in a series of attacks by groups in the Axis on Israel and the US. The attacks could potentially lead to all-out war in the Middle East, putting Saudi Arabia in a difficult position as it tries to navigate its relationships with the US, Israel, and Iran. If Saudi Arabia enters the conflict, it could escalate tensions and lead to a wider war in the region.</description>

			<title>Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt partially opens: What is the crossing and why is it significant?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/rafah-border-crossing-egypt-gaza-9009527/</link>
			<description>The Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt has reopened for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in early October. The crossing, controlled by Egypt, is the main entrance and exit point to Gaza and has been the focus of international negotiations due to being the only entry point for relief supplies. Under a Qatar-mediated deal, Egypt will allow the entry of 88 critically injured Palestinians and around 500 foreign nationals. Israel and Egypt have also agreed on a list of people with foreign passports who can leave Gaza. The reopening of the crossing is significant as it is the only way into and out of the strip for people seeking to flee and is also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid. Egypt has historically restricted access across Rafah due to concerns over insecurity near the border in northeastern Sinai. Arab countries are reluctant to take in Palestinians out of fear of sparking a new wave of permanent displacements.</description>

			<title>Why GST collections surged sharply in October</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-gst-collections-surged-sharply-in-october-9009407/</link>
			<description>Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in India rose by 13.4% in October compared to the previous year, reaching INR 1.72 lakh crore. This is the second-highest level since the implementation of GST in July 2017. The increase in consumption, economic activity, and settlement of disputes by businesses contributed to the surge in revenue. Overall, the total GST collections in October were the highest in 10 months. Central GST, State GST, Integrated GST, and cess all contributed to the revenue. Domestic transactions accounted for a 13% increase in revenue compared to the same month last year. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu were among the states with the highest growth in GST revenue. The government settled amounts to both the central and state GST after which the revenue for October stood at INR 72,934 crore for the center and INR 74,785 crore for the state GST. The surge in GST revenue is attributed to settlement of disputes and increased compliance, and with the ongoing festive season, further growth is expected. The boost in revenue supports the government's fiscal position, especially considering the expected shortfall in disinvestment receipts and slower growth in direct tax revenue.</description>

			<title>Bihar records highest dengue cases and deaths in 5 years: What’s behind the surge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bihar-highest-dengue-cases-deaths-9008868/</link>
			<description>Bihar has seen a significant increase in dengue cases and deaths this year, with over 15,000 cases and 59 deaths recorded so far. This marks the highest numbers in at least five years, with a 608% increase in cases compared to 2018. Doctors predict that there may be further increases in dengue cases in the state over the next two weeks.

The main reason for the rise in dengue cases and deaths is the delayed monsoon season, which lasted until mid-October instead of mid-September. This led to the creation of stagnant pools of water, ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Additionally, the continued use of water coolers, which also attract mosquitoes, has contributed to the problem. Lack of sanitation and proper defogging by the municipal corporations has also been blamed for the increase in cases.

Doctors have observed new symptoms among dengue patients, including liver and lung infections, recurrence of fever in shorter intervals, body itching, and liver swelling. The demand for platelets has also increased, with doctors administering them as a precautionary measure even when the platelet count is around 25,000, higher than the standard protocol of 15,000.

In the past five years, Bihar experienced a sudden surge in dengue cases in 2019, with 6,712 cases compared to 2,142 the previous year. However, no deaths were reported in either of those years. The number of cases decreased in 2020 and 2021, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2022, there was a resurgence of dengue in Bihar, with 13,972 cases and 32 deaths reported, with the city of Patna being the most affected. These figures do not include cases and deaths in private hospitals and clinics.</description>

			<title>Hamas: Its conflict with Fatah, and the role Israel played in strengthening it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-fatah-israel-9008780/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to "crush and destroy" Hamas, the political and militant organization in charge of the Gaza Strip, following the worst-ever attack on Israel's territory. However, there are claims that the Israeli government helped strengthen Hamas to undermine Fatah, the internationally accepted Palestinian political party. The split between Hamas and Fatah in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank occurred because of their differing ideologies and approaches to dealing with Israel. Fatah is a more secular and moderate party that focused on negotiations, while Hamas believes in armed resistance. The claim that Israel boosted Hamas at the expense of Fatah is based on the argument that a divided Palestinian leadership would hinder progress in peace talks. Experts have cited evidence of Israel not following agreements with Fatah, allowing money to go to Hamas, and making comments that suggest a preference for a divided Palestinian leadership. The article also mentions Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, which some view as a peace step while others question its genuine intentions.</description>

			<title>Story of Mamata and Nano: Why Tata can claim Rs 766 crore plus interest from Bengal Govt</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/story-of-mamata-and-nano-why-tata-can-claim-rs-766-crore-9007996/</link>
			<description>Tata Motors has been awarded a sum of Rs 765.78 crore by an arbitration tribunal as compensation for capital investment losses in the Singur manufacturing plant. The plant was set up to manufacture the Tata Nano, but protests from the TMC party forced Tata to leave. The acquisition of land for the plant ran into trouble due to protests from local people and small parties. Mamata Banerjee, who was then in opposition, led a movement against the government and went on a hunger strike. Tata Motors eventually decided to move the production of the Nano to Gujarat. Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011 and returned 400 acres of land to farmers. Tata Motors went to court and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of returning the land to its owners. After the Supreme Court order, Tata Motors entered into arbitration proceedings with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to claim compensation for their losses. The arbitration tribunal has now awarded Tata Motors a sum of Rs 765.78 crore with interest.</description>

			<title>What a ‘normal’ monsoon hides</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-a-normal-monsoon-hides-9008385/</link>
			<description>The monsoon season in India this year had an overall rainfall of 94 percent, marking the eighth consecutive year of normal rainfall. However, there have been significant variations in the distribution of rainfall both in space and time, with some days experiencing heavy downpours and prolonged dry spells. Only 6 percent of district rain-days were found to have normal rainfall, while over 60 percent had deficits of over 60 percent or no rain at all. Additionally, climate change is believed to be increasing rainfall variability. The northeast region of India has consistently received below-normal rainfall, and this year the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal experienced significant rainfall deficits. Kerala, one of the rainiest states in the country, had the largest deficit at 34 percent. The erratic behavior of monsoon rainfall is attributed to climate change, but there are other factors at play. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the unpredictability of monsoon rainfall is expected to continue. The article suggests that preparedness for extreme weather events and strengthening climate resilience in infrastructure are necessary coping mechanisms.</description>

			<title>Maratha quota protest heats up: What SC, Bombay HC have ruled on it, what steps state govt is taking</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/maratha-quota-what-sc-bombay-hc-have-said-9007855/</link>
			<description>The state government of Maharashtra has created a panel of three former high court judges to provide advice on the legal battle over the Maratha quota in the Supreme Court. Activist Manoj Jarange-Patil has launched a fast-unto-death protest for Maratha reservation, putting pressure on the government. The Marathas, constituting roughly 33% of the state's population, have been demanding reservation for several years. In 2018, the BJP government proposed a 16% quota, which was challenged in court. The Bombay High Court upheld the constitutional validity of the reservation but reduced it to 12% in education and 13% in government jobs. The high court relied on the findings of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, which highlighted the social and educational backwardness of the Maratha community. However, in May 2021, the Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota, as it exceeded the 50% reservation ceiling set in the court's 1992 judgment. The court stated that there were no extraordinary circumstances to justify crossing the 50% mark. The Maharashtra government has formed a new committee to study the procedure for granting Kunbi (OBC) certificates to Marathas. The state cabinet has accepted the first report of the committee and plans to file a curative petition in the apex court. Currently, the total reservation in Maharashtra is 52%, including quotas for various communities.</description>

			<title>Politician held for ‘using Nazi symbols’: what German law says on things linked to Hitler’s party</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/german-politician-afd-arrested-nazi-9007693/</link>
			<description>A 22-year-old politician from the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) named Daniel Halemba was arrested on charges of incitement and the use of symbols associated with the Nazi Party. Halemba, who was recently elected to the Bavarian state parliament, was the youngest member to be elected. He was also a member of a student fraternity that was raided by authorities last month due to suspicions of Nazi symbols and objects being present. Four other members of the fraternity are also under investigation. The AfD has been criticized for its opposition to the European Union and its stance against immigration, with some accusing the party of having neo-Nazi ideologies. However, the party has denied these claims. Despite the controversies, the AfD has seen a surge in popularity in Germany, particularly due to concerns about immigration and the economy.</description>

			<title>Recalling Pegasus, the last time phones of Oppn leaders were allegedly targeted by spyware</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/recalling-pegasus-oppn-leaders-targeted-9007516/</link>
			<description>Several opposition leaders in India, including Shashi Tharoor and Pawan Khera of the Congress party, have received a "threat notification" from Apple warning them of a potential state-sponsored spyware attack on their iPhones. The leaders compared this alleged attack to the Pegasus malware attack that targeted activists and politicians in multiple countries two years ago. In July 2021, a global investigative project reported that the Israeli spyware called Pegasus, developed by NSO Group, may have been used to target individuals' mobile phones in India and other countries. The Indian government denied the allegations but refused to provide any evidence or explicitly deny the use of Pegasus. In October 2021, the Supreme Court appointed an Expert Committee to investigate the allegations in the Pegasus spyware case. The committee was tasked with determining who procured Pegasus, whether the petitioners were targeted, and what laws justified its use against Indian citizens. The committee's report found no conclusive evidence of Pegasus being used in the phones it examined and noted that the government did not cooperate with the panel. The court has yet to hold further hearings on the matter.</description>

			<title>Why the Goa government is in the dock over notifying a tiger reserve</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/goa-mhadei-tiger-reserve-wildlife-notification-explained-9005598/</link>
			<description>The Goa bench of the Bombay High Court has directed the Goa government to establish a tiger reserve in Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and surrounding areas within three months. This decision came in response to a public interest litigation filed by the environmental NGO, Goa Foundation, which sought the formation of a tiger reserve as recommended by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The court also instructed the state to settle the rights and claims of Scheduled Tribes and forest dwellers within a year.

The NTCA had previously advised the state government to create a tiger reserve in the Cotigao-Mhadei forest complex, which is known for its tiger population and potential as a habitat. The proposed reserve would enhance protection and security measures, including the establishment of a Special Tiger Protection Force.

Efforts to establish the tiger reserve have faced obstacles, with local politicians encouraging encroachment and cultivation in the sanctuary. In 2022, Goa's Forest Minister stated that there were no resident tigers in Goa, raising doubts about the necessity of a tiger reserve. However, the deaths of a tigress and its cubs in 2020 led to an investigation that recommended upgrading the legal status of Mhadei WLS to that of a tiger reserve.

The Goa government argued before the court that further studies and the settlement of rights of forest dwellers were necessary before establishing the tiger reserve. They also claimed that the existing protected areas already provided sufficient protection for all wildlife, including tigers.

Despite these arguments, the court found the state's contentions inadequate, citing their failure to settle the rights and claims of forest dwellers and their non-compliance with the Supreme Court's directive. The court emphasized the need to notify the tiger reserve and ensure its conservation for the larger public interest and to reduce conflicts between humans and tigers.

As of now, the Goa government has filed an application seeking more time to implement the court's order. The Goa Foundation has also filed a contempt petition against the government for not complying with the High Court's directions.</description>

			<title>What is Apple’s ‘state-sponsored attackers’ alert, received by multiple Opposition leaders?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/apple-state-sponsored-attackers-alert-opposition-explained-9007362/</link>
			<description>Apple has been sending notifications to individuals in 150 countries when it suspects they are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers. The notifications advise users on how to protect themselves, including activating the 'Lockdown Mode' feature on their iPhones. Apple clarified that it does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific attacker and that false alarms are possible. State-sponsored attacks are costly, sophisticated, and designed to evade detection. Apple's system detects activity that matches certain patterns but acknowledges that its threat intelligence signals are not always perfect. The company sends out threat notifications via email and iMessage and provides additional steps for users to protect their devices and privacy. Apple recommends updating software, setting a passcode, enabling two-factor authentication, using strong passwords, downloading apps only from the App Store, and avoiding unknown sources. Lockdown Mode, available on certain devices, restricts functions to prevent attackers from accessing personal information. Apple urges users to take threat notifications seriously and follow recommended steps to secure their devices and accounts.</description>

			<title>What happened on Oct 31, 1984: Recalling the assassination of Indira Gandhi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/oct-31-1984-assassination-of-indira-gandhi-9006876/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the assassination of Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984. Two of her bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, fired multiple bullets at her to avenge the humiliation of Sikhs and the desecration of the Golden Temple during Operation Blue Star earlier that year. Indira's assassination led to widespread violence in India, with approximately 3,350 Sikh deaths, and 2,800 in the national capital alone. Indira had a sense of foreboding about her life being in danger following Operation Blue Star. Despite increased security measures, she insisted on keeping Sikh guards. On the day of her assassination, Beant Singh shot her in her own home while Satwant Singh fired more shots at close range. Both assassins were apprehended, and Indira's body was rushed to a hospital but she was declared dead after surgery. Following the assassination, violent communal tensions erupted in India, with mobs targeting innocent Sikhs. Indira's son, Rajiv Gandhi, became the next Prime Minister, but the violence continued for three days before the army was called in to restore peace. The article highlights that little accountability was achieved for the violence, and revenge remained a significant issue.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking: Comparison between the economies of Palestine and Israel in 6 charts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-the-economies-of-palestine-israel-in-6-charts-9006859/</link>
			<description>This article provides a snapshot comparison of the economies of Israel and Palestine based on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. It highlights several key economic parameters:

1. Population size: Israel's population is almost double that of the West Bank and Gaza.

2. Nominal GDP: Israel's GDP is over 26 times larger than Palestine's.

3. GDP per capita: Israel's average income level is almost 15 times higher than Palestine's.

4. Inflation rate: The inflation rate in Israel is slightly higher than in Palestine.

5. Real GDP growth rate: Palestine's economy fluctuates more than Israel's, with higher vulnerability and weaker growth rates in certain years.

6. Unemployment rate: Palestine has a significantly higher unemployment rate compared to Israel.

The article also discusses the reasons behind Palestine's economic struggles, including systemic restrictions imposed by the Israeli government and a decline in certain sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The World Bank predicts continued economic challenges for Palestine due to these constraints and a lack of conclusive reform programs.

Overall, the article highlights the significant disparities between the economies of Israel and Palestine and the ongoing challenges faced by Palestine in achieving economic growth and development.</description>

			<title>What are electoral bonds, how has govt defended them, what Supreme Court has to decide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-electoral-bonds-hearing-explained-9006289/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is set to hear a group of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the country's electoral bonds scheme. The scheme, introduced in 2017, allows individuals and organizations to anonymously donate money to political parties through interest-free "bearer instruments." These bonds can only be purchased during specific periods and are intended to bring transparency to political funding. However, critics argue that they undermine transparency and enable corruption. The court has previously ordered some safeguards, but the larger constitutional challenge is still pending. The case will now be heard by a five-judge bench. The petitioners not only challenge the electoral bonds scheme but also seek to declare political parties as public offices and subject them to the Right to Information Act. The Election Commission of India has raised concerns about the amendment exempting political parties from disclosing donations received through electoral bonds. The Attorney General, representing the government, argues that the scheme promotes clean money and confidentiality for contributors while adhering to tax obligations.</description>

			<title>What the rapid ice melt in West Antarctica means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ice-sheet-melt-west-antarctica-9006179/</link>
			<description>A new study published in the journal Nature has found that the rapid melting of West Antarctica's ice sheet is now inevitable, regardless of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The melting of the ice sheet would raise global sea levels by 5.3 meters or 17.4 feet, posing a significant threat to coastal cities worldwide, including those in India. Even under the best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the water around West Antarctica will continue to warm three times faster than in the 20th century, leading to increased melting of the ice sheet. The study highlights the importance of mitigating the impacts of climate change, as the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet is just one contributor to rising sea levels.</description>

			<title>Rajnath Singh talks about ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ in international relations: What is this concept</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rajnath-singh-prisoners-dilemma-9006097/</link>
			<description>During his keynote address at the Goa Maritime Conclave, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh highlighted the importance of collaboration and trust between countries in international relations. He referred to the concept of "Prisoner's Dilemma" to explain the strategic decision-making challenges faced by countries. The Prisoner's Dilemma is a game in Game Theory that demonstrates how individuals or entities behave under different circumstances and aims to achieve the best outcome. Singh emphasized the need to find solutions that promote cooperation, build trust, and mitigate the risks associated with the Prisoner's Dilemma situations. The article provides examples of how this concept applies to scenarios such as an arms race between countries or competition between companies in the market. It concludes by suggesting that countries should establish ground rules in geopolitics to avoid detrimental consequences for their economies and people.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/rajnath-singh-prisoners-dilemma-9006097/</link>
			<description>Defence Minister Rajnath Singh spoke about the concept of "Prisoner's Dilemma" during his keynote address at the Goa Maritime Conclave. He explained that this concept can be applied to international relations to understand situations where countries face strategic decision-making challenges. Singh emphasized the need for countries to collaborate and build trust instead of engaging in an arms race out of fear and mistrust. Prisoner's Dilemma is a popular game in Game Theory that helps understand how people or entities behave under different circumstances. It highlights the paradox of whether to confess or stay silent in a situation where two prisoners are questioned about a crime. The best outcome lies in cooperation, but the dilemma has real-life applications in international law and business, such as setting ground rules to avoid an arms race or agreeing on prices to ensure healthy profits.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India will begin hearing petitions challenging the Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018, which allows anonymous donations to political parties. According to the State Bank of India, the only bank authorized to sell the bonds, around Rs 13,000 crore has been transferred through the scheme since March 2018. The scheme was proposed by Arun Jaitley in 2017, despite concerns raised by the Reserve Bank of India and the Election Commission of India. The government argues that the scheme promotes transparency and accountability in political funding, while the RBI and ECI have raised concerns about potential misuse and lack of transparency.</description>

			<title>The moon is 40 million years older: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/moon-40-million-years-older-study-9005806/</link>
			<description>Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the age of the moon, finding that it is older than previously thought. A new study used a technology called atom probe tomography to analyze crystals from a lunar sample collected 51 years ago. They found that the moon formed about 4.46 billion years ago, within the first 110 million years of the birth of our solar system. This research challenges previous estimates and provides valuable information about the formation of the earth-moon system. The study highlights the importance of nanoscale spatial resolution in understanding big-picture questions about the universe. The age of the moon, at 4.46 billion years, puts it only slightly younger than the estimated age of the earth.</description>

			<title>Why the Lewis Model on labour and industrialisation has worked in China, not in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-the-lewis-model-has-worked-in-china-not-in-india-9005004/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of industrialization in underdeveloped countries with surplus labor populations, as proposed by economist William Arthur Lewis. Lewis argued that a growing manufacturing sector could absorb the surplus labor from agriculture and other subsistence sectors by offering higher wages. However, the model has not played out as expected in India. While the share of employment in agriculture has decreased, it has not been replaced by significant growth in manufacturing. Instead, most new jobs have been created in low-paid services and construction. The movement of labor has mainly occurred within subsistence sectors rather than a shift to capitalist sectors. The exception is Gujarat, where a significant proportion of the workforce is employed in manufacturing. However, even in Gujarat, the proportion of workers in agriculture is still high compared to other states. The article suggests that the traditional model of labor transition from agriculture to industry needs to be rethought due to increasing capital-intensive manufacturing and technological advancements. NITI Aayog, an Indian government think tank, is exploring new economic development models that focus on creating remunerative jobs related to agriculture but outside the farm, such as in processing, packaging, transportation, and retailing of agricultural produce or supplying inputs and services to farmers.</description>

			<title>From 2016 to present, how Maratha morcha changed its stance, modes of protest over reservation demand</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/2016-2023-how-maratha-morcha-changed-its-stance-modes-of-protest-9005099/</link>
			<description>The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) has evolved from a socio-economic issue to a political movement centered around the demand for reservation. Maratha activist Manoj Jarange Patil, who is on a hunger strike, has warned the government to find a solution to the issue. Other Maratha activists have shown solidarity with Patil through candlelight protests. Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has urged Patil to prioritize his health and trust in the government's commitment to reservation. The Maratha reservation issue gained momentum in 2016 after the alleged rape and killing of a teenage girl from the community. The MKM's demands also include action against the perpetrators of the crime, higher remuneration for farmers, and loan waivers. The MKM emphasizes peaceful protests and aims to achieve justice for the Maratha community.</description>

			<description>Former head of Hamas, Khaled Mashal, virtually addressed a pro-Palestine rally in Kerala's Malappuram, calling for unity for Gaza. He spoke about the ongoing conflict in the region and criticized Israel for demolishing houses, churches, temples, universities, and UN institutions. Mashal was born in the West Bank town of Silwad in 1956 and became a member of Hamas, a militant organization that used violence for the cause of Palestine. He headed Hamas's Politburo from 1996 to 2017 and currently leads the group's 'external' politburo based in Qatar. Mashal echoed Hamas's opposition to Israel but stated in a 2017 document that they accepted the idea of a Palestinian state within the territories occupied by Israel in the Six-day War of 1967. He also discussed the possibility of negotiating with Israel when they are strong enough to create a reality that forces Israel to reconsider its positions. Mashal has called for unity against Israel following recent attacks and counter-attacks between Hamas and Israel. He was targeted in an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997, which led to a crisis between Jordan and Israel.</description>

			<title>India bans exports of some rice varieties: How this has impacted prices globally, in the country</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-bans-exports-of-some-rice-explained-9004685/</link>
			<description>According to an article from The Indian Express, India banned the export of non-basmati white rice in July 2023 due to depleting public stock, elevated cereal prices, and the threat of an uneven monsoon. The First Advance Estimates of major Kharif crops for 2023-24, released by the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers’ Welfare, showed a 3.7% decrease in rice production compared to the previous year [[SOURCE 1]].

The ban on non-basmati white rice exports led to a sharp increase in rice prices across markets. Although prices have come down since then, they are still higher than the pre-ban period. The impact of India's export restrictions on rice supply, availability, and prices has been felt both domestically and globally [[SOURCE 1]].

Despite the export ban, there has been no respite from the increase in domestic rice prices. The daily average wholesale price of rice on October 24, 2023, was 27.43% higher than a month ago. The daily average retail price of rice on the same day was 12.59% higher than a year ago [[SOURCE 1]].

India is the largest exporter of rice in the world, accounting for about 40% of total rice exports in 2022. Rice exports from India are broadly categorized into basmati and non-basmati rice. While the ban applies to non-basmati white rice and broken rice, there is no ban on other sub-categories of rice [[SOURCE 1]].

In the financial year 2022-23, India exported 45.61 lakh metric tonnes of basmati rice to various countries, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, and Yemen being the top destinations. For non-basmati rice, India exported 177.91 lakh metric tonnes, with Benin, Madagascar, and Kenya being the top buyers. The ban on non-basmati white rice and broken rice exports has significantly affected the quantity of rice shipped out and the number of countries importing from India [[SOURCE 1]].

The article also provides information on other categories of rice exports, such as par-boiled rice, husked (brown) rice, rice in husk of seed quality, and other rice in husk. It mentions the quantities exported and the top importing countries for each category [[SOURCE 1]].

In terms of rice procurement and requirement, the total production of rice during 2022-23 is estimated to be 1357.55 lakh tonnes, which is higher than the previous year's production. The government has been procuring paddy from various states for the Kharif marketing season. The total rice stock in the Central Pool as of October 1, 2023, is 221.87 lakh metric tonnes [[SOURCE 1]].

In summary, India's ban on the export of non-basmati white rice has had a significant impact on rice prices both domestically and globally. Despite the ban, domestic rice prices have continued to rise. India remains a major player in the global rice market, with significant exports of basmati and non-basmati rice.</description>

			<title>Why new tax filing data shows better compliance, upward mobility in higher-income slabs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-new-tax-filing-data-shows-9004515/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.According to the latest income tax returns statistics released by the Income Tax Department, there has been wider compliance and a shift in taxpayers towards higher-income slabs from lower-income slabs. In the assessment year 2021-22, a total of 6.75 crore taxpayers filed income tax returns, which is a rise of 5.6% from the previous year. Additionally, around 2.1 crore taxpayers paid taxes but did not file returns. The data also shows that the share of taxpayers paying nil tax has increased over the years, reaching 66% in the assessment year 2021-22. However, the proportionate contribution of gross total income of the top 1% individual taxpayers has decreased from 15.9% in the assessment year 2013-14 to 14.6% in the assessment year 2021-22.

The income tax statistics also reveal that the highest rate of growth for salaried individual taxpayers was seen in the income slabs of Rs 15-20 lakh and Rs 20-25 lakh in the financial year 2020-21. On the other hand, the lower-income slabs of Rs 10-15 lakh and Rs 5-10 lakh recorded lower growth rates. It is worth noting that the financial year 2020-21 was affected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The data further shows that around 67,970 individuals in India disclosed salary income over Rs 1 crore in the assessment year 2021-22, which is an increase of 3.9% from the previous year. Out of these individuals, 16 had a salary between Rs 100-500 crore.

Overall, the income tax returns statistics indicate a positive trend of migration to higher ranges of gross total income among individual taxpayers. However, concerns remain about the significant number of taxpayers who pay taxes but do not file returns</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains | 10 years of China’s Belt and Road Initiative: The project, its aims and where it stands now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-10-years-chinas-bri-xi-jinping-status-explained-9004356/</link>
			<description>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a decade-old infrastructure funding project initiated by China's President Xi Jinping. It aims to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through investments worth billions of dollars. The BRI initially consisted of the Silk Road Economic 'Belt' and the sea trade infrastructure called 'Road'. Over time, it expanded to include six international Economic Corridors.

Criticism has been raised regarding the sustainability of the debts incurred by BRI projects. Some countries, such as India and the United States, have accused China of engaging in 'debt trap diplomacy' by aiming to acquire assets if loan repayment becomes impossible.

Despite the criticism, the BRI has attracted significant participation from over 150 countries and 30 international organizations. Currently, more than 3,000 BRI projects valued at $1 trillion are underway globally.

The article highlights concerns about transparency, debt traps, and sustainability of BRI projects. It also discusses the evolving perceptions of the European Union (EU) and the United States towards the initiative. While the EU initially viewed the BRI positively, growing apprehensions have led to a reassessment of the relationship with China.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship BRI project, strengthening the strategic partnership between China and Pakistan. Despite concerns about its long-term impact on Pakistan's economy, it is unlikely that Pakistan will abandon the CPEC.

India has consistently expressed reservations about the BRI due to sovereignty-related issues and geopolitical implications. China's expanding economic presence in South Asia, including investments in ports, has concerned Indian policymakers.

Geopolitical tensions, particularly the measures taken by the US and Europe to reduce economic dependence on China, could impact the Chinese economy and the expansion of the BRI. Consequently, China may need to re-strategize some of its BRI projects.

Despite criticism, the BRI has given China diplomatic and geopolitical leverage within the Global South. Western countries are still searching for alternatives to BRI in terms of infrastructure investments.

In response to the challenging geopolitical and economic landscape, China is adjusting its ambitions and focusing on green and smaller-scale development projects. The success of other China-led initiatives, such as the Global Security Initiative and the Global Development Initiative, largely depends on the BRI's success.</description>

			<title>Kerala blast: Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-blast-kills-one-who-are-jehovahs-witnesses-9004346/</link>
			<description>Two people were killed and several others injured in a series of blasts at a Jehovah's Witnesses prayer convention near Kochi. The incident occurred at the Zamra International Convention and Exhibition Centre, where around 2,500 faithful had gathered for a prayer session. A man named Dominic Martin, an estranged member of Jehovah's Witnesses, claimed responsibility for the attack in a video posted on social media. He stated that he believed the sect's teachings were anti-national and wanted them to change their ideology. Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian sect that does not believe in the Holy Trinity and worships Jehovah as the one true God. They base their beliefs solely on the Bible and do not celebrate Christmas or Easter. The sect is known for its evangelical work and believes that the end of the world is near. In India, Jehovah's Witnesses have faced legal challenges regarding their refusal to sing the national anthem or participate in certain activities due to their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has granted protection to members of the sect in cases involving their right to freedom of religion.</description>

			<title>Israel-Hamas war: Where the conflict goes from here, and how it could affect the global economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-war-what-happens-now-impact-global-economy-explained-9004262/</link>
			<description>The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are expanding their ground activity in the Gaza Strip as part of their plan to destroy Hamas. However, it remains unclear how Israel will handle the post-conflict phase if they succeed in eliminating Hamas. General David Petraeus, a former CIA director and top US general, warned Israel against making mistakes in planning for the post-conflict phase, citing the US's own mistakes in Iraq. He emphasized the importance of having a vision for the future of Gaza and the Palestinian people after Hamas is destroyed. Petraeus also cautioned that Israel's bombing campaign and land invasion could lead to a situation similar to the battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993. The military engagement between Israel and Hamas could have serious economic consequences for the region and the world, particularly if it escalates into a full-scale war involving regional powers like Iran. A direct conflict between Iran and Israel could push crude oil prices above $150 per barrel, leading to global inflation and slower economic growth. Even a regional conflict confined to the Gaza Strip could have negative impacts on the global economy as it emerges from multiple shocks.</description>

			<title>Ukraine, G20, Gaza: Over deep faultlines, New Delhi walks diplomatic tightrope again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ukraine-g20-gaza-over-deep-faultlines-new-delhi-walks-diplomatic-tightrope-again-9003867/</link>
			<description>India's abstention at the UN General Assembly on the resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza reflects its attempt to address competing priorities in the ongoing conflict. India joined Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom in abstaining. The resolution, proposed by Jordan and supported by Arab countries, called for a humanitarian truce and unhindered humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip. France voted in favor of the resolution but expressed regret that it did not address terrorist attacks by Hamas. Israel, the United States, and four Eastern European countries voted against the resolution. Canada proposed an amendment to hold Hamas responsible, but it was not adopted. UN General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but the resolution carries moral authority. India's stance aligns with its approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, using diplomatic tools to maintain a balancing act. India's explanation of vote emphasizes its support for Israel regarding attacks on its civilians and concern for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</description>

			<title>What is the ‘SIM swap scam’ — and how can you protect yourself?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/sim-sawp-scam-9003615/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The SIM swap scam is a growing problem in Delhi, India, where fraudsters steal personal information and use it to obtain duplicate SIM cards. The scam involves fraudsters taking personal details through phishing or vishing techniques, then posing as the victim at a mobile operator's retail outlet to report a fake theft of the victim's SIM card. With a duplicate SIM, the fraudsters can receive banking authorization messages and OTPs (one-time passwords) to initiate transactions and steal money from victims' bank accounts. Victims often receive multiple missed calls from the fraudsters to distract them and make them ignore their phones. The stolen money is typically routed through different channels, including conversion to cryptocurrency, making it difficult for police to track. To protect against this scam, individuals should be cautious about sharing personal information and regularly check their bank alerts and messages.</description>

			<title>Swiss woman’s murder in Delhi: How the police deals with the murder of foreign nationals</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/swiss-woman-murder-delhi-foreign-nationals-police-murder-9003430/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the murder of a Swiss national named Nina Berger in West Delhi. Berger's body was found decomposing behind a school, with her hands and legs chained and bruises all over. A businessman named Gurpreet, who was reportedly Berger's scorned lover, has been arrested for the crime. However, Berger's family in Zurich has not physically identified the body, putting the burden of evidence solely on Gurpreet. The family has given consent for a postmortem to be carried out in their absence. The article explores the complications that arise when dealing with the murder of foreign nationals and how the police handle such cases. It explains the process of verifying the victim's identity and informing their next of kin through the embassy. In cases where the body remains unidentified, the police generally wait for a few weeks before disposing of it as per the standard procedure. Berger's family has provided circumstantial evidence but has refused to come to Delhi to physically identify the body and cooperate with the investigation. One possible option to identify the body is through DNA testing or by seeking information from the family in Switzerland. The article emphasizes the importance of physical identification in building a case but also highlights the role of circumstantial evidence in proving the case before courts. The police will rely on other material collected to confirm the deceased's identity and states that if the family wants to join the investigation or take Berger's remains back home, they will be given a piece of cloth or ashes, depending on the chosen method of disposal.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jammu-kashmir-power-crisis-9003414/</link>
			<description>The Jammu &amp; Kashmir administration is facing a power crisis as its power projects are generating less electricity due to a dry spell in summer. Currently, J&amp;K only generates 3,263 MW of electricity from 21 power projects, compared to its identified power generation potential of 16,475 MW. The deficit in power supply is about 500 MW, with a requirement of about 2,600 MW of electricity. The administration is taking steps to address the issue, such as purchasing an additional 700 MW of electricity at a higher cost and promoting the use of ad cables to prevent theft. Efforts are also being made to install meters in all areas to minimize power cuts. The administration has approved a green energy corridor project that will reduce J&amp;K's dependence on hydropower.</description>

			<title>Why Jharkhand govt has approved a new Rs 1,600 crore housing scheme</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-govt-abua-awas-yojana-housing-9003294/</link>
			<description>The Jharkhand Cabinet has approved the 'Abua Awas Yojna' (AAY), a housing scheme for the poor in the state. The scheme aims to provide eight lakh pucca houses to the homeless with a budget of Rs 1,6320 crore. It will be implemented in three phases, targeting two lakh houses in the current financial year, 3.5 lakh houses in FY 2024-25, and 2.5 lakh houses in FY 2025-26. The scheme was needed because existing government schemes have been unable to cover all eligible beneficiaries. The state government found that around eight lakh eligible beneficiaries had been left out of housing schemes due to discrepancies in the database. Despite repeated requests to the central government, these beneficiaries were not added to the list. Therefore, the state decided to create its own housing scheme. Under the AAY, beneficiaries will receive a three-room and one kitchen house with a total area of 31 sq m. The government has allocated Rs 2 lakh per beneficiary, to be disbursed in four installments. There is also a provision for beneficiaries to work under the MGNREGS and receive wages for building the house. Additionally, a toilet can be added to the house using funds from the Swaccha Bharat Mission or other available schemes. All houses built under the AAY will be registered in the name of women in the beneficiary families. The scheme will benefit people belonging to six categories, and a list of beneficiaries will be prepared based on specific criteria.</description>

			<title>The United Nations General Assembly vote on Gaza war, and why India abstained</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/unga-vote-gaza-war-india-abstained-9003225/</link>
			<description>India abstained from a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for a humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The resolution, which did not mention Hamas or hostages, was passed with 120 votes in favor and 14 against. India voted in favor of an amendment proposed by Canada that named Hamas, but the amendment failed to get the necessary support. India's abstention reflects its balancing act in the ongoing conflict. The article highlights four key takeaways from the UNGA proceedings and India's response. First, India joined a group of 45 countries that abstained from the resolution. Second, India supported the amendment proposed by Canada, but it was not adopted. Third, resolutions of the UNGA are not legally binding, but they carry moral weight. Fourth, India's balanced position is consistent with its approach to other conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war. The article also provides details of India's statement at the UNGA, which called for dialogue and condemned violence while expressing concern for civilian casualties and advocating for a negotiated two-state solution.</description>

			<title>Decorated officers and specialists: The 8 Navy veterans sentenced to death in Qatar</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/8-navy-veterans-sentenced-to-death-qatar-9002680/</link>
			<description>Eight retired veterans of the Indian Navy, who were working for an Omani private defense consultancy called Dahra Global, have been sentenced to death by a Qatari court. The reasons for their arrest and death penalty have not been made public, but there is speculation that they may have been involved in espionage for a foreign state. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has expressed shock at the verdict and is exploring all legal options. The article provides some background information on each of the eight men, including their previous positions and accomplishments in the Indian Navy. One of them is the son of a retired army officer and served on India's second aircraft carrier. Another received commendations from the commander-in-chief twice and worked briefly at Hindustan Shipyard after retiring. Another veteran, who was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award, trained Singapore naval personnel before moving to Qatar. Two of the veterans specialized in navigation, one in communications, and one in gunnery, while one was a sailor.</description>

			<title>Why is Qatar playing mediator between the US and Hamas?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/qatars-unique-position-middle-east-9002487/</link>
			<description>Qatar has played a crucial role in facilitating the release of hostages held by Hamas, including the recent release of an American-Israeli mother-daughter pair. The United States has expressed gratitude to Qatar for its involvement in these efforts. Qatar is a small country in the Persian Gulf and is both a close ally of the United States and known to have ties with Hamas. This unique position allows Qatar to act as a mediator in conflicts and as a proxy for the US and other Western countries when direct engagement is not possible. Qatar's geopolitical dynamics have changed significantly over the years due to factors such as its booming economy fueled by natural gas reserves, its increasing closeness with the US, and the ascension of Sheikh Hamad to power. Qatar has also asserted its independence in the international arena, maintaining relations with Iran and providing support to actors opposed to certain Arab governments during the Arab Spring. However, Qatar's actions have led to tensions with neighboring Arab states, resulting in a trade and diplomatic embargo in 2017. Despite this, Qatar remains a significant player in the region due to its natural gas reserves and its hosting of the largest American base in the Middle East.</description>

			<title>The centrality of natural gas in ties between India and Qatar</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/natural-gas-lng-india-qatar-relations-9002396/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the death sentence given to eight former personnel of the Indian Navy by a court in Qatar and its implications on the India-Qatar relationship. It highlights the significant trade imbalance between the two countries, with imports from Qatar outweighing India's exports. The trade between India and Qatar is heavily dominated by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which accounts for over half of India's overall import volumes of the fuel. India's import dependency on natural gas is around 50%, and with the government's aim to increase natural gas consumption, imports are expected to rise in the future. Qatar holds a significant leverage in the trade relationship due to its dominance in the LNG market.

India's largest LNG importer, Petronet LNG, has a long-term contract with Qatar for the import of 8.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG. India has set an ambitious target to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix, which will result in further growth in LNG imports. Natural gas is seen as a cleaner alternative to conventional petroleum fuels and is cheaper than crude oil. Given India's energy security concerns and ambitions, the case of the retired navy personnel presents a sensitive challenge for Indian diplomacy.

In FY2022-23, India's total imports from Qatar were valued at $16.81 billion, with LNG imports accounting for 49.5% of the total. India's other major imports from Qatar include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), plastics, and petrochemicals. On the other hand, India's exports to Qatar were valued at just $1.97 billion in the same period. India imported 10.74 million tonnes of LNG from Qatar, representing 54% of the total LNG imports. Despite efforts to diversify sourcing, it may take several years to reduce the reliance on Qatar for LNG imports.

The global LNG market has become a seller's market due to disruptions in Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. The spot LNG market is prone to price volatility, while term contracts provide a more stable and reasonable price. Qatar, as the world's largest exporter of LNG, holds a strong position in the market. Many countries, including India, are looking to secure long-term contracts with major suppliers like Qatar. The article also mentions that the global LNG market may eventually turn into a buyer's market due to new LNG export projects, but this is still years away.

Overall, the article highlights the significance of the India-Qatar trade relationship, especially in terms of LNG imports, and the challenges India faces in diversifying its energy sources and reducing reliance on Qatar.</description>

			<title>What is West Bengal’s alleged PDS scam, in which ED has arrested TMC Minister Jyotipriya Mallick?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/west-bengal-pds-scam-explained-arrest-tmc-jyotipriya-mallick-9002334/</link>
			<description>West Bengal Forest Minister Jyotipriya Mallick has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his alleged involvement in the state's Public Distribution System (PDS) scam. The scam involves the illegal distribution of rice and wheat, where Mallick and businessman Bakibur Rahman are said to be involved. Rahman would supply lesser quantities of grains to distributors, who would then sell them at lower prices to the poor. The remaining balance would be sold in the open market for profit. The ED had previously arrested Rahman and conducted search operations at various locations connected to him. This PDS scam is one of several alleged scams involving the Trinamool Congress (TMC) party in West Bengal, including cases related to recruitment, smuggling, and coal. The ED document reveals details about the scam, stating that mill owners collected money from the government for selling grains but supplied lesser quantities. The profit from this mismatch in distribution was divided between suppliers, mill owners, government officials, and the Minister's office. Irregularities in the PDS distribution were first flagged during the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020, leading to protests and criticism from both the Central government and West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. The West Bengal government denied these allegations but faced mounting troubles as evidence emerged.</description>

			<title>Li Keqiang was once tipped to be President of China. What happened?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/li-keqiang-passed-away-china-premier-explained-9002115/</link>
			<description>Former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has died at the age of 68 after suffering a heart attack. Li was a longtime member of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) standing committee of the politburo, the highest policy-making body in the country. He served as premier for a decade before being ousted from the politburo in 2022. Despite his ouster and reduced role in recent years, Li was involved in major aspects of Chinese policy and had a unique position among other Chinese leaders due to his academic background and ability to communicate in English. Li was known for championing the opening up of the Chinese economy and was involved in economic policy. However, his influence and power declined under President Xi Jinping, who consolidated power and sidelined Li's faction within the CCP. Li's tenure also saw criticism, including questions about his performance during his provincial governorships and a public perception of "bad luck." Despite his efforts, the concentration of power under Xi limited Li's ability to enact economic reforms. Li will likely be remembered for his concern for the welfare of ordinary people, but also for what could have been.</description>

			<title>Inform customers when banks ask for their credit score: What RBI has told credit bureaus</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/customers-banks-credit-score-rbi-9001711/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has instructed credit information companies (CICs) to notify customers via SMS or email when their Credit Information Report (CIR) is accessed by banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Additionally, banks and NBFCs must send alerts to customers when they submit information on default or Days Past Due (DPD) on existing credit. These new rules will be implemented within six months. CICs collect and analyze credit information from banks and NBFCs to calculate credit scores for individuals and credit ranks for companies. A high credit score increases the chances of obtaining a loan at a favorable rate, while a low score may result in loan denial. The RBI has also mandated that CICs provide individuals with a free full credit report, including credit score, once a year. Customers can apply for data correction if they believe their information is incorrect, and CICs must inform customers of the reasons for data correction rejections. CICs should conduct periodic reviews of their search and match logic algorithm and disclose complaint details on their websites.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, highlighting the raw brutality of the attacks and the high number of hostages held by Hamas. It also mentions the devastating impact on both Israeli and Palestinian civilians, with airstrikes destroying Gaza City and forcing people to flee.

			<description>Eight former personnel of the Indian Navy have been sentenced to death by a Qatari court. The men were working for a private company overseeing the induction of submarines in the Qatari Emiri Naval Force. The reasons for their arrest and the alleged crime they have been sentenced for are not publicly known. The Indian government has been closely monitoring the situation and providing support to the arrested sailors. India has maintained a stance in accordance with international laws, similar to the Enrica Lexie-Italian Marines case. The families of the former Navy personnel have also filed a Mercy Plea to the Emir of Qatar.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/jerusalem-baba-farids-lodge-history-explained-9000641/</link>
			<description>The Indian Hospice in Jerusalem has a long history dating back to the 12th century. Legend has it that Baba Farid, a Sufi saint from Punjab, spent time meditating at this spot, and over time it became a shrine and hospice for Indian Muslims visiting Jerusalem. The lodge within the hospice, known as Zawiya Al-Hindiya, has retained its association with India despite changing rulers. In the early 20th century, the lodge underwent renovations and repairs with the help of Muslim patrons from India. After India gained independence, the lodge sought official recognition from the Indian embassy in Egypt. Today, the Indian Hospice continues to serve as a sanctuary for travelers and pilgrims from India and hosts various organizations within its premises. The property is owned by the Waqf Board of India and is accessible only to individuals of Indian citizenship or heritage.</description>

			<title>Who are the 8 Indian Navy veterans sentenced to death by a court in Qatar, and what is the case against them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/qatar-death-penalty-indian-navy-personnel-9000611/</link>
			<description>Eight former Indian Navy personnel have been sentenced to death by a court in Qatar. The reasons for their arrest and the awarding of the death penalty are not known, and their families were not informed of the charges against them. The case poses a significant diplomatic challenge for the Indian government. The veterans were working at a defense services provider company owned by an Omani national, who was also arrested but later released. The company had connections to the Qatari Emiri Naval Force, but its new website does not mention this or the former Navy officers who held leadership roles. The arrested men had been working at the company for several years before their arrests. The charges against them were never made public, but they were put in solitary confinement, leading to speculation of a security-related offense. India and Qatar have had friendly relations for many years, with strong trade and defense cooperation ties. This incident is the second major challenge to the relationship in recent years, following a controversy over derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad made by a BJP spokesperson. The news of the death penalty comes at a time when tensions are high in the Middle East due to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, and Qatar is playing a role as a mediator in the crisis.</description>

			<title>Why have 33 US states sued Meta?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/33-us-states-sued-meta-mental-health-social-media-9000258/</link>
			<description>Dozens of US states have filed a lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, alleging that the tech giant has contributed to the youth mental health crisis. The attorneys general of 33 states, including California and New York, claim that Meta repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and intentionally encouraged young people to engage in addictive and compulsive social media use. The lawsuit comes two years after former Meta employee Frances Haugen blew the whistle on the company, revealing an internal study that showed many young girls on Instagram suffering from depression and anxiety related to body image issues. The lawsuit specifically mentions features such as likes, alerts, and filters, which are known to promote body dysmorphia in young users. Meta has denied the allegations and expressed disappointment that the attorneys general chose to pursue legal action instead of collaborating with the industry to establish clearer standards for apps used by teens. Haugen's testimony to Congress and internal documents she released have also been cited in the lawsuit, which highlights the negative impact of Instagram on teenagers' mental health. The research on social media's adverse effects, including increased levels of anxiety and depression, has been well-documented.</description>

			<title>Three reasons why Israel has still not launched its ground offensive into Gaza</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/reasons-israel-not-launched-ground-offensive-gaza-9000202/</link>
			<description>Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has stated that the country will launch a ground offensive into Gaza following an air offensive by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). However, there are several reasons why Israel has not yet initiated a full-scale ground invasion. Firstly, the US administration under President Joe Biden has reportedly advised Israel to delay the invasion in order to strategize and prevent excessive loss of civilian lives. The US has requested time to complete preparations for a broader conflict, including deploying air defense systems in the Gulf and sending an aircraft carrier and marines. Additionally, there are over 200 hostages being held in unknown locations in Gaza, making it unlikely that Israel could rescue all of them by force. The delay in the ground offensive may be an attempt to negotiate for more hostage releases before launching a military operation. Furthermore, Gaza's extensive network of underground tunnels poses a challenge for Israeli forces. These tunnels house Hamas command centers, stockpile weapons, and potentially hold hostages. Previous attempts to bomb the tunnels have been unsuccessful. The IDF is concerned about endangering the safety of hostages if they strike the tunnel network. The complexity of eliminating Hamas' infrastructure in Gaza is another factor holding Israel back. Former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter suggests that many of the reservists called up by Israel are not combat-ready and may not be prepared for a conventional ground battle against Hamas. There is also concern about Hezbollah opening a front in southern Lebanon simultaneously with a conflict in Gaza, which would strain Israel's resources and manpower. Iran has warned that it could get involved if the situation worsens in Gaza. Reports of civilian casualties could also escalate Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, requiring Israel to allocate additional forces and resources to contain it. Finally, even if Israel were successful in eliminating Hamas from Gaza, it would be challenging to administer the territory long-term as successors to Hamas may be even more radical and extremist.</description>

			<title>What is the ‘One nation, One Student ID’ initiative of the Union govt?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-nation-one-student-id-apaar-explained-9000086/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has introduced the Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR), a special ID system for all students in India. Under this initiative, each student will receive a lifelong APAAR ID, which will track their academic progress from pre-primary education to higher education. APAAR will also serve as a gateway to Digilocker, a digital system where students can store important documents and achievements. The goal of APAAR is to make education hassle-free and reduce the need for physical documents. It aims to reduce fraud and duplicate certificates by providing a single, trusted reference for educational institutions. Every individual will have a unique APAAR ID linked to the Academic Bank Credit (ABC), which stores information about the credits earned by students. When a student changes schools, their data in the ABC will be transferred to the new school using the APAAR ID, eliminating the need for physical documents. To sign up for APAAR, students will need to provide basic information and their Aadhar number for verification. The government assures that the information shared will be kept confidential and only used for educational purposes. Registration for APAAR is voluntary, not mandatory.</description>

The investigation found that Ansari collected funds from investors through his courses and workshops, as well as through bank accounts linked to him and his company.

			<title>Expert Explains | What happens now in Mahua Moitra cash-for-query case: process, precedent</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/p-d-t-achary-explains-mahua-case-process-precedent-8999614/</link>
			<description>BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai will appear before the ethics committee of Lok Sabha on Thursday in connection with Dubey's accusation against Trinamool Congress member Mahua Moitra. Dubey alleged that Moitra accepted bribes to ask questions in parliament that targeted the Adani group. The allegations were based on information provided by Dehadrai and confirmed by real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani. Hiranandani issued a sworn affidavit stating that Moitra gave him her parliament login and password to post questions on her behalf. The question at hand is whether Moitra asked questions in return for consideration and if there is illegal gratification involved. If established, this could be a serious breach of privilege and contempt of the house. The matter should have been referred to the privileges committee, which is responsible for addressing breaches of privilege and contempt of the house. The ethics committee typically deals with questions of propriety but not alleged breaches of privilege. The committee will call the parties involved, including the complainant, witnesses, and Moitra, who has the right to cross-examine the complainant. The committee can recommend suspension, but it does not have executive powers. Its recommendations will go before the house for a decision, which can accept or modify the punishment. If a member is expelled, they can challenge it based on unconstitutionality, gross illegality, or denial of natural justice. The court's intervention in such cases is limited.</description>

			<title>LS Ethics Committee: its constitution, members</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ls-ethics-committee-its-constitution-members-8999613/</link>
			<description>The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee, responsible for handling complaints against members of parliament, last met on July 27, 2021. The committee, which was established over twenty years ago, mostly deals with relatively minor offenses. The members of the committee are appointed by the Speaker for a one-year term, and it is currently headed by Vinod Kumar Sonkar from the BJP. Other members include representatives from various political parties. The idea of ethics panels for both houses was proposed in 1996, and the Rajya Sabha ethics committee was formed in 1997. The Lok Sabha ethics committee was recommended during the 13th Lok Sabha and became a permanent part of the house in 2015. In 2005, motions were adopted to expel several MPs accused of accepting money for asking questions in parliament. The BJP demanded that the report be sent to the privileges committee so that the MPs could defend themselves. Any person can file a complaint against an MP, accompanied by evidence and an affidavit. The committee only entertains complaints that involve misconduct by MPs and conducts a preliminary inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. After evaluating a complaint, the committee presents its report to the Speaker for consideration. The work of the ethics committee and privileges committee often overlap, with more serious accusations typically going to the privileges committee. The privileges committee's role is to protect the freedom, authority, and dignity of parliament. The ethics committee specifically addresses cases of misconduct by MPs.</description>

			<title>What is Cubism — and how Braque and Picasso invented it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/what-is-cubism-braque-picasso-8999424/</link>
			<description>Pablo Picasso, a renowned Spanish artist, was born on October 25, 1881. He is known for his extensive body of work, which includes paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics. Picasso, along with French painter George Braque, invented Cubism, a revolutionary art movement that emerged in 1907 and lasted until 1914. Cubism rejected traditional approaches to art and instead focused on depicting objects from multiple viewpoints. It was not about creating cubes, despite its name. The movement had a significant impact on the art world, inspiring other non-representational art movements like Surrealism. Picasso and Braque drew inspiration from French artist Paul Cézanne, who represented nature using geometric shapes. Cubism also reflected the scientific and technological advancements of the early 20th century, with artists discussing concepts like the fourth dimension. Cubism developed in two phases: analytical cubism, characterized by muted tones and multiple viewpoints, and synthetic cubism, which incorporated real-life objects and brighter colors.</description>

			<title>The story of the Osage Indians’ murders, subject of Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/osage-indians-murders-killers-of-the-flower-moon-8999410/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the historical events surrounding the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe in Oklahoma, during the 1920s. After oil was discovered on their land, members of the tribe were murdered, leading to the formation of the FBI. The killings exposed the exploitation of Native American resources by white settlers. The upcoming film "Killers of the Flower Moon" tells this story based on David Grann's book. The Osage were forced to give up their territory and move to Kansas before being allocated a reservation in northeastern Oklahoma. The land they moved to had significant oil deposits, which made the Osage wealthy. However, they were not fully in control of their finances due to a system of financial guardians mandated by law. The article focuses on Mollie Burkhart's family, whose members were targeted for their headrights to the oil deposits. Investigations into the murders were initially unsuccessful until an FBI agent named Tom White connected them to William K Hale. Eventually, a law was passed to prevent non-Osage individuals from inheriting headrights. Many believe that the death toll among the Osage was much higher than officially reported.</description>

			<title>NCERT panel suggests replacing ‘India’ with ‘Bharat’: A brief history of the nation’s names</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/ncert-textbooks-replace-india-with-bharat-8999272/</link>
			<description>The 2022 Social Science committee of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in India has suggested that the country should be called "Bharat" in all Social Science textbooks up to Class 12. The committee's chairman, Prof CI Issac, hopes that this change will be implemented in the next academic year, pending approval from the NCERT. The debate about the nation's name has been ongoing, and it gained attention during the G20 Summit when the invitation for the dinner hosted by the President mentioned "The President of Bharat" instead of "President of India." The name "Bharat" has roots in ancient literature and is associated with the land between the sea in the south and the abode of snow in the north. The name "Hindustan" also has historical significance, derived from the Persian cognate form of the Sanskrit word "Sindhu." Over time, the name "India" became more commonly used, especially during British colonial rule. The adoption of "India" as the primary name for the country in the Constitution of India was not without debate, with some arguing for "Bharat" or "Bharatvarsha" instead. Ultimately, the committee adopted the name "India, that is, Bharat."</description>

			<description>The alleged suicide of Balwinder Kaur, an unemployed assistant professor in Punjab, has sparked a political controversy. Kaur blamed disputes at home and state education minister Harjot Singh Bains for the stress caused by not getting a job despite being selected as an assistant professor. Kaur was a member of a union of unemployed teachers who have been protesting against the government. Farmer unions and opposition parties have joined their cause, demanding Bains's arrest. The police have booked Kaur's husband and father-in-law for mental cruelty and abetment to suicide. The controversy stems from 1,158 appointments made under the previous government that were later struck down by the High Court as unconstitutional. The recruitment process was challenged in court, with petitioners alleging that it was done hastily for political reasons and violated guidelines. The court ultimately quashed the entire recruitment process. Protesters are demanding justice for Kaur and immediate postings, while the government has challenged the High Court order. The next hearing is scheduled for November 29.</description>

			<title>The benefits that Agniveers get, compared with those of regular soldiers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/agniveers-regular-soldiers-benefits-agnipath-8999008/</link>
			<description>The death of a 22-year-old Agniveer deployed on the Siachen glacier has raised concerns about the Agnipath scheme, a contractual recruitment program for the armed forces in India. The scheme, introduced last year, allows recruits to serve for four years with the possibility of joining the services on a regular basis afterward. However, there are criticisms regarding the lack of benefits provided under the scheme, such as gratuity and pensionary benefits. The government introduced the scheme to address the suspension of recruitments due to the Covid-19 pandemic and to bring down defense pension bills. Agniveers receive a monthly remuneration of Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 and are entitled to risk and hardship allowances. They also contribute to a Seva Nidhi package, which provides financial support upon completion of four years. However, unlike regular soldiers, Agniveers do not receive a pension post-retirement and have limited benefits for their families in case of death or disability. The article highlights the disparities between regular soldiers and Agniveers in terms of salary, insurance coverage, gratuity, and education allowances.</description>

			<title>Why the IDF will struggle to ‘neutralise’ Gaza’s tunnels</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/idf-neutralise-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-8998837/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenge that Israeli forces would face in a ground invasion of Gaza due to the extensive network of tunnels controlled by Hamas. The tunnels, which are approximately 500 km in length and up to 70 m underground, serve various purposes such as smuggling essential items into Gaza and transporting weaponry for Hamas. The tunnels also function as defensive and offensive structures for military operations against Israel. Locating and eliminating these tunnels is a difficult task, as they are often found through human detective work rather than surveillance technology. Additionally, fighting inside the tunnels poses risks for Israeli soldiers, and using bunker-buster bombs could result in collateral damage due to Gaza's dense population. Despite Israel's efforts, it is unlikely that the entire tunnel network would be destroyed.</description>

			<title>The new made-in-India EV charging standard for bikes and scooters: here’s why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/india-new-national-ev-charging-standard-8998587/</link>
			<description>The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has approved a new AC and DC combined charging connector standard for light electric vehicles (LEVs) in India. This standard, called ISI7017 (Part 2 / Sec 7): 2023, is the first in the world to combine AC and DC charging for LEVs. It was developed through collaboration among NITI Aayog, the Department of Science and Technology, Ather Energy, and other government and industry stakeholders. The new standard aims to address the issue of multiple charging standards used by different EV makers in India, which makes it difficult for public charging stations to cater to all types of EVs. While the new standard is a step towards interoperability and addressing range anxiety, it does not mandate EV makers to use a uniform standard. In comparison, countries like China have a national standard (GB/T) for EV charging connectors, while Europe uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) as its predominant standard. The US does not have a national standard but some collaboration between EV makers has taken place. Japan uses the CHAdeMO charging standard.</description>

			<description>The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has approved a new charging connector standard for light electric vehicles (LEVs) in India. The standard, called ISI7017 (Part 2 / Sec 7): 2023, is the first in the world to combine alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) charging for LEVs. This standard was developed through collaboration among NITI Aayog, the Department of Science and Technology, Ather Energy, and other stakeholders. The new standard aims to address the issue of multiple charging standards used by different EV makers in India, which makes it difficult for public charging stations to cater to all types of EVs. However, the standard is not mandatory for EV makers to use, which means that different charging standards may still be used, contributing to range anxiety and hindering the adoption of EVs. In contrast, countries like China, the United States, Europe, and Japan have their own national or regional charging connector standards in place.</description>

			<title>Telangana’s law under scanner: How preventive detention works</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/telanganas-law-under-scanner-how-preventive-detention-works-8998057/</link>
			<description>The Telangana government's use of its stringent preventive detention law is being questioned by the Supreme Court ahead of the Assembly polls next month. The law allows for the detention of individuals by the state without trial or conviction, based solely on suspicion. Preventive detention can last up to a year unless extended. Unlike pre-trial detention, preventive detention can be used as a measure even if no crime has been committed. India's constitution allows for preventive detention under Article 22, despite its emphasis on individual liberty. Several states in India also have similar preventive detention laws. The article explains the provisions and safeguards under Article 22 for preventive detention, including the role of advisory boards and the right of the detainee to challenge the detention order in court. However, the scope of judicial review for preventive detention is limited, as the constitution prioritizes the state's subjective satisfaction over fundamental rights. Courts often strike down detention orders on technical grounds.</description>

			<title>Why Mumbai is witnessing more poor air quality days</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-mumbai-is-witnessing-more-poor-air-quality-days-8998070/</link>
			<description>The air quality in Mumbai during the winter months is deteriorating, similar to what has been happening in Delhi for the past decade. Previously, Mumbai was considered immune to air pollution due to its coastal location and strong sea breezes that would blow away dust and particles. However, in the last two years, this geographical advantage no longer offers reliable protection. Last year, Mumbai experienced a long period of poor air quality from November to January, with some days being more polluted than Delhi. This trend continued last week when the air quality index (AQI) exceeded 300 in certain parts of the city. Adverse meteorological conditions have contributed to these particularly bad spells, but overall, Mumbai's air quality has been consistently declining. The direction and strength of winds play a crucial role in determining air quality in Mumbai. While the city generates pollutants at a similar rate to Delhi and other urban centers, strong winds usually help sweep away dust particles. However, disruptions in wind patterns can impact air quality, as seen last year when winds changed directions less frequently than usual. This disruption may have been influenced by La Nina conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean. La Nina is a large-scale phenomenon that affects weather events worldwide. Last year's prolonged and strong La Nina event likely played a role in Mumbai's poor winter air quality. However, La Nina has ended and been replaced by El Nino, whose effects are not yet known. Last week's dip in air quality was caused by different factors, including calmer winds as the monsoon retreated and a temperature gradient between Mumbai and nearby hilly regions that brought dust from construction projects into the city. While unfavorable local weather conditions contribute to poor air quality, the main cause is high levels of pollution exceeding the city's carrying capacity due to increased economic activity, vehicles, construction, consumption, and emissions. Experts warn that Mumbai's air quality has been steadily declining over the past decade and efforts to mitigate the impacts are insufficient.</description>

			<title>Iceland PM joins women’s strike: Why the ‘world’s most gender-equal country’ is protesting inequality</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iceland-pm-joins-womens-strike-why-8997923/</link>
			<description>Women in Iceland, known as the world's most gender-equal country, went on a one-day strike to protest against gender discrimination. Despite Iceland's reputation as an equality paradise, issues such as the gender pay gap and gender-based violence persist. The strike, inspired by a similar action in 1975, saw women refusing all kinds of work, paid and unpaid. Sectors dominated by women, such as healthcare and education, were heavily affected. The Prime Minister, Katrin Jakobsdóttir, also participated in the strike. Activists aim to highlight the connection between underpaid work and gender-based violence, both stemming from the view of women as lesser. The strike aims to challenge societal mindsets and demand urgent action for gender equality in Iceland.</description>

			<title>RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat mentions ‘woke’ in speech: What does the word mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/rss-mohan-bhagwat-woke-speech-meaning-explained-8997724/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In his Vijaydashami speech in Nagpur, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat criticized "cultural Marxists or woke" individuals, referring to them as deceitful and destructive forces in India. He claimed that these individuals, despite claiming lofty goals, have ulterior motives of taking control of media and academia to create confusion and corruption in education, culture, politics, and society. The term "woke" originated in the United States within Black communities, symbolizing awareness and vigilance against violence and social injustice. Over time, it gained prominence through civil rights movements and Black artists' music. Following incidents like the shooting of Michael Brown and George Floyd's death, "woke" became associated with discussions on police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. The term has now gone global, with conservative politicians mocking inclusivity as "woke" and using it to criticize causes like gender equality and environmental conservation. However, there is concern among progressive groups that the true activism-heavy history of the term is being diluted as powerful individuals co-opt it for political correctness without meaningful action. Additionally, companies often use the term in advertising campaigns for marketing purposes. While conservatives view "woke" as identity-driven change at odds with liberalism and capitalism, some argue that its message should be stronger, while others question the need for it altogether.</description>

			<title>Bhagwat praises Ambedkar: How the RSS came to embrace the father of India’s constitution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bhagwat-ambedkar-rss-8997717/</link>
			<description>RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has called on his audience to read B.R. Ambedkar's last two speeches in the same way as they read K.B. Hedgewar, the founder of the RSS. This is part of the RSS's practice of praising Ambedkar, particularly since the BJP came to power in 2014. Historically, the RSS criticized Ambedkar and his work, but their position has since evolved. The RSS's initial opposition to Ambedkar was due to his advocacy of reforming Hindu personal laws and his support of the Hindu Code Bill, which aimed to give Hindu women rights. However, since the Meenakshipuram incident in 1981 and the mass conversion of lower-caste Hindus to Islam, the RSS has sought to invoke Ambedkar and Dalits. They have organized gatherings and events to promote Hindu unity and have celebrated Ambedkar's birthday alongside that of Hedgewar. The RSS has also established education centers and sewa vibhags to engage with Dalit communities. In recent years, Bhagwat has emphasized the need for Hindu unity and condemned discrimination. The RSS's shift in position is reflected in the publication of articles praising Ambedkar and featuring his picture on the cover of their journal.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/united-nations-founded-history-1945-evolution-explained-8997530/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Nations (UN) was founded on October 24, 1945, after the end of World War II. It was created to maintain world peace and prevent future wars. The UN replaced the League of Nations, which had failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. The idea for the UN was first discussed by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1941, and it was officially established with the signing of the UN Declaration by representatives of 51 nations in 1945. The UN has since grown to include 193 member states and has expanded its scope to address various global issues such as health, environment, and human rights. It has achieved significant milestones, including the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948 and the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002. However, it has also faced criticism for its failures, such as its inability to prevent genocides in Rwanda and sexual misconduct allegations against its peacekeeping missions. The UN aims to address these challenges and work towards sustainable development goals in the next decade.</description>

			<title>No US House Speaker for over 20 days: Why the Republican party can’t unite</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-house-speaker-why-republican-party-cant-unite-8997337/</link>
			<description>House Republicans have been struggling to find a replacement for the Speaker after a series of failed attempts. The divisions within the party have made it virtually impossible to unite behind a single candidate. The factions within the party, including the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, the Main Street Caucus, the Mainstream Republican Governance Group, and the Problem Solvers Caucus, each have their own ideologies and interests. Personal vendettas and bad blood among members further complicate the situation. The recent ousting of California Rep. Kevin McCarthy as Speaker was due in part to conflicts with other members, including Rep. Matt Gaetz. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the current front-runner for the nomination, is facing similar hurdles, with some allies of former President Donald Trump viewing him as disloyal. To become Speaker, a Republican must secure 217 votes, which is a challenging task given the party's current circumstances. The article highlights the difficulty of finding a unifying figure within a deeply divided party.</description>

			<title>US bond yield hits 16-year high of 5 pc: Why is it rising and what does it signal?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-bond-yield-why-rising-explained-8997263/</link>
			<description>The yield on 10-year government bonds in the US rose to its highest level since July 2007, reaching 5.02%. This increase in bond yields is due to concerns over inflation and the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high for longer. In India, the yield on 10-year government bonds is already at a high of 7.38%. Factors such as rising crude oil prices, inflation risks, and the US government's borrowing plans have contributed to the rise in bond yields. The increase in yields indicates that the cost of funds in the financial system is rising, leading to higher interest rates. This can have an impact on the overall financial system and put upward pressure on interest rates in the banking system. Rising yields can also lead to a decline in bond prices and impact debt funds and corporate bonds.</description>

			<title>China to build the world’s largest ‘ghost particle’ detector: What are neutrinos and why do they need to be detected?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/china-largest-ghost-particle-detector-neutrinos-explained-8997219/</link>
			<description>China is constructing a large telescope in the western Pacific Ocean to detect neutrinos, also known as "ghost particles". Neutrinos are tiny, chargeless particles that are abundant in the universe but difficult to observe due to their weak interactions with other particles. The new telescope, called "Trident", will be the largest of its kind and will be located in the South China Sea. It is expected to be 10,000 times more sensitive than existing underwater telescopes and will help scientists study the energy and source of neutrinos. Neutrinos are still not fully understood, and their behavior defies established rules of physics. However, understanding them could help solve scientific mysteries such as the origin of cosmic rays. The construction of Trident will bring scientists closer to unraveling the secrets of neutrinos and the origins of our universe.</description>

			<title>The uneven spread of medical colleges, debate over the regulator’s new guidelines</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-uneven-spread-of-medical-colleges-debate-over-the-regulators-new-guidelines-8996819/</link>
			<description>Nagaland recently opened its first medical college, called the Nagaland Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (NIMSR). The college will have 100 seats available for MBBS students in the upcoming academic session. The government aims to distribute medical colleges evenly across the country. However, a new regulation issued by the National Medical Commission (NMC) in August has put a hold on the establishment of new medical colleges and the expansion of existing ones in states that already have more than 100 medical education seats per million population. This has caused frustration among southern states, as they are now ineligible for additional medical education seats. The NMC argues that these guidelines will reduce regional disparities and ensure quality education for all. They estimate that the country could potentially add 40,000 more MBBS seats if colleges are distributed evenly. The distribution of medical college seats currently varies among states, with Tamil Nadu having the most seats followed by Karnataka and Maharashtra. Meghalaya, Bihar, and Jharkhand have the most acute deficiencies in medical college seats relative to their populations. Despite the government's efforts to increase seats, there is still a shortage of faculty in hospitals even in major cities like Delhi. The NMC's decision will only apply to new colleges or increased seats from the 2024-25 academic year onwards. Many experts agree that there is a need to rationalize the distribution of medical colleges, given the increasing number of private colleges. They believe that the NMC's ratio is necessary to ensure a fair distribution of colleges across the country and to avoid an oversupply of healthcare professionals in certain areas.</description>

			<title>How Ramleela reached Trinidad and became a representation of ‘Indianness’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/ramleela-trinidad-indentured-labour-8996443/</link>
			<description>Ramleela, a traditional folk theatre performance in India, has made its way to Trinidad through the Indian diaspora. In the early 19th century, Trinidad turned to indentured labor from India after slavery was abolished. The first boatload of indentured Indians arrived in Trinidad in 1845, bringing with them their culture and the Ramcharitmanas, a Hindu text. Ramleela became popular among the Indian community in Trinidad, but its popularity declined as formal education spread and younger generations became less familiar with the Manas. Migration to urban areas and exposure to other cultural influences also contributed to the decline. However, Ramleela has undergone innovation and adaptation to appeal to younger audiences, with increased financial backing leading to higher production values. Despite these changes, the essence of the story and performance remains the same, serving as an anchor for the Indian community in Trinidad and representing their Indianness.</description>

			<title>Hand, Lotus, noodle bowl, charger and more: How are symbols allotted to political parties in India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/hand-lotus-how-political-parties-allotted-symbols-explained-8996390/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court in India has rejected a petition filed by the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) party in Telangana, which challenged the allotment of election symbols to two other parties. BRS argued that the symbols of 'road roller' and 'chapatti roller' given to the Yuga Thulasi Party and Alliance of Democratic Reforms Party respectively, were too similar to BRS's symbol of a car and could confuse voters. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, stating that voters were intelligent enough to differentiate between the symbols. The article goes on to explain how symbols are allotted to political parties in India and whether parties have a say in choosing them. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for the allotment of symbols, which can be either reserved or free. Recognized parties get exclusive symbols, while unregistered parties can choose from free symbols. The ECI publishes lists specifying parties and their symbols through a notification in the Gazette of India. The article also mentions that the late MS Sethi, a former draughtsman for the ECI, sketched many of the symbols used by political parties. Parties are allowed to state their preferences for symbols, but they must not resemble existing symbols or have any religious or communal connotations. When a recognized party splits, the Election Commission decides on the symbol assignment.</description>

			<title>Israel wants civilians to flee northern Gaza: Why that’s not an option for many</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-war-civilians-to-flee-8996405/</link>
			<description>Many people in northern Gaza are unable to flee due to the high cost and lack of safety guarantees. The Israeli military has intensified its bombardment of the area and urged civilians to move south, warning that those who don't may be considered terrorists. However, the danger of Israeli airstrikes on the road has made travel expensive, with drivers charging between $200 and $300 per family. The dire situation in Gaza, with shortages of food, water, and supplies, has led to over half of the population being displaced. The United Nations has condemned the labeling of civilians as accomplices in terrorism and warned that deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime. The Israeli military claims it treats civilians as such and does not target them. Despite the evacuation warnings, airstrikes continue to hit the south, and some families choose to stay in the north due to the lack of familiarity and fear of ending up on the streets. One family's attempt to seek shelter in the south resulted in an airstrike that killed several members.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and ex-Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi were indicted by a special court in the Cypher case. This case is related to the disclosure of a classified cable sent to Islamabad by Pakistan's ambassador in Washington. Imran and Shah Mahmood have been accused of making the document public, although Imran denies revealing its content publicly and claims the document is proof of a US conspiracy to remove him from office. The classified cable contained details of a meeting between US state department officials and the Pakistani ambassador. The US officials expressed their displeasure regarding Imran's neutrality on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The cypher case gained attention when Imran mentioned the secret document during a gathering, alleging an international conspiracy against him. The former PM was later convicted and sentenced to three years in prison in a separate graft case, and he is currently awaiting the court's ruling on the cypher case.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country's largest carmaker, has reported sales of one million automatic vehicles.

However, visa services provider VFS Global clarified that its visa application centers in India will continue to operate normally. This assurance brings relief to many Canada visa seekers, particularly students, as a significant number of Indian students go to Canada for educational purposes. VFS Global is authorized to accept applications for visitor visas, study visas, work permits, and travel document applications. It is important to note that while VFS Global helps with the application process, the decision to issue or refuse a visa is made by immigration officers of the IRCC.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking | Bidenomics: What is it? Has it worked? What is its significance?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-joe-biden-economics-explained-8995387/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In an article by Udit Misra, it is highlighted that the year 2024 will be significant for the global economy due to elections in major economies such as India, Russia, the UK, the EU, and the US. These countries collectively contribute to more than 50% of the global GDP in 2023, with a combined GDP of over $54 trillion. The US election is particularly important, as President Joe Biden is expected to run for re-election, facing a challenge from former President Donald Trump. Bidenomics, the economic policies introduced by President Biden, is a key focus of the article [[SOURCE 1]].

Bidenomics is a term used to refer to the economic policies implemented by the Biden administration. It is a reaction to the economic structure that has been in place since the Reagan presidency in 1981. Reaganomics, which aimed to stimulate economic activity through tax cuts for businesses and reduced government intervention, has been criticized for exacerbating income and wealth inequality. Bidenomics seeks to address these inequalities and promote inclusive growth by investing in infrastructure, reducing trade dependence on countries like China, and raising living standards for the middle and lower-income groups [[SOURCE 1]].

The article discusses two main concerns regarding Bidenomics. First, there is a question of whether it is working effectively. While macro indicators such as GDP growth and unemployment rates show positive trends, there are concerns about income and wealth inequality. Real income growth for the middle 40% of the working population has remained negative for most of the Biden presidency, indicating that the benefits of economic growth may not be reaching everyone [[SOURCE 1]].

The second concern is the ideological disagreement with Bidenomics. Critics argue that the policies implemented, such as providing subsidies to domestic companies, may distort markets and lead to a global subsidy war. This could harm poorer nations and increase inefficiency and corruption within the US. However, proponents of Bidenomics argue that it is necessary to address inequality and counter global rivals like China [[SOURCE 1]].

In conclusion, Bidenomics is an economic approach aimed at reducing inequality and promoting inclusive growth. While it has shown positive macroeconomic indicators, there are concerns about income and wealth inequality and ideological disagreements with the policies implemented. The impact of Bidenomics will continue to be debated as the Biden administration moves forward with its economic agenda [[SOURCE 1]].</description>

			<title>Why Israel attacked Syria’s airports, amid its ongoing war with Hamas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-israel-attacked-syria-war-hamas-8995086/</link>
			<description>Israeli warplanes launched strikes on parts of Gaza and two airports in Syria, approximately two weeks after Hamas carried out the largest attack on Israel since its founding. Israel has not explicitly stated its motives for the latest attack but has previously expressed the need to prevent another front opening towards its north. The strikes are believed to be targeting the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, which has threatened attacks on Israel's north. Hezbollah has historically opposed Israel and received support from Iran. Syria, which has long opposed Israel, has also been involved due to its alliance with Hezbollah. Israel has carried out previous strikes in Syria during the war. Concerns arise from the sizeable force and weaponry of Hezbollah, potentially leading to a ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces and spillover effects in West Asia.</description>

			<title>Canada recalls 41 diplomats from India: What is the 1961 Vienna Convention, why it was invoked</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canda-recalls-diplomats-india-why-the-1961-vienna-convention-explained-8994999/</link>
			<description>The Canadian government has recalled 41 diplomats and their family members from India due to concerns that their diplomatic immunity could be revoked. This move comes after India sought "parity" with Canada, asking it to reduce its diplomatic staff in the country. The dispute stems from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's remarks linking the Indian government to the killing of a pro-Khalistan separatist leader in Canada, which India rejected as baseless. The US and UK have backed Canada's diplomats, stating that they should be allowed to resolve differences on the ground. India has rejected Canada's claims and stated that its actions are consistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</description>

			<title>Israel-Hamas war: Gaza’s humanitarian situation explained</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gaza-humanitatian-aid-israel-hamas-palestine-conflict-8994765/</link>
			<description>Trucks carrying humanitarian aid have entered Gaza for the first time since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which led to a blockade. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the aid supplies, including medicines and medical supplies, will only address a fraction of the escalating health needs in the area. The Gaza Strip, home to 2.2 million people, has been facing shortages of medicine, fuel, and food due to the electricity cut off by Israel. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees reported that Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a large population of refugees. The ICRC highlighted the dire situation in hospitals where power shortages are risking the lives of patients. Gaza's unemployment rate is over 45%, and 80% of residents rely on humanitarian assistance. Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007, severely limiting the movement of people and essential supplies. The Rafa border crossing with Egypt is currently the only route for aid into Gaza.</description>

			<title>What is ‘Visa Shopping’ and why is it being done to enter countries in Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/visa-shopping-immigration-europe-schengen-explained-8994712/</link>
			<description>The practice of 'visa shopping' is becoming popular in several Indian states, including Punjab. Visa shopping refers to obtaining visas for countries that individuals may or may not visit during the granted visa period. This allows people to enter their preferred countries, particularly in Europe, even if they have obtained a visa for another European nation. People are also purchasing visas for countries they have no immediate plans to visit in order to increase their chances of obtaining visas for countries of their choice in the future. The Schengen Visa is a popular example of this, as it allows travellers to explore many European countries without the need for separate visas. The Schengen system was established in 1985 and allows people to travel freely between member countries without going through border controls. Many people opt to apply for a Schengen Visa from a country with an easier application process and then use it to travel to their intended destination. While this practice is not illegal if travellers adhere to the norms and guidelines of the visa process, legal concerns arise if a person seeks a visa for a particular country but stays in another or shows that their intentions were not to stay in that country but to only use it as an entry point. The Embassy of Estonia in New Delhi has advised against visa shopping and warned that there may be severe consequences, including refusal of the visa or being offloaded from the plane or returned back home from the EU borders. Repeatedly engaging in visa shopping may also raise suspicion among officials.</description>

			<title>Who are the Bedouin Arabs in the Israeli army?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bedouin-arabs-israeli-army-8993875/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the role of Bedouin soldiers in Israel's military and their contributions to the country. The Bedouins are a nomadic Muslim Arab people who traditionally lived in the Negev desert in southern Israel. In the past, they provided security and intelligence to early Jewish settlers in Palestine during the Arab-Israeli War. Israel recognized a large number of Bedouins as citizens in the 1950s and built settlements for them in the Negev. Many Bedouin soldiers serve in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), particularly in scouting and tracking units. Specialized search and rescue units, mainly comprising Bedouins, were also formed by the IDF. The article mentions that army training is not compulsory for Bedouin youth, but many still volunteer, with a record number of approximately 600 enlisting in 2021. The Bedouin population in Israel currently numbers around 210,000 individuals, with a significant presence in the Negev desert. The Israeli government has launched Operation Negev Shield to integrate Bedouin communities into society through educational programs. The article also highlights the appointment of Israel's first Bedouin ambassador and the presence of Bedouin entrepreneurs in the country's high-tech sector.</description>

			<title>Nawaz Sharif back in Pakistan: What this means for the former PM, his country, and Imran Khan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nawaz-sharif-returns-pakistan-8993870/</link>
			<description>Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has returned to Pakistan after four years of voluntary exile in London. Sharif, who left Pakistan in 2019 for medical treatment while serving a prison sentence for corruption, landed in Islamabad and will travel to Lahore to hold a gathering of his supporters. His return is seen as a signal that the military is willing to give him another chance and help thwart Imran Khan and his party from coming to power. Sharif's downfall came after he lost support from the military and was accused of corruption. He was disqualified from office and later banned from politics. The military had previously supported Khan but their relationship soured, leading to Khan's ouster as prime minister. Sharif remains popular and the military hopes his return will help defeat Khan's party in the upcoming general elections. However, Sharif must have his corruption-related convictions overturned in order to run for office again.</description>

			<title>Israel missiles hit Gaza’s oldest church: What you need to know about the Church of Saint Porphyrius</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-missiles-hit-gazas-oldest-church-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-church-of-saint-porphyrius-8993651/</link>
			<description>An Israeli airstrike on a building near the Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza has caused significant damage to the church. The building, which was affiliated with the church, collapsed in the explosion. Around 500 people had sought refuge at the church compound during the recent hostilities, and at least 16 people were killed and many injured in the airstrike. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate has condemned the attack as a war crime, stating that targeting churches and their affiliated institutions is unacceptable. The Church of Saint Porphyrius, located in Gaza's Old City, has a long history dating back to the 5th century. It was converted into a mosque after the Islamic conquest but was later reclaimed and rebuilt by Crusaders. Today, it is one of three churches in Gaza and serves as an important institution for the Christian Palestinian community. The church has also provided sanctuary for Muslims during times of conflict. In 2014, during an Israeli bombing campaign, the church's courtyard was used for daily prayers and was also targeted, causing damage to nearby structures.</description>

			<title>As Israel-Hamas conflict gets deadlier, what happens to the India-Europe economic corridor?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/israel-hamas-india-europe-imec-corridor-8993474/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) faces significant challenges and complexities in light of the recent fighting in Israel and escalating tensions in the region. The project aims to physically connect a vast stretch of the Eurasian subcontinent through cross-country railway lines and shipping corridors. However, officials from multiple government ministries indicate that the ongoing conflict has made progress on the project even more difficult.

When Prime Minister Modi announced the IMEC alongside US President Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, there was an acknowledgment of the logistical complexities involved. This includes potential customs checks and clearance for consignments as well as navigating the complex geopolitics of the West Asian region.

The design of the corridor involves traversing diverse nations with different political dynamics, strategic interests, and historical tensions. The US backing was seen as crucial, especially considering the involvement of countries like Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. However, the recent outbreak of fighting between Hamas and Israel threatens to disrupt these efforts, potentially affecting the Saudi-Israel peace initiative.

The premature announcement of the project without finalized implementation details or funding plans has been criticized as lacking clarity. The use of the land route in the Arabian peninsula could offer logistical advantages by bypassing the congested Suez Canal. Indian officials emphasize the need for close coordination among various departments and ministries involved in the initiative.

The fresh trouble in the West Asia region poses a risk to diplomatic outreach between Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as other countries like the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan. Moreover, Turkey has announced its own project as a counter to the IMEC, citing disputed waters along the proposed sea route between Haifa in Israel and Piraeus in Greece.

The IMEC is part of a US-led initiative called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment (PGII), with discussions starting in January 2023. The alignment of the corridor stretches from Western India to Europe via the ports of Piraeus, Haifa, and Dubai. The corridor includes two separate routes: the east corridor connecting India to the Arabian Gulf and the northern corridor connecting the Arabian Gulf to Europe.

The IMEC aims to establish a reliable and cost-effective cross-border ship-to-rail transit network to facilitate the movement of goods and services between India and Europe. It also presents opportunities for laying cables for electricity and digital connectivity, as well as a pipeline for clean hydrogen export. However, the current conflict and geopolitical complexities pose significant challenges to the realization of this ambitious project.</description>

			<description>Senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan, his wife Tanzeen Fatima, and son Abdullah Azam Khan have been sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged forgery of Abdullah's birth certificate. This is the fourth case in which Azam has been convicted in the last year. The case was lodged in January 2019 on a complaint from a local BJP leader, and after 11 hearings, the court found the three guilty. The complaint stated that the accused conspired to obtain two birth certificates for personal gain, with one used for a passport and the other for government documents and university affiliation. The prosecution presented 70 documents and 15 witnesses, while the defense argued that there was no motive or criminal intent and that the case was politically motivated. The three have been convicted under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and can file an appeal against the judgement.</description>

			<title>Israel-Palestine conflict: How international humanitarian law views forced displacement and human shields</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/international-humanitarian-law-forced-displacement-human-shields-8992746/</link>
			<description>In an article, President Joe Biden accused Hamas of using innocent Palestinians as human shields. Israel has long made this accusation against Hamas, claiming that they hide behind civilians while targeting Israeli civilians. Protests condemning the forced displacement of Palestinians by Israel are ongoing in the Arab world and beyond, as many worry about a refugee influx and permanent Israeli occupation. The use of human shields is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law (IHL), and it is also prohibited to target human shields. The article discusses the complexities of the situation in Gaza due to the population density and highlights that regardless of intent, it would be illegal for Israel to attack civilian homes used for military purposes. Recently, Israel ordered hundreds of thousands of civilians to evacuate from northern Gaza, which could constitute forcible displacement under the statute of the International Criminal Court. The order was criticized by organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Norwegian Refugee Council. While warning civilians of military operations is necessary, it is illegal to threaten people to leave. Any displacement of civilians must be temporary and for their benefit, with guarantees of safety and return.</description>

			<title>Why the Indian Army is embracing AI</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/indian-army-artificial-intelligence-8992606/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Army has deployed 140 AI-based surveillance systems along its borders with Pakistan and China to enhance its operational capabilities. These systems include high-resolution cameras, sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and radar feeds, which are collected and analyzed through AI to detect intrusions and classify targets. The army is also using AI-powered drones and robots to patrol borders, reducing the need for human intervention in dangerous situations. India is investing approximately $50 million each year in AI spending for defense purposes but needs to increase investments to keep up with China's advancements in the field. The country is positioning itself at the forefront of intelligent warfare strategies by integrating AI into its defense systems. However, experts emphasize the importance of human intelligence in interpreting data gathered from AI solutions, especially in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism measures. While deploying high-tech solutions has minimized human involvement in monitoring and improved intrusion detection, there are still challenges that need to be overcome to fully utilize the potential of AI in military operations.</description>

			<title>Canada visa services now available only in Delhi: How will Indian visa seekers, including students, be impacted?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/canada-visa-services-delhi-india-students-impact-explained-8992540/</link>
			<description>Canada has suspended visa and consular services at its consulates in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and will now only offer these services at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi. This decision comes after Canada withdrew 41 diplomats from India, following New Delhi's decision to revoke their diplomatic immunity. The ongoing diplomatic dispute between the two countries was triggered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegation that India may have been involved in the killing of a Khalistani separatist in Canada. 

The expected fallout of this situation is that there will be a significant slowdown in Indian visa applications for Canada. A large portion of these applications come from Indian students who wish to study in Canadian universities. Currently, there are over 319,000 registered Indian students in Canada, making it the second-largest destination for Indian students after the United States. This downsizing of Canada's diplomatic corps and the suspension of visa services in major Indian cities will impact the processing of these applications, potentially causing a backlog.

Indian students make a substantial contribution to the Canadian economy through tuition fees and their spending on living expenses. Tuition fees for international students in Canada are higher than those for domestic students, and it is estimated that Indian students contribute approximately Canadian $10 billion annually to the education sector in the country. Moreover, international students, including Indian students, fill essential jobs in critical sectors of the Canadian economy.

While Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has stated that it is reducing the number of employees in India from 27 to 5, the visa application centers operated by third-party contractors will not be impacted. These centers process the majority of visa applications outside the country, through IRCC's global network. The remaining staff will focus on urgent cases, visa printing, and working with the visa application centers.

Overall, the slowdown in the visa process is expected to have negative consequences for Indian students and the Canadian economy. The diplomatic dispute between Canada and India has further strained relations and created challenges for those seeking to travel and study between the two countries.</description>

			<title>The colonial — and anti-colonial — roots of Durga Puja</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/history-durga-puja-bengal-company-8992370/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the history of Durga Puja, a religious festival celebrated in Bengal, India. The origins of modern Durga Puja can be traced back to the nexus between Bengali zamindars (landowners) and merchants, and the East India Company during colonial rule. With Company rule came economic opportunities, leading to the rise of a new class of powerful natives who used Durga Puja as an occasion to display their wealth and socialize with the British elites. By the late 19th century, Durga Puja became a part of the nascent nationalist project, symbolizing the nation and its fight against foreign rule. After Lord Curzon's decision to Partition Bengal in 1905, Durga Pujas became places where collective consciousness and action were forged in the Swadeshi Movement. In the 1920s, public Pujas began to emerge, making the festival accessible to everyone regardless of caste or residence.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the critical importance of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which is currently sealed by Egypt. With Israel imposing a complete siege on the Gaza Strip and the possibility of a ground invasion, the opening of the crossing has become increasingly urgent. President Joe Biden has urged Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and Israel has stated that it would not block deliveries from Egypt. However, there has been no immediate response from Egypt. The article provides a description of the Rafah crossing and mentions the restrictions on the movement of people and goods imposed by both Israel and Egypt. It also highlights the damage caused by Israeli airstrikes near the crossing and the delays in aid reaching Gaza. Many people, including American citizens, are waiting near the border in the hopes of leaving, but the border remains closed.</description>

			<title>PM Modi flags off RRTS: What is this mass transport system, how it can benefit NCR</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-to-flag-off-rrts-what-is-this-mass-transport-system-how-it-can-benefit-ncr-8991437/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the first leg of India's Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), which is the country's first mass rapid system dedicated to regional connectivity. The trains on this first section have the capability to run at speeds up to 180 km/h, which will eventually reduce the journey time between Delhi and Meerut to less than an hour. The RRTS is an integrated mass transit network aimed at achieving balanced and sustainable urban development by providing better connectivity and access across the National Capital Region (NCR). The idea for this network originated from a study commissioned by the Indian Railways in 1998-99, which identified the possibility of connecting various locations in the NCR through fast commuter trains. The proposal was later re-examined in 2006 with the extension of the Delhi Metro lines to towns in the NCR. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) was established to implement the RRTS project, which includes eight corridors to connect different towns in the NCR. The RRTS, also known as Namo Bharat, aims to unlock the full potential of the NCR by enhancing multi-modal connectivity and reducing congestion on roads, highways, metro, and railway networks. Additionally, the project is expected to boost employment and stimulate economic activity in the region. The RRTS trains will run faster than metro trains, operating at speeds up to 180 km/h, compared to the maximum speed of 100-120 km/h for Delhi Metro trains. The Phase I development includes three corridors: Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut (82 km), Delhi-Gurugram-SNB-Alwar (164 km), and Delhi-Panipat (103 km). The project plans to develop five more corridors in the future. The Sarai Kale Khan station in Delhi will serve as the central hub for all three Phase I corridors. The priority section of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor, a 17 km stretch with five stations, has been inaugurated, and the entire corridor is scheduled to be operational by 2025.</description>

			<title>What is the first test on Gaganyaan journey, to be held on Saturday</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-the-first-test-on-gaganyaan-journey-to-be-held-on-saturday-8991441/</link>
			<description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to conduct the Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) on Saturday, as part of its preparations for launching an Indian astronaut into space. The TV-D1 mission will test the Crew Escape System of the Gaganyaan project, which allows the crew to leave the spacecraft in an emergency. The rocket will reach an altitude of almost 17 km before triggering an abort signal, leading to the separation of the crew module and its descent using a parachute. The test mission will last 532 seconds and will demonstrate the new Test Vehicle and a basic version of the crew module. ISRO has developed a low-cost Test Vehicle specifically for these tests, using existing liquid propulsion technology. The Gaganyaan human space flight programme has a budget of around Rs 9,000 crore ($1.2 billion).</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Gujarat government recently announced the Gyan Sahayak Scheme, which aims to fill vacancies in government schools with teachers on a contractual basis until regular appointments are made. However, the scheme has faced opposition from student groups, political parties, and even the BJP-backed student wing. The scheme is based on the National Education Policy 2020, which emphasizes the need for teachers with interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary skills. The government plans to appoint 15,000 Gyan Sahayaks in primary schools and 11,500 in secondary and higher secondary schools. Online applications have been issued, and a school-wise list of Gyan Sahayaks will be announced soon. The scheme has faced protests from various groups who argue that it delays regular appointments and raises concerns about the quality of education provided by contractual teachers.</description>

			<title>Vladimir Putin seen with ‘nuclear briefcase’ in China: Its history, what it contains</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/vladimir-putin-nuclear-briefcase-explained-8991091/</link>
			<description>During Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to China, he was seen with officers carrying the "nuclear briefcase." This briefcase is part of a system for authorizing the launch of nuclear strikes. It is used to convey orders for a nuclear strike to the rocket forces of the country. The briefcases are also carried by the defense minister and the chief of general staff, who coordinate with the president in case of a potential order to strike. The first known instance of a nuclear briefcase being used was in 1995 during a crisis. The briefcases were developed during the Cold War to cut down reaction time in the event of a sudden attack. The American president also has a similar briefcase, officially called the presidential emergency satchel or the "football," which contains information on retaliatory options and authentication codes to authorize a nuclear attack. Other countries have similar systems as well. There have been instances of misplaced or lost codes in the past.</description>

			<title>Row over Jagannath temple’s treasure room: Why has it not been unlocked in 38 years, why demands to open now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/jagannath-temples-treasure-room-why-has-it-not-been-opened-8991140/</link>
			<description>The demand to open the Ratna Bhandar (treasure room) of the Puri Jagannath Temple in Odisha is growing as assembly and general elections approach. The treasure room has not been unlocked for 30 years. The BJP and Congress have both raised the issue and demanded its opening. The Ratna Bhandar stores precious ornaments given by devotees and kings over centuries. The outer chamber is regularly opened for rituals, but the inner chamber has not been opened in 38 years. The demand to open the Ratna Bhandar has increased due to concerns about cracks in its walls that could endanger the precious ornaments. The last inventory of the treasure room was done in 1978, and efforts to open it in 2018 were unsuccessful due to missing keys. A judicial inquiry was ordered to investigate the loss of the keys. The issue resurfaced when the ASI sought permission to inspect the inner chamber in 2022. Eminent individuals and opposition parties have demanded the opening of the treasure room, leading to the temple managing committee recommending its opening during the annual rath yatra in 2024. The Orissa HC directed the government to form a high-level committee to supervise the inventory-making of the valuables but declined to interfere in the inventory and repair plans.</description>

			<title>Who are the Palestinians?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/who-are-palestinians-israel-hamas-8990440/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the oversimplification of the Palestinian identity in media coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict. It highlights that the emphasis is often placed on Palestinians being Muslims who are in conflict with Jewish Israelis, which fails to acknowledge the rich and complex history of the Palestinians. The term "Palestine" originated in ancient Greece and referred to the coastal land between Phoenicia and Egypt. The region underwent Islamisation and saw the emergence of various overlapping identities. After the defeat of the Ottomans in World War I, Palestine was divided among the British and the French. The Palestinian national charter of 1968 emphasized the Palestinians' Arab identity but did not define Palestine in religious terms. The majority of Palestinians today are Sunni Muslims, but there is also a Jewish minority in Palestinian areas. Palestinian Christians make up a small percentage of the population.</description>

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi warned that a mass exodus of Palestinians into Egypt could bring militants into the Sinai Peninsula, from where they might launch attacks on Israel, endangering the two countries' peace treaty. Jordan's King Abdullah II gave a similar message, stating that there would be no refugees in Jordan or Egypt.

			<title>Why reforms have been proposed for World Bank, other Multilateral Development Banks; what they say</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/reforms-proposed-world-bank-multilateral-development-8990139/</link>
			<description>A G20 expert panel has recommended that multilateral development banks (MDBs), such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, shift their focus from financing individual projects to prioritizing programs with sectoral focus and long-term transformation plans as identified by national governments. The panel argues that MDBs should align their operations with national development priorities and increase coordination between stakeholders to address global challenges effectively. The panel also suggests that private sector engagement should be brought to the center of MDB operations to increase financing and reverse the trend of low private financial flows to emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The existing perception of MDBs as bureaucratic and risk-averse has impacted their engagement with the private sector. MDBs have played a significant role in India's development journey, with commitments from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and European Investment Bank in key infrastructure sectors such as transport, energy, and urban infrastructure.</description>

While they support the appointments of Anant's elder siblings, Isha and Akash, both 31 years old, on the board, the firms claim that Anant's age and limited leadership experience make him unsuitable for the role of a non-executive non-independent director. The firms have recommended RIL shareholders to vote against Anant's appointment. The e-voting process for the appointments started on September 27 and will end on October 26. Proxy advisory firms provide advice to shareholders on voting decisions and recommendations on agenda items. Their recommendations are non-binding, and investors should conduct their own research before making voting decisions.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Andhra Pradesh has announced that it will conduct a census for backward classes starting from November 15. The Minister for Backward Classes Welfare, C Srinivasa Venugopala Krishna, stated that this census will help the government better understand the numerical strength of the 139 backward-class communities in the state. The publication of the caste survey results in Bihar earlier this month has raised the possibility of other states conducting similar exercises. The enumeration of castes, along with the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), has been a long-standing issue to ensure equal distribution of reservation benefits. The OBCs are identified based on their occupation and are categorized into various groups. The demand for reservation for the "backwards among OBCs" has gained traction as it is felt that a few "upper" OBCs have benefited the most from the existing reservation system. Bihar has already identified backward and extremely backward classes through its caste survey. The report also provides information about previous OBC commissions and their recommendations. The subcategorization of OBCs has been discussed by various commissions, but the recommendations have not been implemented yet.</description>

			<title>Suspected Banksy artwork appears in London: The artist’s long connection with Palestine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/banksy-artwork-in-palestine-8989505/</link>
			<description>A new Banksy mural has appeared near the Edgware Road Underground Station in London. The artwork, which depicts robotic arms being pulled by three individuals, bears the words "another world is possible." While Banksy has not claimed ownership of the piece, it has attracted a large number of visitors. Interpretations of the artwork vary, with some viewing it as a warning against the dangers of artificial intelligence and others seeing it as a commentary on the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.

Banksy has a history of working in Palestine since the early 2000s, with his artworks being spotted in the region, including on the West Bank wall. He also owns a hotel next to the separation wall in Bethlehem called the Walled Off Hotel. The hotel features rooms with artwork by Banksy and other artists, a gallery showcasing Palestinian artworks, and a museum with audio-visual presentations about the region's history.

One of Banksy's most notable statements on the Israel-Palestine conflict is a video he released in 2015, sarcastically promoting tourism in Gaza. The video highlights the devastation in Gaza and the restrictions faced by its residents, juxtaposed with the Israeli military presence. Banksy also references the destruction caused by the 2014 military operation and the network of illegal tunnels. The video concludes with a quote spray-painted on a wall, emphasizing the importance of not remaining neutral in conflicts between the powerful and the powerless.

Banksy's artworks in the region include the famous "Love is in the Air" mural in Jerusalem, which depicts a man throwing a bouquet of flowers instead of a weapon, symbolizing peace. He has also created murals featuring children interacting with Israeli soldiers and commenting on the Israeli occupation. One of his well-known projects in Palestine is a series of large murals painted on the segregation wall in 2005, including images of children playing on a sandcastle and a variation of Banksy's "Girl with Balloon" painting.

Overall, Banksy's artworks in Palestine and his recent mural in London continue his exploration of political and social issues, provoking thought and sparking conversations about topics such as artificial intelligence and the Israel-Palestine conflict.</description>

			<title>Severe drought grips the Amazon rainforest: The impact, cause and grim future</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/drought-amazon-rainforest-8989382/</link>
			<description>The Amazon rainforest is experiencing a severe drought, causing rivers to dry up and leaving Indigenous communities without water, food, or medicine. The Rio Negro, one of the largest rivers in the world, has reached a record low level. The drought has also led to dead fish and river dolphins contaminating the water supply, leaving residents with limited access to clean water. The lack of water has affected a major hydropower dam and stranded tens of thousands of people in remote villages. The dry conditions have also increased the risk of wildfires, with the Amazonas state experiencing a high number of blazes this month. The drought is attributed to the combined effects of El Nino and high sea surface temperatures. Studies suggest that with rising global temperatures, the Amazon will experience more frequent and longer droughts, potentially leading to irreversible damage and releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere. Experts emphasize the need to curb deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions to protect the Amazon and its vital role in global ecosystems.</description>

			<title>Scriptures may be copyright-free, but adaptations are protected: What HC has said</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/scriptures-copyright-free-adaptations-are-protected-8989236/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has ruled that there is "large-scale infringement" of copyrighted works by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust on the internet. The trust, which publishes books and commentaries on Indian religious philosophy, has been granted permission to approach tech companies Google and Meta (owners of YouTube and Instagram) with takedown orders against those reproducing copyrighted works on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita. The court found that while religious scriptures are in the public domain, copyright protection applies to original parts of literary works that explain or interpret these scriptures. The court also noted that Srila Prabhupada, the founder of the trust, had handed over copyrights to be administered by the trust, making unauthorized reproduction a violation.</description>

			<title>How can the West deal with Moscow and Pyongyang?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-can-the-west-deal-with-moscow-and-pyongyang-8989113/</link>
			<description>South Korea has joined the US in condemning North Korea after allegations that Pyongyang provided munitions and weapons to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. South Korea is considering additional measures against North Korea, but analysts suggest there are few options left for exerting pressure on the country. North Korea has managed to bypass international sanctions through alliances with Russia and China. The South Korean Foreign Ministry stated that any weapons exchanges between North Korea and Russia are a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and a threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Both Russia and North Korea have denied these allegations. Experts believe that Russia and North Korea's collaboration could last a long time as both countries have grievances against the West and desire to overturn the international order. However, further sanctions from the US or South Korea may not significantly impact North Korea's regime, as Russia has indicated it will not support additional UN pressure on North Korea. It is also suggested that North Korea may be willing to teach Russia some of its survival tactics in return for nuclear weapons and missile technology.</description>

			<title>Israel using white phosphorus in Gaza? 5 things about the controversial weapon</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-white-phosphorus-gaza-5-things-8988938/</link>
			<description>Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of using white phosphorus munitions in Gaza and Lebanon, in violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The organizations claim that Israel's use of these munitions in densely populated areas poses long-term risks to civilians. White phosphorus is a pyrophoric substance that ignites when exposed to oxygen, producing thick smoke and intense heat. It is primarily used as a smokescreen to hide troop movement and can also be used as an incendiary weapon. Exposure to white phosphorus can cause severe burns, respiratory damage, and harm to internal organs. The use of white phosphorus munitions is regulated under the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), specifically Protocol III, but there are loopholes in the regulations. Efforts have been made to strengthen the CCW to address these loopholes.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/festive-bonus-what-da-hikes-mean-for-govt-employees-the-exchequer-8988977/</link>
			<description>The Union Cabinet has approved a 4 percentage point increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief for central government employees and pensioners, bringing it to 46% from 42%. The hike will be effective from July 1st and is intended to benefit government employees and pensioners during the festive season. The hike will cost the exchequer Rs 12,857 crore per year. Approximately 48.67 lakh central government employees and 67.95 lakh pensioners will benefit from this increase. This hike follows the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission. The DA for employees and pensioners is estimated based on the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW), released monthly by the Labour Bureau. The last revision in DA was done on March 24, 2023, and was effective from January 1, 2023. In addition, the government has announced the grant of non-productivity linked bonus (ad-hoc bonus) for eligible employees for the year 2022-23. The ad-hoc bonus has been approved for certain categories of employees, including paramilitary forces, and the calculation ceiling for payment has been set at Rs 7,000.</description>

			<title>Why a Supreme Court order on telcos’ licence fee tax has the industry worried</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/supreme-court-order-telecom-licence-fee-8988571/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court in India has ruled that telecom companies will have to classify their payment of entry fees and annual license fees as capital expenditure rather than revenue expenditure, resulting in potential additional tax liabilities for the companies. This decision could lead to a tax liability of around $1 billion for telecom companies like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in the current fiscal year. The Court's decision means that telecom companies will need to deduct a portion of the total fee over each year for tax purposes, rather than deducting the entire expenditure at once. This change in accounting is expected to result in lower cash flow for telecom companies. It is unclear whether the change will be applied retrospectively, and income tax authorities are expected to demand any shortfall in tax payment for the prior period, along with penalties. Telecom companies are likely to file a review petition, which could delay the actual tax liability. Bharti Airtel is currently examining the order and its impact to determine the next course of action.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court’s marriage equality judgment unpacked: Two views on four key issues</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/scs-marriage-equality-judgment-unpacked-two-views-on-four-key-issues-8988049/</link>
			<description>A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud, has declined to grant legal status to same-sex marriages. The majority opinion, held by three judges, stated that the issue should be addressed by the legislature rather than the judiciary. While the CJI and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul recognized civil unions for queer couples, they were in the minority. The judges provided their views on four key questions raised during the case.

Regarding the argument that there exists a fundamental right to marry a person of one's own choice under the Constitution, the minority view disagreed. They stated that marriage may have gained significance because of state regulation, rather than being inherently fundamental. The majority opinion agreed with this perspective, emphasizing that personal preference and social status are important aspects of marriage. They also highlighted that the US courts' reasoning for declaring the right to marry a fundamental right may not be applicable.

The court considered a gender-neutral interpretation of the legislation governing civil marriages, where the state sanctions the marriage instead of religion. However, the minority view warned against entering the domain of the legislature, while the majority view stated that the legislation is intended only for heterosexual couples belonging to different faiths.

The petitioners also argued against discriminatory adoption guidelines set by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). The minority view found certain CARA regulations to be precluding unmarried couples from adopting without sufficient justification. They emphasized that good or bad parenting should not be assumed based on individuals' sexuality. The majority view agreed with the discriminatory impact on queer couples but stated that legislative changes are necessary to address this issue.

Regarding the recognition of civil unions for queer couples, the minority view located the right to form intimate associations within the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. They suggested that a committee would determine the rights available to queer couples in unions. In contrast, the majority view disagreed with prescribing civil unions as a choice for queer couples, suggesting that the state should facilitate this choice if the community desires it.

Overall, the Supreme Court's Constitution Bench refused to grant legal status to same-sex marriages, emphasizing that the issue falls within the domain of the legislature rather than the judiciary. The judges provided differing opinions on various aspects related to fundamental rights, legislation interpretation, adoption guidelines, and civil unions for queer couples.</description>

			<title>Why Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage verdict opens no doors for queer people</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-scs-same-sex-marriage-verdict-opens-no-doors-for-queer-people-8987899/</link>
			<description>In November 2022, two same-sex couples brought a case to the Supreme Court of India, arguing that their inability to marry under Indian family law violated their fundamental rights. After a 10-day hearing, the court reserved its judgment and delivered its final verdict on October 17, 2023.

The court, with a majority of three judges, addressed key questions in their separate opinions. The main issue was whether same-sex couples have the right to marry under the Indian Constitution and if the prevention of such marriages is discriminatory. The court unanimously answered both questions in the negative.

The court held that marriage is an institution established by law, and same-sex couples do not have the right to participate in it unless the law permits them to do so. The court found that the Special Marriage Act, which permits marriages only between a man and a woman, was constitutional.

The court also rejected the idea of allowing queer couples to enter into a civil union, stating that only an elected legislature has the authority to make such changes. The court acknowledged the complexity of aligning legal frameworks based on heterosexual unions with the right of queer individuals to marry.

Regarding adoption, since same-sex couples cannot legally marry in India, they cannot adopt as a couple. However, a single person within a same-sex couple could adopt a child. The court shifted the burden to the executive branch, encouraging it to reconsider adoption laws in line with the best interests of children.

In summary, the court's judgment did not recognize queer marriages or civil unions. It affirmed the right of queer individuals to choose a partner, even if it does not amount to a marriage or union. The court acknowledged the exclusion of the queer community from family laws but shifted the responsibility to the legislature to address these issues. The court directed the government to set up a committee to examine potential amendments to make the benefits of marriage available to same-sex couples.

The judgment represents a setback for the queer community, and the authors suggest that the legislature should take the lead in re-evaluating and improving Indian family law to be more inclusive and non-discriminatory.</description>

			<title>The Netherlands stun South Africa in World Cup: The journey of cricket in the Dutch Isles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/cricket-netherlands-dutch-history-8987894/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Dutch cricket team has made history by defeating South Africa in a rain-truncated game in Dharamshala. This victory marks their first win in 50 over World Cups. Cricket was introduced to the Netherlands in the 18th century through British traders and spread through elite Dutch schools. The first written reference of the game being played in the Netherlands dates back to 1845. However, cricket in the Netherlands developed differently from British colonies, with different clubs following their own rules and ideas of the game. This lack of standardization led to embarrassing losses for the Dutch team against proper English sides. In 1884, the Nederlandsche Cricket Board (NCB) was founded to ensure proper administration of the game, making it the second international cricket association in the world after MCC. World War I brought an influx of talent to Dutch leagues, and cricket continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1930s. Despite World War II, cricket did not stop being played in the Netherlands and was seen as a demonstration of defiance against Nazi occupation. The professionalization of Dutch football in 1954 made it more accessible than cricket, leading to its decline as a popular sport. Additionally, the exclusionary policies of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which only granted Test status to England, Australia, and South Africa, further hindered the development of cricket in the Netherlands. If ICC had been more inclusive, Netherlands could have enjoyed regular international matches and seen an increase in standards and performances.</description>

			<title>PMK says abolish All India Quota: The problem of vacant MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pmk-all-india-quota-vacant-mbbs-seats-tamil-nadu-8987644/</link>
			<description>Demand for MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu remains high, but seats in the All-India quota are going vacant due to a flawed allotment system. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has called for the abolition of the All India quota. PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss highlighted that 16 MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu's government medical colleges, as well as seats in private medical colleges, remain unoccupied after four rounds of counseling. The issue stems from the National Medical Commission's (NMC) policy on student admissions. Previously, the central government conducted two counseling rounds, and unfilled seats were given to the states. However, after increasing counseling rounds to four, now unfilled seats go to waste. This has resulted in vacancies in top medical colleges, causing missed opportunities and financial losses. The situation appears to have worsened from the previous year. Despite efforts from the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) and the state selection committee, seats remain empty. Tamil Nadu contributes over 800 seats to the All India quota, and there are calls to appeal to the Supreme Court to prevent these high-demand seats from going unclaimed. Experts argue that the flawed admission policy by the central government is at the crux of the problem. The government announced in 2021 that it would no longer return any seat surrendered by state governments. While private medical colleges with high fees can admit students until the deadline, state-run colleges with lower fees are left with vacancies. PMK leader Ramadoss suggests scrapping the All India quota, as each state now has its own medical institutions.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.US President Joe Biden is set to visit Israel and Jordan, following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visits to several Middle Eastern countries. However, there has been no outreach towards Iran, which is currently under US sanctions and is seen by many in the West as having enabled the recent Hamas assault on Israel. Iran has been raising concerns about the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and the humanitarian situation there, denying any involvement in the Hamas attack. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian is also touring the region, meeting with Iran's allies. The article highlights a significant diplomatic development: a phone call between Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the crisis in Gaza. This call marks the first communication between the leaders since diplomatic relations were resumed in 2023. Saudi Arabia has frozen its efforts to normalize relations with Israel due to events in Israel and Gaza, which Iran sees as contributing to its own security challenges. The article also discusses Iran's historical support for Palestine through organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as its ongoing confrontation with Israel. It notes that any regional escalation of the conflict would be detrimental to Iran's attempts to address its economic challenges under US-led sanctions.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, is positioned to become the next prime minister according to polls. He has positioned himself as a centrist and unity candidate, in contrast to his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer has marginalized the party's left-wing faction, criticized anti-Semitism within the party, and softened the language of reform while maintaining many of Corbyn's policy positions. Some have compared Starmer to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the party to power by departing from its socialist roots. However, there are concerns that Starmer's centrist approach may lead him to abandon principled positions in favor of pragmatism. The challenge for Starmer will be maintaining his balancing act and navigating crises once in power.</description>

			<description>The Vizhinjam International Seaport Project in Kerala, India, has sparked a dispute between the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress. The project, a deepwater transshipment port, is being built by Adani Ports and SEZ Private Limited on a design, build, finance, operate, and transfer basis. The port aims to address India's lack of infrastructure for handling ultra-large container ships and attract transshipment traffic currently going to ports outside India. It is expected to bring numerous benefits, including forex savings, increased economic activity, and job opportunities. The port has a natural depth of over 18 meters and is designed to handle container transshipment, multi-purpose, and break-bulk cargo. It is expected to compete with ports in Colombo, Singapore, and Dubai. The project is currently around 65% complete and has faced delays due to various factors, including natural disasters and protests. The first phase of the project is scheduled to be operational by December 2024.</description>

The judges agreed that there is no fundamental right to marry under the constitution and that it is not possible to modify the special marriage act to allow same-sex marriage using gender-neutral language.

			<title>Modi speaks to Google’s Pichai, why are Google manufacturing plans in India so important?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/google-chromebook-manufacturing-india-8986877/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have discussed Google's plan to establish an electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India. The production of Chromebooks in India is seen as a major boost to the country's electronics manufacturing ambitions and puts Google among high-profile companies manufacturing in India. The production of Chromebooks will help Google compete with Windows computers built by Dell, Lenovo, and Asus. India aims to become a trusted partner in global supply chains, as companies worldwide look to diversify away from China. The import of electronic goods in India has increased, with China accounting for around 70-80% of Indian imports of personal computers and laptops. The Indian government has implemented policy changes to discourage imports from China and is expected to clear applications from around 30 companies to manufacture laptops and computers in India. The government has also introduced an "import management system" requiring companies to register and disclose import data, and is aiming to reduce import dependence on China by reorienting supplies from trusted sources.</description>

			<title>SC verdict on same sex marriages Explained Highlights: No fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, says Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-verdict-on-same-sex-marriages-explained-live-8986361/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, ruled unanimously against legalizing same-sex marriage in India. The court also ruled against civil unions for non-heterosexual couples in a 3:2 verdict. The Chief Justice stated that it is up to the Parliament to decide on the issue and that the Special Marriage Act cannot be struck down or interpreted differently. The focus of the petitions filed was on a gender-neutral interpretation of the Act. Justice Kaul supported the idea of civil unions for non-heterosexual couples, while all five judges agreed that there is no fundamental right to marry and that the decision should be left to the legislature. The court heard arguments for 10 days, covering topics such as equality, privacy, marriage privileges, and the impact on children. The Center, the national child rights body, and an Islamic scholars' body opposed the petitioners. The court directed the Center to ensure non-discrimination and equal access to goods and services for the queer community, as well as raise public awareness of queer rights and establish support systems. The court also issued guidelines to the police to prevent harassment of queer individuals. The Chief Justice emphasized that marriage is not a stagnant institution but stated that the court cannot change the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. Four judgments were delivered, with each judge expressing their opinion. The Chief Justice disagreed with the Center's argument that only Parliament can decide on same-sex marriage, stating that fundamental rights must be enforced. The court also referred to previous judgments that recognized LGBTQ rights, such as the 2018 ruling that decriminalized homosexuality. Same-sex marriage is recognized in 32 countries worldwide, with most countries introducing it through legislation. The hearings were live-streamed for the public, and arguments were made on the implicit right to marry for non-heterosexual couples based on equality, non-discrimination, and the right to privacy. The inclusion of LGBTQIA+ couples in marriage acts, minimum marriageable age, and the impact on children were also discussed during the hearings.</description>

			<title>India-Sri Lanka ferry service restarted after 40 yrs: Opportunities, challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-sri-lanka-ferry-service-restarted-opportunities-challenges-8986549/</link>
			<description>India and Sri Lanka have launched a passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu, India, and Kankesanthurai in Jaffna, northern Sri Lanka. The service aims to strengthen bilateral ties, boost tourism, and increase people-to-people relations. The ferry, named 'Cheriyapani', is a high-speed craft that operates once daily. The service is expected to benefit local traders and enhance connectivity and trade between the two nations. The resumption of ferry services between India and Sri Lanka is a revival of an age-old maritime linkage that was disrupted by the civil war in Sri Lanka. The service is expected to amplify religious tourism and boost regional commerce. The state government of Tamil Nadu is making infrastructural developments to accommodate the influx of travelers, and efforts are being made to ensure a smooth experience for passengers. The service was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who both emphasized the importance of connectivity in bringing the two countries closer. However, the success of the service will depend on its operation, and challenges such as ticket prices and booking systems need to be addressed for the service to thrive.</description>

			<title>Can AAP be an accused in Delhi excise policy case? What law says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/aap-delhi-excise-policy-case-law-8986484/</link>
			<description>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is considering adding the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an accused in its money laundering probe related to the Delhi government's now-scrapped excise policy. The ED is contemplating charging AAP under Section 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which deals with offences by companies. Although a political party is not considered a company, the provision includes an explanation that could bring a political party under the ambit of the anti-money laundering law. This would be the first instance of a political party being accused of money laundering if AAP is directly named as an accused. Political parties have previously been booked and investigated under the Income Tax Act, and trusts and NGOs are already under the PMLA ambit. The main allegation against AAP is that it was the recipient of the proceeds of crime in the excise scam. Even if cases involving individuals fall, the political party can still be prosecuted for money laundering separately. The ED's consideration to book AAP as an accused comes in response to a statement made by a bench of Supreme Court justices during a hearing seeking bail for former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India is set to deliver its verdict on a series of petitions seeking marriage equality for LGBTQIA+ couples. The hearings, which lasted for 10 days in April-May, were live-streamed for the public. The petitioners argued that marriage brings with it various rights and privileges protected by the law. They claimed that the right to marry for non-heterosexual couples is implicit in several articles of the Indian Constitution, including those related to equality, non-discrimination, and right to life. The petitioners also discussed issues such as the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ couples in marriage laws, minimum marriageable age, and the impact of such marriages on children. The respondents, including the Central government and various organizations, opposed the petitions. They argued that the Supreme Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear this case and that only Parliament can make changes to marriage laws. The respondents also raised concerns about the impact on children and the need to regulate marriages for the welfare of the child. Different states responded differently to the plea, with some opposing it and others seeking more time to consider the matter. Overall, the case involves complex legal arguments and has implications for various aspects of marriage laws in India.</description>

			<title>Delhi excise policy case: What are the options for Election Commission if AAP is named as an accused?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-excise-policy-case-uncharted-area-poll-panel-faces-limited-options-if-aap-named-8986385/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has proposed in the Supreme Court to name the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an accused in the Delhi Excise Policy case. This situation poses a dilemma for the Election Commission (EC) as there are no clear guidelines on what action should be taken when a political party is accused of illegal activity. Former officers of the poll panel state that the EC's options for punitive action against a party are limited. The EC has the power to suspend or withdraw a party's recognition, but this can only be done if the party fails to observe the model code of conduct or disregards the orders and instructions of the commission. If a party is accused of illegality, there are no specific provisions on what should be done. The option to de-register a party is also limited and can only be done if the party obtained its registration by fraud, shows a lack of faith in the constitution or principles of socialism, secularism, and democracy, or is declared unlawful by the union government under specific laws. The Representation of the People Act has no provisions for dealing with the inclusion of a political party in a case like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). There is uncertainty regarding whether the AAP can be implicated under section 70 of the PMLA, as a political party is not categorized as a company. The legal expert questions how the AAP can be implicated under this section. The article is written by Ritika Chopra, Chief of National Bureau at the Indian Express.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/new-zealand-prime-minister-christopher-luxon-8986035/</link>
			<description>Former airline executive Christopher Luxon is set to become the next Prime Minister of New Zealand after his Centre-right National Party, in coalition with the right-wing ACT Party, secured enough seats in the recent general election. Luxon, who joined politics just three years ago, has emerged as a leader tackling the country's cost of living crisis and high inflation. In his victory speech, Luxon vowed to address the economic mess and reduce government debt by lowering interest rates and providing tax relief. Luxon, who had a successful career in the corporate world, is known for his disciplined work ethic and ambitions for the country. However, he has faced criticism for his Christian beliefs, including his personal opposition to abortion. Luxon has promised tax cuts, reduced government spending, and improvements in healthcare and education to address New Zealand's economic woes and make the country "even better."</description>

			<title>Before SC, question of law in Muslim women’s right to divorce</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/before-sc-question-of-law-in-muslim-womens-right-to-divorce-8986022/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court will review a ruling by the Kerala High Court that affirmed a Muslim woman's right to pronounce extrajudicial divorce through "khula." Khula is the right of a Muslim woman to unilaterally divorce her husband, similar to talaq for Muslim men. Scholars differ on whether the husband's consent is necessary for khula. Other forms of extrajudicial divorce available to Muslim women include talaq-e-tafwiz (contract-based divorce), mubara'at (separation by mutual consent), and faskh (divorce through court intervention). The 1939 Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act clarified and consolidated the provisions of extrajudicial divorce for Muslim women, including the faskh route. The Kerala HC ruled in 2021 that Muslim women retain their right to extrajudicial divorce under the 1939 Act.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has directed its officers to not scrutinize angel tax provisions for start-ups recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). The CBDT issued a directive stating that no verification is required for start-ups recognized by the DPIIT for notices related to the amended provisions for angel tax. This clarification comes after many start-ups expressed concerns about receiving scrutiny notices for angel tax. The CBDT outlined two scenarios for start-ups selected under scrutiny: in the first scenario, no verification will be done for the issue of applicability of section 56 (2) (viib) of the Income Tax Act, and the contention of the start-up companies on the issue will be accepted. In the second scenario, the issue of applicability of the mentioned section will not be pursued during the assessment proceedings. The finance act proposed to extend angel tax to non-resident investors from April 1, 2023. The DPIIT-recognized start-ups were previously excluded from angel tax.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has released the results of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for the period July 2022 to June 2023. The PLFS provides data on employment metrics in India, including the proportion of people demanding work, the gender differences in employment, wages, and the sectoral distribution of workers. The survey collects data through two methods: Usual Status (US) and Current Weekly Status (CWS), with the CWS approach being more commonly used globally. The latest findings show a decrease in the unemployment rate, an increase in the labour force participation rate, and a rise in female participation in the workforce. However, the data also reveals that most of the new jobs created are in the self-employment sector, and monthly incomes have not significantly improved over the past six years. There is also an increase in the proportion of workers in agriculture and a decrease in manufacturing.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.China's Special Envoy on the Middle East Issue, Zhai Jun, will visit the region to address the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. China has expressed its opposition to acts that harm civilians and called for a ceasefire and the establishment of an independent State of Palestine. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized Israel's actions and expressed support for the Palestinians' just cause. China's stance is rooted in its strategic and economic interests in West Asia and its initial opposition to Israel as a US ally. By aligning with Arab nations' support for Palestine, China seeks to secure regional allies and criticize Western powers' involvement. China has positioned itself as an alternative to the US through diplomatic engagement, brokering normalization agreements between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hosting Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas. China recognizes the PA as the representative of the Palestinian people and advocates for a two-state solution based on 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. China has made significant investments in infrastructure projects in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative. Despite growing economic ties with Israel, China has criticized Israel's role in Palestine, while Israel has condemned Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, along with colleagues from the ruling African National Congress (ANC), expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine as Israel ordered residents of Gaza to leave in preparation for a possible ground offensive. South Africa has a long history of supporting Palestine due to its own experience with discrimination and disempowerment during apartheid. However, over time, many African nations, including South Africa, softened their stance towards Israel as more Arab countries recognized the Jewish state and saw the benefits of trade and technological advancements. Despite this, South Africa has remained steadfast in its support for Palestine, citing its deep links with anti-discrimination activism and a resistance to Western influence on global issues. Last year, South Africa declared Israel an apartheid state and downgraded its embassy in Israel to a liaison office in March of this year.</description>

			<title>Ground invasion imminent, what are the implications for Gaza, Hamas, and the Palestinian movement?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ground-invasion-gaza-hamas-palestine-explained-8984242/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has issued a warning to Palestinians to leave northern Gaza, indicating a possible ground invasion to target Hamas. The article highlights the potential humanitarian catastrophe that could occur due to the dense population in Gaza, with innocent civilians being the most affected. It also mentions that Israel does not have a clear plan for what comes next if they were to destroy Hamas, and the reoccupation of the Strip could lead to more loss of lives and resistance from smaller groups. The Israelis are pushing for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and the Sinai desert, but Egypt rejects this plan. The article criticizes the unconditional support from the West to the Israeli operation, which many human rights groups consider to be war crimes. It emphasizes that Hamas is deeply integrated into Palestinian society and enjoys significant support, making it difficult to eliminate completely. The article also discusses the implications of the conflict on the peace process between Israel and Arab nations, particularly the potential US-led deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Abraham Accords have been discredited in the eyes of many Arabs due to the situation in Gaza, leading to the freezing of talks of normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The article includes insights from Khaled Al Hroub, a scholar of the Middle East, who discusses the history and role of Hamas in Palestinian society.</description>

			<title>USS Dwight D Eisenhower: Why US Navy’s ‘finest 5-star aircraft carrier’ has been sent to the Mediterranean</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/israel-hamas-conflict-us-navy-carrier-uss-dwight-eisenhower-deployment-8984087/</link>
			<description>The US has directed the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group to move to the eastern Mediterranean near the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. This move is part of the US effort to deter any hostile actions against Israel or any attempt to escalate the war. The Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group will join the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, which arrived earlier in the region. Israel is likely to launch a ground invasion of Gaza, and has already deployed troops, tanks, and artillery on the edge of the territory. Israel has been bombarding Gaza, causing the death of many Palestinians. The US aims to show support for Israel and provide a deterrent for other groups, such as Hezbollah, from joining the conflict. The presence of the carriers can also provide various options for operations such as command and control, information warfare, surveillance, and humanitarian work. The USS Eisenhower is described as the navy's finest 5-star aircraft carrier with a wide range of capabilities. The strike group includes cruisers, destroyers, aircraft squadrons, and embarked staffs. The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group also deployed to the region, along with squadrons of fighter aircraft from the US Air Force.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘Women… are fuelled by a will to survive’, from Iran’s Nobel Peace Prize winner</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-nobel-peace-prize-2023-feminist-movement-iran-upsc-8983830/</link>
			<description>The 2023 Nobel Prize for Peace has been awarded to Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian women’s rights activist, for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all. Mohammadi is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Iran for charges including spreading propaganda against the state. The Norwegian Nobel Committee also mentioned the 2022 protests in Iran following the killing of Mahsa Amini, stating that the protests' motto "Woman - Life - Freedom" reflects Mohammadi's dedication and work. Mohammadi's quote, "Women will not give up. We are fueled by a will to survive, whether we are inside prison or outside," emphasizes the strength and determination of women in their struggle against patriarchy. Born into a politically active family, Mohammadi has been involved in activism since the 1990s and has faced multiple arrests and convictions. She has campaigned against the death penalty and published a book on solitary confinement. The recent protests in Iran after Amini's death highlighted women's frustration with years of regulations, including mandatory hijab wearing. Despite suppression by the regime, the movement gained global attention. Iranian women have a history of protesting and defying authority, with Mohammadi's activism building on this legacy.</description>

This article explores the historical context of the conflict, focusing on the Jewish migration to Israel and the role played by the British and other Arab powers. It traces the origins of Zionism, the movement to establish a Jewish homeland, and the early Jewish migration to Palestine. The article also discusses the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which expressed British support for the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. It highlights the growing Palestinian nationalism and the divisions between Jewish and Arab factions during the British Mandate period. The article concludes by mentioning the UN resolution to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, the subsequent declaration of Israeli independence, and the multiple Arab-Israeli wars that followed. Currently, the United Nations recognizes Israel and Palestine, with Gaza and the West Bank under Israeli military control.</description>

			<title>Why Putin has compared Israel’s actions in Gaza to the Nazi siege of Leningrad</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/putin-israel-gaza-nazi-siege-leningrad-8983106/</link>
			<description>Russian President Vladimir Putin recently warned Israel against besieging Gaza in a manner reminiscent of Nazi Germany's siege of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad, which occurred between 1941 and 1944, resulted in the deaths of around 1.5 million civilians, leading some scholars to describe it as a genocide due to the deliberate starvation and destruction of the city's population. Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, included the devastating siege of Leningrad. The city was strategically and symbolically important to the Soviets, who mobilized citizens and soldiers to defend it. The siege lasted for 872 days and involved constant shelling, famine, and harsh weather conditions. Approximately 650,000 residents of Leningrad died in 1942 alone, with around 100,000 perishing each month during the peak winter. Ultimately, 1.5 million people lost their lives during the siege, with an additional 500,000 dying during evacuation attempts. The tragedy of Leningrad was on a scale greater than the combined casualties of the United States and Britain in the entire war. German forces targeted civilians by cutting off supplies, leading to widespread starvation. Some desperate individuals even resorted to cannibalism. Putin's personal connection to the siege, as his brother died during that time, likely contributes to his invocation of this historical event. His mother also experienced near-starvation during the siege.</description>

			<title>What happens if Israel invades Gaza? Enormous costs, devastation, and a possible stalemate</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/insrael-invade-gaza-hamas-8983090/</link>
			<description>Israel is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to wipe out the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The country's military has told 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours, and has deployed tens of thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery on the edge of the territory. Israel has been bombarding Gaza since Hamas attacked on October 7, dropping over 6,000 bombs so far. It has also mobilized 360,000 troops and enforced a naval blockade to cut off supplies to Hamas. If a large-scale invasion is ordered, Israel would likely divide Gaza in two and target Hamas leaders and infrastructure. However, urban warfare and the difficulty of distinguishing fighters from civilians pose challenges for Israeli troops. The implications of an invasion are uncertain for Israel, but it would be a catastrophe for Gaza, where infrastructure has been destroyed and there is little electricity or means of escape.</description>

			<title>After four sluggish months, why are corporate revenues seeing a pickup — and will this sustain?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-corporate-revenues-seeing-pickup-8982501/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Indian corporates are expected to see an improvement in revenue growth in the July-September quarter, according to a report by Crisil. The report estimates that revenue growth will be between 8-10% on a year-on-year basis, marking the first increase in growth after four consecutive quarters of moderation. Sectors such as consumer discretionary products and services, as well as construction-linked sectors, are expected to show higher revenue growth. The report also suggests that operating profitability likely expanded by 200-300 basis points on a year-on-year basis during the second quarter. Overall, Indian corporate revenue is projected to grow 10-12% this fiscal year, driven by domestic consumption and easing input costs. However, risks include inadequate monsoon rainfall and uncertain export demand.</description>

			<title>What is ‘foetal viability’ in abortion, and do the rights of an unborn child matter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-foetal-viability-unborn-chold-rights-abortion-8982030/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case regarding a married woman's request to end her 26-week pregnancy. The case has raised important questions about a woman's right to choose and the legislative framework surrounding abortion in India. Two key ideas that have come up during the hearings are "foetal viability" and the rights of the unborn child. Foetal viability refers to the point at which a foetus can survive outside the womb, and it has been argued that this is an arbitrary standard. The Indian legal framework leans towards a woman's autonomy to decide and choose, but there is criticism that the decision to terminate after 20 weeks is left to doctors rather than the woman herself. The case will continue on October 16, and a fresh medical report has been requested by the court.</description>

			<title>What the 2023 Nobel Economics Prize winner says on women’s aspirations, role in workforce and pay gap</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/economics-laureates-book-charts-womens-aspirations-role-in-workforce-8982036/</link>
			<description>Claudia Goldin, an economist and winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, explores the history of college-educated women in the United States in her book "Career &amp; Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity." She examines how women's aspirations and circumstances have changed over time, highlighting the ongoing problem of women feeling short-changed in their careers compared to their husbands and male colleagues. Goldin attributes this problem to sex discrimination, gender bias, and the glass ceiling. However, she suggests that even if these issues were to disappear, the problem would still persist due to the underlying system at play.

The book categorizes women who graduated from college into five groups ranging from the 1900s to the 1990s. Goldin explores how their aspirations shifted over time, from having to choose between a career and family, to sacrificing one for the other, to ultimately aspiring for both equally. She attributes these shifts to factors such as laws that initially prohibited women and married women from working, which later changed with increased job demand after the Great Depression and the "baby boom" era following World War II.

The introduction of the birth control pill in 1960 allowed women to delay childbirth and marriage, leading to greater enrollment in post-graduate courses and aspirations for long-term careers rather than just jobs. The feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s also played a role in increasing women's participation in the workforce, contributing significantly to economic growth.

Goldin emphasizes the tension between work and caregiving responsibilities as a major challenge faced by women today. This challenge impacts women's career goals and contributes to the gender pay gap. While previous explanations attributed the pay gap to differences in fields of study and occupational choices, Goldin argues that it expands as men and women age, get married, and have children.

The root of the problem, according to Goldin, is the prevalence of "greedy work," referring to careers that demand extensive time and attention, such as doctors, lawyers, and senior corporate executives. Greedy jobs heavily reward individuals who are available at all times, creating an imbalance between work and family life. Goldin asserts that addressing this issue requires changing the existing work and care structures, which she considers relics of a time when men were the only ones who could have both careers and families.

One part of the solution involves making rewarding, well-paying work more flexible in terms of hours and allowing for time-offs. Goldin cites fields like veterinary medicine in the US as examples of how this flexibility has been implemented to some extent. Remote work, which became more prevalent during the pandemic, also provides a potential solution.

Men play a crucial role in achieving gender equality at work and in caregiving. Goldin emphasizes the importance of men supporting their male colleagues on parental leave, advocating for public policies that subsidize childcare, and pressuring their firms to adopt more flexible practices. Ultimately, Goldin calls for a reimagination of work and care to allow both men and women to have fulfilling careers and family lives.</description>

			<title>Why do terrorist groups like Hamas take people hostage?</title>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent hostage-taking incident in southern Israel by Hamas fighters. It mentions that approximately 150 Israelis, mostly civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, were taken hostage and are currently held in multiple locations in Gaza. The fate of these hostages remains unknown as an Israeli ground assault is imminent. The article also provides historical context, stating that hostage-taking has been a common tactic in unconventional warfare and has been used by terrorist groups for various purposes such as political concessions, ransom, attracting international attention, and inspiring further terrorism. It highlights previous instances of hostage-taking in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the Munich massacre in 1972 and the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Private Shalit by Hamas in 2011. The article also explores different approaches to hostage situations by various countries, such as the US and UK's policy of no negotiations with terrorists, France and Europe reportedly paying ransom for kidnapped journalists, and instances where negotiations or military operations were used to free hostages. It emphasizes the challenges and risks involved in a potential Israeli ground offensive to rescue the hostages, as well as the need for negotiations involving countries like Iran. The article concludes by providing examples of notable hostage crises throughout history, including the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, the hijacking of TWA flight 847 in 1985, and the Beslan school siege in 2004.</description>

			<title>What is Israel’s new ‘unity government’ overseeing the military campaign in Gaza?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-unity-government-gaza-8981806/</link>
			<description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formed an emergency unity government with opposition leader Benny Gantz to oversee the ongoing war with Hamas. The unity government aims to bring together political rivals to keep Netanyahu out of power. The agreement includes Gantz and members of his Blue and White party joining forces with Netanyahu's far-right ruling coalition. An emergency war cabinet has been formed, consisting of Netanyahu, Gantz, and Yoav Gallant from the Likud party. The unity government will serve for the duration of the war, during which crucial decisions regarding the conduct of the war will be made. Legislation unrelated to the war will be put on hold. Some opposition parties, including Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid, have chosen not to join the unity government due to their opposition to Netanyahu's far-right allies. The ruling coalition includes ultra-Orthodox allies and a far-right faction, including controversial figures such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, known for their anti-liberal and anti-democratic views.</description>

			<title>Which nation can mediate in Hamas-Israel conflict?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/which-nation-mediate-hamas-israel-conflict-8981745/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas in the aftermath of a terror attack. Israel has conducted massive airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, resulting in a high death toll. The Israeli government has also imposed a siege on Gaza and is attempting to free hostages held by Hamas. The militant group Hezbollah has supported Hamas by firing rockets into Israel, while extremist settlers have killed Palestinian civilians. There are concerns that the conflict could lead to a broader war involving other Middle Eastern countries. Various international actors, including the US, European nations, Russia, and China, have expressed a desire to help facilitate negotiations and establish a ceasefire. However, it is emphasized that Middle Eastern countries should take the lead in resolving the crisis. Egypt plays a crucial role as it shares a border with Gaza and is involved in providing humanitarian aid. Jordan has a history of involvement in the region and supports a two-state solution. Qatar, with its close ties to Hamas, is leading efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Turkey, which does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization, has also offered to mediate. Overall, the situation remains volatile, with concerns about further displacement and refugees seeking safety across borders.</description>

			<title>What is Australia’s Indigenous Voice referendum?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australia-indigenous-voice-referendum-explained-8981365/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A referendum will be held in Australia on October 14 to determine whether the country's indigenous peoples should be formally consulted in the decision-making process for laws. The referendum question asks if the constitution should be altered to recognize the first peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. However, a recent YouGov poll suggests that the referendum is unlikely to pass. Indigenous Australians are not mentioned in the country's constitution, and the referendum aims to address this by proposing the establishment of an Indigenous "voice to parliament" to advise lawmakers on matters affecting their lives. Aboriginal people in Australia face various socio-economic challenges, including lower life expectancy, higher rates of disease and infant mortality, and a suicide rate twice as high as non-indigenous Australians. Supporters argue that the proposed body would provide a voice for the original inhabitants of the continent and address the legacy of failed programs and broken policies. The history of the indigenous communities in Australia has been marked by marginalization resulting from laws and policies implemented by colonial settlers. The opposition parties, including the Liberal Party and Nationals, have opposed the referendum, citing concerns about unclear details regarding the proposed body and the potential for dividing Australian society along racial lines. Some indigenous people have also rejected the idea of a consultative body, advocating instead for a formal treaty that transfers substantial power between the government and indigenous people.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: Why did Hamas attack now, what does it say about Israeli intelligence?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-did-hamas-attack-now-what-does-it-say-about-israeli-intelligence-8980558/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the military conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip-based militant group Hamas, highlighting some key factors and background information. The conflict is seen as unprecedented due to Hamas's ability to breach advanced border fencing mechanisms and intelligence capabilities. Hamas was founded in 1987 as a political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood and has significant influence in the Palestinian territories, particularly in Gaza. The group has carried out rocket attacks against Israel and developed expertise in digging military tunnels. Hamas considers Israel its sworn enemy and aims for its destruction.

The article also mentions the reciprocal accusations between the parties involved, with Israel being accused of acts of terrorism and violating international law by encouraging Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The lack of progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the perception that the conflict is now more of an Israel-Palestinian issue contribute to the frustration among Palestinians. Additionally, Israel's hardline government and talk of expanding settlements have exacerbated tensions.

The article suggests that Hamas's attack on Israel, codenamed "Al-Aqsa Flood," may be a response to the desecration of the Al-Aqsa mosque complex and an attempt to convey that Jerusalem is undividable. There is also speculation that Hamas aims to disrupt the possible Israeli-Saudi agreement for normalization by provoking heavy retaliation. The author points out the blow to Israel's intelligence apparatus and raises questions about potential failures in coordination between the government and military-security officials.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for Israel to reassess its counter-terrorism and intelligence strategies in light of this conflict.</description>

			<title>What war crimes laws apply to the Israel-Palestinian conflict?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-war-crimes-laws-apply-to-the-israel-palestinian-conflict-8980317/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The recent conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces, sparked by the assault from the militant group Hamas, has resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides. The conflict falls under an international system of justice that has evolved since World War II. The rules governing this conflict are based on the internationally accepted principles of armed conflict, as outlined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions. These conventions have been ratified by all UN member states and have been supplemented by rulings from international war crimes tribunals. These rules, collectively known as the "law of armed conflict" or "international humanitarian law," apply to government forces, organized armed groups, and Hamas militants.

If alleged perpetrators of atrocities in Israel, including Palestinians, or alleged crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice locally, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal body that can bring charges. While domestic courts can exercise universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, its scope is limited. The ICC derives its legal authority from the Rome Statute and can investigate alleged crimes on the territories of its member states or committed by their nationals when domestic authorities are "unwilling or unable" to do so. The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor has confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and is currently collecting information.

The ICC, established in 2002, is the world's permanent war crimes tribunal. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by their nationals. However, major powers such as China, the United States, Russia, India, and Egypt are not members. While the ICC recognizes Palestine as a member state, Israel rejects the court's jurisdiction and does not engage with it formally. Due to budget and staff constraints, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases in different countries, and the budget for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 is just under a million euros ($1.06 million).

The ICC has been conducting an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021 but has not yet issued any arrest warrants. Prosecutors have stated that there is a reasonable basis to believe that violations have been committed by all sides, including Israeli troops, Hamas militants, and other armed Palestinian groups.

Acts that could potentially violate war crimes law include the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, taking civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, and the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians. The deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are deemed heinous crimes by human rights organizations, with no justification. Violations such as the taking of hostages, murder, and torture are explicitly prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. Israel's response to the conflict could also be subject to a war crimes investigation, particularly concerning the announcement of a tightened blockade and the possibility of a ground invasion to destroy Hamas.

US President Joe Biden has stated that Israel has the right and duty to respond but emphasized the importance of acting according to the rule of law. A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians instead of being a legitimate means to undermine Hamas' military capabilities or if it is deemed disproportionate. Under international law, attacks on military objectives must be proportional and should not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects compared to the expected military advantage. A defense lawyer at the ICC highlighted the gruesome killings by Hamas militants, such as the attack on a dance rave and civilians in kibbutz communities near the Gaza border, as potential focuses for a war crimes case.</description>

			<title>Why China has assisted Sri Lanka over debt worth $4.2 billion</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-sri-lanka-debt-deal-imf-explained-8980203/</link>
			<description>Sri Lanka has reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to cover $4.2 billion of its outstanding debt, as the country continues to grapple with an economic crisis. China is the largest bilateral creditor to Sri Lanka, having lent $7 billion of the country's total foreign debt of $42 billion. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka was caused by factors such as tax cuts, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on tourism, and fuel shortages due to the war in Ukraine. Sri Lanka has also sought assistance from India, including a $500 million credit line for fuel and a $1 billion credit line for importing essentials. In September 2022, Sri Lanka qualified for a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but this loan is contingent on securing financing assurances for debt sustainability from its creditors through negotiations and debt restructuring. Sri Lanka has asked for a 30% reduction in the value of its outstanding debt and hopes to reduce its overall debt by $16.9 billion through restructuring. Negotiations between Sri Lanka and countries including Japan, India, and France for a debt rework deal did not go through in September 2023. The agreement with China's EXIM Bank will help Sri Lanka secure the release of the second tranche of about $334 million from the IMF and provide fiscal space for implementing reform measures. China's assistance to Sri Lanka will be seen as another way it is deepening ties with the country, which has joined China's Belt and Road Initiative. India has concerns about China's increasing presence in its neighborhood and fears it could lead to increased Chinese military presence and surveillance in the region.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh recently visited the VC Yeshwant Ghadge Sundial Memorial in Montone, Italy to pay tribute to Indian soldiers who fought in World War II. This visit highlights the shared military history between India and Italy during the campaign to liberate Italy. The soldiers' contributions had been largely ignored until Italy opened the memorial earlier this year. Naik Yeshwant Ghadge, a 23-year-old soldier, played a significant role in the Italian campaign. Despite facing heavy machine gun fire, Ghadge charged at the enemy and neutralized their position, even though he suffered fatal injuries. For his bravery, he posthumously received the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honor. Indian soldiers made up the third-largest Allied contingent in Italy, with 50,000 soldiers and over 5,000 casualties. They played a crucial role in various battles, including Monte Cassino and breaching the Gothic Line. The Indian Army's professionalism and successes in the Italian campaigns gained recognition from Allied commanders.</description>

			<title>Why Odisha govt’s new rural development scheme has triggered a controversy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/odisha-govts-rural-development-scheme-controversy-8980142/</link>
			<description>Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has launched a new scheme called 'Ama Odisha, Nabin Odisha' ahead of the upcoming General and Assembly elections in 2024. The scheme aims to provide assistance of Rs 50 lakh to every panchayat in the state for various projects, including the protection of places of worship, upgrading historical sites, improving rural infrastructure, and enhancing digital access. This initiative builds on the success of the 'Ama Gaon, Ama Bikash' scheme, which helped the ruling BJD party secure a fifth consecutive term in the previous Assembly elections. Under the new scheme, funds are allocated based on suggestions from rural residents through video conferencing. However, the opposition BJP has raised concerns about the use of the ruling party's electoral symbol in government advertisements for the scheme and has questioned the timing of its launch. The BJP MLA has accused the government of not following proper guidelines and has threatened to challenge the use of the symbol in court.</description>

			<title>Large ozone hole detected over Antarctica: Is it a matter of concern?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/large-ozone-hole-antarctica-explained-8979396/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Satellite measurements taken by the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite have detected a large hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. The hole, which is referred to as an "ozone-depleted area," is 26 million square kilometers in size, approximately three times the size of Brazil. This is one of the largest ozone holes ever observed. The ozone layer acts as a protective shield against ultraviolet radiation, reducing the risk of skin cancer. The size of the ozone hole over Antarctica varies each year, opening in August and closing in November or December. This year's large ozone hole is believed to be a result of volcanic eruptions in Tonga, which released water vapor and other elements that can deplete ozone. However, human activities, particularly the use of chlorofluorocarbons, were responsible for creating significant ozone holes in the past. The Montreal Protocol was established in 1987 to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances, which has led to a reduction in ozone holes. While ozone depletion is not a primary cause of global climate change, there are indications that rising global temperatures could impact ozone holes. Additionally, ozone holes may contribute to cooling effects and alter the progression of seasons.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-new-royalty-rates-for-strategic-minerals-lithium-rees-can-help-cut-their-imports-8978912/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has amended a key law to specify competitive royalty rates for the mining of three strategically significant minerals: lithium, niobium, and rare earth elements (REEs). This decision follows the removal of six minerals, including lithium and niobium, from the list of specified atomic minerals, which opens the possibility for private sector participation through auctioning of concessions for these minerals. The move is aimed at encouraging domestic mining to reduce imports of these minerals and promote the development of industries such as electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage solutions. The lower royalty rates, set at 3% for lithium and niobium and 1% for REEs, align India's rates with global benchmarks and will help attract bidders to the auctions.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses India's relationship with Israel and Palestine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with Israel during the recent Hamas assault and India's Ministry of External Affairs mentioned Palestinians for the first time in a statement. The article explores India's historical perspective on Palestine, including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's support for a federal state and Mahatma Gandhi's opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine. India recognized Israel in 1950 but did not establish diplomatic relations until 1992 due to the Cold War dynamics and India's alignment with the Soviet Union. However, India's support for Palestine has since toned down, and the country has developed a closer relationship with Israel, especially in the defense sector. The article suggests that India's support for Israel may be driven by a desire for stronger action against cross-border terrorism. While India officially supports the two-state solution, its growing closeness to Israel has raised concerns among Palestinians. However, the article argues that Arab countries have lost interest in the Palestinian cause, and India's relationship with them is unlikely to be affected.</description>

Initially, there was uncertainty and a sell-off in the markets, but as the scope of the war became clearer, markets recovered. The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty Index in India experienced fluctuations throughout the week, but overall, they showed resilience. The Dow Jones index in the US also gained points. The recovery was attributed to factors such as the resilience of the US economy, declining US bond yields, and the hope that the conflict would remain localized and not impact crude prices. However, concerns remain about the potential spread of the conflict to other countries and the impact on oil prices. Investors are advised to remain cautious, but indications suggest that the prevailing tone will continue. Inflation rates in India and the US, as well as corporate performance, are also factors influencing the markets.</description>

			<title>What the GI tag can mean for the cashew industry in Goa</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/goan-cashew-gets-gi-tag-how-this-can-help-the-industry-in-the-state-8978577/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Goan cashew has received the geographical indication (GI) tag, which signifies its unique characteristics and qualities as a product originating from a specific geographical region. The GI tag will help consumers differentiate between authentic Goan cashews and those sourced from outside the state, which are often marketed as 'Goan cashews'. The application for the GI tag was filed by the Goa Cashew Manufacturers' Association, and the government plans to take steps to promote it. The influx of cheaper cashews from other states and countries has affected the sales of traditional Goan cashew processors, leading to a decline in processing units in Goa. The GI tag is expected to be useful for export as well.</description>

			<title>Is China’s investment in Pakistan slowing down?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-investment-pakistan-8978474/</link>
			<description>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project, specifically the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), appears to have stalled, according to recent reports. The CPEC, which was signed in 2015, aims to develop rail and road links to facilitate the shipping of Chinese goods through Pakistan into the Arabian Sea. However, China has shown reluctance to fund several requested CPEC projects due to economic concerns and its own recent slowdown. Experts believe that the actual outcomes of the CPEC in Pakistan have fallen short of expectations, with limited tangible benefits for the Pakistani people and a surge in public debt to Chinese companies. Pakistan's political instability, following the ouster of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, is seen as a concern for China, as it risks unrest and violence that could threaten Chinese nationals and interests in Pakistan. Security threats to Chinese workers in Pakistan are also worrying China, with incidents such as militant attacks on Chinese engineers and workers. These security concerns could jeopardize new investments and the completion of projects. Despite these challenges, some believe that the CPEC is moving forward as planned, while others assert that security concerns and political instability could impede progress on the project.</description>

			<title>Why Gaza is known as the world’s biggest ‘open air prison’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-gaza-is-known-as-the-worlds-biggest-open-air-prison-8978189/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the current situation in Gaza, following a recent attack by Hamas militants on Israel. Israel's defence minister has ordered a complete siege of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity, food, water, and fuel. The article explains that Gaza has been under an air, land, and sea blockade since 2007 and is often referred to as an "open air prison" due to the conditions created by the occupation and blockade. It provides a brief history of Gaza's occupation by Israel since 1967 and the withdrawal of Israeli settlements in 2005. The article also highlights the physical barriers surrounding Gaza, including walls and border crossings controlled by Israel and Egypt. It emphasizes the densely populated and impoverished nature of Gaza, with high unemployment rates, food insecurity, and aid dependency. The blockade has also made it difficult for people from Gaza to travel to the West Bank for medical treatment or other purposes. The term "open air prison" is used by UN experts, intellectuals, rights groups, and even former British Prime Minister David Cameron to describe the situation in Gaza.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/uss-gerald-r-ford-israel-us-hamas-8978104/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group to sail to the Eastern Mediterranean to assist Israel in response to a surprise attack by Hamas. The deployment demonstrates the US's support for Israel and its aim to prevent further escalation of the conflict. The USS Gerald R Ford is the largest warship ever built, measuring 337m long, 78m wide, and 76m high. It can support up to 90 aircraft and has a crew of over 4,500 personnel. Despite its size, it is agile with a top speed of over 30 knots. The aircraft carrier always travels with a defensive cover of a carrier strike group, which includes cruisers, frigates or destroyers, and supply ships. The USS Gerald R Ford entered service in 2017 and is named after former US President Gerald R Ford, who served in the US Navy during World War II.</description>

			<title>Why did China detain an Australian journalist for over three years — and why has she been released now?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australian-journalist-cheng-lei-released-china-8978076/</link>
			<description>Cheng Lei, a China-born Australian journalist, has returned home after being detained in China for over three years on suspicion of illegally supplying state secrets overseas. Her release was welcomed by Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who stated that her return would be warmly welcomed by all Australians. Cheng had a successful journalism career and worked for various media outlets in China and Singapore. She suddenly disappeared from Chinese television in August 2020 and was later announced to be held on national security grounds without formal charges or access to a lawyer. Cheng's trial began behind closed doors in March 2022, and the verdict has not been made public. Her detention occurred during a turbulent period in China-Australia relations, but tensions have since simmered down with the removal of tariffs and the resumption of ministerial visits. The timing of Cheng's release suggests that politics played a role in China's handling of her case.</description>

			<title>Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad, PLO, and Palestinian Authority: A brief introduction to the political players in Palestine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-fatah-plo-palestinian-authority-islamic-jihad-israel-palestine-8976870/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The recent attack on Israel has brought attention not only to Hamas but also to other significant players in Palestine, such as Fatah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and Palestinian Authority (PA). Let's take a quick look at each of them and their roles in the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Fatah, meaning "to conquer," was formed in the late 1950s in Kuwait. It was established by key figures like Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas with the objective of armed struggle against Israel to liberate Palestine. Fatah's military operations began in 1965 and were carried out from Jordan and Lebanon. In 1968, Fatah became part of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which aimed to achieve statehood for Palestine through armed resistance. However, Fatah later transformed its approach and started negotiating with Israel. In the 1990s, Fatah-led PLO renounced armed resistance and signed the Oslo Accords, which established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) or Palestinian Authority (PA) as an interim self-governing body leading to an independent Palestinian state. Currently, Fatah heads the PA, governing about 40% of the occupied West Bank.

Hamas, founded in the late 1980s, is another major political party in Palestine known for its ongoing armed struggle against Israel. Like Fatah, Hamas aims to establish a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967. However, unlike Fatah, Hamas has not recognized the statehood of Israel. Since 2006, Hamas has been ruling the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second-largest militant group in Palestine, aiming to destroy Israel and establish an Islamic Palestinian state through force. It was established in 1981 by members of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and is believed to receive financial support from Iran. Though Hamas and PIJ are allies, they have separate identities and some differences. PIJ has mainly focused on armed struggle but also participated in student politics and legislative elections.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was conceived in 1964 with the goal of liberating Palestine through armed struggle. It is a coalition of smaller Arab groups, with Fatah being the dominant one. PLO was recognized by the Arab League and the United Nations as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people." In the early 1990s, PLO gave up armed struggle and recognized the statehood of Israel, which led to the rise of Hamas.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) was founded in 1994 as an interim body to govern parts of Gaza and the West Bank. It functions as an agency of the PLO and is led by a directly-elected president, currently Mahmoud Abbas. In 2006, Hamas won the legislative elections and took control of the Gaza Strip, while the PA continued to govern parts of the West Bank.

These various groups and organizations play significant roles in the complex Israel-Palestine conflict, each with its own history, objectives, and approach.</description>

			<title>What the hottest September ever reveals about climate change</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-the-hottest-september-ever-reveals-about-climate-change-8977093/</link>
			<description>September 2023 has been confirmed as the hottest September on record, continuing the trend of record-breaking temperatures seen throughout this year. Scientists had predicted that 2023 would be exceptionally warm due to the development of El Nino in the Pacific Ocean. The remaining three months of the year are also expected to be warmer than usual. July 2023 was not only the warmest July ever recorded, but also the warmest month overall. June, February, March, April, and May all experienced average temperatures that ranked among the highest ever for those respective months. The period between June and August was the warmest on record globally. September 2023 stood out by being significantly warmer than both pre-industrial times and a more contemporary baseline. The Secretary-General of the World Meteorology Organisation expressed concern about the ongoing warming trend and its impacts on the environment and society. It is anticipated that 2023 will surpass 2016 as the warmest year on record, with fears that it may breach the 1.5 degree Celsius mark for the first time. Despite these alarming trends, there has been little policy response from countries to address climate change. Only a significant global disruption could make a noticeable difference in reducing temperatures in the short term. The world is likely to exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius target within four years if current trends continue. The promise to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, made at a recent G20 meeting, is considered insufficient to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions adequately. At an upcoming climate change meeting in Dubai, countries will assess global climate action and its adequacy in relation to temperature goals. It is hoped that this assessment will prompt more energetic climate action from nations.</description>

			<title>Baiga tribal group gets habitat rights in Chhattisgarh: What this means, significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/baiga-pvtg-habitat-rights-chhattisgarh-significance-8976933/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Baiga Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Chhattisgarh, India, has been granted habitat rights ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. This makes them the second PVTG to receive these rights in the state, following the Kamar PVTG. A total of 19 Baiga villages with a population of 6,483 people have been given habitat rights. Habitat rights recognition provides the community with rights over their customary territory, socio-cultural practices, livelihood means, and protection of their natural and cultural heritage. These rights are granted under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. The Baiga community primarily resides in various districts of Chhattisgarh and neighboring Madhya Pradesh. Only three out of 75 PVTGs in India currently have habitat rights. Chhattisgarh has seven PVTGs living in 17 districts, with a total population of 2.50 lakh. The government determines habitats based on consultations with tribal leaders and verification by relevant departments. The process of granting habitat rights began in December 2021, starting with the Kamar tribes as a pilot project.</description>

			<title>Washington rallies behind Israel: Why a lasting consensus may prove elusive</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/washington-rallies-israel-democrats-republicans-consensus-8976826/</link>
			<description>The recent surprise attack by Hamas on Israel has brought together politicians in the United States, who have been divided on the issue of support for Israel. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed condemnation of Hamas and solidarity with Israel following the killing of Israeli civilians. However, as Israel retaliates with airstrikes and a potential ground invasion, some Democrats on the left have criticized Israel for its treatment of Palestinians. This current unity in support for Israel may be tested as the conflict continues and Israeli forces employ more firepower. The Biden administration has declared Israel's right to defend itself and is providing military aid. The sensitivity of the situation is evident in mixed signals sent by the administration, which were subsequently deleted due to backlash. The article highlights that while there is bipartisan support for retaliation against Hamas, there are concerns about the impact of the response on the civilian population in Gaza. The article also discusses the evolving partisan divide on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Washington, with Republicans solidly supporting Israel and Democrats being more divided on the issue. President Biden, despite his past differences with Netanyahu, has offered unwavering support for Israel in the current crisis. Some dissenting voices among Democrats have called for an end to U.S. support for Israel's military occupation and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza. However, there are Democrats who strongly condemn these views and emphasize the importance of standing with Israel as an ally in the region. The article concludes by noting that the involvement of Americans in the conflict adds another dimension and suggests that there may be little sympathy for those who do not prioritize protecting Israel and standing up to terrorists.</description>

			<title>SC to hear petition challenging electoral bonds: What is the scheme and its criticisms?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sc-petition-challenging-electoral-bonds-explained-criticism-8976353/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has announced that it will hear petitions challenging India's electoral bonds scheme on October 31. Introduced in 2018, electoral bonds are interest-free bearer instruments that allow anonymous donations to political parties. They can be purchased in various denominations from authorized branches of the State Bank of India. Political parties have 15 days to encash the bonds and use the funds for electoral expenses. If the bonds are not encashed within the timeframe, the money is deposited into the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. The scheme has faced legal challenges, with critics arguing that it lacks transparency and allows unlimited corporate funding. They also claim that the anonymity of donors under the scheme can be exploited for unfair advantage. Additionally, it has been noted that a majority of the electoral bonds have gone to the ruling party, the BJP, raising concerns about impartiality.</description>

			<title>Hamas may have hit — or killed — a brewing Israel-Saudi agreement: here’s how</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-attack-israel-saudi-agreement-palestine-explained-8976056/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The recent attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel may be linked to ongoing negotiations between Israel and Saudi Arabia for the normalization of ties. The potential deal, mediated by the United States, would see Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel for the first time and receiving security guarantees from the US in exchange. It would also bring economic benefits to Israel and political gains for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US is motivated by concerns over growing Chinese influence in the region and hopes to improve relations with Saudi Arabia. The Palestinians are not directly involved in the negotiations, but Saudi Arabia has indicated that a deal is possible even without providing Palestinians an independent state. The US wants the deal to be finalized before the next presidential elections in November 2022, and Iran's refusal to halt its nuclear program adds urgency to strengthening ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The Israel-Hamas conflict has disrupted the timeline of the deal and triggered sympathy for Palestinians in the Arab world, casting doubt on its chances of being finalized soon. Some believe Iran played a role in encouraging Hamas to launch the attack, although there is no concrete evidence of Iranian involvement.</description>

			<title>Why Mahatma Gandhi opposed a Jewish nation-state in Palestine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/gandhi-opposed-jewish-nation-state-palestine-8975964/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article discusses Mahatma Gandhi's views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Gandhi expressed sympathy for the Jewish people, acknowledging their historical persecution and the parallels between their treatment and that of the untouchables in Hinduism. He even stated that a war against Germany to prevent the persecution of Jews would be justified. However, Gandhi opposed the creation of a Zionist state in Palestine. He believed that imposing Jews on the Arabs would be wrong and inhumane. Gandhi argued that the settlement of Jews in Palestine should occur only with the goodwill of the Arab Palestinians, without the aid of force. He also believed that a Jewish homeland in Palestine would hinder the fight for Jewish rights elsewhere. Gandhi's stance on this issue influenced India's foreign policy for many years and shaped the perspective of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. India voted against the partition of Palestine in the United Nations and only established diplomatic relations with Israel much later, in 1992.</description>

			<description>Claudia Goldin, a professor of economics at Harvard University, has won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for 2023. She has been awarded the prize for her contributions to understanding women's labor market outcomes. Goldin's research has provided insights into the causes of the gender gap in earnings and labor market participation over centuries. She has demonstrated that the relationship between economic growth and women's involvement in the labor market is not linear and that historical and social factors play a significant role. Goldin's work also highlights the impact of education, marriage, and childbirth on women's career opportunities. Her research has shed light on the barriers that need to be addressed to achieve gender equality in the labor market. This recognition marks a significant achievement for Goldin, who has been a trailblazer in studying the role of women in the economy.</description>

			<title>Why is Israel an attractive destination for Indian caregivers?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-is-israel-an-attractive-destination-for-indian-caregivers-8975296/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the concerns in India about the safety of its expatriate population in Israel, particularly the estimated 14,000 Indian caregivers who work there. The job of a caregiver in Israel is attractive due to the high pay and benefits, such as free food, accommodation, and healthcare. Caregivers in Israel have specific facilities in their clients' homes and typically only look after one person. They are also allowed to change employers after a year of employment or if their client passes away. To become a caregiver in Israel, one does not need to be a nursing graduate but can have completed an ANM or GNM course. Language proficiency tests are required before recruitment, and short-term courses in Hebrew are available. The flow of caregivers from India to Israel began in the mid-1990s when the government enacted a law providing home care for the elderly and disabled. The recruitment process starts when an Israeli citizen or their family raises a demand for a caregiver with local government authorities. Caregivers are paid directly by employers or through health insurance. Many Indian nursing professionals choose to work in Israel due to low salaries and limited opportunities in Indian hospitals.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent violence between Israel and Hamas, which began when Hamas launched an attack on Israel. The toll has surpassed 1,100 and thousands have been injured on both sides. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have also taken over 130 people from Israel and brought them to Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, stated that the attack was in response to the blockade of Gaza and Israeli occupation. Deif, who has been the head of Hamas' military wing since 2002, was born in Gaza and joined the Islamic University of Gaza. He was involved in suicide bombings in the 1990s and narrowly escaped multiple assassination attempts by Israel. The US State Department has designated him as a terrorist. Deif has targeted high-impact locations such as settlements, soldiers, and buses. He is said to be in a wheelchair and has lost an arm, a leg, and possibly an eye.</description>

			<title>Economics Nobel 2023: How Claudia Goldin shed light on the status of women in the workforce</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/economics-nobel-2023-claudia-goldin-explained-8975198/</link>
			<description>Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University professor, has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for her work on women's labor market outcomes. Goldin's research has focused on women's participation in the labor market over the past two centuries and the persistent gender pay gap. She found that older data revealed a history of women's involvement in economic activities related to agriculture and cottage industries before industrialization. The growth of the services sector in the early 20th century, along with factors such as marriage and the contraceptive pill, influenced women's access to higher education and employment opportunities. Goldin highlighted that legislation and societal expectations limited married women's employment prospects, and the introduction of contraceptive pills allowed women to plan their careers and motherhood. Despite women catching up in terms of education and employment fields, the gender pay gap persists. Goldin and her co-authors demonstrated that the pay gap widens when women have children, as they face slower career advancements. This Nobel Prize in Economics is not a part of Alfred Nobel's original will but was established through a donation from Sweden's central bank in 1968. Goldin is the third woman to receive this honor.</description>

			<title>In Israel-Palestine conflict, why Hamas and Hezbollah have raised the issue of ‘normalisation’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-palestine-conflict-hamas-hezbollah-normalisation-explained-8973995/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent attack by Hamas on Israel and its connection to the concept of "normalization" in the region. "Normalization" refers to the efforts to establish diplomatic relations and normalize ties between Israel and other Muslim countries in West Asia. The attack by Hamas is believed to be a response to these attempts at normalization.

The Israel-Palestine conflict is rooted in the shared claim of both Jews and Palestinians to the land of Palestine, which is now Israel. The dispute also encompasses cultural, ethnic, and religious aspects that are integral to the identity of both sides. The city of Jerusalem holds particular significance for Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, making it a focal point of the conflict.

The article provides a brief historical overview, highlighting the partition plan proposed by the United Nations in 1947, which was rejected by Arab parties, leading to the first war in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Israel declared its establishment as a state in 1948, and Arab armies invaded the next day. The war resulted in Israel capturing a significant portion of the former Mandatory Palestine, with Jordan annexing the West Bank and Egypt gaining control of the Gaza Strip.

Efforts have been made over the years to establish a two-state solution, but none have been universally accepted. The Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, proposed the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, which called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories and the recognition of East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state. However, it was not until recently that progress towards normalization began to materialize.

Factors such as the Arab Spring protests, the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, and the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco have contributed to the process of normalization. These developments have been influenced by shifting geopolitics, including concerns about an expansionist Iran and China's growing influence in the region.

However, the article also highlights that the Palestinian issue has been somewhat sidelined in these normalization efforts, leading to discontent among Palestinians. The author argues that true normalization cannot be achieved without addressing past annexations and other concerns.

In summary, the article explores the recent attack by Hamas in response to attempts at normalizing relations between Israel and Muslim countries in the region. It provides a historical background of the Israel-Palestine conflict, discusses the significance of Jerusalem, and examines the factors contributing to the process of normalization. The article also emphasizes the importance of addressing Palestinian concerns for true normalization to occur.</description>

			<title>With food inflation limited to dal roti, why govt policy may need changes</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/with-food-inflation-limited-to-dal-roti-why-govt-policy-may-need-changes-8974046/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Consumer food prices in India were 9.9% higher year-on-year in August, causing concern for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government. The RBI's monetary policy committee stated that food price shocks are impacting inflation, and the government is keen to prevent food inflation from spiraling out of control ahead of national elections in six months. Food inflation is being driven by cereals and pulses, although vegetable prices are expected to moderate. The government may need to consider a more balanced approach to food inflation that takes into account both consumer and producer interests.</description>

			<title>How India-Israel ties progressed: from Palestine-leaning to a strategic embrace of the Jewish nation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/arc-of-indias-ties-with-israel-8974060/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's historical relationship with Israel and Palestine, highlighting the roller coaster nature of their ties over the past seven decades. It mentions that India initially supported the Palestinian cause after independence in 1947, but recognized Israel in 1950. In the late 1960s and early 70s, India developed a strong relationship with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and recognized it as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. However, India's support for Palestine faced criticism within the country due to Arab countries' neutral position during India's conflicts with China and Pakistan. The article notes that India established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992, which proved beneficial during the Kargil conflict in 1999 when Israel provided precision target bombs to India. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India's ties with Israel have become more visible, but New Delhi has maintained its support for the Palestinian cause. The article concludes by stating that recent attacks between Hamas and Israel put India in a diplomatic tight spot as it tests efforts towards peace in the Middle East.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/aditya-l1-corrects-trajectory-why-how-was-this-done-8973882/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has conducted a Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) for its spacecraft Aditya L1 to ensure it reaches its destination at the Sun Earth Lagrangian point 1. The Aditya L1 is embarking on a 110-day journey through space, one of the longest for an Indian spacecraft since the Mars mission in 2013-2014. Deep space missions require trajectory correction plans to ensure the spacecraft remains on course for its destination. The Aditya L1 spacecraft will be injected into an orbit around L1, and trajectory errors were identified after the Trans Lagrangian Point 1 Insertion maneuver. The spacecraft will orbit around L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit in a plane perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun. The L1 orbit is challenging to acquire and maintain, and course corrections may be needed during the mission. ISRO has previously performed TCMs during the Mars Orbiter Mission to ensure the spacecraft reached the correct trajectory.</description>

			<title>What was the Yom Kippur war, and why is the Hamas attack on Israel being compared to it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-was-the-yom-kippur-hamas-attack-israel-8973844/</link>
			<description>The recent surprise attack by Hamas on Israel has brought back memories of the Yom Kippur War, which started 50 years ago. This current conflict is being compared to the Yom Kippur War for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it has been the deadliest attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Hamas gunmen carried out a rampage in Israeli towns, killing at least 400 Israelis and kidnapping civilians. In retaliation, Israeli strikes have killed at least 313 Palestinians. In the Yom Kippur War, over 2,500 Israeli soldiers were killed. 

The second similarity is the criticism within Israel for being unprepared. The attack on Saturday came as a surprise, despite Israel's advanced intelligence and interception systems. This is similar to the Yom Kippur War, where Israel was also caught off guard due to many soldiers being on leave for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.

The Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War or the Ramadan War, was fought between Israel, Egypt, and Syria from October 6 to 25, 1973. It was the fourth Arab-Israeli war, following conflicts in 1949, 1956, and 1967. After Israel's decisive victory in the six-day war of 1967, it acquired territories from its neighbors, including the Golan Heights from Syria and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. 

Six years later, Egypt and Syria coordinated an attack on Israel. Israel was initially caught off guard and took time to mobilize its soldiers who were on leave for Yom Kippur. While both Syria and Egypt made some gains initially, Israel eventually halted their advances and launched counterstrikes. The intervention of the US and the Soviet Union further escalated tensions between the superpowers. A lasting ceasefire was finally reached on October 25, weakening Israel's previously perceived invincibility. 

Despite Israel's ability to beat back both attackers, the Yom Kippur War is still seen as a game-changer. Israel's scramble to rally troops initially and the heavy casualties it suffered showed that it could be vulnerable in battle. Prime Minister Golda Meir and her cabinet resigned six months after the war. Many analysts believe that Egypt's strategy behind launching the attack was to bruise Israel enough to bring it to the negotiating table. 

Following the war, a peace process was initiated, leading to the 1978 Camp David Accords in which Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. This marked the first instance of an Arab country recognizing Israel as a state. However, for Syria, the war had no positive outcomes as Israel continued to occupy the strategically important Golan Heights.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-palestine-conflict-hezbollah-explained-8973572/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a devastating attack on Israel, resulting in the deaths of at least 300 people. The attack is being seen as the biggest exchange of fire between the two parties in decades. Israel has declared war, raising concerns for an already volatile region. Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militant group, has also fired rockets at Israeli positions and declared solidarity with the Palestinian resistance. Hezbollah is described as the world's most heavily armed non-state actor and is supported by Iran. It opposes Israel and Western influence in the region. Hezbollah has been involved in Lebanese politics and holds seats in the country's Parliament. It has been characterized as a terrorist organization by many Western governments. Israel and Hezbollah have a history of conflict, with Hezbollah possessing a large arsenal of rockets and missiles. The Israeli government is facing criticism for being caught off guard by a less powerful force. Hamas' motivations for the attack are related to its opposition to recent engagements between Israel and other West Asian governments that lacked diplomatic relations with Israel. The attack follows months of rising violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Iran has called the attack an act of self-defense by Palestinians and pledged support to Palestinian fighters until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.</description>

			<title>What is Israel’s Iron Dome, how does it intercept rockets?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-palestine-conflict-iron-dome-air-defence-explained-8973212/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent attack by Hamas on Israel and the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome air defense system. The attack resulted in the deaths of 250 Israelis and the abduction of several others, while Israel's retaliatory strikes caused over 230 casualties in Gaza. The video shared by Nic Robertson shows the Iron Dome intercepting rockets from Gaza. The Iron Dome is a short-range, ground-to-air defense system that includes radar and interceptor missiles to neutralize rockets or missiles aimed at Israeli targets. It was developed in response to the Hezbollah's rocket attacks during the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war. The Iron Dome has a success rate of over 80%, according to experts. It consists of a detection and tracking radar, a battle management and weapon control system, and a missile firing unit. Each battery of the Iron Dome can cost over $50 million, while one interceptor missile costs around $80,000. Despite the high cost, it serves as a deterrent and helps save lives.</description>

			<title>Why the RBI’s Open Market Operation plan caught the market by surprise</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-open-market-operation-8972699/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent announcement to consider open market operation (OMO) sales of government securities took the bond market by surprise. The central bank did not specify a timeline for this proposal, causing the yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds to rise by 12 basis points to 7.34%. This unexpected move led to speculation of an OMO being implemented soon, which would tighten liquidity in the system. The surprise element stemmed from the absence of a specific calendar for these operations, leaving market participants on edge as OMOs could potentially be announced at any time.

The market was not anticipating such a measure by the RBI to withdraw excess liquidity, adding a hawkish tone to the monetary policy. Liquidity is expected to tighten further due to cash withdrawals during the upcoming festival season. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das mentioned that OMO sales may be considered to manage liquidity, but the timing and quantity of such operations will depend on evolving liquidity conditions.

OMOs are used by the RBI to adjust rupee liquidity conditions in the market on a lasting basis. If there is excess liquidity, the central bank sells government securities to remove rupee liquidity. Conversely, when liquidity conditions are tight, the RBI purchases securities to release liquidity into the market. OMOs are employed as a tool to control inflation and money supply. However, when liquidity is sucked out, it can lead to higher bond yields, as the RBI introduces more government securities into the market, causing bond buyers to demand higher interest rates on these securities.

The RBI's emphasis on active liquidity management during the post-policy press conference indicates its inclination towards tighter liquidity conditions in the future. This approach is driven by concerns about inflation risks and financial stability, aligning with the central bank's objective of keeping inflation at 4%. The RBI aims to achieve this target through liquidity management, particularly during the October-May period when cash withdrawals are high due to festive and wedding seasons.

The current liquidity position is such that the RBI may opt for OMO sales auctions of government securities to absorb any excess liquidity. In September, the RBI conducted OMO sales in the secondary market, resulting in net sales amounting to Rs 6,200 crore. Despite the gradual withdrawal of the incremental cash reserve ratio (i-CRR) implemented in the August Monetary Policy Committee meeting, systemic liquidity remained in deficit due to tax outflows and GST payments. The government's cash balance with the RBI is estimated at around Rs 2.7 lakh crore, and an increase in government spending and the withdrawal of i-CRR could boost systemic liquidity. However, the festive season may also lead to increased currency demand, offsetting any liquidity increase.</description>

			<title>How China invaded Tibet and annexed it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/china-tibet-invasion-annexation-dalai-lama-8972679/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950 and its long-lasting impact. It emphasizes how the invasion was initially unknown to most Tibetans due to the remote location of the region and the slow spread of news. The Chinese Communist Party had both ideological and pragmatic motivations for annexing Tibet, wanting to secure the border and access its natural resources while also seeing it as a feudal-theocracy in need of liberation. However, Tibet had historically existed independently, with its own culture, language, and religion. Tense negotiations took place between Lhasa and Beijing, but China steadily built up forces at Tibet's border to exert pressure. The People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet in October 1950, capturing the town of Chamdo and forcing the Tibetan garrison to surrender. China then sent the defeated governor of Chamdo to Lhasa to propose the seventeen point agreement to the Dalai Lama. Under duress, Tibetan plenipotentiaries signed the agreement in May 1951, subordinating Tibet to China while promising non-interference in domestic affairs, culture, and religion. However, China soon violated the agreement and introduced communist reforms in Tibet, eroding its autonomy and imposing cultural and economic changes. Massive resistance grew in Tibet by 1954, and in 1959, a revolt erupted in Lhasa amid fears that the CCP might arrest the Dalai Lama. Chinese reprisals were brutal, resulting in the deaths of thousands and the destruction of monasteries. The Dalai Lama fled to India, repudiated the seventeen point agreement, and declared himself as Tibet's legitimate representative. Since then, China has maintained absolute control over Tibet, suppressing dissent, placing its own people in religious positions, and encouraging Han Chinese immigration, which has affected Tibet's demographics and culture.</description>

			<title>Why India is launching a national framework for climate services</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/national-framework-for-climate-services-nfcs-8972568/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India is launching its first national-level framework for climate services, called the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS). Spearheaded by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the NFCS aims to provide climate information and services to key sectors such as agriculture, energy, disaster management, health, and water. The NFCS is based on the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), which is a partnership of governments and organizations at a global level. The GFCS aims to produce and improve the usage of climate information and services. The NFCS will focus on generating high-quality data on weather parameters and creating long-term projections and scenarios. The five major components of the GFCS are Observations and Monitoring, Research, Modelling and Prediction, Climate Services Information System, User Interface Platform, and Capacity Building. The IMD will be the nodal agency for implementing the national framework in India. Initially, the NFCS will work on bridging gaps between various agencies that require climate services. The IMD plans to strengthen its observational network and improve data inflow to run weather and climate models for deriving climate predictions. The framework aims to support efforts in preparing for new climate conditions and adapting to their impacts on various sectors. Several countries have already launched their own NFCS, and India will soon release its statement after receiving consensus from key stakeholders.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Palestinian militants launched rockets into southern and central Israel, leading to a state of war being declared by Israel. At least 22 Israelis were killed and over 500 injured in the attacks. Israel responded with air strikes on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. Hamas leader Mohammed Deif claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel as part of "Operation Al-Aqsa Storm." Hamas is a Palestinian militant group and political party that governs the Gaza Strip. It was founded in the late 1980s as an armed resistance against Israeli occupation. The rise of Hamas came after the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made concessions in recognition of Israel's right to exist and dropped armed struggle as a strategy. Hamas opposed the Oslo Peace Accords and carried out suicide bombings to disrupt the peace process. The group gained prominence during the second intifada and won democratic elections in 2006. Israel holds Hamas responsible for attacks from Gaza, and conflicts between the two sides have resulted in significant casualties.</description>

			<title>Hamas-Israel escalation: What we know so far, and whether it could lead to the Third Intifada</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/third-intifada-hamas-israel-escalation-8972498/</link>
			<description>Palestinian fighters infiltrated southern Israel on October 7 and launched thousands of rockets into the country, marking the beginning of a new operation called "Operation al-Aqsa Storm" by Hamas. The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, called on Palestinians to join the offensive in response to what they view as the "crimes of the occupation." Israel quickly retaliated by launching their own rockets into Gaza and declaring a state of war alert. Gun battles between Palestinian fighters and Israeli forces have been reported, along with Israeli personnel being taken captive by Hamas. As a result of the escalation, people on both sides of the Gaza border are fleeing their homes. International concern has been expressed, with the UK, France, and Egypt calling for restraint and the protection of civilians. This conflict is part of a long history of conflict in the region, with the creation of Israel in 1948 and subsequent wars and uprisings in Palestinian territories. Some observers have referred to the latest escalation as the beginning of the "third intifada," which represents a popular uprising against Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza. Tensions between Israel and Palestine have remained high, with continued expansion by Israel and increased terrorist attacks by Palestinian organizations. The rise of far-right ultranationalists in Israel has further contributed to the conflict. 2022 saw the highest number of conflict-related deaths for both Israelis and Palestinians since 2015, and violence has continued to escalate in 2023.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: Caste survey &amp; OBC vote</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-expert-explains-caste-survey-obc-vote-8971768/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The BJP's electoral success has seen a shift in its social base, with the party now having a much wider support base compared to its earlier perception as a party of urban upper castes and upper classes. The party has made significant inroads among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Adivasis, and Dalits while retaining its core support among the upper castes. This expansion among OBCs has come at the cost of both the Congress and regional parties, particularly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The BJP's support among OBCs has been consistently higher than that of the Congress, with the trend intensifying in recent years. The party has also gained greater support from lower backward castes compared to more powerful OBCs. However, upper OBCs remain more committed to regional parties. OBC support has played a crucial role in the BJP's dominance in Indian politics, but a dent in this support could impact its hold on power in the Hindi belt. The recent caste survey in Bihar may become a rallying point for regional parties and increase pressure on the BJP to announce an all-India caste census. However, it is important to note that the OBCs are divided between upper and lower backwards, which influences their voting patterns.</description>

			<title>Russia may pull out of CTBT: How the treaty tried — and failed — to stop nuclear testing</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nuclear-test-ban-treaty-ctbt-8971599/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia may revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to be on equal terms with the United States, not to resume nuclear testing. The CTBT is a multilateral treaty that prohibits all nuclear explosions. While Russia ratified the agreement in 2000, the US has yet to do so. The CTBT was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996 but is still in the ratification stage, with 18 countries yet to ratify it. The treaty came into being due to concerns about the health and environmental effects of nuclear tests. Previous attempts to curb nuclear testing included the Limited Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (LTBT) in 1963 and the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) in 1974. The breakthrough for a comprehensive test ban came after the end of the Cold War, leading to the adoption of the CTBT in 1996. Since then, there have been 10 nuclear tests conducted by various countries, including India, Pakistan, and North Korea. To enter into force, the CTBT requires ratification by 44 specific nuclear technology holder countries, eight of which have yet to ratify it: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and the United States. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged these countries to ratify the treaty.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi has been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize for Peace for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her work to promote human rights and freedom. The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited last year's protests in Iran following the killing of Mahsa Amini, stating that Mohammadi's dedication and work align with the protests' motto "Woman - Life - Freedom." Mohammadi is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Iran's Evin House of Detention on charges including spreading propaganda against the state. She has been involved in political protests since childhood and has focused her activism on women's rights and prisoners' rights in Iran. Mohammadi has been previously recognized with other prominent awards for her work, including the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award and the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. The Nobel Peace Prize has faced criticism for being awarded to politicians and world leaders too soon, unlike other Nobel prizes that are awarded years after the research work is published.</description>

			<title>When can a bill be designated as a ‘money bill’: SC to hear challenge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-challenge-centre-money-bill-key-legislation-8970978/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, announced on Friday that a seven-judge bench will be established to hear a group of pleas challenging the government's use of the money bill route to pass certain legislations. The Chief Justice made this observation while hearing a plea specifically challenging amendments to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The seven-judge bench will examine whether the legislation in question was validly categorized as a money bill or if it was done to avoid scrutiny from the Rajya Sabha. A money bill is defined by Article 110 of the Constitution as a bill that deals with taxation or the appropriation of public funds. It can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and if the Speaker categorizes a bill as a money bill, it does not need to be passed by the Rajya Sabha. The Modi government has introduced several key legislations as money bills, bypassing the Rajya Sabha. The constitutionality of three key legislations, including the PMLA, the Aadhaar Act, and amendments altering service conditions of tribunals, will be examined by the larger bench to determine if they qualified as money bills. The Supreme Court had previously upheld the PMLA and the Aadhaar Act but struck down the tribunal amendments as unconstitutional. The court will reconsider the validity of these laws in light of whether they were rightly categorized as money bills.</description>

			<title>TRAI can’t regulate OTT platforms like Hotstar, says tribunal. This is why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/trai-regulation-hotstar-ott-platforms-meity-8970887/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India's Telecom Appellate Panel, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), has ruled that over-the-top (OTT) platforms like Hotstar are not under the jurisdiction of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) but are instead governed by the Information Technology Rules, 2021. This ruling came in response to a petition by the All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF), which claimed that the free streaming of ICC Cricket World Cup matches on Disney+Hotstar was discriminatory under TRAI regulations. The rejection of AIDCF's plea is significant because it challenges TRAI's attempt to regulate OTT services, which has been opposed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had previously released a draft telecom bill that aimed to classify OTT platforms as telecommunications services, but the IT Ministry argued that such services are not under the DoT's jurisdiction. TRAI has recently started consultations on how to regulate OTT services, revisiting its previous stance against intervention.</description>

			<title>RBI’s status quo and an indication that rate cuts would have to wait: What’s in store for borrowers, depositors</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-mpc-status-quo-rate-impact-8970844/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep key interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive time due to concerns about retail inflation. This means that banks will not raise their lending rates, keeping equated monthly installments (EMIs) on loans steady. The MPC also retained the inflation projection at 5.4% for FY2024 and the GDP growth at 6.50% for FY2024. The decision to pause the rate hike cycle is driven by uncertainty in the overall inflation outlook, including factors such as lower reservoir levels and volatile global food and energy prices. The pause in the Repo rate hike will provide relief to borrowers, as their EMIs will not increase. However, existing and new home buyers should expect continued higher outgo in the form of monthly installments. The RBI remains focused on withdrawing its accommodative stance until all risks to inflation dissipate.</description>

			<title>With the recent Fashion Week and Olympics due in 2024, why bedbugs have caused alarm in Paris</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-bedbugs-have-caused-alarm-in-paris-8970378/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.There have been reports of bedbugs in various public places in Paris, leading to demands for government action. While the Transport Minister claims there is no resurgence of cases, videos of the bugs on social media have caused concern. The increase in bedbugs may be attributed to travel, as they can attach themselves to clothes and objects. Pesticides like DDT used to keep bedbugs away, but their environmental impact led to a decline in their use and the re-emergence of the insects. The upcoming Olympic games and high influx of tourists in Paris are also causing worry. Bedbug bites cause itching and inflammation, with some people experiencing more severe reactions. Technicians are using hot steam to exterminate infested areas, and some individuals are freezing their clothes as a precaution.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A Delhi court has remanded Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member of Rajya Sabha Sanjay Singh in Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody until October 10. The Supreme Court, hearing the bail plea of former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, asked the ED some tough questions before adjourning the matter to October 12. Both Singh and Sisodia are accused of corruption in the formulation and implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22. The allegations arose from a report submitted by Delhi Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar to Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena in July 2022, pointing to alleged procedural lapses in the policy. The report claimed that decisions taken by Sisodia resulted in financial losses and kickbacks received by AAP leaders were used to influence Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa. The ED has alleged that Rs 100 crore kickbacks were used in AAP's 2022 Goa Assembly election campaign.</description>

			<title>Nobel Prize in Literature: In Norwegian laureate Jon Fosse’s ‘slow prose’, shades of Ibsen and Derrida</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/in-norwegian-laureate-jon-fosses-slow-prose-shades-of-ibsen-and-derrida-8970388/</link>
			<description>Norwegian playwright, poet, novelist, essayist, and translator Jon Fosse has won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his focus on the subterranean that connects personal experiences with universal themes. Fosse's work, which includes innovative plays, novels, poetry collections, essays, children's books, and translations, gives voice to the unsayable. While he is known for his plays, Fosse has also gained recognition for his prose. In his acceptance statement, Fosse expressed gratitude and a sense of overwhelm, seeing the award as a recognition of literature that aims to be literature above all else. Fosse's literary career began with the novel "Red Black" in 1983, and he has since written several notable plays and novels. His work is often compared to that of Henrik Ibsen and Jacques Derrida for its modernist concerns and ability to tap into the unspoken.</description>

			<title>Nobel Prize for Literature 2023: Meet the winner, the Norwegian author Jon Fosse</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/nobelliterature-who-is-jon-fosse-8970192/</link>
			<description>Norwegian author Jon Olav Fosse has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature 2023 for his innovative plays and prose that give voice to the unsayable. Fosse's work presents everyday situations that are relatable and expresses powerful human emotions of anxiety and powerlessness in simple terms. He is regarded as a major innovator in contemporary theatre for his ability to evoke man's loss of orientation and provide access to a deeper experience close to divinity. Fosse writes in Norwegian Nynorsk, the least common version of Norwegian, and sees the award as recognition for this language and the movement promoting it. He started writing novels before switching to plays and has become one of Norway's most-performed dramatists. His works have been translated into over 40 languages, and he has written around 40 plays along with novels, short stories, children's books, poetry, and essays. Fosse's writing style is characterized by simple, minimal, searing dialogue similar to Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. His themes explore the absurdity, futility, and power of the human condition, everyday confusions and irresolutions, and the difficulty of forming connections through conversation. While Fosse has been celebrated in Europe for a long time, he is not as popular in English-speaking countries like the UK and US due to difficulties in relating to his themes and connecting with his plays. However, his popularity has been increasing in these geographies in recent years.</description>

			<title>How Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj killed Afzal Khan with his ‘Wagh Nakh’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/shivaji-wagh-nakh-afzal-khan-return-8969833/</link>
			<description>The Cultural Affairs Minister of Maharashtra, Sudhir Mungantiwar, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to bring back Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's wagh nakh to the state. The wagh nakh is a medieval claw-like dagger that was used across the Indian subcontinent. It will be displayed in museums across Maharashtra for a period of three years. The most famous use of the wagh nakh comes from the story of Afzal Khan's killing by Shivaji. The weapon was brought to Britain by James Grant Duff, an East India Company officer, and it is currently housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The return of the wagh nakh is part of a larger trend of former colonies demanding the return of cultural artifacts taken during colonial times.</description>

			<title>Sarakka Central Tribal University approved for Telangana: The figures of Sammakka-Sarakka, their significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/sammakka-sarakka-central-tribal-university-telangana-festival-8969825/</link>
			<description>The Union cabinet has approved the establishment of the Sarakka Central Tribal University in Telangana, India. The university, which will be located in Mulugu district, is estimated to cost Rs 889 crore. The university was initially promised by the Central government as part of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act in 2014, which stated that both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana would receive support to establish a tribal university each. However, the Telangana tribal university faced challenges due to delays in land allocation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently announced that the university would be named after Sammakka-Sarakka, a revered mother-daughter duo among the local tribal community. The duo played a significant role in a 13th-century battle against local rulers who imposed taxes on the Koya people. The region holds a biennial festival called Sammakka Saralamma Jatara, which is considered one of the largest gatherings of tribal people in the world. The festival attracts millions of devotees from various tribal and non-tribal communities across India. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the state government of Telangana provide financial support for the festival, and the Ministry of Tourism has sanctioned funds for the development of a tribal circuit in the area.</description>

			<title>Why Punjab wants to ban the cultivation of PUSA-44 paddy variety</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/punjab-ban-pusa-44-paddy-explained-8969472/</link>
			<description>The Punjab Chief Minister, Bhagwant Singh Mann, has announced that the state will ban the cultivation of the pusa-44 paddy variety from next year. This variety was widely grown in Punjab and covered 70 to 80 percent of the state's total area under paddy cultivation. Farmers were satisfied with its high yield, but the agriculture department and Punjab Agricultural University discouraged its cultivation due to declining groundwater levels. The government aims to conserve one month of irrigation water by banning the variety, as well as address issues such as stubble burning and air pollution. Pusa-44 has an extended maturity period, leading to a narrow window for stubble disposal between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing. The variety is grown extensively in several districts of Punjab, where stubble-burning incidents are high. The ban is expected to have an impact on farmers' income, as pusa-44 yields more than other varieties.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Scientists have discovered that very small particles, known as nanoparticles, behave differently from larger particles of the same element. This deviant behavior arises due to the emergence of quantum effects at the sub-atomic level. Nanoparticles with special properties, called quantum dots, have become an integral part of modern appliances and have applications in biochemistry and medicine. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Alexei Ekimov, Louis Brus, and Moungi Bawendi for their groundbreaking research on nanoparticles. These particles interact with light in different ways depending on their size, leading to variations in color and other properties. Efficient methods to produce nanoparticles with precise desired properties have been developed by Bawendi.</description>

			<title>Delhi HC passes ‘dynamic injunction’ against illegal ICC World Cup broadcast: What this means, what was the case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/delhi-hc-what-is-dynamic-injunction-8968692/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has issued a "dynamic injunction" to prevent nine websites from illegally broadcasting the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 matches. The court granted this injunction to protect the revenues of Star India, the official broadcaster of the World Cup, as rogue websites that engage in piracy are likely to illegally broadcast the matches. Dynamic injunctions are granted before copyrighted works are publicly released or created to prevent irreparable loss due to online piracy. The Delhi High Court has previously passed similar injunctions to protect copyrighted works, including films and series. Star India cited previous cases and its exclusive rights acquired from the ICC to seek the injunction. The court's ruling falls under Section 37 of the 1957 Copyright Act, which grants broadcasting organizations special rights and specifies actions that constitute infringement. Exceptions to copyright infringement are included under Section 39 if the reproduction can be considered fair dealing.</description>

			<title>Glacial lake outburst flood kills 14 in Sikkim, 102 people missing: What is GLOF, and why does it happen?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/glacial-lake-outburst-flood-glof-sikkim-8968562/</link>
			<description>Fourteen people have been killed and 102 are missing in Sikkim, India, after the South Lhonak Lake burst due to heavy rains. The release of water caused flooding in downstream areas, including four districts. Glacial lakes like South Lhonak Lake are dangerous because they are mostly dammed by unstable ice or sediment, and if the boundary breaks, it can cause flooding. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) can be triggered by earthquakes, heavy rains, or ice avalanches. Rising global temperatures have led to the rapid melting of glaciers in Sikkim Himalayan, resulting in the expansion of glacial lakes. There are currently over 300 glacial lakes in Sikkim Himalayan, with 10 identified as vulnerable to outburst floods. South Lhonak Lake has been under observation for years due to its significant increase in size. In 2016, authorities syphoned off water from the lake to mitigate the risk of a GLOF.</description>

			<title>Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2023: What exactly have the three scientists been honoured for?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-for-2023-what-have-the-three-done-8968403/</link>
			<description>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2023 has been awarded to Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus, and Alexei Ekimov for their discovery and synthesis of quantum dots. Quantum dots are small particles of nanotechnology that have various applications, including in televisions, LED lamps, and guiding surgeons during tumor removal. While scientists had theorized about the existence of these particles, the three laureates were able to create high-quality quantum dots that could be practically used. Ekimov was the first to make notable discoveries but his research was not accessible beyond the Iron Curtain. Ekimov and Brus independently observed how the size of particles affected their absorption of light, leading to the realization that particle size alters characteristics and behavior. Bawendi further improved the creation of quantum dots using different methods. Quantum dots are now utilized in computer and television screens, LED lamps, biochemistry, and medicine.</description>

			<title>ED summons Ranbir Kapoor: What is the Mahadev online betting racket?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ed-ranbir-kapoor-mahadev-online-betting-racket-8968193/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Actor Ranbir Kapoor has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Mahadev online betting case. The ED alleges that Kapoor promoted an illegal online betting and gaming platform. Mahadev Online Book is accused of providing platforms for illegal betting in various live games, including poker, card games, cricket, badminton, tennis, football, and even elections in India. The main promoters of the platform are based in Dubai and may have made around Rs 5,000 crores through the app. The app operates by advertising contact numbers on websites and luring people to play for profits. Users are provided with separate contact numbers for depositing money and encashing accumulated points. The operations involve creating user IDs, distributing credentials, and collecting money through benami accounts. The app's reach among users increased during the pandemic. The main promoters of Mahadev Online Book are Sourabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal from Bhilai, who are currently based in Dubai. They allegedly control 80% of the profits made through the app. In August, the ED arrested four individuals who were involved in facilitating illegal funds movement and protecting the racket from police action. ASI Chandra Bhushan Verma is accused of playing a major role in protecting the main accused and collecting bribes amounting to Rs 65 crore. The bribes were allegedly passed on to additional superintendents of police and senior IPS officers in Chhattisgarh. The ED claims that ASI Verma was the link between the main promoters in Dubai and those in power in the Chhattisgarh government. The Dammani brothers facilitated hawala movement of funds generated from the illegal business using their jewellery shop and petrol pump. Satish Chandrakar got raids carried out on two branches of Mahadev book and was given a panel/branch to run for his own benefit. The Chhattisgarh Police has registered 75 FIRs and arrested 429 individuals in connection with the case. They have seized laptops, mobile phones, betting materials, and luxury cars worth about Rs 2.50 crore. Over 3,033 bank accounts were used in the racket, with 1,035 accounts frozen so far. FIRs have also been registered against the app operators in other states like Andhra Pradesh.</description>

			<title>Why Punjab is burdened with debt of Rs 3.27 lakh crore</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/punjab-burdened-debt-rs-3-27-lakh-crore-8967929/</link>
			<description>Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has written a letter to Governor Banwarilal Purohit, requesting a five-year moratorium on the state's growing debt. Punjab's debt is estimated to reach Rs 3.27 lakh crore by the end of this fiscal year. The government has already spent a significant amount on debt servicing, with 20% of the annual budget going towards loan repayments. If the situation does not improve, Punjab's debt could exceed Rs 4 lakh crore in two years. The state's debt has multiplied nearly ten times over the past twenty years, largely due to "freebies" provided by the government, such as power subsidies. Economists suggest that a moratorium on debt repayment and a special package from the central government could help revive Punjab's economy and attract private investment. It is crucial for Punjab to change its course promptly to avoid becoming a "debt-trapped" state and to benefit the Indian economy as a whole.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/kevin-mccarthy-us-house-speaker-removed-8968080/</link>
			<description>Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, was ousted by a group of Republican leaders in a no-confidence vote. This is the first time a House Speaker has lost such a vote. McCarthy had the support of most Republicans but lost eight votes from his own party. The motion to remove him was brought by Matt Gaetz, a far-right Republican representative, who criticized McCarthy for mishandling government spending and budget fights. McCarthy's close relationship with former President Donald Trump and his impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden also contributed to his ouster. Patrick T McHenry, a Republican representative from North Carolina, has temporarily replaced McCarthy as acting Speaker. The path to electing a new Speaker remains uncertain due to deep polarization within the House and the Republican party.</description>

			<title>What UAPA sections have been invoked against NewsClick</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-uapa-sections-have-been-invoked-against-newsclick-8967236/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Police has sealed the office of news portal NewsClick, accusing it of receiving money for pro-China propaganda. The police have filed an FIR against the portal under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law. The main allegation is that NewsClick received illegal funding from China through the United States. The FIR includes various sections of the UAPA, including Section 16, which deals with punishment for terrorist acts. This section defines "terrorist act" as any act that threatens India's unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty or strikes terror in the people. Other provisions invoked against NewsClick include unlawful activities, raising funds for terrorist acts, conspiracy, and offences by companies and trusts. The UAPA gives the state more powers compared to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by relaxing timelines for filing chargesheets and imposing stringent conditions for bail. The Supreme Court has defined prima facie narrowly in relation to denying bail under the UAPA, stating that courts must only consider whether a prima facie case can be made out and not analyze evidence or circumstances. Section 43D(5) of the UAPA states that a person accused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV and VI of the Act cannot be released on bail unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to be heard and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accusation is prima facie true.</description>

			<title>Why China used a torn painting as a symbol of ‘hope for reunification’ with Taiwan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-china-used-a-torn-painting-as-a-symbol-of-hope-for-reunification-with-taiwan-8967024/</link>
			<description>On China's National Day, the Chinese military released an animated short film that depicted two pieces of a torn historical scroll painting, one kept in China and the other in Taiwan, joining together. The film symbolized the shared cultural heritage and hope for reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. China claims Taiwan as its territory and has increased its military presence around the island in recent years. President Xi Jinping has even stated that Beijing is ready to take Taiwan by force if necessary. The painting in question is called "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains," created by artist Huang Gongwang in the 14th century. It is considered a great classical work and was passed down to art collectors over time. Attempts were made to restore it, but it became separated into two parts. One part is now in the collection of the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in China, while the other is in Taipei, Taiwan. The animated film released by the Chinese military features two elves representing the two pieces of the painting, magically making it whole again at the end of the movie. China claims that Taiwan was part of its territory until Japan occupied it after a war in 1895. After World War II, a civil war between the Communists and Nationalists led to both sides claiming to be the "official" China. However, as China's economy grew and opened up to the world, more countries recognized it as China officially, maintaining only informal relations with Taiwan. Currently, only 13 countries have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) winning elections in 2004 brought a change as they have been wary of China's control over Taiwan. President Xi Jinping's increasing power since 2013 has also led to heightened rhetoric on Taiwan from China. The Chinese military's release of a film showing the reunification of the painting is seen as part of its larger aims related to Taiwan.

			<title>Nobel Prize in Physics 2023: What the three scientists have been awarded for</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/nobel-prize-in-physics-2023-what-for-8966824/</link>
			<description>Three scientists, Anne L'Huillier, Pierre Agostini, and Ferenc Krausz, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in making it easier to observe electrons. They have developed a way to create extremely short pulses of light, lasting only attoseconds, which allows for the measurement of rapid electron processes. This breakthrough has potential applications in diagnosing diseases and developing more efficient electronic gadgets. L'Huillier, Agostini, and Krausz's work has brought humanity closer to studying the movement of electrons and understanding mechanisms governed by them. This could be used to study molecular-level changes in blood for disease identification and improve electronic device efficiency.</description>

			<title>Why Google producing its Chromebook laptops in India is significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/google-chromebook-laptops-india-production-8966416/</link>
			<description>Google has partnered with HP to start manufacturing its Chromebook laptops in India, boosting the country's electronics manufacturing ambitions. The move comes as companies worldwide seek to diversify their supply chains amid geopolitical uncertainties. The Chromebooks will be produced at HP's Flex facility near Chennai and will cater to the demand for affordable PCs in India, particularly in the education sector. This development aligns with India's goal of becoming a trusted partner in global supply chains and reducing its dependence on imports from China. The government has also introduced an import management system to track imports of electronic hardware and encourage companies to source from "trusted sources."</description>

			<title>An expert explains: Why has the BJP been shying away from an all-India caste-based census?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-bjp-does-not-want-caste-based-census-8965780/</link>
			<description>The BJP's success in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections was partly due to its support among Other Backward Castes (OBCs). However, despite demands from opposition parties, the BJP-led government is hesitant about conducting a caste-based census. The implementation of the Mandal Commission report in the 1990s changed electoral politics in India, leading to the rise of regional parties. The BJP had to counter this with its Hindutva politics. While the BJP gained OBC support in the 2019 elections, it does not maintain the same level of support during state government elections. The BJP has been more successful in mobilizing lower OBC votes compared to dominant OBCs in North India. The reluctance to conduct a caste census may be due to fears that it could give regional parties leverage to reshape OBC quotas and challenge the BJP's dominance.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking: How employment and consumer sentiments vary with caste and religion in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-employment-consumer-sentiments-caste-religion-india-8965910/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar government has released details about the state's caste survey, which provides information on how the population is divided into different caste categories. The survey's findings could have significant political implications, as caste often plays a role in determining economic fortunes in India. This article focuses on caste-wise data related to employment and consumer sentiments sourced from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy's Economic Outlook. The data shows that the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) has fallen for each caste, with the lowest LFPR among upper castes. OBCs and SCs have experienced the biggest fall in LFPR since 2016. The Unemployment Rate (UER) remains high for all caste groups except OBCs, but this is due to a decline in LFPR rather than an increase in job opportunities. The Employment Rate (ER) has also fallen for every caste group, with the largest drop seen among OBCs and SCs. The article also mentions that the survey looked at caste across religious identities and highlights the falling employment rate among Hindus compared to other recognized religions. Additionally, it discusses consumer sentiments, which have decreased for almost all caste groups since 2016-17, with the lowest levels observed among OBCs and intermediate castes aspiring to be included in the OBC category. The article concludes by asking readers for their views on whether a caste survey should be conducted nationwide and if India would benefit from it.</description>

			<title>Four takeaways from Bihar caste survey: On its significance, possible impact on elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/nitish-kumar-govt-4-takeaways-from-bihar-caste-survey-8965735/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar government has released the results of its survey on castes in the state, revealing that Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) make up more than 63% of the population. The "unreserved" category of forward castes accounts for about 15.5%. This is the first release of nationwide caste data since 1931. The EBCs are the largest social group in Bihar, comprising 36.01% of the population, followed by OBCs at 27.12% and Scheduled Castes at 19.65%. Scheduled Tribes only make up 1.68% of the population. The survey was conducted in two phases, with over 3 lakh people going door-to-door to collect data on caste, religion, and economic status. The findings could have political implications, potentially leading to increased demands for reservation and a quota within a quota for EBCs. It may also reopen debates on the 50% ceiling on reservation imposed by the Supreme Court.</description>

			<title>Why free speech is not a priority in Southeast Asia</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/free-speech-not-priority-in-southeast-asia-8965588/</link>
			<description>Southeast Asian countries have some of the worst press freedom and media rights in the world, according to a report by the Pew Research Center. Governments in the region, ranging from communist states to tentative democracies, tend to limit free speech in order to protect national "harmony." This is reflected in global press freedom rankings, with Vietnam ranked third worst in the world. The deterioration of free speech internationally is attributed to increased aggression from authorities and growing animosity towards journalists on social media. A majority of respondents in three out of four Southeast Asian states agree that national harmony should come before free speech, although younger and more educated individuals are more likely to support the ability to criticize governments and prioritize free speech. Differences based on religion were also found, with Thai Muslims more likely than Thai Buddhists to prioritize harmony over free speech. Critics argue that Southeast Asia's strict laws on hate speech and other legislation do not actually defend social harmony in practice.</description>

			<title>Nobel Prize in Medicine 2023: How Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman’s work helped develop Covid vaccines</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/nobel-prize-in-medicine-2023-work-helped-develop-covid-vaccines-8965450/</link>
			<description>The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman for their work on mRNA vaccines against Covid-19. Their groundbreaking findings have revolutionized our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system, leading to the rapid development of vaccines during the pandemic. Traditional vaccines rely on introducing weakened or dead viruses into the body, but mRNA technology uses messenger RNA to deliver instructions to cells to produce the necessary proteins to fight a specific virus. Kariko and Weissman discovered that lab-grown mRNA was recognized as foreign by dendritic cells, triggering an inflammatory response. By modifying the bases in the mRNA, they were able to significantly reduce this response. Their work laid the foundation for the development of mRNA vaccines by companies like Moderna and Pfizer. Kariko is a Hungarian scientist who has worked at various institutions, including BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals, while Weissman is an American researcher based at the University of Pennsylvania.</description>

			<title>Bihar caste survey data out: Why it was legally challenged — and why the court found it ‘perfectly valid’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/bihar-caste-survey-legal-challenged-8965424/</link>
			<description>The Bihar caste survey conducted by the state government has revealed that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) make up more than 63% of the population of Bihar. This is in contrast to the 27% reservation that the OBC population receives in government jobs and educational institutions. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is expected to use this data for political gain both at the state and national level. 

The caste survey faced challenges during its second phase, with the Patna High Court initially staying the survey in May. However, the court later deemed the survey to be valid. The grounds for the challenge included claims that the survey violated citizens' right to privacy and that the state did not have the power to conduct such a survey. The court ruled that permissible restrictions can be imposed on the right to privacy in the state's legitimate interests, and it accepted the Bihar government's assurance of data security. The court clarified that the survey aimed to identify backward classes for development schemes, not to discriminate against individuals or groups. 

The competence of the state government to conduct the survey was also questioned, with petitioners arguing that only the Union government has the power to conduct a census. The Bihar government argued that a caste census was previously conducted by the Union government in 2011, and that it had the power to collect statistics under the concurrent list. The court ruled that the state's actions were valid and within its competence, as it aimed to provide development with justice and did not violate privacy rights.

Overall, the Patna High Court upheld the validity of the Bihar caste survey, stating that it serves a compelling public interest and is in line with the state's legitimate interests.</description>

			<title>Was Mahatma Gandhi racist?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/was-mahatma-gandhi-racist-8965363/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article explores the complex legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, a prominent figure in India's fight for freedom. While Gandhi is widely admired and studied for his non-violent methods of resistance, there has been increasing scrutiny of his views on race. Critics argue that his writings during his time in South Africa demonstrate a racist mindset. Gandhi's discomfort with Indians being treated similarly to black South Africans is apparent in his writings, where he derogatorily refers to black people as "kaffirs." However, African leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. have praised Gandhi's role in mobilizing resistance against British rule. Some historians have also criticized Gandhi for excluding Africans from the struggle for equality and maintaining a similar attitude towards them as the British. Despite these criticisms, Gandhi's grandson Rajmohan Gandhi argues that while his grandfather had his flaws, he was ahead of his time in terms of racial equality and paved the way for the fight for black rights.</description>

			<title>Four things to know about Lal Bahadur Shastri: From ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ to resignation over railway accident</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/lal-bahadur-shastri-anniversary-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-railway-tashkent-8965233/</link>
			<description>October 2 is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, two iconic Indian leaders who played a role in the freedom struggle and nation-building. Shastri, who came from humble origins in Uttar Pradesh, dedicated his youth to India's struggle for independence. After independence, he served in the UP state government and the central government before becoming Prime Minister in 1964. Shastri's rise from a humble background is notable, as he displayed social consciousness at an early age and dropped his birthname "Varma" to oppose caste differences. He took responsibility for a train accident during his tenure as Union Minister for Railways and Transport, resigning twice to accept moral responsibility. This increased his moral stature nationally and set a new precedent for political conduct. Shastri also played a crucial role in solving disputes over the government's official language policy. As Prime Minister, he focused on addressing economic stagnation, food production, and defense issues. He famously gave the nation the slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" (Hail the soldier, hail the farmer) to emphasize the importance of both sectors. During his tenure, India faced the 1965 war with Pakistan, which led to the signing of the Tashkent Declaration for long-term peace between the two nations. However, Shastri passed away suddenly due to a heart attack the day after signing the declaration. Speculation arose about his death, but based on available evidence, it is believed that he died of a heart attack without any external intervention.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Renowned agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan, known as the "Father of the Green Revolution," passed away on September 28. Swaminathan was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's call for self-sufficiency and self-rule in India. He believed in achieving "zero hunger" and wrote about it in a booklet titled "Zero Hunger is Possible." Swaminathan highlighted the importance of technology, services, and public policy in achieving food security. He also emphasized the need for nutrition-sensitive farming systems and promoting naturally bio-fortified foods. However, criticisms of the Green Revolution include its focus on water-intensive crops like wheat and rice. Swaminathan advocated for providing adequate nutrition sustainably for all.</description>

			<title>RJD leader says quota will help women with ‘bob cut hair’: Why socialist parties have used ‘parkati mahilayein’ to oppose Bill</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/rjd-leader-bob-cut-hair-parkati-mahilayein-womens-reservation-bill-8964269/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui faced backlash after making derogatory comments about women with lipstick and bob-cut hair potentially taking advantage of the women's reservation Bill. Siddiqui later apologized, stating that he used the reference to explain his point to a rural audience. This remark echoes a similar comment made by JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav in 1997. The opposition to the women's reservation Bill from parties like RJD, Samajwadi Party, and JD(U) stems from concerns that reserved seats will go to upper caste and upper class women, reducing representation for disadvantaged classes. Critics argue that these women may not have their own voice and will further the agenda of dominant classes. However, parties like JD(U) have softened their stance and now support the Bill, demanding a quota for women from disadvantaged communities within the 33% quota for women. The AIMIM remains opposed to the Bill, highlighting the minimal representation of OBC and Muslim women in Parliament.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: In alarm over Conocarpus trees, echo of faulty policies on invasive exotics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/expert-explains-gujarat-conocarpus-trees-invasive-plants-8964032/</link>
			<description>Concerns have been raised over the management of the invasive Conocarpus species of trees in India, leading to bans in Gujarat and Telangana. This has drawn attention to the selection of species in urban landscaping projects, which often favor exotic species for beautification. Many previously introduced species for greening or ornamental purposes have become invasive, driving native species to extinction and incurring significant costs for their management. The two species of Conocarpus trees, which are easily propagated in nurseries, have caused pollen allergies and respiratory problems. The proliferation of non-native species is facilitated by their lack of pests or pathogens in new habitats and minimal aftercare requirements. It is recommended that landscape managers choose native species for long-term sustainability and refer to existing information on these species before large-scale use. Monitoring the import and use of horticultural plants is necessary to protect native species, ecosystems, and public health. Clear guidelines are needed for landscape planners and land managers in mega greening projects, as urban greens contribute significantly to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. India's climate commitments require a focus on nature-based solutions, such as sustainable biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban areas.</description>

			<title>Why IIT Bombay’s liberal arts programme for engineering undergrads has not found takers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/iit-bombays-no-takers-8963985/</link>
			<description>IIT Bombay's liberal arts program, called LASE, has struggled to attract students since its launch in 2021. The program aimed to give undergraduate students the opportunity to customize their degree according to their interests. However, factors such as the perception of liberal arts education in an IIT and concerns about the utility of the Bachelor of Science degree offered by the program have hindered its success. LASE allows students to take courses from any department at IIT Bombay, providing greater flexibility for those interested in disciplines outside of engineering. Despite efforts to attract applicants, only a few students have enrolled in the program in the past two years, falling short of the minimum number required to run any course. Reasons for low interest include apprehensions about a BS degree instead of a traditional BTech degree and risk aversion towards something unfamiliar. The program was conceived as an alternative to address the lack of interest among students in their engineering streams and align with the multidisciplinary approach advocated by the New Education Policy. While branch changes at IIT Bombay will be discontinued from next year onwards, LASE will continue to be offered as an option for students.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/nashik-onion-traders-strike-prices-explained-8963884/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Onion traders and commission agents in Nashik, Maharashtra, have decided to continue their ongoing strike over recently imposed export duties on onions and other related issues. The strike began on September 21 and will continue until their demands are met and the government rescinds the duty. Traders are protesting against the 40% export duty and want government agencies to not sell onions procured from farmers in wholesale markets. They also demand a reduction in market cess levied by wholesale markets. The government argues that the export duty is necessary to control onion exports and ensure enough availability in domestic markets due to low stock levels caused by untimely rain and hailstorms earlier this year. The immediate effect of the strike is limited to Nashik district, as other states are supplying onions to retail markets. However, exports have come to a halt and price rises may occur until the new crop arrives in November.</description>

			<title>The story of Mahatma Gandhi’s portrait on Indian banknotes</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/story-mahatma-gandhi-portrait-indian-banknotes-8963152/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi on Indian official currency notes. While many prominent photographers captured images of Gandhi throughout his life, the most widely circulated image of him is the one on the currency notes. The portrait on the notes is a cut-out of a photograph taken in 1946 where Gandhi is seen standing with British politician Lord Frederick William Pethick-Lawrence. The identity of the photographer and the person who selected the photo remain unknown.

The article explains that it wasn't until 1996, many decades after India gained independence in 1947, that Gandhi became a permanent feature on all legal banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI's Department of Currency Management designs the rupee notes and needs approval from the central bank and the union government.

The article mentions that Gandhi first appeared on Indian currency in 1969, with a special series issued to commemorate his 100th birth anniversary. In October 1987, a series of 500-rupee currency notes featuring Gandhi was launched. Before independent India, the RBI continued to issue notes from the colonial period featuring King George VI. The design of the 1-rupee note was changed in 1949 to replace King George VI with the lion capital of Ashoka pillar at Sarnath.

Over the years, new designs and motifs were introduced on the banknotes to represent different aspects of India. In the 1990s, the RBI introduced the 'Mahatma Gandhi series' to replace the former Ashoka pillar banknotes. Various security features were also added to combat counterfeiting. In 2016, the 'Mahatma Gandhi new series' of banknotes was announced, with additional security features and the inclusion of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan logo on the back of the notes.

The article concludes by mentioning suggestions made to include other personalities on currency notes, such as Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi. However, the RBI committee decided that Mahatma Gandhi best represents the ethos of India and rejected the suggestions to replace his portrait with any other leader.

Overall, the article provides insight into the history and significance of Mahatma Gandhi's portrait on Indian currency notes and discusses the various changes made to the designs over time.</description>

			<title>Why Vivek Ramaswamy wants to end birthright citizenship in the US</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vivek-ramaswamy-birthright-citizenship-us-8963079/</link>
			<description>Indian-American presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has stated that he would end birthright citizenship in the US if elected, echoing a proposal made by former President Donald Trump in 2015. Ramaswamy argues that children of undocumented immigrants should not be granted citizenship as their parents broke the law to be in the country. The debate over birthright citizenship centers around the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to individuals born in the US. The amendment was introduced in 1858 to overturn a Supreme Court ruling that denied African Americans citizenship rights. It wasn't until 1898, in the case of 'United States v. Wong Kim Ark,' that the Supreme Court confirmed birthright citizenship for most people born in the US. Proponents of ending birthright citizenship argue that it should not apply to children of illegal immigrants and question whether they are subject to US jurisdiction. Supporters of birthright citizenship believe that any person in the US is subject to US laws regardless of immigration status and argue against racial undertones in the debate. Birthright citizenship remains a recurring topic in American politics, with Trump previously proposing to abolish it but facing constitutional barriers.</description>

			<title>Why has Punjab Congress MLA Sukhpal Khaira been arrested?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/punjab-cong-mla-sukhpal-khaira-arrested-8962811/</link>
			<description>Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira was arrested by Fazilka Police on September 28 based on a report from a Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigating a 2015 case. The case was related to the seizure of drugs, gold biscuits, and weapons from Gurdev Singh and his associates, who were eventually convicted. During the investigation, Khaira's name came up as he had spoken with Gurdev Singh multiple times before the case was lodged. Khaira was previously arrested in a money laundering case in November 2021 but was granted bail ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls in 2022. In February 2023, the Supreme Court quashed summon orders against Khaira, but a fresh SIT was formed in April 2023 to investigate the case again. Khaira has also faced other cases, including forgery and defamation charges. He has had a political career spanning different parties, including Congress and AAP. The arrest has been criticized by Congress and condemned by Shiromani Akali Dal, while AAP stated that there is enough evidence for Khaira's arrest.</description>

			<title>How did Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping get so close, and what are they trying to achieve?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-get-close-8962748/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving relationship between China and Russia and their joint mission to reshape the world. It traces the origins of their partnership, which began during the end of the Cold War when China faced sanctions and Russia provided military technology assistance. Over time, their relationship grew stronger, with Russia's abundance of natural resources complementing China's need for capital and technology.

The article highlights key moments, such as Vladimir Putin's speech at the Munich Security Conference in 2007, where he criticized the enlargement of NATO and expressed concerns about Russia's security. Putin's obsession with maintaining control over Ukraine is also discussed, which eventually led to the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

On the other hand, Xi Jinping's rise to power in China brought a renewed sense of national rejuvenation and ambitious goals for China to become the world's leading power by 2049. The article notes China's assertiveness in various areas, including cracking down on freedoms in Hong Kong, the Belt and Road infrastructure project, and threats to seize Taiwan.

The convergence of Xi's and Putin's journeys is highlighted, as both leaders coordinate in international arenas to counter perceived Western containment and regime change efforts. The Ukraine war has brought China and Russia even closer, with China providing essential support to Russia without crossing red lines that could trigger Western sanctions.

While the China-Russia relationship is not a formal military alliance like NATO, the article suggests that closer military coordination between the two powers could pose challenges for US defense planners, especially if Russia escalates in Ukraine while China makes a move on Taiwan.

The article concludes by discussing the role China may play in any potential endgame to the Ukraine war and highlights China's opposition to NATO expansion. Putin, confident in his position, is betting on the resilience of his joint mission with Xi Jinping in contrast to Western support for Ukraine.</description>

			<title>Four reasons why bank credit growth is expected to moderate in FY24</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/bank-credit-growth-moderate-fy24-8962582/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.According to domestic rating agency Crisil Ratings, the growth of credit in the banking sector is expected to be lower at 13-13.5% in fiscal year 2023-24. This projection comes after a strong credit growth of 15.9% in fiscal year 2022-23, driven by a broad-based economic recovery, healthier balance sheets, and a lower base from the previous two fiscal years.

However, this estimate excludes the impact of the merger between HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank in fiscal year 2024. Care Ratings also projected a growth rate of 13-13.5% for bank credit in fiscal year 2024, excluding the merger's impact.

As of September 8, 2023, bank credit grew by 19.81% on a year-on-year basis to Rs 150.38 lakh crore, including the impact of the merger. Excluding the merger's impact, bank credit grew by 15.08%. Year-to-date, bank credit (including the merger) has risen by 8.6% as of September 8.

In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, personal loans (housing and non-housing) recorded some deceleration but continued to grow above the overall credit growth. Non-food credit grew by 15% in August, while personal loans growth decelerated to 18.3% due to moderation in credit to housing.

Credit growth to the industry registered a growth of 6.1%, while credit to the services sector accelerated to 20.7% primarily due to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and commercial real estate.

Crisil attributes the moderation in bank credit growth to four factors. First, GDP growth is expected to decline to 6% in fiscal year 2023-24, impacting overall credit growth. Second, inflation is projected to ease due to the softening of commodity prices, reducing the demand for working capital loans. Third, the substitution of debt capital markets has decreased, impacting wholesale credit growth. Finally, the high-base effect from strong credit growth in fiscal year 2023 will contribute to lower bank credit growth this fiscal year.

Crisil expects bank credit growth to improve to 13.5-14% in fiscal year 2024-25 as economic growth picks up. Retail credit is expected to remain a key growth driver, expanding steadily at 19-20% each fiscal year.

The revival of private industrial capex is slower than expected, but capex announcements and higher capacity utilization levels suggest a ground-level pickup in capex next fiscal. On the services side, demand from non-banks is expected to support corporate credit growth. In the MSME segment, credit demand is expected to be steady due to the government's initiatives and the productivity-linked incentive scheme. Home loan demand is expected to be steady, and unsecured loans are expected to grow faster due to digitalization and borrowing for discretionary spending.</description>

			<title>Pakistan bomb blast: Why Balochistan remains a problem province for the country</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-bomb-blast-why-balochistan-remains-a-problem-province-for-pak-8962184/</link>
			<description>A suicide attack in Mastung district of Pakistan's Balochistan province killed at least 53 people and injured over 70 others. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Tehreek-e-Taliban distanced themselves from it. This is the deadliest terror attack in Pakistan since 2018. Balochistan, the largest Pakistani province, has been the site of insurgencies and a Baloch nationalist movement since 1948. The region's ethnic differences, economic alienation, and political grievances contribute to the ongoing conflict. Baloch nationalists argue that the Baloch people do not benefit from the province's natural resources, and they have targeted Chinese officials involved in projects like the China-backed Gwadar Port. The Pakistani government blames foreign actors for destabilizing the region.</description>

			<title>UK’s beloved Sycamore Gap cut down: The tree and its significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/britain-sycamore-gap-tree-cut-down-8962114/</link>
			<description>A 300-year-old sycamore tree in England, located in a gap in the Hadrian Wall, was deliberately cut down by a teenage boy. The motive behind the act is unclear. The tree was a popular spot for visitors and had cultural significance, being featured in films and used for special occasions. Sycamore trees can grow up to 35 meters tall and live for up to 400 years. They were introduced to the UK by the Romans or during the Tudor era and have since become common, sometimes at the expense of native species. The Hadrian Wall is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site called the 'Frontiers of the Roman Empire'.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukrainian-nazi-praised-canada-8962078/</link>
			<description>The Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, Anthony Rota, resigned from his position after praising a Ukrainian veteran, Yaroslav Hunka, who was revealed to have fought for a Nazi military unit during World War II. Hunka received a standing ovation in Canada's parliament during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hunka was part of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, which was declared a criminal organization by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946. Hunka's involvement in the unit's atrocities is not known. The controversy has brought attention to allegations that the Canadian government has been lenient in prosecuting Nazi war criminals and collaborators. In 1950, Canada allowed Ukrainian soldiers who fought against the Soviet Union to immigrate, resulting in over 1,880 members of the 14th Waffen SS unit settling in Canada. However, charges of war crimes against the unit members were never substantiated.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-fraud-case-explained-8961677/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Former US President Donald Trump has been ruled to have committed fraud by misrepresenting his wealth, according to a New York judge. The case was initiated by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused Trump of deceiving banks, insurers, and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth. The ruling could result in Trump losing major properties, including the iconic Trump Towers in Manhattan. James aims to secure at least $250 million in penalties from Trump and a ban against him and his sons from running businesses in New York. Trump has sued the judge and sought to have the case thrown out, but these appeals have been rejected. The trial will begin next week, and further evidence will be presented. Despite facing multiple lawsuits and indictments, Trump remains a frontrunner among Republican nominees for the 2024 elections.</description>

			<title>As illicit trade booms, seizure mount: 3.5 tonnes of gold, 18 crore cigarette sticks and 90 tonnes of heroin caught in FY23</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/illicit-trade-seizures-gold-cigarette-heroin-report-ficci-8961370/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Around 3.5 tonnes of gold, 18 crore cigarette sticks, 140 metric tonnes of red sanders, and 90 tonnes of heroin were seized along with other drugs in India during the last financial year. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs Chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal emphasized the need to tackle issues such as counterfeiting, smuggling, and tax evasion to safeguard India's economic stability. A report by FICCI Cascade titled 'Hidden Streams' revealed that India has a higher overall score of 6.3 in the illegal economy compared to the average score of 5 in 122 other countries. While India has a lower score of 4.3 in the organized crime segment, the efficacy of criminal networks in the country enables them to generate substantial illicit financial flows despite their smaller numbers. The report also highlighted the economic impact of violence in India, costing around $1170 billion in 2021, approximately 6% of the country's GDP. The presence of criminal networks involved in drug and human trafficking, illegal trade in wildlife products, and other illicit activities contributes to the higher score of 6 for India in terms of the total illegal economy. The report also mentioned the increase in the illicit drug trade in India, with a higher prevalence of cannabis, synthetic drugs, and heroin compared to other countries.</description>

			<title>Maldives elections on September 30: Why India is watching closely</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/maldives-elections-on-september-30-why-india-is-watching-closely-8960839/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Maldives will hold a runoff election this Saturday since no candidate received more than 50% of the votes in the first round. The electoral system in the Maldives requires the winner to secure a majority of votes. In the first round, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih received 39% of the votes, while opposition candidate Mohamed Muizzu received 46%. The runoff will be between these two candidates.

Maldives has followed an Executive Presidency system since 1968, with a transition to a multi-party system in 2008. No incumbent President has been re-elected since then. India has had a mixed experience with Maldives politics, with closer ties during President Solih's government. India has provided assistance in various areas, including vaccines, infrastructure development, and debt relief.

The relationship between India and Maldives has strengthened over the years, and India has undertaken several projects in Maldives. The defense ties between the two countries have also grown, with India providing training and equipment to the Maldivian defense and security personnel.

The current political landscape in the Maldives sees President Solih facing a challenge from opposition candidate Muizzu, who is seen as a proxy of former President Abdulla Yameen. Muizzu has made statements that have raised concerns in India, including threats to terminate agreements with foreign countries and expel foreign companies if they are not beneficial to Maldives.

Solih's campaign has focused on his government's achievements, but he is also facing anti-incumbency sentiment. The voter turnout in the first round was relatively low compared to previous elections.

The outcome of the runoff election will depend on the support of smaller parties, including Nasheed's The Democrats. India will be closely watching the election as President Solih trails in the first round.</description>

			<title>Gujarat bans Conocarpus plants: Which other states stopped cultivating some trees, and why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/gujarat-conocarpus-other-states-ban-trees-8960608/</link>
			<description>The Gujarat government has banned the planting of ornamental conocarpus trees in forest or non-forest areas due to their adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The fast-growing exotic mangrove species had been popular in increasing green cover in Gujarat. Telangana had also previously banned this plant species. Other non-indigenous trees, such as vilayati kikar in Delhi and eucalyptus in Kerala, have also faced restrictions due to their negative effects on the local environment and flora and fauna. The vilayati kikar in Delhi had taken over the central ridge, killing native trees and fauna, while also depleting the water table. Kerala stopped cultivating acacia and eucalyptus in forest tracts due to their impact on fodder availability and forest habitats.</description>

			<description>NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has spent seven years collecting and returning samples from the asteroid Bennu. After mapping the asteroid and collecting about 250 grams of rock, the spacecraft is now returning to Earth. The samples will be released over the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah and then transferred to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. OSIRIS-REx will then continue its journey to the asteroid Apophis. Sample return missions provide valuable information about our solar system and early Earth history. The samples from Bennu are expected to give insight into the formation of the Sun and planets. NASA will keep 25% of the samples and distribute the rest among mission members and international partners. Sample return missions have been conducted in the past, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and Japan's Hayabusa missions to asteroids. Future missions, such as Japan's MMX and the European Space Agency and NASA's Mars sample return mission, aim to bring back samples from Mars and its moons.</description>

			<title>Jewar Airport gets ‘DXN’ code: How the IATA assigns unique codes to each airport</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/jewar-airport-dxn-code-iata-codes-8959951/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The upcoming Noida International Airport (NIA) in Jewar has been awarded its own unique international three-letter code, 'DXN', by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The CEO of NIA, Christoph Schnellmann, explained that the code is significant as it represents the connectivity of Delhi-Noida with the world through the airport. The "D" in DXN signifies Delhi, the national capital, while the "N" represents Noida, indicating the presence of the airport in the western UP area. The letter "X" signifies connectivity within India and the world. Phase 1 of the airport is expected to be operational by the end of 2024, with a capacity of 12 million passengers per year and a 3.9-km-long north runway. Each airport has two unique codes, one assigned by IATA and the other by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The IATA codes are used for passenger-facing operations, while the ICAO codes are used by industry professionals. Kiran Jain, COO of NIA, stated that the airport code is a major milestone and will not change as long as the airport exists. The assignment of airport codes is governed by IATA resolution 763 and published twice a year in the IATA airline coding directory.</description>

			<title>How MS Swaminathan triggered the Green Revolution and helped India achieve food security</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ms-swaminathan-father-green-revolution-explained-8959892/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Monkomb Sambasivan Swaminathan, also known as the 'Father of the Green Revolution', passed away at the age of 98. He played a significant role in transforming farming in the 1960s and '70s, leading to India achieving food security. Swaminathan was highly dedicated to agriculture and conducted extensive research in the field throughout his career.

He held various positions in agricultural institutions both in India and abroad. Notable roles included serving as the Independent Chairman of the Food and Agricultural Organisation Council, President of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, President of the World Wide Fund for Nature (India), and the Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Swaminathan's interest in agriculture was sparked during the Bengal famine in 1942-43. This event, combined with Mahatma Gandhi's call for the Quit India Movement, led him to study agriculture instead of pursuing a medical career. Fascinated by the science of genetics, he decided to focus his research on genetics and breeding, recognizing the impact that improved crop strains could have on farmers.

His research on rice led him to work at the Central Rice Research Institute, where he pioneered the transfer of genes for fertilizer response from Japonica varieties to Indica varieties. This breakthrough laid the foundation for developing high-yielding crop varieties that could thrive in good soil fertility and water management.

Swaminathan's most significant achievement was his contribution to the Green Revolution, which involved providing farmers in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh with high-yielding variety seeds, irrigation facilities, and fertilizers. As a result, wheat production in India increased dramatically, transforming the nation from a food-deficient country to self-sufficiency. This achievement instilled confidence in Indian farmers and disproved the notion that India was reliant on wheat imports from the US.

He collaborated with American scientist Norman Borlaug, who incorporated dwarfing genes into spring wheat varieties suitable for the Indian climate. Their joint efforts led to the development of Gaines, a high-yielding dwarf wheat variety. This breakthrough marked the beginning of the "Wheat Revolution" in India.

Despite the success of the Green Revolution, Swaminathan acknowledged its shortcomings, such as favoring already prosperous farmers and unsustainable farming practices. He advocated for the conservation of soil fertility, responsible use of pesticides and herbicides, and scientific management of underground water resources.

In recognition of his contributions, Swaminathan received numerous accolades, including the first World Food Prize Laureate in 1987. His work saved millions from food deprivation and secured India's food self-sufficiency.

Swaminathan's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements. As the head of the National Commission on Farmers, he advocated for fair prices for farmers, recommending that the Minimum Support Price should be at least 50 percent higher than the weighted average cost of production.

Monkomb Sambasivan Swaminathan's pioneering work in agriculture has left an indelible mark on India's farming landscape, ensuring food security and improving the lives of millions of farmers.</description>

			<title>Nearly 69 lakh cancer deaths among Indian women were preventable: What a study says on gender and the disease</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/cancers-gender-problem-8959239/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new report by the Lancet Commission on gender inequity in cancer care reveals that around 63% of premature deaths due to cancers in Indian women could have been prevented through risk reduction, screening, and diagnosis. Additionally, 37% of these deaths could have been averted with timely and optimal treatment. The report, titled 'Women, Power and Cancer', highlights that although men are at a higher risk of cancers that affect both genders, cancer incidence and mortality in women remain high. Globally, women account for 48% of new cancer cases and 44% of cancer deaths. The report emphasizes that women face challenges in accessing timely and appropriate care due to a lack of knowledge, decision-making power, financial resources, and availability of services at the primary level. Women are also more likely than men to lack the knowledge and power to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Furthermore, they are more likely to experience financial hardship due to cancer. The report also notes that women are underrepresented as leaders in providing cancer care and often face gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment. They also constitute the largest unpaid workforce in this field. The report estimates that the value of unpaid cancer caregiving by women is about 3.66% of India's national health expenditure. Dr Abhishek Shankar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences explains that there is a gendered aspect to cancer care, with healthcare-seeking behavior being lower among women, especially those from poor sections of society. He adds that treatment for women is often not prioritized, leading to worse outcomes compared to men. The report calls for societal changes alongside increased knowledge about cancer prevention. It suggests creating awareness campaigns to encourage people, especially women, to come forward for screening and seek care. The report also recommends developing laws and policies that reduce exposure to known cancer risks and ensuring equitable access to research resources, leadership positions, and funding opportunities for women in the field of cancer care.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The European Union (EU) plans to stop importing palm oil-based biofuel by 2030, causing concern for palm oil exporters in Malaysia and Indonesia. Legislation in the EU aims to eliminate deforestation from the supply chains of everyday items, including palm oil. Malaysia recently signed a €500 million agreement with China to establish a trading and distribution center for palm oil, with the goal of doubling exports to China in the coming years. There are concerns that if Malaysia and Indonesia become dependent on China for exports, the intended environmental benefits of the EU legislation could be nullified. The EU's reputation has been criticized for potentially protecting its own vegetable oils, such as rapeseed and sunflower oil, at the expense of Southeast Asian producers. While some argue that trade restrictions should be the last resort, the EU emphasizes its efforts to improve environmental standards globally and believes it will remain an attractive market for exporters. Dialogue and collaboration between all parties involved are crucial for finding solutions.</description>

			<title>Bonding with the world: Will more inflows give India’s economy the booster dose?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/jp-morgan-indian-government-bonds-8959037/</link>
			<description>JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co has recently decided to include Indian government bonds in its emerging markets index, which could lead to a surge in dollar inflows into India. Other global investment majors are also considering including India in their investment index baskets. While there are differing views on when the foreign funds may start flowing into the country, it is widely agreed that this surge in flows will positively impact India's fiscal and balance of payments dynamics. The inclusion of government bonds in JP Morgan's index will be staggered over a 10-month period, starting in June 2024. Analysts estimate that this inclusion could result in inflows of around $25-30 billion into the government securities market. Other major index providers, such as FTSE Russell, are also reportedly considering including Indian bonds in their indices. The impact of these inflows is expected to include a downward pressure on interest rates, higher profits for the corporate sector, a potential boost to the bond market, a stronger rupee, and a rise in foreign exchange reserves. However, there are concerns about the macro-prudential risks associated with heavy foreign debt flows, as well as the potential for capital flight and market volatility. The RBI will play a crucial role in monitoring and intervening to maintain stability in the financial markets.</description>

			<title>Why Odisha wants to have its own tiger census, how it will go about it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-tiger-census-explained-8958968/</link>
			<description>The Odisha government has announced its plans to conduct a tiger census after questioning the findings of the All-India Tiger Estimation (AITE) 2022. The AITE report stated that more than half of the tigers in Odisha have disappeared since 2016, with one tiger reserve left with no tigers. Disagreeing with the AITE's methodology, Odisha will use the camera trap method along with other approaches for its own census. The state aims to have a more accurate estimation of the tiger population and their habitats for better monitoring and protection. Odisha intends to conduct the counting more frequently than the AITE, which is done every four years. The survey will be carried out in the rest of Odisha, excluding coastal districts, and will include camera-trapping and DNA analysis. The survey will be conducted in phases, starting with a preparatory phase and ending with the analysis of camera trap images and DNA findings before compiling the results. The success of the census will depend on the sincerity of forest officers, and the state's survey aims to take place annually instead of every four years.</description>

			<title>Musk’s X biggest source of disinformation, claims EU survey: Why hate speech, false info have spiked on the platform</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/musk-x-disinformation-eu-8958942/</link>
			<description>A new study by the European Commission has found that x, previously known as Twitter and now owned by Elon Musk, has the highest ratio of disinformation posts among large social media platforms. The study analyzed over 6,000 social media posts across various platforms in three countries, including Poland, Slovakia, and Spain. The study has prompted the EU's values and transparency commissioner, Vera Jourova, to call on Musk to comply with the bloc's laws against disinformation. This is not the first time Musk has faced criticism for failing to address the increase in disinformation and hate speech on x since taking over in October 2022. After Musk's acquisition, there was a significant surge in antisemitic, misogynistic, and transphobic language. Previous studies have also shown an uptick in hateful narratives, particularly against the LGBTQ+ community. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that x failed to take action against 99% of hate posts by Twitter blue subscribers. Musk's changes within the company, including laying off employees and restoring barred accounts, have been attributed to the deterioration of safety standards on the platform. The dilution of the verification process has also led to the creation of fake accounts. X has sued the CCDH in response to their findings, claiming harm to its business.</description>

			<title>US accuses Amazon of ‘illegal monopoly’: Why the country has sued the online giant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-sues-amazon-accusing-illegal-monopoly-8958363/</link>
			<description>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the company of using coercive tactics to maintain its monopoly and harm customers. The lawsuit, seen as a high-profile case against a big tech company, comes after the appointment of Lina Khan as the regulator's chair. Khan has been critical of Amazon in the past. The FTC alleges that Amazon engages in exclusionary conduct that prevents competitors from growing and new competitors from emerging. Some of these tactics include anti-discounting measures and conditioning sellers' eligibility for Amazon's "Prime" service on using its costly Fulfilment service. The FTC is seeking a permanent injunction to restore competition. Amazon has called the lawsuit misguided and argues that it would harm consumers and businesses. The allegations made by the FTC have previously been investigated by India's competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI).</description>

			<title>China-Philippines tussle: Everything you need to know about the South China Sea dispute</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/south-china-sea-dispute-8957602/</link>
			<description>China's installation of a barricade near the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea has reignited tensions in the long-standing territorial dispute. The South China Sea, bordered by Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam, has been a source of contention for centuries. China's rise as a global power has escalated tensions in recent years, with the country claiming up to 90% of the sea through its "nine-dash line" map. Other countries have contested China's claims, leading to increased militarization and construction of islands by China. The United States has intervened to protect its own interests and support China's opponents. The South China Sea is rich in resources such as oil and natural gas deposits and serves as a crucial trade route. The dispute shows no signs of quick resolution, raising concerns about potential global conflict and undermining international laws governing maritime disputes.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains | View from China on India-Canada spat: ‘US to blame, India should see West’s hypocrisy’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-on-india-canada-row-8957737/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the diplomatic tensions between India and Canada triggered by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's accusation of India's involvement in killing a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. This accusation has led to the expulsion of a senior diplomat from both countries. The article highlights Chinese interest in the row due to China's own diplomatic hostility with Canada a few months ago. Chinese media, particularly pro-Beijing outlets, have focused on exposing what they perceive as American double standards, with articles highlighting the hypocrisy of US values-based alliances. Some Chinese publications blame Canada for provoking India and causing trouble due to its reliance on the US. Left-leaning platforms describe the tension as India being in big trouble and potentially being classified as a "terrorist" country. Reader comments express caution when siding with India, claiming that the US pardons every sin done by India in its efforts to use India against China and Russia. Some Chinese people enjoy the deteriorating relations between two American allies, and believe that China's rise exposes India's value to the West. Overall, the Chinese media and public discourse remain occupied with the issue, with many believing that the spat is a result of US President Joe Biden favoring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain China.</description>

			<title>Why the delimitation exercise is seen as a political battle between the BJP and the rest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/womens-reservation-bill-political-issue-of-delimitation-8957721/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Women's Reservation Bill, which aims to provide a 33% quota for women in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies, was recently passed by both Houses of Parliament. However, its fate is uncertain due to its connection to the delimitation exercise. Opposition parties have criticized the government for linking the implementation of women's reservation with delimitation, arguing that there is no reason for this association. The government's decision to make women's reservation contingent on delimitation seems to serve multiple objectives. First, the delimitation exercise will increase the number of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies, potentially maintaining the current number of male legislators while accommodating women's reservation. Second, it appears to be an attempt to exert pressure on opposition parties, particularly those from south India, to support the delimitation exercise. Delimitation is a constitutional mandate that adjusts the number of seats and their boundaries based on population data after each Census. However, the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies has remained unchanged for the past 50 years due to opposition from parties in South India. These parties are reluctant to allow delimitation as it would result in a significant increase in Lok Sabha seats in North Indian states, benefiting the BJP the most. The fear of male politicians losing their seats has been a major obstacle in the implementation of women's reservation. By connecting women's reservation to delimitation, the government aims to ensure the preservation of the current male politicians' political fortunes. If the delimitation exercise results in an increase in the number of Lok Sabha seats to 770, 257 seats would be reserved for women, leaving 513 seats for men to contest. This would simplify the accommodation of male leaders within political parties. The opposition parties have recognized the government's larger agenda, which is to make the delimitation exercise inevitable and to use any resistance to it as a means to accuse the opposition of hindering the women's reservation bill. However, the opposition is not willing to surrender and has raised concerns about the potential reduction in the representation of South Indian states if the implementation of women's reservation is linked to delimitation. Former law minister Kapil Sibal has warned that the linkage with delimitation could further delay the implementation of women's reservation beyond 2029. Delimitation aims to ensure equitable representation in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies based on population, but there is no defined number of seats. If the number of seats were to remain the same as in 1977, the Lok Sabha would need to expand to nearly 1,400 seats due to population growth. However, the maximum capacity of the new Lok Sabha is set at 888 seats. Therefore, the average population size of each constituency would have to increase. The number of Lok Sabha seats in North Indian states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is likely to increase significantly compared to South Indian states, as the number of seats has remained unchanged for the past 50 years. The BJP is eager for delimitation as it would strengthen its political position, particularly in North India. By linking delimitation with women's reservation, the BJP is attempting to leverage its advantage, but the opposition has not yet revealed its strategy. In this political battle, the women's reservation bill may suffer as a consequence.</description>

			<title>Chinese research ship to visit Sri Lanka, US raises concerns: What has happened, and why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sri-lanka-chinese-research-ship-explained-8957466/</link>
			<description>The US has expressed concern to Sri Lanka about an upcoming visit by a Chinese research ship called the Shi Yan 6. India also finds this concerning and had objected to a Chinese ship docking in Sri Lanka last year. The Shi Yan 6 is a scientific research vessel that conducts oceanography, marine geology, and marine ecology tests. It is expected to dock in Sri Lanka in October for research purposes. India considers Chinese ships near its mainland a security threat, even if their stated purpose is scientific research. Last year, India objected to a Chinese ballistic missile and satellite tracking ship staying at Hambantota port in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka initially postponed the ship's arrival but later allowed it to dock. This raised concerns in India about potential surveillance of its ports and vital installations. Sri Lanka maintains a neutral stance and has a Standard Operating Procedure for foreign ships and aircraft operating in its territory. It believes in an even-handed approach and cannot exclude China.</description>

			<title>Humans of Bombay vs People of India: What is copyright infringement and when does it apply?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/humans-of-bombay-vs-people-of-india-case-explained-8957397/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has issued summons to Instagram account "People of India" (POI) in a copyright infringement suit filed by storytelling platform "Humans of Bombay" (HOB). HOB alleges that POI has imitated its storytelling style and used similar images and videos. The court found "substantial imitation" between the two platforms. Copyright infringement refers to the unauthorized use of a substantial part of a copyrighted work, and the copyright owner can take legal action for remedies such as injunctions and damages. HOB has also claimed "passing off and unfair competition" as POI has used content identical or similar to HOB's in an attempt to benefit from its goodwill and reputation. The court has issued notice to POI and listed the matter for further hearing.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Members of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, have carried two pending matters to their new building. The first matter is the formulation of a Code of Conduct for members, which has been under consideration by the Committee on Ethics for over eight years. The second matter is the declaration of members' business interests, which currently only applies to members of Rajya Sabha, the upper house. Concerns over conflicts of interest among MPs have been raised for almost a century. The Ethics Committee in Lok Sabha has been reconstituted every year and is responsible for examining complaints of unethical conduct and formulating a Code of Conduct. In contrast, Rajya Sabha has had a 14-point Code of Conduct in place since 2005. The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Rajya Sabha also require the maintenance of a Register of Members' Interests, accessible to ordinary citizens under the Right to Information Act.</description>
