			<title>Failure to follow procedure: Why SC said Newsclick founder’s arrest was illegal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/failure-to-follow-procedure-sc-newsclick-arrest-illegal-9330103/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India ordered the release of Newsclick founder-editor Prabir Purkayastha, invalidating his arrest under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The court highlighted that the Delhi Police did not inform Purkayastha of the grounds for his arrest before taking him into custody, which is a violation of due process as per Article 22(1) of the Constitution. This decision underscores the importance of following proper legal procedures, even in cases involving stringent terror charges.

Purkayastha was arrested on October 3, 2023, with allegations of receiving funds for pro-China propaganda. The FIR listed several serious offences under the UAPA and IPC. However, the remand order was signed before Purkayastha was informed of his arrest or presented before a judge, and the FIR was not made public until days later. The Supreme Court's ruling aligns with a previous decision that mandates providing written grounds of arrest to the arrested person, applicable to both PMLA and UAPA cases.

The Solicitor General argued against Purkayastha's release, citing the seriousness of the offences and national security concerns. The Delhi High Court had upheld the arrest, noting email exchanges that allegedly portrayed Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh as disputed territories, which was seen as aligning with Chinese propaganda. However, the Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the necessity of lawful arrest procedures, especially given the high bar for bail under special legislation like the UAPA.</description>

			<title>Explained: Controversy and drama at Hybe, the K-pop company behind BTS</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/hybe-k-pop-ador-controversy-newjeans-bts-9328888/</link>
			<description>Hybe, the company behind BTS, has faced turmoil including a dramatic press conference and allegations of an illegal takeover. The company's market value dropped significantly due to falling stock prices. Hybe, founded as Big Hit Entertainment by Bang Si-hyuk in 2005, struggled initially but found phenomenal success with BTS, leading to expansion and acquisitions. In 2020, Hybe went public with a valuation of $4.1 billion.

A dispute arose between Hybe and its subsidiary ADOR, with Hybe alleging that ADOR's CEO, Min Hee-jin, was planning a takeover. Min, who joined Hybe in 2019 and became CEO of ADOR, launched the successful K-pop group NewJeans in 2022. However, Hybe accused her and other executives of plotting an illegal takeover, leading to a contentious press conference where Min denied the allegations.

The conflict has sparked debates among fans and concerns over NewJeans' future. Reports suggest Min may have been replaced as CEO, but confirmation is pending. The situation raises questions about Hybe's reputation and management, especially as BTS's hiatus due to military service leaves a gap in Hybe's artist lineup. The K-pop industry faces challenges in maintaining its success, with Hybe's shares and those of its competitors declining recently. Separately, the BCCI is considering Stephen Fleming as the next head coach for Team India.</description>

			<title>Explained Climate: Heatwaves and climate change</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-climate-heatwaves-climate-change-9329251/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of climate change on heatwaves in India, highlighting that recent extreme temperatures in eastern and southern parts of the country have been made significantly more likely due to climate change. The study by World Weather Attribution indicates that this is the third consecutive year where early summer heatwaves in India are linked to climate change. Attribution science has advanced, allowing researchers to assess the likelihood of such events being influenced by climate change.

Heatwaves are defined by temperature abnormalities rather than high temperatures alone, and evidence suggests they are becoming more frequent, intense, and prolonged in India due to climate change. For instance, February 2023 saw heatwave conditions and was the second warmest February recorded for the country. Predictions for more prolonged heatwaves seem to be coming true, with an 18-day heatwave in Odisha and record-breaking heat in Gangetic West Bengal.

The article also addresses the health risks associated with prolonged heat exposure, such as dehydration and cardiovascular issues. It notes the challenges in collecting reliable data on heat-related illnesses and deaths in India, with discrepancies in figures reported by different agencies. Despite the implementation of heat action plans in vulnerable states, which have reduced heat-related deaths, the article suggests that more needs to be done to manage the increasing severity of heatwaves, including regulating activities in unorganized sectors and adjusting office and school timings.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need for better funding and stricter regulations to mitigate the effects of heatwaves, which are expected to worsen due to climate change. It calls for mandatory local administrative measures to protect the population, especially during peak heat periods.</description>

			<title>What is the new FLiRT variant of the Covid virus, and should you worry?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/new-flirt-covid-variant-kp-symptoms-9328759/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the emergence of a new coronavirus variant, KP.2, also known as FLiRT, which has been circulating in India since November 2023 and is linked to rising Covid-19 cases globally. FLiRT is a sub-variant of Omicron with mutations that enable it to evade antibodies, making it more transmissible. Despite this, experts are not overly concerned, as the symptoms are similar to previous variants and there are no indications of increased severity. The variant has been sequenced by INSACOG, with a significant number found in Maharashtra. Preventive measures remain the same, including social distancing and proper mask usage. Current vaccines in India, targeting the original virus strain, may not be effective against FLiRT, and most Indians might not need a booster due to prior infections. The article also highlights the vulnerability of senior citizens and immunocompromised individuals to severe illness from Covid-19.</description>

			<title>Putin has replaced Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: What does this mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/putin-russia-defence-minister-shoigu-9328701/</link>
			<description>Russian President Vladimir Putin has initiated a significant reshuffle in his security team, replacing long-time Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu with Andrei Belousov, who previously served as Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister and is an economist by training. Shoigu, who has been a key figure in Russian politics since 1994 and a close ally of Putin, will now serve as Secretary of the Security Council. This move comes after Putin's inauguration for a fifth presidential term and amidst ongoing Russian military operations in Ukraine.

Shoigu's tenure as Defence Minister saw the annexation of Crimea and military interventions in Syria and Ukraine. His replacement, Belousov, lacks a military background but has been a prominent economic advisor to Putin. The reshuffle is seen as a response to the changing dynamics of the conflict in Ukraine, with Belousov's economic expertise expected to bring efficiency to the Ministry of Defence.

Experts suggest that the decision for the reshuffle was carefully considered, with Putin known for his reluctance to change personnel. The transfer of Shoigu could be attributed to increasing pressures, including accusations of military incompetence and corruption, as well as the recent arrest of his deputy on bribery charges. Despite these challenges, Shoigu maintains a direct line to Putin and will continue to play a significant role in Russia's military-industrial complex and international military hardware dealings.

Belousov's appointment reflects a strategic shift as Russia's conflict with Ukraine evolves into a war of attrition, necessitating economic adjustments within the Ministry of Defence to adapt to new realities. Belousov's economic policies and long-standing advisory role make him a fitting candidate to implement these changes.</description>

			<title>India VIX Index rallies: What does market volatility mean for investors?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-vix-index-market-volatility-9327742/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the surge in India VIX, a measure of market volatility expectation, which has recently passed the 21 mark due to uncertainties surrounding the Lok Sabha elections. The VIX, also known as the Fear Index, rises with market volatility and is based on the order book of the underlying index options. It was first introduced by the CBOE in 1993 and has since been used to gauge market volatility and inform investment decisions.

India VIX, computed by the NSE using NIFTY Options, reflects the expected market volatility over the next 30 days. A higher VIX value indicates greater expected volatility. Recently, the India VIX has seen a significant increase, attributed to the ongoing elections and actions by foreign portfolio investors. Market experts suggest that the VIX may peak before the election results are announced and could fall sharply afterward.

Investors are advised to view the market as in a corrective or consolidation phase, with a cautious approach until a clearer trend emerges post-elections. The article also briefly mentions Snehil Dixit Mehra's experience with filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, unrelated to the main financial content.</description>

			<title>Why some Indians are turning to LMIA work permits to emigrate to Canada</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/indians-lmia-work-permits-canada-9326443/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the shift in preference among Indian emigrants from student visas to the Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) permit following Canada's cap on international student admissions. The LMIA program allows Canadian employers to hire foreign workers when local recruitment fails. Employers post job requirements on the Canadian job portal, and foreign workers with a positive LMIA can apply for work permits using various documents, including the LMIA itself.

The competitiveness of student visas and labour shortages in certain sectors have made the LMIA a viable alternative, offering a pathway to gain Canadian work experience. The demand for skilled labour in Canada is expected to increase the popularity of the LMIA route. The costs associated with student visas are high, and some individuals are paying substantial fees to secure an LMIA permit. Lower English proficiency scores are accepted for some LMIA jobs compared to study permits, which often require higher scores.

A positive LMIA does not guarantee permanent residency; skilled foreign workers must meet the Express Entry immigration process requirements. The article concludes with an unrelated mention of Elon Musk's prediction about solving chess and the mixed reactions from the chess community.</description>

			<title>What are India’s stakes in Iran’s Chabahar port?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-are-indias-stakes-in-irans-chabahar-port-9326692/</link>
			<description>India and Iran have signed a **10-year contract** for the operation of a terminal at the **Chabahar port**, which is strategically significant due to its location and accessibility for large cargo ships. The contract was signed by **India Ports Global Ltd (IPGL)** and the **Ports &amp; Maritime Organisation of Iran (PMO)**, with India committing to invest approximately **$120 million** in the port's equipment and operations. Additionally, India has offered a credit line of **$250 million** for infrastructure projects related to the port.

Chabahar port's development has been a topic of strategic and economic importance for India, providing a route to Afghanistan and potentially linking South Asia with Central Asia and Europe. Despite setbacks due to geopolitical pressures, particularly from the US, the project gained momentum with the signing of a **Trilateral Agreement** in 2016 to establish the **International Transport and Transit Corridor**.

India has contributed equipment to the port and has been operating it since 2018, handling significant cargo and facilitating humanitarian aid. The recent operationalisation of the long-term investment aims to make Chabahar a hub for connecting India with Central Asia and Afghanistan. The development of the port is also tied to the larger **International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC)** project, which seeks to create a multi-modal transportation route from the Indian Ocean to northern Europe.

The future of these projects, however, faces uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine and strained relations between Europe and Russia, which could affect the INSTC's viability. The article also mentions unrelated content and advertisements, which have been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Fuelled by Pakistan’s economic crisis: why is PoK on the boil?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pok-protests-riots-inflation-food-crisis-pakistan-kashmir-9326378/</link>
			<description>Protests have erupted in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) due to economic distress and alleged discrimination by the Pakistani government. The protests, which began after the arrest of 70 members of a traders' committee, have led to a police officer's death and over 90 injuries. The demonstrators are protesting against high costs of living, particularly electricity and food prices, which have been exacerbated by Pakistan's economic crisis, including a halt in trade with India and inflation rates reaching 38%. The region's leaders have accused Islamabad of power distribution discrimination, particularly concerning the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project.

Trade between India and Pakistan has suffered significantly, especially after India increased customs duties on Pakistani goods and Pakistan ceased all trade following India's constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's economy is struggling with low foreign exchange reserves, high energy import dependency, and minimal private sector development. The IMF has indicated that Pakistan will require substantial financing in the coming years.

			<title>Burqa row: Why BJP candidate in Hyderabad has been booked by police at the ECI’s behest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/madhavi-latha-burqa-controversy-9326271/</link>
			<description>During the fourth phase of the Lok Sabha election, BJP candidate Madhavi Latha was recorded asking niqab-wearing women to remove their face coverings for identity verification. This led to an FIR against her for undue influence, obstruction, and intent to incite, under various IPC sections and the Representation of the People Act. Historically, women in India have voted with face coverings, and the Election Commission of India (ECI) has worked to respect privacy while ensuring fair elections. The ECI mandates special arrangements for the identification of 'pardanashin' women voters by female polling officers. The verification of voter identity is the ECI's responsibility, not the candidates', and Latha's actions were considered interference, resulting in police action. The article also mentions Damini Nath, an Assistant Editor with The Indian Express, and a separate, unrelated anecdote by Twinkle Khanna about motherhood and a humorous remark by her husband, Akshay Kumar.</description>

			<title>First human recipient of pig kidney transplant dies: What is xenotransplantation, why pigs are used</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/pig-kidney-transplant-death-xenotransplantation-9325986/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the case of the first recipient of a modified pig kidney transplant, Richard "Rick" Slayman, who passed away two months post-surgery. The Massachusetts General Hospital and Slayman's family did not attribute his death to the transplant. Xenotransplantation, the process of using animal cells and organs in humans, is highlighted as a promising solution to the organ donor shortage. The article notes that nearly 90,000 people in the U.S. await a kidney transplant, with over 3,000 dying annually while waiting.

The procedure involves significant genetic modifications to the animal organ to prevent rejection by the human body, with 69 genomic edits made in Slayman's case using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Despite the potential of xenotransplantation, as evidenced by over 50 years of using pig heart valves in humans, challenges remain. These include ensuring the human body does not reject the organ and monitoring for infections, including latent retroviruses that could cause disease years later.

The article also briefly mentions unrelated content about author Twinkle Khanna discussing the evolution of a mother's roles and responsibilities, which is not connected to the main topic of xenotransplantation.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: How India’s polling stations work</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-india-polling-stations-work-9325944/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed overview of the polling station setup and management during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections in India. It highlights that **96.8 crore electors** are enrolled to vote at **10.5 lakh polling stations** nationwide. The district election officer (DEO) is responsible for establishing polling stations under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, with the aim to make them accessible within two kilometers for voters, have a minimum area of 20 sq m, and serve no more than 1,500 electors. Exceptions are made for remote or challenging locations, such as Arunachal Pradesh's Malogam polling station, which serves a single voter.

Polling stations are typically located in government buildings, with private buildings used only when necessary. The list of polling stations is verified and updated annually, with input from political parties and citizens. The Election Commission of India (ECI) approves the final list, which is then distributed to parties and candidates.

To accommodate the Indian summer, polling stations are equipped with shade structures, cooling devices, and medical kits to combat heatwaves. Special provisions are made for **88.4 lakh Persons with Disabilities (PwD)**, including ramps, wheelchairs, and transport facilities. The ECI's Saksham App helps PwDs with various services.

Access to polling stations is restricted to authorized individuals, and a polling party consists of a Presiding Officer and three Polling Officers who manage voter identification, indelible ink application, and EVM control. Sector Officers, Micro Observers, Booth Level Officers (BLO), and security personnel support the election process.

Separate queues for men and women are maintained on polling day, and political activities are restricted near polling stations. Critical polling stations receive additional security measures to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

The article concludes with a brief mention of author and entrepreneur Twinkle Khanna's column, which discusses the evolving roles of mothers and includes a humorous anecdote involving her husband, actor Akshay Kumar. However, this part of the article is unrelated to the main topic of the Lok Sabha elections.</description>

			<title>Himachal Pradesh HC split verdict: Can courts impose a timeline on Speakers’ acceptance of MLA resignations?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/himachal-pradesh-mla-resignation-high-court-9325913/</link>
			<description>The Himachal Pradesh High Court is divided over whether to direct the Speaker to accept MLA resignations promptly. Chief Justice Rao declined to intervene, while Justice Dua ordered a two-week deadline for the Speaker's decision. The controversy stems from the Rajya Sabha elections in February 2024, where BJP's Harsh Mahajan won against Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi, aided by defections from six Congress MLAs and three independents. The Speaker disqualified the defectors, who then petitioned the court for immediate acceptance of their resignations. The law allows the Speaker to verify the authenticity of resignations, but the judges' opinions diverged on judicial intervention. The case may escalate to a larger bench or the Supreme Court, with the Speaker's final decision expected by early June.</description>

			<title>Why Congress hit ‘400 paar’ in 1984 elections, how Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure was marred by struggles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/why-congress-hit-400-paar-in-1984-elections-how-rajiv-gandhis-tenure-was-marred-by-struggles-9324387/</link>
			<description>The article recounts the political landscape of India during the 1980s, focusing on the rise and fall of Rajiv Gandhi's political career. After the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984, Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister and led the Congress to a landslide victory, winning 414 of the 514 Lok Sabha seats. However, his tenure was marred by a corruption scandal, and Congress never regained a majority on its own after 1984.

The article also details the fragmentation of political parties during this period, with several leaders forming their own factions. Notable political developments included Farooq Abdullah becoming Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Ramakrishna Hegde becoming CM of Karnataka, and N T Rama Rao taking oath in Andhra Pradesh.

Efforts to unite various "progressive and socialist" parties led to the formation of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which later dissolved, leading to the creation of the Dalit Mazdoor Kisan Party (DMKP). The article also touches on the anti-Sikh violence following Indira Gandhi's assassination, the Election Commission's role in the subsequent election, and the outcomes for various political figures and parties.

Significant events such as the Rajiv-Longowal Accord, the Assam Accord, and the Bofors scandal are mentioned, culminating in the Congress party's significant loss in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, which led to the formation of a non-Congress government. The article concludes with a brief mention of the current political scenario and the upcoming second half of the Lok Sabha elections.</description>

			<title>What FLiRT, a new set of Covid-19 variant detected in the US, could mean for spring and summer</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/flirt-new-covid-variant-kp2-9324182/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant, KP.2, which is an offshoot of the previously dominant JN.1 variant. KP.2, part of the "FLiRT" group of variants, has quickly risen to account for over a quarter of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Although it is very similar to JN.1, KP.2 may be slightly more infectious and better at evading immune defenses due to differences in its spike protein.

Despite the shift in variants, there is no current indication of a significant rise in cases. Data shows minimal virus levels in wastewater, and hospital visits have decreased. However, experts are monitoring KP.2 for potential increases in infection rates. Vaccines still offer protection, particularly against severe disease, but KP.2 may infect those who have received the latest vaccine targeting a different variant, XBB.1.5.

The CDC continues to recommend vaccinations, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised. Symptoms of KP.2 are similar to other variants, and while reinfections can occur, they are often milder. The risk of long COVID remains, but its prevalence is lower than earlier in the pandemic. The article underscores the evolving nature of the virus and the ongoing efforts to understand and respond to it. The unrelated content about Magnus Carlsen and the Grand Chess Tour has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>As a section of Air India Express employees call in sick, a look at ‘sickouts’ as a means of protest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/air-india-express-employees-vistara-sickout-9323914/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent phenomenon of "sickouts" in the Indian aviation industry, where employees, particularly those in critical operational roles like pilots and cabin crew, coordinate mass sick leaves to protest and force management to address their grievances. This form of industrial action has become more common as traditional strikes decline due to various factors, including laws weakening labor unions and the lack of supportive legislation for private sector workers to organize formally.

Sickouts are similar to strikes in their goal to push for management's attention to demands but differ in their informal, swift nature, often catching management off guard. They are most effective when key operational employees participate, as their absence can significantly disrupt operations. The article cites recent instances at Vistara and Air India Express, as well as past occurrences at other airlines like IndiGo, Kingfisher, and Jet Airways.

The practice is not limited to aviation; it has been used in various sectors worldwide, especially when workers are not legally allowed to strike. Examples include Amazon, Target, and Whole Foods employees in the US, and public school teachers in Detroit. The article suggests that while sickouts are challenging for management to address legally, they remain a potent tool for employees to express discontent and push for change. The author, Sukalp Sharma, has extensive experience in journalism, covering various sectors and topics. The unrelated content about Magnus Carlsen's chess match has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Aurora lights in India: What caused them to be visible even from Ladakh?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/aurora-lights-india-ladakh-9323390/</link>
			<description>Auroras, typically seen near the poles, were observed in Ladakh, India, due to intense solar activity. The Indian Institute of Astrophysics captured these lights, which occur when solar wind particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere. This recent event was caused by strong solar storms resulting from Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from an active solar region. These CMEs, traveling at high speeds, reached Earth's atmosphere, causing vibrant auroras visible from lower latitudes. Such solar storms can disrupt satellites in Low Earth Orbit, posing risks to navigation and communication systems. Continuous solar activity is expected to affect space weather and Earth's magnetosphere for the next few days.</description>

			<title>SC cautions on ‘history sheets’: all you need to know about the practice</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-history-sheet-police-amanatullah-khan-9322795/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has directed all states and Union Territories to ensure that police 'history sheets' do not carry caste biases. This came during the hearing of AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan's plea against being labeled a 'bad character' in police surveillance records. The Court emphasized the need to avoid caste prejudices and confirmed that the process of documenting 'history sheeters' should be free from such biases. 

'History sheets' are records of individuals with significant criminal histories, used by police to track and manage criminal activities. These records are detailed and include descriptions, associates, and property details to assess the individual's lifestyle and potential criminal behavior. The Supreme Court's directive also included instructions to protect the privacy and dignity of the family members of those listed in the history sheets, specifically mentioning that details of minor children and spouses should not be included.

The article also references the Punjab Police Rules of 1934, which first introduced the term 'history sheet' and outlines the procedures for documenting individuals believed to be habitually involved in crime. It draws a parallel between the language used in these rules and the colonial-era records of 'criminal tribes', highlighting the need for modern policing to move away from such outdated practices.

In conclusion, while the Delhi High Court had previously upheld the police's actions regarding Khan's history sheet, the Supreme Court has taken a stance to ensure that the process respects individual rights and does not perpetuate societal biases. The police have agreed to review their procedures to align with the Court's directions.</description>

			<title>What are northern and southern lights? Why do they occur?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/northern-southern-lights-aurora-9322408/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent appearance of auroras, both the northern lights (aurora borealis) and southern lights (aurora australis), in various parts of the world including Ladakh, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. Auroras are natural, colorful light displays in the sky, occurring near the poles but sometimes visible at lower latitudes during strong solar activity. This phenomenon is caused by charged particles from the Sun, known as solar wind, interacting with Earth's magnetic field and atmospheric gases, producing lights in different colors. The recent widespread visibility of auroras was due to a geomagnetic storm triggered by a coronal mass ejection (CME) hitting Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) labeled the storm as extreme and noted the possibility of more CMEs affecting Earth. Geomagnetic storms can disrupt various space-dependent systems like GPS, communications, and power grids.</description>

			<title>Explained: Behind the two decade delay in Naga municipal polls</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/naga-municipal-polls-womens-reservation-delay-9321962/</link>
			<description>Nagaland is preparing for municipal elections on June 26, the first since 2004. The elections have been delayed due to disputes over a 33% reservation for women, which some argue contradicts Naga customary laws protected by the Constitution. The Naga Mothers' Association has been a key advocate for the reservation, leading to a Supreme Court directive to hold the elections. However, violent protests and political pressure led to the resignation of a Chief Minister and the repeal of the original Municipal Act. A new Nagaland Municipal Bill was passed in 2023, maintaining the women's reservation but removing the chairperson reservation and property tax provisions. The upcoming elections will follow this new legislation.</description>

			<title>ISRO successfully tests 3D-printed rocket engine: What is 3D printing and how does it work?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/isro-3d-printing-rocket-engine-9321975/</link>
			<description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has achieved a significant milestone by successfully testing the PS4 liquid rocket engine, which has been redesigned for production using 3D printing technology. This additive manufacturing process constructs three-dimensional objects layer by layer from materials such as plastic, composites, or bio-materials. The 3D printing approach contrasts with traditional subtractive manufacturing methods and allows for the creation of complex shapes and moving parts without the need for assembly.

ISRO's use of 3D printing for the PS4 engine, which powers the fourth stage of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), has resulted in a reduction of the engine's parts from 14 to a single piece, eliminating 19 weld joints and saving 97% of raw material. Additionally, this innovation has cut down the overall production time by 60%. The successful long-duration test of the re-designed engine marks a design and manufacturing breakthrough for ISRO, showcasing the potential of 3D printing in space technology.</description>

			<title>Israel, Saudi Arabia, and churn in the Middle East: The view from India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-saudi-arabia-and-churn-in-the-middle-east-the-view-from-india-9321088/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the United States' efforts to establish a mutual defence treaty with Saudi Arabia and support Israel against Hamas and Iran. The US-Saudi deal hinges on the US's control over Saudi's civilian nuclear program, the nature of the defence pact, and Saudi's commitment to pricing oil in US dollars rather than Chinese yuan. A key condition for the deal is Saudi Arabia's normalization of relations with Israel, which depends on Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, halting settlement construction in the West Bank, and a pathway to a Palestinian state.

The potential US-Saudi treaty and peace in the Middle East could benefit President Biden's re-election campaign and signal a stronger American presence in the region, countering Beijing's influence. For India, these developments present an opportunity to leverage the region's potential, given its growing ties with both Saudi Arabia and Israel. India's trade with Saudi Arabia reached $52.76 billion in 2022-23, with significant Saudi investments in Indian startups. The Indian diaspora in Saudi Arabia and India's trade with Israel, valued at $10.7 billion in 2022-23, underscore the importance of these relationships.

The article also touches on the reputational changes of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. MBS is seen as a liberalizer after implementing reforms, while Netanyahu's stance on Gaza is linked to his political survival, causing impatience in the US. The article concludes with the mention of a dust storm in Delhi, unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Turnouts, delays, Form 17C</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/lok-sabha-elections-2024-turnouts-delays-form-17c-9321149/</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India (ECI) has addressed allegations by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge regarding the delay in releasing final voter turnout figures. Kharge suggested that the delay might indicate tampering with the final results. The ECI clarified that the initial turnout numbers are preliminary estimates and are subject to change as data from polling stations, especially remote ones, is received and verified. The final figures are confirmed only after postal ballots are counted on the day of counting.

The ECI explained that the process of data verification and entry by Returning Officers (ROs) can take a couple of days post-polling, depending on the geographical and weather conditions affecting the arrival of polling parties. The Voter Turnout mobile application provides real-time turnout data but carries a disclaimer that it is an approximate trend and does not include postal ballot data, which is shared in Form 17C with all polling agents at the close of polling.

Form 17C, which includes detailed voter and elector numbers, is considered final and is used for any legal challenges to the election results. The ECI reassured that there is no legal obligation to publish voter turnout data at an aggregate level and that the provision of Form 17C is a statutory requirement. The ECI also emphasized that discrepancies, if any, can be challenged on the day of counting. Activists have called for full transparency, noting the challenges candidates face in collating figures from numerous polling stations. The ECI has reiterated that all candidates receive Form 17C and can verify results against the EVM count on counting day.</description>

			<title>Charges framed against Brij Bhushan: what does this mean in legal process?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/charges-framed-against-brij-bhushan-what-does-this-mean-in-legal-process-9321146/</link>
			<description>A Delhi trial judge has charged BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh with offences under IPC Sections 354 and 354A, related to assault and sexual harassment of women. This follows a police investigation and a 1,500-page chargesheet filed last year, which also included charges of stalking under Section 354D. The court found sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial, particularly noting material supporting charges of criminal intimidation based on two complainants' allegations.

The legal process now moves to the trial phase, where Singh can plead innocent or guilty. If he pleads innocent, witnesses will be summoned for cross-examination. After the examination and arguments, the judge will reserve judgment, which could lead to conviction and sentencing if found guilty.

The article explains that IPC Sections 354 and 354A are classified as offences against women, with Section 354 covering assault intended to outrage a woman's modesty, punishable by 1 to 5 years of imprisonment and/or a fine. Section 354A defines sexual harassment, with varying degrees of punishment up to 3 years in prison and a fine, depending on the act.

Additionally, the judge has framed charges of criminal intimidation against Singh, as defined in Section 503, with potential imprisonment of up to 2 years, extendable to 7 years for more severe threats, as outlined in Section 506.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sc-arvind-kejriwal-bail-ruling-could-set-precedent-for-political-detainees-9321302/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, allowing him to campaign for elections. This decision is seen as an unprecedented move that could set a precedent for future political detainees. The court emphasized the importance of participatory democracy and the need for a level playing field in elections, which it deemed part of the Constitution's basic structure. The order also mentioned previous instances where the court confirmed bail for political leaders, highlighting the right to political speech. The court's decision on Kejriwal's case was based on individual facts, acknowledging his role as a national party leader and Chief Minister. Additionally, the court allowed Kejriwal to fulfill certain duties as Chief Minister, such as signing official files for the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi's approval. The article also briefly mentions charges framed against a BJP leader in a separate case of sexual harassment.</description>

			<title>Gold continues to glitter. What should investors do?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/gold-investors-surge-akshay-triyiya-9320765/</link>
			<description>Gold has traditionally been a favored investment in India, offering a hedge against inflation and financial uncertainties. With the recent surge in gold prices to historic highs, experts suggest various strategies for investors. Gold's value has increased significantly, with a 50% CAGR over the past two years. Cultural practices in India, such as buying gold during festivals and weddings, have bolstered its demand as an investment asset.

Prices have soared due to geopolitical tensions and central banks' gold accumulation, reaching Rs 73,000 per 10 grams domestically and $2,400 per ounce internationally. Analysts predict that gold prices may continue to rise due to global macroeconomic factors and central banks' purchasing activities. However, there could be a short-term price correction due to the current high levels.

Long-term, gold is seen as a safe and profitable investment, with domestic gold prices more than doubling in the last five years. Experts recommend buying gold in smaller denominations and considering market trends, geopolitical events, and personal financial goals before investing. They also advise on diversifying investments and timing purchases strategically.

Physical gold has its drawbacks, such as illiquidity and reduced value due to overhead costs. Investors are encouraged to consider gold-related financial instruments like Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs), gold ETFs, and Fund of Funds schemes for better liquidity and ease of investment. Digital gold, in the form of ETFs and mutual funds, is recommended as a viable option, with a suggested cap of 5-10% of one's investment portfolio. When selecting gold investments, factors like investment horizon, taxation, and liquidity should be taken into account.</description>

			<title>Vladimir Putin reappoints Mikhail Mishustin as Russian PM: Who is he?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-pm-mikhail-mishustin-putin-9320643/</link>
			<description>Vladimir Putin, following his recent inauguration for a fifth term as Russian President, has nominated Mikhail Mishustin for reappointment as Prime Minister. The proposal is now with the State Duma for a vote. Mishustin, who has been PM since 2020, is known for his technocratic expertise and lack of political ambition. He previously led the Federal Taxation Service, where he significantly increased tax revenues. His bureaucratic background contrasts with many of Putin's senior officials, who often have ties to the intelligence community. The Prime Minister's role in Russia, while limited compared to the President's, involves setting government priorities and managing its operations. Additionally, the PM would act as President if the current leader could not serve. Putin's political influence has grown over his terms, with a 2021 constitutional amendment allowing him potentially to remain in power until 2036.

			<title>Why Kerala has banned oleander flowers in temple offerings</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-banned-oleander-flowers-temple-offerings-9320431/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

Two temple boards in Kerala have banned the use of oleander flowers in temples after a 24-year-old nurse, Surya Surendran, died from accidental oleander poisoning. She was unaware of the plant's toxicity and chewed its leaves, leading to her death days later. Oleander, or Nerium oleander, is a drought-tolerant shrub used for ornamental purposes and known as arali in Kerala. While the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India notes medicinal uses of oleander, such as treating skin diseases, its toxicity is well-documented. Cardiac glycosides found in the plant can have therapeutic effects on the heart but also pose a high risk of overdose and toxicity. Symptoms of oleander poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and irregular heartbeat, which can last for days and may require hospitalization. The article emphasizes the plant's dual nature as both a medicine and a poison, historically used for therapeutic purposes and as a means of suicide.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/arvind-kejriwal-interim-bail-supreme-court-delhi-excise-policy-9320344/</link>
			<description>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on May 10, following his arrest on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Delhi excise policy case. Kejriwal, who had skipped nine ED summons, was termed the "kingpin and key conspirator" of the scam involving kickbacks from liquor businessmen. Despite the Delhi High Court rejecting his petition against the arrest, the Supreme Court, considering the general elections and Kejriwal's position as an elected official, granted him bail with conditions. He is not to visit the Chief Minister's office or the Delhi Secretariat, interact with witnesses, or comment on the excise scam case. The bail is effective until June 1, coinciding with the closure of voting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. This case is separate from the CBI's parallel investigation into the same matter, which also involved the arrest of former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.</description>

			<title>Experts Explain: How India’s main political parties view the world</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/experts-explain-india-main-political-parties-foreign-policy-9320139/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the diverging foreign policy perspectives of India's major political parties as reflected in their manifestos. It highlights the breakdown of the historical consensus on foreign policy, with issues like the Katchatheevu island dispute with Sri Lanka, terrorism from Pakistan, and the Gaza crisis causing divisions. The BJP manifesto emphasizes India's civilizational values and aims to assert India's soft power and global partnerships, while the Congress accuses the BJP of eroding India's international image and pledges to restore it. The CPI(M) criticizes the BJP for aligning too closely with US interests.

The manifestos show a lack of imaginative policies towards neighboring countries, with the BJP advocating a "Neighbourhood First Policy" and the Congress focusing on bilateral relations and repairing ties with neighboring countries. The CPI(M) and CPI emphasize non-alignment and South-South cooperation. The DMK and Trinamool Congress manifestos reflect concerns over domestic politics and regional issues, such as the treatment of Tamil Nadu fishermen and Chinese territorial claims.

The article also touches on the role of the Indian diaspora, with the BJP and Congress acknowledging its importance in foreign policy. The BJP counts the safe return of citizens abroad as an achievement and promises further engagement, while the Congress proposes re-establishing a ministerial position to address diaspora concerns.

Overall, the manifestos suggest a predominantly inward-looking perspective with broad principles rather than specific positions on international issues. The authors of the article, Amitabh Mattoo and Chetan Rana, provide this analysis, with Mattoo being a Dean and Professor at JNU and Rana an Associate Editor and doctoral candidate.

			<title>Explained: Rationalist Narendra Dabholkhar’s murder case, in which two have been sentenced to life terms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/narendra-dabholkhar-murder-case-sentence-9320105/</link>
			<description>Over a decade after the assassination of Dr. Narendra Dabholkar, a rationalist and anti-superstition activist, a Special UAPA Court in Pune has delivered its verdict. Two men, Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for Dabholkar's murder, while three others were acquitted due to insufficient evidence.

Dr. Dabholkar, who was a prominent figure in the fight against superstition through his organization MANS, was shot dead in Pune in 2013. His murder, along with the killings of other rationalists and activists, sparked national debates on freedom of speech and rational thought.

The investigation into these murders revealed potential links and common perpetrators. Initially, two men were arrested based on ballistic evidence but were later released. The CBI took over the case in 2014, leading to the arrest of Dr. Virendrasinh Tawade, associated with the radical Sanatan Sanstha, and later the actual assailants, Andure and Kalaskar.

The CBI's investigation faced contradictions, with initial suspects being absolved and new ones charged. The agency also struggled to recover the murder weapon, despite efforts to retrieve it from a creek.

The trial highlighted the complexities of the case, with the CBI facing criticism for not thoroughly investigating the higher-ups in the Sanatan Sanstha. The verdict has brought some closure to the case, although questions about a larger conspiracy remain unanswered.</description>

			<title>What are the grounds for challenge to US law forcing TikTok sale</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-are-the-grounds-for-challenge-to-us-law-forcing-tiktok-sale-9319157/</link>
			<description>TikTok Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. are challenging a U.S. law that requires the app to be sold to a non-foreign adversary entity by January 19, 2025. They argue that creating a standalone U.S. TikTok is not feasible for three main reasons: the global nature of the platform's content, the impossibility of transferring the source code to a new team within the given timeframe, and the inability to export TikTok's recommendation engine without Chinese government approval. Despite drafting a National Security Agreement with robust data protection measures and spending $2 billion on its implementation, TikTok and ByteDance claim Congress passed the law without proper justification or addressing actual threats, making it both under-inclusive and over-inclusive. The law also uniquely targets TikTok and ByteDance, while other companies would require a presidential determination to be affected. The challenge is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</description>

			<title>How Olympics got torch relay</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-olympics-got-torch-relay-9319158/</link>
			<description>The article provides a historical and ceremonial overview of the Olympic torch as it arrives in Marseille, France, in anticipation of the upcoming Paris Summer Games. The torch, which was first lit in Olympia, Greece, will be relayed across France, culminating in its arrival in Paris on July 26 for the opening ceremony. The tradition of the Olympic Games dates back approximately 3,000 years, with the Olympics website citing 776 BC as a reference point. The Games not only represent competition but also the possibility of peace, as evidenced by the 9th century BC Olympic Truce. The modern Olympics were revived in 1894 by Pierre de Coubertin, with the first Games of the modern era held in Athens in 1896. The torch relay tradition began with the 1936 Berlin Games, inspired by ancient Greek torch races. The Olympic flame is lit using a mirror method that ensures its purity, a practice that continues today. The torch is carried by thousands across cities and countries, with the final torchbearer's identity, typically a notable sports figure or young leader, kept secret until the opening ceremony. The tradition of torchbearers has evolved to include women and people with disabilities since the 1972 Munich Games. The article concludes with unrelated information about a local water supply shutdown in Mumbai, India, which is not connected to the Olympic torch narrative.</description>

			<title>Meeting nutrition challenge: What new guidelines prescribe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/meeting-nutrition-challenge-what-new-guidelines-prescribe-9319195/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rising concern of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in India, affecting not just adults but also adolescents and children. The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has released comprehensive dietary guidelines for various vulnerable groups, including pregnant and lactating women, children, and the elderly.

**Key points from the guidelines:**
- **Unhealthy diets** are responsible for 56.4% of India's disease burden.
- **Healthy diets and physical activity** can prevent 80% of Type 2 diabetes and reduce heart disease and high blood pressure.
- **Optimal nutrition** from conception to 2 years of age is crucial for growth and preventing undernutrition and obesity.
- The **Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2019** indicated a high prevalence of lifestyle conditions in children, with notable percentages of overweight, obese, diabetic, and pre-diabetic children and adolescents.
- **Micronutrient deficiencies** are prevalent among children, and the guidelines suggest diet charts to address these along with overnutrition diseases.
- **Anaemia** remains a significant issue, with varying prevalence among different age groups of children.
- **Dietary recommendations** include consuming nutrients from at least eight food groups and limiting cereal intake to 45% of total energy. More proteins and essential fatty acids are encouraged, especially for vegetarians.
- **Salt intake** should be limited to 5g per day, and highly processed foods should be avoided.
- **Specific advice for pregnant women, infants, children, and the elderly** focuses on frequent meals, breastfeeding, complementary foods after six months, and a diet rich in proteins, calcium, micronutrients, and fiber for the elderly, along with exercise.

The article emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet and physical activity in combating the rise of NCDs and maintaining overall health across different age groups. It also highlights the shift from traditional undernutrition issues to the current challenges of overnutrition and lifestyle diseases.</description>

			<title>Why agriculture may need a new export-import policy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/agriculture-new-export-import-9318675/</link>
			<description>India's agricultural exports decreased by 8.2% to $48.82 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, down from the previous year's $53.15 billion. This decline was attributed to restrictions on shipments of various commodities, including cereals, sugar, and onions. The fall in exports was led by sugar and non-basmati rice due to government-imposed bans on their export to control domestic availability and food inflation. Wheat and onion exports also faced restrictions, significantly reducing their export values.

Despite these declines, other agricultural products like Basmati rice and spices saw growth, with Basmati rice exports reaching a new high of $5.84 billion. However, exports of buffalo meat, oil meals, and raw cotton did not reach their peak levels from previous years.

On the import side, there was a 7.9% decrease in agricultural imports, primarily due to lower global prices of edible oils, which reduced India's import bill for vegetable fats. Conversely, imports of pulses nearly doubled, reaching the highest level since 2016-17.

The article suggests that farmers and traders seek policy stability and predictability. It criticizes sudden export bans, which can harm producers and disrupt market-building efforts. It recommends a more predictable and rules-based policy approach, such as temporary tariffs instead of outright bans. The current low import duties on pulses and certain oils contrast with the government's goal of promoting crop diversification. The incoming government post-elections is advised to develop a more rational export-import policy that balances the interests of producers and consumers and aligns with the long-term goals of the agricultural sector.</description>

			<title>Can Delhi’s unaided private schools increase fees without govt approval? What HC said</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/delhi-unaided-private-schools-fees-increase-9318530/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has stayed a circular from the Directorate of Education (DoE) that required private unaided schools, which were allotted land by government agencies, to obtain prior approval before increasing fees for the academic year 2024-25. The court's decision referenced a Supreme Court ruling from 2004 to emphasize the prevention of the commercialization of education. The circular in question was based on the Delhi School Education Act, 1973, which mandates that aided schools cannot levy fees or other charges without the Director of Education's sanction.

The circular had directed private unaided schools to submit fee increase proposals for the academic session 2024-25, with the condition that schools allotted land by government agencies must seek prior sanction from the DoE. The court's interim order on April 29 highlighted that, as per a 2019 High Court ruling, unaided recognized private schools are not required to obtain DoE approval before fee hikes, provided they do not engage in profiteering or commercialization of education. This 2019 ruling allowed such schools to increase fees without prior approval, even if they are on land provided at concessional rates by the government. The current stay order is pending a response from the DoE, with the next hearing scheduled for July 31. The 2019 order is under challenge before a two-judge bench.

In a separate note, the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board (KSEAB) is set to release the SSLC results for the exams conducted from March 25 to April 6. The results will be available on the official websites, continuing the trend of girls outperforming boys in previous years.</description>

			<title>Why Assam’s Dhubri constituency consistently records very high voter turnouts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/assam-dhubri-constituency-high-voter-turnout-9318552/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the unusually high voter turnout in Assam's Dhubri constituency during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, contrasting with the general decline in voter turnout across India. Dhubri recorded a 92% turnout, significantly higher than the national average. This pattern is consistent with past elections, where Dhubri has seen turnouts well above the national average. The article suggests that the high turnout is due to the citizenship anxieties of the electorate, many of whom are Muslims of Bengali origin. The presence of a large number of D-Voters (Doubtful Voters) whose citizenship status is disputed, and the ongoing National Register of Citizens (NRC) process, have heightened these concerns. Many travel long distances to vote, fearing non-participation could lead to their names being removed from electoral rolls. The article highlights that maintaining voting records is seen as crucial for those whose citizenship may be questioned.</description>

			<title>A new biocontrol agent to manage ‘foot rot’ disease in Basmati crop: Why this matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/biocontrol-agent-to-manage-foot-rot-disease-in-basmati-crop-9318082/</link>
			<description>The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has developed a new biocontrol agent, **Trichoderma asperellum**, to combat the 'foot rot' disease in Basmati rice crops. This disease, caused by the fungus **Fusarium verticillioides**, primarily affects seedlings and can lead to significant crop loss. Traditional chemical treatments are harmful to both soil and consumers, prompting the need for this eco-friendly alternative.

The new agent, which has been registered with the Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee (CIBRC), shows promise in managing the disease without leaving harmful residues, thus protecting environmental safety and potentially improving Punjab's export prospects. An MOU has been signed for large-scale production and distribution, aiming to make it available for the upcoming farming season. This development is significant for Punjab and Haryana, which together account for over 70% of India's Basmati exports.</description>

			<title>West Nile fever cases detected in Kerala: What is the disease, how can it be prevented?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/west-nile-virus-kerala-symptoms-prevention-9317853/</link>
			<description>The article reports on the outbreak of West Nile fever in Kerala, India, with cases reported in Thrissur, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts. The state's Health Minister, Veena George, has called for vigilance and mosquito control measures. The West Nile Virus (WNV) is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and can cause a fatal neurological disease, though 80% of infected individuals show no symptoms. The virus can also spread through blood transfusion and from mother to child but not through casual contact or consuming infected animals. Symptoms of severe West Nile disease include fever, headache, fatigue, and body aches, with a low death rate. No specific treatment or vaccine exists; only supportive care is provided. Preventive measures include using mosquito repellents and maintaining clean surroundings. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1937 and has since spread globally. In India, WNV activity has been reported since 1952, with the virus isolated from mosquitoes and humans in various states. The article also mentions the release of SSLC exam results in Karnataka, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Is Vietnam’s corruption crackdown rattling the Communist Party?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vietnam-corruption-crackdown-communist-party-9317800/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a series of high-profile resignations within the Vietnamese Communist Party due to unspecified violations and corruption allegations, raising concerns about political stability. Vuong Dinh Hue resigned as National Assembly chairman, following the resignations of President Vo Van Thuong and his predecessor Nguyen Xuan Phuc. These events are part of a broader anti-corruption campaign led by Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Communist Party, which has resulted in numerous government and business leaders being dismissed or jailed.

Vietnam, despite its economic growth and strategic trade partnerships, is criticized for corruption, political censorship, and human rights issues. The recent political turbulence is unprecedented, with three of the country's "four pillars" of leadership stepping down mid-tenure in the past two years, indicating a significant shift in the political landscape.

The article also highlights concerns about the increasing influence of Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security within the Politburo, the party's highest decision-making body, and leaked plans to intensify media censorship and surveillance. This political shakeup occurs as Vietnam strengthens its strategic partnership with the US, its second-largest trade partner after China.

The instability has implications for foreign investment, as evidenced by the reaction to the death sentence of businesswoman Truong My Lan for embezzlement. Despite the challenges, analysts believe the Communist Party will maintain control, though the infighting and personalized politics may cause lasting damage to the party's legitimacy. The article concludes with a mention of the release of SSLC exam results in Karnataka, India, unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lifted the ban on Bank of Baroda's mobile banking app 'bob World', allowing the bank to resume onboarding customers. The ban was initially imposed due to lapses in the customer onboarding process and material supervisory concerns, including allegations of fake onboarding by some employees. Following corrective measures and further steps to address the RBI's concerns, the restrictions were removed. The ban had affected the bank's transaction volumes and the percentage of deposits made through the app. Bank of Baroda has now resumed new customer onboarding through 'bob World'.</description>

			<title>Once upon a tram: The story of India’s tramways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/story-of-indias-trams-tramways-mumbai-9316868/</link>
			<description>The article provides a historical overview of tram services in India, marking the **150th anniversary** of Bombay's first horse-drawn trams which started on **May 9, 1874**. Initially, these trams were slow and economically challenging due to the high number of horses required for operation. Tram services spread to various cities like Patna, Nasik, and Calcutta, where they underwent several transformations, including attempts at steam locomotives which were ultimately unsuccessful due to reliability and pollution issues.

The advent of electric tramways began in Madras in 1895, offering a cleaner and quieter alternative to horse and steam-powered trams. Calcutta and Bombay followed with their own electric trams in the early 1900s. However, by the 1960s, tramways had largely disappeared from Indian cities due to the rise of more efficient transport options like suburban railways and buses, as well as issues like low ridership and economic losses. Today, Kolkata is the only Indian city with operational trams, although they face the threat of discontinuation. The article concludes by noting that this is an edited version of an explainer originally published on February 24, 2023.</description>

			<title>Explained: History of India and Nepal’s border issue</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history-of-india-and-nepals-border-issue-9316954/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing territorial dispute between India and Nepal over a 372-sq-km area that includes Limpiadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani. Nepal's decision to depict these areas on its Rs 100 currency note has been met with criticism and skepticism within Nepal and has provoked a response from India's External Affairs Minister, stating that unilateral actions will not change the ground reality. The dispute dates back to historical treaties and maps, with Nepal claiming historical and evidential ownership, while India maintains control. Despite agreements to resolve the issue diplomatically, there has been little progress, and recent political developments in Nepal have brought the issue back into focus. The article also touches on Nepal's past boundary resolution with China and the potential for future hardships due to the unresolved border issue with India. The situation remains complex, with no consensus within Nepal's political parties and no set timeframe for diplomatic resolution between the two countries.</description>

			<description>Staff Sergeant Gordon Black, a US Army soldier, was detained in Vladivostok, Russia, on allegations of theft from a woman he had a relationship with. Black, who enlisted in 2008 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was last assigned to the Eighth Army in South Korea. Contrary to his orders to return to the US, he traveled to China and then Russia to meet the woman he met in South Korea. Following an argument, the woman reported a theft to the police, leading to Black's arrest. He is accused of stealing 200,000 Russian rubles and is in pre-trial detention until July 2. The Pentagon has initiated an investigation as his travels were unauthorized, and the US State Department advises against travel to Russia. Additionally, two other Americans are currently detained in Russia: journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges and former Marine Paul Whelan, sentenced to 16 years for alleged spying.</description>

			<title>How India, China dominate Europe’s supply of essential drugs — and can Europe do anything about it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/india-china-dominate-europe-supply-of-essential-drugs-9316536/</link>
			<description>The article discusses Europe's dependency on China for pharmaceutical products, particularly antibiotics, and the risks associated with this reliance. It highlights the continent's vulnerability, as seen during the coronavirus pandemic with the shortage of medical masks. The European Union is trying to map out its external dependencies on medicines, but creating a comprehensive pharmaceutical database is challenging due to trade secrets. The generics market, which is crucial for public healthcare, is particularly opaque and complex.

China has been a key player in antibiotic production since the 1980s, and along with India, is a major supplier of pharmaceuticals globally. Germany, while a leader in innovative medications, lags in the generics market due to low profit margins. The German government's strategy to strengthen domestic pharmaceutical production includes streamlining clinical trial approvals, improving access to health data, and encouraging local manufacturing.

Critics argue that Germany needs a new drug pricing system rather than subsidizing unprofitable factories. Recent German legislation aims to incentivize reshoring of pharma production and prevent offshoring by allowing higher drug prices. However, there are concerns about the lack of European production capacity, especially for generics.

The article concludes that despite these efforts, the high costs and regulatory challenges in Europe, contrasted with the advantages enjoyed by Chinese manufacturers, make it unlikely that Europe will achieve pharmaceutical independence from China.</description>

			<title>Who is Devinder Pal Bhullar, in jail for terror since 1995?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/who-is-devinder-pal-bhullar-in-jail-for-terror-since-1995-9316490/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recommendation by Delhi Lieutenant-Governor V K Saxena for a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe against jailed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The probe is suggested due to allegations of Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party receiving $16 million from the banned pro-Khalistani outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). The funding is allegedly linked to facilitating the release of Devinder Pal Bhullar and promoting pro-Khalistani sentiments.

The article provides a detailed timeline of the Bhullar case, starting from the 1993 bombing outside the Indian Youth Congress offices, leading to Bhullar's death sentence in 2001, and subsequent legal developments. It highlights the commutation of his death sentence to life imprisonment in 2014 due to delays in handling his mercy plea. The narrative also covers the efforts by various parties, including the AAP and SAD-BJP governments, to secure clemency for Bhullar, who has been frequently out on parole since 2016.

The Sentence Review Board (SRB) of the Delhi government has repeatedly rejected Bhullar's requests for permanent release, with the latest rejection occurring in January of the current year. The article concludes with statements from Bhullar's lawyer and political figures, emphasizing the need to depoliticize Bhullar's case and address it as a human rights issue. It also mentions a request to the LG by BJP spokesperson R P Singh for a compassionate review of Bhullar's case.</description>

			<title>Why Vietnam wants US to change its ‘non-market economy’ status</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vietnam-us-non-market-economy-9316314/</link>
			<description>Vietnam is actively lobbying the US to reclassify it from a "non-market economy" to a "market economy" to avoid high tariffs. Despite being a significant trade partner and countering China's influence, Vietnam remains labeled as a non-market economy by the US, a status shared with countries like Russia and China. This classification allows the US to impose anti-dumping duties on imports, calculated based on third-country prices, often leading to higher tariffs.

Vietnam contends that its economic reforms justify a reclassification, highlighting its allowance for foreign investment, free wage negotiations, and predominantly private ownership of production means. A change in status would eliminate anti-dumping duties, enhancing the competitiveness of Vietnamese products in the US market. However, opposition from US industries and concerns over aiding Chinese firms operating in Vietnam present challenges to this change. The US Commerce Department's review of Vietnam's status is expected to conclude by late July.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/do-marriages-need-to-be-registered-9315506/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India recently ruled that a Hindu couple was not legally married despite having a marriage certificate because they registered their marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, before performing the necessary wedding rituals. This case highlights the importance of both the registration and solemnization of marriages in India.

Marriage in India is governed by various personal laws and the Special Marriage Act, 1954. For Hindus and Christians, marriage is considered a sacrament and requires specific rituals for validity. For Muslims, marriage is a contractual agreement requiring consent and witnesses, often formalized in a nikahnama.

The article explains that 'court marriage' or 'registered marriage' under the Special Marriage Act is a civil marriage without rituals, while marriages under personal laws like the Hindu Marriage Act are valid only after religious rituals are performed. Registration of a marriage is different from its solemnization and is mandatory in some Indian states.

A marriage certificate is important for official purposes but is not the sole proof of a valid marriage. The law presumes the existence of marriage based on continuous cohabitation, and in legal disputes, evidence such as photographs, witnesses, and acceptance by family can be crucial.

The article concludes with unrelated content about a celebrity, which is not pertinent to the legal discussion on marriage.</description>

			<title>A history of Lok Sabha elections: Indira Gandhi’s triumph and tragedy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/a-history-of-lok-sabha-elections-indiras-triumph-tragedy-9314864/</link>
			<description>The article provides a historical overview of the political turmoil in India during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It begins with the defeat of Indira Gandhi and the rise of the Janata Party, highlighting the prominent figures in Morarji Desai's cabinet. The Janata Party's internal conflicts and the dismissal of Congress-ruled state governments are discussed, leading to the eventual fall of the Janata government. Charan Singh's brief tenure as Prime Minister and the subsequent political maneuvers, including the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from a faction of the Janata Party, are detailed.

The article then shifts to the 1980 general elections, where Indira Gandhi's Congress (I) made a significant comeback. The aftermath of the elections saw the dissolution of non-Congress state governments and the tragic death of Sanjay Gandhi. The narrative concludes with the challenges faced by Indira Gandhi, including Operation Blue Star and her assassination, which led to Rajiv Gandhi becoming Prime Minister.

The article also touches upon the issue of "dual membership" within the Janata Party and the political realignments that followed, including the establishment of the BJP with its new symbol, the 'Lotus'. The piece ends with a reflection on the separatist movement in Punjab and the events leading up to and following Indira Gandhi's assassination.</description>

			<title>Why electric vehicles are at the heart of trade frictions between China and Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/electric-vehicles-china-europe-9314295/</link>
			<description>President Xi Jinping is visiting Europe for the first time in over five years, amidst tensions over trade and espionage allegations. His trip includes stops in France, Serbia, and Hungary, aiming to strengthen ties and possibly secure deals, such as with Airbus. The visit comes as the EU investigates Chinese electric vehicle (EV) subsidies, which could lead to increased tariffs. China's EV exports to the EU have surged, causing concerns over market imbalance. The European Commission has accused some Chinese EV manufacturers of withholding information for the anti-subsidy probe. Concurrently, China is conducting an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy imports. The presence of Chinese-made EVs in the EU market is expected to exceed 25% in 2024, with brands like BYD and SAIC expanding globally. This growth contrasts with the declining presence of European companies in China. The article also briefly mentions the Met Gala event, highlighting Indian fashion entrepreneur Mona Patel's attendance.</description>

			<title>Maharashtra to translocate tigers to Sahyadri reserve: Role of wildlife corridors in tiger conservation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/tiger-translocation-sahyadri-wildlife-corridor-9314268/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the plan to revive the tiger population in Maharashtra's Sahyadri Tiger Reserve (STR) by translocating tigers from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). The success of this project hinges on the security and human disturbance-free status of the Sahyadri-Konkan wildlife corridor, which connects forests in STR, Goa, and Karnataka. The STR has historically suffered from a low tiger population due to poaching, poor prey base, and habitat changes. Translocation is seen as a short-term solution to increase the population, with previous projects in India showing mixed results.

Experts emphasize the importance of wildlife corridors for the long-term success of such projects, as they facilitate tiger dispersal and genetic diversity. The Sahyadri-Konkan corridor, in particular, is vital for connecting tiger populations across the northern Western Ghats. However, human settlements and development activities threaten this corridor, increasing the risk of man-animal conflict. Strengthening the corridor is essential for the success of the translocation plan and the dispersal of a breeding tiger population to other forests.

The article also highlights the role of wildlife corridors in conservation, including mitigation measures like underpasses and wildlife crossings to protect tigers from habitat fragmentation caused by infrastructure projects. The National Tiger Conservation Authority and Wildlife Institute of India have mapped major tiger corridors in India, emphasizing their significance in conservation policy.

Lastly, the article mentions the resistance of Goa's forest department to declare a tiger reserve despite the presence of tigers in the state's protected areas. The importance of these corridors extends beyond wildlife conservation to include water security for local communities and the cultural significance of tigers in the region. Coordination between Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka is crucial for managing these issues. The journalist, Nikhil Ghanekar, is noted for his extensive experience in covering environmental policy matters.</description>

			<title>How a CRISPR gene editing trial was able to treat some cases of inherited blindness</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/crispr-gene-editing-blindness-research-9314245/</link>
			<description>In a groundbreaking clinical trial named "BRILLIANCE," researchers used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool to significantly improve vision in individuals with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a rare form of inherited blindness. The study, led by Eric Pierce of Harvard Medical School and published in The New England Journal of Medicine on May 6, 2024, involved 12 adults and two children. Participants received a single dose of EDIT-101, a CRISPR therapy that corrects the gene mutation responsible for LCA by replacing the defective DNA strand with a healthy one.

The results were promising, with 11 out of 14 participants experiencing improved vision and no serious adverse effects. The trial's success marks a new era in genome editing, with potential applications for treating a variety of diseases. Currently, only one CRISPR treatment, Casgevy for sickle-cell disease, is clinically approved, but ongoing trials are exploring its use for conditions like HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and antibiotic resistance. The study signifies a shift towards not just treating but potentially curing genetic disorders.</description>

			<title>ECI’s letter on deepfakes: What poll panel has said, and what remains unclear</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/eci-deepfakes-9314115/</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued a directive to political parties regarding the use of deepfakes during elections. The ECI has mandated that parties must not disseminate deepfake content on social media and must remove such content within three hours upon discovery. The directive also includes a warning for the individual responsible for sharing the deepfake. While the ECI has not prohibited the use of AI for campaign material, it has emphasized that content must not be misleading or impersonate another person. The ECI's concerns include the potential for manipulated content to influence voter opinions, the protection of women from derogatory content, and the need for parties to report fake accounts and unlawful information. In cases where social media platforms do not act on reports, parties are instructed to approach the Grievance Appellate Committee.

However, there are uncertainties regarding the enforcement of these directives, especially with content shared on encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp, which is widely used in India. The ECI's letter does not address the use of AI-based real-time calls to voters, which occur outside social media platforms. The impact of the ECI's actions on curbing the spread of deepfakes remains to be seen, and the language used in the directives has been criticized for being vague and lacking enforcement power. The article also mentions the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, with Phase 3 commencing and the results to be announced on June 4.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-rafah-invasion-concerns-hamas-9313945/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Israeli Defense Forces' (IDF) operation in Rafah, targeting Hamas infrastructure and militants. The IDF has established control over the Rafah border crossing, citing recent attacks from the area, including one that killed four IDF soldiers. The operation follows Israel's rejection of a peace deal with Hamas and aims to eliminate the group, which Israel equates to "new Nazis."

The article highlights the humanitarian concerns in Gaza, where over 34,000 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in the ongoing military campaign. The United Nations reports a significant increase in Rafah's population due to evacuations from other parts of Gaza, and there are fears of a famine in northern Gaza.

The piece also touches on the historical context of Israeli settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, noting recent legislative changes that could lead to new settlements post-war. Criticism of Israel's actions comes from both international allies, like the United States, and regional players, with warnings of disastrous consequences for an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah.

Lastly, the article mentions the ongoing Lok Sabha elections in India, unrelated to the main topic, and provides a brief update on the voting process.</description>

			<title>Met Gala 2024: What is the event and why is it such a big deal?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/met-gala-2024-9313732/</link>
			<description>The Met Gala, also known as "fashion's biggest night," is an annual fundraising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. Held on the first Monday in May, it's the only wing of the museum that self-funds, doing so through this exclusive party. The event is invitation-only, with celebrities dressing according to a yearly theme that also aligns with the Costume Institute's exhibition. This year's theme was 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,' focusing on historical fashion pieces too delicate for regular display.

The Costume Institute boasts a collection of over 33,000 fashion items, dating back seven centuries. The Met Gala itself began in 1948 and has evolved into a high-profile, globally recognized event, largely attributed to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has been organizing it since 1999. Tickets are highly priced, with this year's tickets at $75,000 and tables starting at $350,000, often purchased by major brands.

The event is shrouded in mystery, with guests not allowed to carry phones, but it's known they view the Costume Institute's exhibits before dinner and enjoy performances by high-profile entertainers. This year's hosts included Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, and Chris Hemsworth, with Indian actress Alia Bhatt among the attendees. The gala is sponsored by various brands, including TikTok, Loewe, and Condé Nast.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: A brief history of religion-based reservations in India; the question of Muslims’ inclusion</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/expert-explains-the-muslim-quota-question-9312311/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complex issue of religion-based reservation in India, a secular country. It explores whether such reservations undermine the principle of secularism and if Muslims have been given reservations by reducing quotas for other groups. The Indian Constitution has evolved from promoting formal equality to substantive equality, allowing for affirmative action and special measures for backward classes. The Supreme Court has interpreted equality as a dynamic concept that may necessitate differential treatment for historically disadvantaged groups.

**Key points include:**
- The Constitution allows for reservation for backward classes not adequately represented in state services.
- Article 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, among others, but allows for special provisions for the advancement of backward classes.
- Some Muslim castes have received reservation not because of their religion but because they were classified as backward classes.
- Historical context shows that Muslim castes have been included in the OBC list and given reservations without affecting the quotas for SCs, STs, and OBCs.
- Legal precedents affirm that reservations for Muslims do not conflict with secularism and that they can be considered for reservation if found socially backward.
- Various commissions and government actions have sought to provide reservations for Muslims, often leading to legal challenges and court decisions that have shaped the current reservation policies.

The article concludes with the ongoing debate and legal scrutiny over the reservation policies for Muslims in India, highlighting the tension between the need for social justice and the principles of secularism. Prof Faizan Mustafa, Vice-Chancellor of Chanakya National Law University, provides expert commentary on the subject. The article also briefly mentions unrelated content, including updates on the IPL 2024 points table and other news snippets, which are not directly related to the main topic.</description>

			<title>What is the banned organisation Sikhs for Justice?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-sikhs-for-justice-alleged-to-have-links-with-aap-9312323/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recommendation by Delhi Lieutenant-Governor V K Saxena for an NIA probe against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The probe is suggested due to allegations of Kejriwal's party receiving $16 million from Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a banned pro-Khalistan group in the US. SFJ, led by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, aims for Sikh self-determination and the creation of Khalistan. Despite advocating non-violence, SFJ has been criticized for glorifying past acts of terrorism and its leaders have made veiled threats against non-Sikhs. India has labeled Pannun a terrorist and banned SFJ under its Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Multiple cases are registered against Pannun and SFJ in India. The article also briefly mentions unrelated content about the current standings in the IPL 2024 points table.</description>

			<title>Why are cancer cases soaring in India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/cancer-cases-india-9311917/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rising cancer cases in India, highlighting individual stories and broader health trends. Praful Reddy, an IT professional with lung cancer, and 12-year-old Dipti with Wilms tumor, represent the growing number of cancer diagnoses, particularly among children. An Apollo Hospitals report calls India the "cancer capital of the world," with a sharp increase in non-communicable diseases. It notes that one in three Indians is pre-diabetic, two in three are pre-hypertensive, and one in ten suffers from depression. The report projects cancer cases to rise from 1.4 million in 2020 to 1.57 million by 2025.

The most common cancers in India are breast, cervix, and ovarian for women, and lung, mouth, and prostate for men. Contributing factors include aging, unhealthy diets, pollution, and climate change. The median age for lung cancer in India is 59, younger than in Western countries. There's a shortage of pediatric oncology facilities, especially in public hospitals, and financial and social barriers hinder treatment access.

Low health screening rates present a challenge, with less than 1% of Indians screened for common cancers, despite WHO recommendations. Experts call for prioritized action, including government incentives for screening and policies for financial protection and expanded services. Without intervention, cancer cases could double by 2040, with many preventable through individual, societal, and governmental efforts. The article concludes with a separate mention of a legal notice sent to a tea startup by Sony Pictures Networks India, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>How Indians became Germany’s largest community of international students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/indians-germany-largest-community-international-students-9311803/</link>
			<description>Indian students have become the largest international student group in Germany, surpassing Chinese students. The number of Indian students in German universities has doubled over the past five years to 43,000 and is projected to reach 45,000-50,000 by the end of 2024. The low cost of education, as higher education in Germany is mostly publicly funded, and the introduction of English-taught courses have contributed to this growth. Over 2,000 degree courses are now offered in English, particularly at the master's level.

Germany has become the third most popular destination for international students globally and the top non-English speaking country. In 2023, Germany issued 16,850 visas to Indian students. Engineering remains the most popular field of study for Indian students in Germany, followed by law, management, social sciences, and mathematics.

The article also notes that Indian students are the largest international student community in the US and are expected to reach one million by 2030. However, Canada has seen an 86% decline in study permits issued to Indian students due to diplomatic issues and a cap on international student permits.

Germany's new Skilled Immigration Act offers a smoother pathway for international students into the German labor market, allowing them to work up to 20 hours per week. This change is expected to further attract Indian students to Germany.</description>

			<title>Why are Lakshadweep coral reefs undergoing severe bleaching?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/lakshadweep-coral-reefs-undergoing-severe-bleaching-9311488/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe coral bleaching in the Lakshadweep Sea, identified by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). The phenomenon, caused by prolonged marine heatwaves since October 2023, poses a threat to the region's diverse marine ecosystems. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the algae living in their tissues due to warm water, leading to a transparent appearance and exposing their white skeleton. Although not immediately fatal, bleached corals risk starvation and disease.

The Lakshadweep Sea has experienced significant coral bleaching events before, but the current scale is unprecedented. Scientists measure the accumulated heat stress using the Degree Heating Week (DHW) indicator, and Lakshadweep has crossed the critical threshold, indicating severe bleaching. The increase in marine heatwaves is attributed to global warming and strong El Niño events, with a notable rise in the Indian Ocean region.

These heatwaves not only threaten coral reefs but also affect seagrass meadows and kelp forests, impacting photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction. The health of coral reefs is crucial for Lakshadweep's structure, and their death could prevent future coral formation. The article also briefly mentions a legal notice sent to Dorje Teas by Sony Pictures Networks India, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>GOLDENE: A sheet of gold that  is only one atom thick</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/goldene-a-sheet-of-gold-that-is-only-one-atom-thick-9310360/</link>
			<description>Researchers at Linköping University in Sweden have created a **one-atom-thick sheet of gold**, named 'goldene', marking the first time a freestanding 2D metal has been formulated. This breakthrough follows the discovery of graphene in 2004 and adds to the growing list of 2D materials. The challenge with metals is their tendency to form nanoparticles, but the team overcame this by replacing a monolayer of silicon with gold atoms, then etching away the surrounding titanium carbide.

The resulting goldene sheets are about **100 nanometres thick**, significantly thinner than the thinnest gold leaf available commercially. The material's potential applications are vast, particularly in the electronics industry, where it could serve as an economical catalyst and reduce the amount of gold needed for electrical conductivity. The technique may also apply to other metals, with efforts underway to create 2D sheets of iridium and platinum.

Goldene's unique structure, where each gold atom has only six neighbors instead of twelve, suggests it may have special properties. Future applications could include environmental and energy solutions like carbon dioxide conversion, hydrogen production, and water purification.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/covid-virus-is-still-here-why-arent-more-people-falling-ill-9310234/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on India's experience with the Covid-19 pandemic, highlighting that the worst phase was in May 2021 with a peak in cases and deaths. It notes that India did not experience further deadly waves after the Omicron surge in early 2022, which led to many infections but fewer severe cases and deaths. The WHO declared Covid-19 no longer a global public health emergency in May 2023, and India lifted all related restrictions shortly after the Omicron wave.

The virus, particularly the JN.1 variant, continues to circulate and cause infections, but not severe disease. Global data shows a decline in cases and deaths, with India reporting minimal cases and deaths despite low testing rates. The article suggests that the lack of severe outbreaks is due to natural immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, although neither provides permanent immunity. Continuous monitoring of the virus is necessary for timely interventions.

The article also mentions unrelated content regarding security operations in Jammu and Kashmir, which is not connected to the Covid-19 discussion.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘Freedom of the press is a precious privilege that no country can forego’, by Gandhi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-upsc-freedom-press-gandhi-9309530/</link>
			<description>World Press Freedom Day, celebrated on May 3, honors the essential principles of journalism, as established by the Declaration of Windhoek in 1992. The day emphasizes the responsibilities of journalists, the importance of a diverse media landscape, and press freedom. Mahatma Gandhi, known for his political leadership, also contributed significantly to journalism, advocating for the power of the press to unite people and reflect societal aspirations. He launched the newspaper Indian Opinion to address the needs of the Indian diaspora and highlight their issues.

Gandhi's perspective on journalism was that it should act as a bridge between different social groups and provide a platform for diverse voices. He also stressed the importance of a free press, free from political and corporate influences, as a means for societal self-reflection and critique. Despite potential biases, Gandhi believed in the press's role in advocating for the marginalized and the need for its freedom to allow for constructive criticism.

The article underscores the significance of press freedom as a privilege that is crucial for a healthy society, allowing for the critique of institutions and ideologies. It suggests that without press freedom, societies risk stagnation and decline due to a lack of feedback mechanisms. The article concludes by highlighting Gandhi's legacy in journalism and the enduring relevance of a free press.</description>

			<title>How Xi Jinping’s Europe visit aims to seize a strategic opportunity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/xi-jinping-europe-visit-strategic-opportunity-9309638/</link>
			<description>Chinese President Xi Jinping's first European visit in five years is marked by a strategic effort to challenge U.S. influence and promote China as a counterweight. Targeting France, Serbia, and Hungary for their openness to China and economic ties, Xi aims to showcase China's growing clout and seek pragmatic relations amidst tensions over China's support for Russia and espionage concerns.

The visit tests Europe's balance between the U.S. and China, with Xi's presence in Serbia during the NATO bombing anniversary symbolizing a critique of U.S. international law adherence. The EU's complex stance on China as a partner, competitor, and rival reflects internal conflicts over economic benefits versus security risks.

Xi's focus on France aligns with President Macron's vision for European strategic autonomy, avoiding subservience to the U.S. and fostering a multipolar world. China's economic growth surpasses the EU's, highlighting the significance of their relationship amidst EU investigations into Chinese subsidies and potential trade tensions.

Xi's tour intends to strengthen China's partnerships in Europe, navigating the continent's divided perspectives and leveraging shared interests to reshape global dynamics. The unrelated content regarding the CISCE results has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Who is Sadiq Khan, the Pakistani-origin Mayor of London now re-elected to the post?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sadiq-khan-pakistan-london-mayor-reelection-9309396/</link>
			<description>Sadiq Khan has been re-elected as the Mayor of London, marking his third consecutive victory and making him the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. His journey from humble beginnings as the son of Pakistani immigrants to a human rights lawyer and then a politician resonated with voters. Khan's political career began with his election as an MP in 2005, and he later became the first Muslim to serve in the cabinet as Minister for Transport. Despite facing criticism over rising violent crime rates, Khan's policies, such as freezing transport fares and tackling air pollution, have maintained his popularity among London's diverse electorate. His recent win is seen as a significant boost for the Labour Party ahead of the UK's general elections set for no later than January 2025. Khan's stance on international issues, like calling for a ceasefire following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, has also contributed to his electoral success.</description>

			<title>IndiGo’s wide-body aircraft order: What makes long-haul, low-cost air travel a tough nut to crack?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/indigo-wide-body-aircraft-order-international-9309030/</link>
			<description>IndiGo, India's largest airline, has placed an order for 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, with an option for 70 more, signaling its ambition to expand into non-stop, long-haul international flights. This move comes after its record order of 500 narrow-body jets last year. The long-haul, low-cost airline model is challenging and has seen many failures, but IndiGo aims to succeed where others have struggled.

The success of low-cost carriers (LCCs) hinges on minimizing costs to offer low fares while maintaining profitability. However, long-haul flights face higher fuel costs and operational complexities, such as the need for additional crew due to longer journey times, which can impact cost control. Wide-body aircraft, like the A350, offer better fuel efficiency but come with higher purchase and maintenance costs.

Effective network planning is crucial for the success of LCCs, with strategies including operating on less competitive routes, using multiple hubs, and serving secondary airports to reduce costs. IndiGo's approach to long-haul flights may include a dual-class cabin configuration and a focus on under-served routes with latent demand.

IndiGo's CEO, Pieter Elbers, has stated that the airline is considering various options for its wide-body fleet, including cabin configuration and amenities, with decisions to be made based on market needs. The airline is experimenting with a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) model for in-flight entertainment and may introduce seat-back screens and other amenities on its A350s.

IndiGo plans to offer direct international flights from multiple Indian cities, not just major hubs, aligning with successful LCC network designs. This strategy, along with potential innovations in service and pricing, could position IndiGo favorably in the long-haul market, leveraging its strong domestic and short-haul international network for connections.

The article also includes an unrelated announcement about the release of ICSE Class 10 and 12 results for 2024, which will be available on May 6 at 11 am on the official website. Last year, the pass percentage for Class 12 was 96.93%, with girls outperforming boys. This information is not related to the main content of the article.</description>

			<title>Israel sanctions: Who has imposed curbs over its Gaza assault?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-sanctions-curbs-over-gaza-assault-9307976/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, focusing on the actions taken by various countries and movements against Israel. Turkey has suspended its $7 billion trade with Israel, demanding a cease-fire and aid for Gaza. This decision was influenced by Israel's stance and the situation in Gaza's Rafah region. Criticism came from Israel's Foreign Minister, while Hamas welcomed the move. Turkey's trade halt includes a wide range of exports and imports, and negotiations are underway to minimize the impact on Palestinians.

France is the only major Western power considering sanctions to compel Israel to withdraw troops and increase humanitarian aid in Gaza. The US, Canada, France, and the UK have already imposed targeted sanctions on Israeli settlers in the West Bank accused of violence. The Biden administration plans to label goods from West Bank settlements to indicate their origin.

Chile has banned Israeli companies from a major aerospace fair and ceased all military cooperation and purchases from Israel. It has also called for an ICC investigation into Israel's actions in Gaza and the occupied territories.

The conflict has stalled the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor project, which aims to enhance integration and counter China's Belt and Road initiative. The project's delay affects the potential normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement promotes nonviolent action against Israel, inspired by South Africa's anti-apartheid efforts. It faces accusations of antisemitism but continues to advocate for boycotts and sanctions. Consumer apps like Boycat support the boycott by identifying products linked to Israel.

Lastly, the article mentions the announcement of the ICSE Class 10 and 12 results for 2024 by CISCE, unrelated to the main topic. The results will be released on May 6, with a notable pass percentage from the previous year.</description>

			<title>What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and why are people worried about it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/artificial-general-intelligence-agi-9307895/</link>
			<description>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has pledged significant investment in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which aims to create machines capable of performing any intellectual task a human can. AGI represents a leap from narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks, to a more generalized intelligence. The concept, dating back to Alan Turing's 1950 paper, holds potential for transformative impacts across healthcare, finance, business, and education. However, it also raises concerns about environmental impact, job loss, socio-economic disparity, and the potential for AGI to become uncontrollable. Prominent figures like Stephen Hawking and AI pioneers have called for strict regulations to align AGI development with human values and safety.</description>

			<title>Why has China sent a mission to the far side of the Moon?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/china-mission-far-side-moon-9307878/</link>
			<description>China's Chang'e-6 mission, launched on May 3, aims to be the first to retrieve samples from the Moon's far side, unseen from Earth. The mission began at the Wenchang Space Launch Center and will take five days to reach lunar orbit. The far side of the Moon, often called the dark side, is of interest due to its unique features such as a thicker crust and more craters compared to the near side. Scientists believe that analyzing far-side samples could reveal the Moon's origins and why its two sides are different.

The 53-day mission will see the orbiter circle the Moon while the lander targets the South Pole-Aitken basin, a large impact site that may contain material from the lunar mantle. After sample collection, an ascent vehicle will rendezvous with the orbiter to return the samples to Earth. This follows China's successful Chang'e-4 mission in 2019, which achieved a soft landing on the far side and explored with a rover. The Chang'e-6 mission continues China's exclusive achievements in far-side lunar exploration.</description>

			<title>What a Blue Corner notice will mean for Prajwal Revanna</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/blue-corner-notice-prajwal-revanna-9307699/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the likelihood of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) issuing a Blue Corner notice for Janata Dal (Secular) MP Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of sexual abuse and has fled to Germany. A Blue Corner notice is one of Interpol's color-coded alerts used to share information on crimes and criminals internationally. It is specifically aimed at gathering additional information about a person's identity, location, or activities in relation to a criminal investigation. The article explains that while Interpol notices are discretionary and cannot compel action, cooperation between countries can lead to effective responses. The article also mentions that India's good relations with Germany may aid in the cooperation between law enforcement agencies to address the case. In the past, Interpol issued a Blue Notice to locate fugitive Godman Nithyananda. The article concludes by mentioning the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's web-series "Heeramandi" on Netflix.</description>

			<title>How international students can (legally) get around Canada’s fixed work hours</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/international-students-legally-bypass-canada-fixed-work-hours-9307530/</link>
			<description>Canada has recently updated its student work regulations, limiting off-campus work for international students to 20 hours per week, which has caused financial difficulties for many. This limit is expected to increase to 24 hours in September, but students are still struggling with high tuition and living costs. The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is considering increasing the limit to 30 hours, but concerns about academic performance have been raised.

International students, particularly from developing countries, are pushing for more work hours to achieve financial independence. With parents typically funding only the first year, students must work to afford their education. New study permit requirements mandate proof of at least $20,635 in savings, plus tuition and travel costs. The high cost of living, including rent and daily necessities, adds to the financial burden.

Students can legally work more than 20 hours by taking on-campus jobs, which offer unlimited work hours. These positions include teaching or research assistants and jobs with on-campus businesses. However, competition for these roles is fierce due to limited availability. Off-campus work restrictions are lifted during summer and winter breaks, allowing full-time employment. On-campus work provides a potential solution for students to support themselves financially while studying in Canada.</description>

			<title>Swell waves likely to hit several coastal areas over the weekend, says INCOIS: What are these waves?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/swell-waves-likely-to-hit-several-coastal-areas-over-the-weekend-says-incois-what-are-these-waves-9307429/</link>
			<description>The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has issued a warning for high sea waves, known as swell waves, expected to affect the coastal regions of Goa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands from May 4 to May 5. Fishermen and coastal residents are advised to suspend beach and nearshore activities due to potential risks.

Swell waves, which are not caused by local winds but by distant storms, can lead to significant flooding, as seen in Kerala in March. These waves originate from strong winds in distant parts of the ocean and can travel great distances before reaching the shore. INCOIS's Swell Surge Forecast System, launched in 2020, provides advanced warnings of such events.

The article also differentiates between swell waves and tsunamis, noting that tsunamis are much faster and associated with underwater earthquakes, while swell waves are generated by atmospheric conditions like storms and can be forecasted in advance.</description>

			<title>Emergency, first non-Congress Govt, and a promise belied</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/emergency-first-non-congress-govt-and-a-promise-belied-9306583/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed account of the political events in India surrounding the 1977 Lok Sabha elections. It highlights the rise of the Janata Party and the fall of Indira Gandhi's Congress post-Emergency. The Emergency period saw widespread arrests and censorship, with Indira Gandhi's election being invalidated due to electoral malpractice. The Janata Party, formed from a merger of four parties, won the election with Morarji Desai becoming the Prime Minister. The Congress suffered a major defeat but retained some strength in the southern states. Internal conflicts within the Janata Party led to instability, and by 1979, Charan Singh briefly became Prime Minister with Congress support, which was soon withdrawn, leading to another election. The article concludes with the notion that this period was a significant experiment in Indian democracy.</description>

			<title>Explained: The Eta Aquariid meteor shower and how it can be spotted</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/eta-aquariid-meteor-shower-visible-9306317/</link>
			<description>The **Eta Aquariid meteor shower**, associated with **Halley's Comet**, is expected to be visible on May 6 and 7. These showers, consisting of space debris entering Earth's atmosphere at high speeds, are an annual occurrence in May. While best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere, they can also be observed in the Northern Hemisphere.

Meteor showers originate from comets, which are icy bodies that release gas and dust when near the Sun, creating a visible tail. The Eta Aquariids are particularly fast, with about 30 to 40 meteors per hour visible from the Southern Hemisphere at their peak. This rate decreases in the Northern Hemisphere due to the position of the radiant in the Aquarius constellation.

For optimal viewing, a clear, dark sky with minimal light pollution is recommended. The Eta Aquariids are visible to the naked eye and can be traced back to their point of origin near the Aquarius constellation. Halley's Comet, the source of these meteors, orbits the Sun every 76 years and was last seen in 1986. It will next appear in 2061. The Orionids in October are another meteor shower caused by this comet.</description>

			<title>What led to Latin America’s record dengue surge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/latin-america-caribbean-record-dengue-surge-9306244/</link>
			<description>Dengue cases in Latin America and the Caribbean have surged to over 5.9 million from January to April 2024, surpassing the total for 2023. The spike is attributed to rising temperatures, fostering ideal conditions for mosquito proliferation. Brazil is the hardest hit, with 4.2 million cases and over 2,000 deaths, leading to states declaring emergencies and setting up field hospitals. Peru, Puerto Rico, and Argentina are also experiencing significant outbreaks, with Central American countries and Mexico reporting early rises in cases.

Climate change, particularly a 0.2°C average temperature increase per decade over 30 years, has expanded mosquito habitats and extended their active season. The 2023 El Niño event and extreme weather, such as untimely rainfall and droughts, have exacerbated the situation, creating more breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Urbanization, especially in shantytowns with standing water and inadequate refuse collection, has also contributed to the spread.

Efforts to develop a dengue vaccine face challenges due to the virus's four strains and the risk of increased susceptibility to other strains after vaccination against one. Current vaccines, like Qdenga and Dengvaxia, are either costly or have limitations. Partnerships and new clinical trials aim to produce more affordable and effective vaccines, but widespread availability is still years away. The Serum Institute of India is also testing a single-shot vaccine, with hopes for future success.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/feroze-rahul-gandhi-rae-bareli-congress-bastion-9306141/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi has filed his nomination for the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat, continuing the Gandhi-Nehru family's long-standing association with the constituency. The family's connection began with Feroze Gandhi in 1952. Over the years, the seat has seen significant events, including Indira Gandhi's election and the controversy that led to the Emergency. Post-Emergency, the constituency witnessed a non-Congress victory but returned to Congress control in subsequent elections. Sonia Gandhi has maintained the seat since 1998, despite strong challenges from BJP candidates. The current contest is between Rahul Gandhi and Dinesh Singh, reflecting the ongoing political dynamics in Rae Bareli.</description>

			<title>On World Press Freedom Day, the story of India’s first newspaper – ‘Hicky’s Bengal Gazette’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/world-press-freedom-day-india-first-newspaper-9306034/</link>
			<description>World Press Freedom Day, celebrated on May 3, highlights the pivotal role of journalism. The first newspaper in India, Hicky's Bengal Gazette, was launched on January 29, 1780, by James Augustus Hicky. Initially catering to the British in Calcutta and filled with gossip, the Gazette also exposed government corruption and criticized the British East India Company, leading to its shutdown due to libel suits.

Andrew Otis, in his book "Hicky's Bengal Gazette: The Untold Story of India’s First Newspaper," delves into Hicky's life, from his arrival in India to his imprisonment, where he started his printing business. The Gazette, Asia's first newspaper, covered local issues, civic problems, and even Calcutta's frequent fires, influencing policy changes like the ban on thatch houses.

Despite avoiding political issues initially, Hicky's Gazette became a platform for social commentary and criticism, leading to legal troubles and Hicky's financial ruin. Otis credits Hicky with contributing to the growth of Indian journalism, which persisted despite British repression. The legacy of the Gazette and its influence on Indian-owned presses and the spread of anti-colonial sentiment is a testament to the enduring power of the press.</description>

			<title>Can Yulia Navalnaya unite the Russian opposition?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/yulia-navalnaya-russian-opposition-9305595/</link>
			<description>Following the death of her husband Alexei Navalny, Yulia Navalnaya has decided to take over his Anti-Corruption Foundation and continue his work. She has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being responsible for her husband's death and has stated that an investigation is in progress. Alexei Navalny, who died at 47, was known for his political activism against corruption in Russia, which led to severe repercussions from the authorities.

Yulia Navalnaya, who met Alexei in 1998 and married him in 2000, has been a supportive partner throughout his political journey, even though she never aspired to be a politician herself. Despite her own academic and professional background, she chose to assist her husband with his work. Her role became increasingly significant as Alexei Navalny's political influence grew.

The article recounts various challenges the couple faced, including Alexei's arrest and conviction on embezzlement charges, which was widely seen as politically motivated. Yulia's support was crucial during these times, and she earned the nickname "First Lady" of the opposition when Alexei ran for mayor of Moscow.

Observers now see Yulia Navalnaya as a potential unifying symbol for the Russian opposition, with some suggesting she could become a moral symbol of resistance. Her determination and involvement in her husband's political career have been highlighted as key factors in her rise as a prominent figure in the opposition movement. She has expressed a commitment to fight for a new Russia, one that aligns with the vision of dignity, justice, and love that Alexei Navalny had championed. Her message is one of resilience and encouragement to continue the struggle without fear.</description>

			<title>Why is a Reliance Capital Ltd investor challenging its resolution plan?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/reliance-capital-ltd-challenge-resolution-plan-9305148/</link>
			<description>An investor, Harsh Mehta, has filed a writ petition challenging SEBI's delisting regulations and the NCLT's approval of a resolution plan for Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL), which is undergoing insolvency proceedings. The challenged regulation exempts delisting as per an IBC-approved resolution plan from the standard delisting norms. Mehta, who holds a small percentage of RCL shares, argues that this exemption fails to protect investors' interests, as it allows for the delisting of shares without prior intimation or approval from public shareholders. The resolution plan approved by NCLT, submitted by IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL), proposes to cancel and extinguish the entire share capital of RCL for nil consideration, effectively reducing the liquidation value of equity shareholders to zero and impacting 98.49% of public shareholders. The petitioner contends that this process undermines the interests of equity shareholders and violates the SEBI Act, 1992. The trading of RCL shares is currently suspended following the NCLT order.</description>

			<title>Why Congo’s latest Mpox outbreak is concerning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/why-congos-latest-mpox-outbreak-is-concerning-9304630/</link>
			<description>The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing a significant Mpox outbreak, with over 4,500 suspected cases and nearly 300 deaths reported since January. This marks a substantial increase from the previous year. The outbreak has been declared a health emergency, and cases have also been reported in the neighboring Republic of Congo.

A new form of Mpox, detected in the mining town of Kamituga in eastern Congo, is believed to be more transmissible among humans. This is attributed to genetic mutations resulting from sustained human transmission, in a population with limited contact with the wild animals that are natural carriers of the disease.

Dr. Placide Mbala-Kingebeni, who leads a lab at Congo's National Institute of Biomedical Research, notes that the new form of the disease presents milder lesions primarily on the genitals, making diagnosis more challenging. The disease's transmission through sexual contact has been confirmed, with a significant number of cases found in sex workers.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the mutations may necessitate a revised testing strategy. There are concerns about silent transmission if patients do not seek medical attention. Two clades of Mpox exist, with Clade 1 being more severe. A new form of Clade 1 has been identified, potentially linked to over 240 cases and at least three deaths in Kamituga.

Despite the urgent situation, Congo has had limited access to Mpox vaccines and treatments. The health minister has authorized vaccine use in high-risk areas, and discussions are underway with countries like Japan to secure funding for vaccines. However, WHO's emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, highlighted the lack of financial investment from donors to address the Mpox spread in Africa and beyond.</description>

			<title>The flight of Prajwal Revanna: How diplomatic passports, visa regimes work</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/flight-of-prajwal-revanna-how-diplomatic-passports-visa-regimes-work-9304621/</link>
			<description>Janata Dal (Secular) MP Prajwal Revanna, after being accused of sexual abuse, fled to Germany using a diplomatic passport. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that Revanna did not require a visa note for Germany due to a visa exemption agreement between India and Germany. Diplomatic passports, which are maroon and have a shorter validity than normal passports, grant the holder certain international law privileges, including immunity from arrest and legal proceedings in the host country.

Diplomatic passports are issued to a range of individuals, including those with diplomatic status, government officials on official business, certain ranks of the Indian Foreign Service, and their families, as well as MPs and union ministers representing the government abroad. The validity of these passports is tied to the term of the MP. Despite the visa exemption, Prajwal was still required to seek political clearance for his travel, which he did not.

Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has requested the cancellation of Prajwal's diplomatic passport and his return to India to face legal action. However, the government can only revoke the passport following a court order, as per the Passport Act 1967, which allows revocation for wrongful possession, suppression of material information, or if deemed necessary by the passport authority in the interest of India's sovereignty, integrity, or international relations. A diplomatic passport can also be revoked if the holder is convicted by a court in India or upon court orders during criminal proceedings.</description>

			<title>Australian media reports Indian spies ‘kicked out’: In the world of spycraft, why national interest trumps all</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/in-the-world-of-spycraft-why-national-interest-trumps-all-9304549/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a series of allegations against India regarding espionage and covert operations abroad. Reports from Australia, the US, the UK, and Canada have accused Indian operatives of various acts, including attempting to steal sensitive information and being involved in assassination plots. India has denied these allegations, with varying responses that reflect its strategic positions. The incidents have raised concerns among the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network countries, which include the accusers and have strategic ties with India. The article suggests that while espionage is a common practice among nations, the public outing of Indian operatives by these countries indicates a pushback against India's covert activities. The narrative also touches upon India's foreign policy, its reliance on ancient statecraft principles from the Arthashastra, and the importance of intelligence in national security. It concludes with the perspective that intelligence operations should remain consistent regardless of diplomatic relations, as per the insights of a former R&amp;AW chief. The article also briefly mentions unrelated domestic political developments in India.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/article-361-immunity-shield-until-governor-in-office-9304516/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the constitutional immunity provided to the President and Governors in India, which protects them from being named as accused or investigated for criminal proceedings while in office. This immunity is outlined in Article 361 of the Constitution. The article cites several instances where this immunity has been applied, such as the case of former UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, who was not tried for criminal conspiracy charges while serving as the Governor of Rajasthan. It also mentions cases where Governors resigned following allegations of misconduct, such as V Shanmuganathan of Meghalaya and N D Tiwari of Andhra Pradesh. The article references a Supreme Court ruling that affirms the complete immunity of Governors from legal action for acts performed in their official capacity. Additionally, the article briefly touches on the casting of Sanjay Dutt in the film Munna Bhai, despite his industry ban, and the subsequent success of the film and its sequels.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/zhang-yongzhen-china-protest-covid-9304108/</link>
			<description>Dr. Zhang Yongzhen, the scientist who first published the Covid-19 genome sequencing, has regained access to his lab in China after a protest against its closure. His early work was pivotal for vaccine development and understanding the virus. Despite an eviction and a dispute with the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, authorities have allowed him to continue his research. Zhang's initial findings in January 2020 linked the virus to SARS and were shared globally, aiding in vaccine and testing kit development. However, his lab was shut down for "rectification" shortly after publishing the data. Recent tensions involve lab closures for renovation, with Zhang's collaborators expressing difficulties in continuing their work. Posts by Zhang on these events have been removed from Chinese social media, indicating a possible government clampdown on medical professionals and activists discussing Covid-19. The full nature of the lab dispute remains unclear.</description>

			<title>How to decide domestic violence damages: injury or ability to pay?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/domestic-violence-damages-sc-9303952/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is considering whether compensation in domestic violence cases should be based on the severity of violence or the perpetrator's financial capacity. This follows a petition challenging a directive for a man to pay Rs 3 crore to his wife under the Domestic Violence Act. The Act aims to protect women's rights within the family, defining domestic violence broadly to include physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.

The petitioner's counsel argues that compensation should reflect the harm suffered, not the standard of living or income of the parties involved. The Act allows for monetary relief consistent with the aggrieved person's standard of living, but the debate centers on whether this should apply to compensation for damages.

Legal precedents suggest maintenance should prevent destitution and align with the spouse's capacity to pay, with the Supreme Court previously ruling that alimony should fit the parties' status and the payer's financial ability. The current case raises questions about the legal framework for calculating damages in domestic violence cases, as there is a lack of clear precedents, leading to the application of maintenance case laws to domestic violence situations. The court's decision could clarify the legal approach to compensation in such cases.</description>

			<title>Why Theodor Herzl wanted to establish a sovereign Jewish state</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/why-theodor-herzl-wanted-to-establish-a-sovereign-jewish-state-9303721/</link>
			<description>Theodor Herzl, born on May 2, 1860, in Budapest, is recognized as the father of modern Zionism. Encountering anti-Semitism from a young age, Herzl initially believed Jews could assimilate to overcome prejudice. However, witnessing the Dreyfus Affair in France, where a Jewish officer was wrongfully convicted, changed his perspective. In 1896, Herzl published "Der Judenstaat," advocating for Jewish self-determination and a separate state as the solution to anti-Semitism.

Herzl proposed Argentina or Palestine for this state, favoring the latter due to its historical significance. He tirelessly lobbied influential figures for support and organized the first World Jewish Conference in 1897, which led to the establishment of a Zionist organization aiming to create a legally recognized Jewish homeland.

Despite opposition from some Jews and not being the first to advocate for a Jewish homeland, Herzl's vision and political efforts were pivotal. They contributed to the broader Jewish support for a nation-state and influenced the Balfour Declaration and the eventual creation of Israel in 1948. Herzl passed away in 1904, but his legacy endures, with his remains interred at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is the only individual mentioned in Israel's declaration of independence, highlighting his foundational role in the state's creation.</description>

			<title>Should Shariat law apply to former Muslims in succession matters? The question before SC</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/shariat-law-succession-inheritance-sc-9303528/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is set to examine if a person who has left the Muslim faith should be governed by Muslim personal law or secular laws in matters of succession. This follows a plea by Safiya PM, representing former Muslims in Kerala, who argues for the right to be governed by secular laws, particularly the Indian Succession Act of 1925, in both intestate and testamentary succession cases.

The case raises questions about the application of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, which dictates inheritance rules based on Islamic teachings. Safiya's plea is backed by the Supreme Court's 2018 Sabarimala ruling, emphasizing the freedom of religion, including the right to not follow any religion, without facing discrimination in civil rights such as inheritance.

The current law stipulates specific shares for various relatives, with provisions that can disadvantage women and non-Muslims. The petitioner's advocate highlighted the adverse effects of these provisions on individuals like Safiya, who may be prejudiced under the current laws.

Safiya's petition seeks to challenge Sections 2 and 3 of the 1937 Act, which mandate the application of Shariat in certain matters for Muslims. The court's decision to hear the case acknowledges the potential legal vacuum for those who leave the Muslim faith and seek a secular framework for inheritance. The court has sought responses from the government and will revisit the case in July. The article also briefly mentions an unrelated IPL cricket match update.</description>

			<title>Why has private wheat purchase surged in Punjab?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/private-wheat-purchase-punjab-9303319/</link>
			<description>In Punjab, during the current Rabi season, there has been a significant **47% increase** in the private purchase of wheat compared to last year. As of May 1, the state's grain markets have received **109.57 lakh metric tonnes (LMT)** of wheat, with **107.69 LMT** already purchased. Private entities, such as flour millers and processors, have bought **6.18 LMT**, which is a substantial increase from the **4.19 LMT** purchased last year.

There are approximately **70 roller flour mills** in Punjab, with an annual processing capacity of around **12 LMT**. These mills primarily supply atta, sooji, and maida within Punjab and to other states. However, most of their wheat is procured from outside the state, with only **25-30%** sourced locally. The rest comes from the Food Corporation of India’s e-auction or from states like Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, where wheat is cheaper.

This year, Punjab millers have already purchased over **50%** of their annual wheat consumption. The increase in local purchases is attributed to higher prices in other states and changes in the quota under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). The Minimum Support Price (MSP) in Rajasthan, for instance, is **Rs 2,400 per quintal**, prompting millers to offer **Rs 5-10 more per quintal** than the MSP in Punjab.

The millers, represented by Naresh Ghai, seek a transparent government policy on the open market sale price of wheat to better manage price fluctuation risks. The current trend of increased private wheat purchases in Punjab reflects their efforts to optimize procurement strategies and minimize financial risks.</description>

			<title>US Fed will keep rates steady amid high inflation: Why this matters for the global economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-fed-policy-inflation-interest-rates-9302996/</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark rate steady, despite an increase in inflation. This decision diverges from earlier predictions of multiple rate cuts in 2024, with the current consensus being a single cut. The consumer price index rose more than expected, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that rate cuts would not be considered until there is greater confidence that inflation is moving towards the 2% target. The Fed's stance has affected market enthusiasm, with the S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 experiencing declines after the announcement.

The Fed's monetary policy, particularly the federal funds rate, plays a crucial role in influencing employment and inflation by affecting credit availability and cost. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and spending, which can stimulate economic growth. However, the policy's impact on inflation and employment is not immediate.

A potential rate cut by the Fed could positively affect emerging markets like India, as it may widen the interest rate differential, making such countries more attractive for currency carry trade. It could also boost US growth, which is beneficial for global growth, and influence emerging market equities and currency markets.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept its repo rate unchanged, with expectations of a rate cut later in the year, likely after the Fed's rate cut. The RBI's last rate cut was in May 2020, and since then, it has increased the rate to combat inflation. The RBI aims to maintain inflation at 4%, with a 2% margin on either side.

Lastly, President Joe Biden highlighted the positive contributions of immigrants to the US economy and criticized xenophobia, contrasting his views with former President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant stance.</description>

			<title>What is the role of hydropower in a world facing increasing drought?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/hydropower-drought-9302102/</link>
			<description>Hydropower, a clean energy source providing more electricity than all other renewables combined, faces challenges due to climate change. Droughts, particularly those driven by El Niño, have led to power shortages in Ecuador and Colombia, countries heavily reliant on hydropower. The vulnerability of hydropower to climate-induced weather patterns, such as droughts and floods, is an increasing concern. The first half of 2023 saw a historic drop in global hydropower output, with an 8.5% decrease attributed to droughts, likely worsened by climate change.

Countries with high dependence on hydropower, like those in Africa, are especially vulnerable to climate impacts due to limited alternative power generation and transmission infrastructure. Diversifying power sources and integrating renewable technologies like wind and solar are suggested solutions. Innovations like floating solar panels on reservoirs could complement hydropower generation.

Despite these risks, hydropower is still seen as crucial for decarbonizing the global economy. Medium-scale plants are recommended over mega dams to mitigate climate risks. The International Energy Agency predicts that while hydropower will be surpassed by wind and solar, it will remain the largest source of renewable electricity into the 2030s. However, a slowdown in industry growth could impact net-zero goals. Doubling hydropower capacity by 2050 is necessary to limit global temperature increases to 1.5°C, requiring significant investment.

Better water management and integration with other renewables can improve hydropower's resilience to drought. Hydropower also stabilizes electricity generation, acting as a large battery that can quickly adjust output. Pumped-storage schemes, which recycle water, offer additional resilience to drought compared to traditional hydropower.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the political dynamics in Pakistan following the elections, highlighting the surprising strength of Imran Khan's position despite the military's influence. It notes that the military can no longer dictate politics as before, and the traditional political parties, PPP and PML-N, are now in a coalition with the military, which is expected to be short-lived due to economic challenges. Nawaz Sharif is taking a backseat, grooming Maryam as his political heir, while Shehbaz Sharif focuses on infrastructure projects. The article also touches on the broader geopolitical context, including Pakistan's reduced leverage following the US's shift in focus to other global issues and the need for India to engage with Pakistan as part of its foreign policy, despite the current impasse in relations. It concludes with observations on the China-Pakistan relationship and the structural economic challenges Pakistan faces.</description>

			<title>What marijuana reclassification means for the United States</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/marijuana-reclassification-united-states-9301901/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a proposal by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, acknowledging its medical uses but not legalizing recreational use. The process involves reviews and public comments, and while it doesn't immediately change the legal status, it's seen as a significant shift. President Biden supports the move, which aligns with his stance on medical marijuana. The reclassification could impact research, as Schedule III drugs are easier to study, and reduce taxes for cannabis businesses. However, it doesn't address banking issues faced by the industry. Critics argue the change is either too political or not substantial enough, with some advocating for complete removal from the controlled substances list. The article also mentions President Biden's views on immigration and his criticism of xenophobia.</description>

			<title>Why can accused persons in prison contest polls but not vote?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/accused-persons-prison-poll-vote-9301880/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the legal nuances of the right to vote and the right to be elected in India, particularly in the context of imprisoned individuals. It highlights that while free and fair elections are considered a basic constitutional principle, the rights to elect and be elected are statutory rights and not fundamental rights. This distinction allows for certain restrictions, such as those outlined in the Representation of People Act, 1951 (RP Act). 

**Key points include:**
- **Amritpal Singh**, a jailed leader, intends to run for Lok Sabha elections, but cannot vote due to his imprisonment.
- The Supreme Court has ruled that the rights to vote and be elected are statutory, not fundamental, which means they can be regulated by law.
- **Section 8 of the RP Act** disqualifies individuals from contesting elections upon conviction of certain offenses, with a further six-year ban after release.
- There have been legal challenges to this section, but the Supreme Court has maintained that only the legislature can amend the RP Act.
- The **Election Commission of India** can reduce disqualification periods, as seen in the case of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang.
- Convicted MPs or MLAs can contest elections if their conviction is stayed on appeal.

			<title>Why is China more important for Tesla than India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/china-more-importanttesla-india-9301824/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk's recent visit to Beijing, after postponing his trip to India, highlights China's pivotal role in Tesla's global supply chain. China leads in electric vehicle (EV) sales and battery production, with CATL, a key Tesla supplier, dominating two-thirds of the global market. Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, its largest and first outside the U.S., produces over a million Model 3 and Model Y vehicles annually for various markets.

India, while a potential player in the global EV market, currently depends on battery imports and has a disjointed supply chain. The country is promoting domestic battery production through incentives and aims to capture a significant market share by 2030. India's recently released EV policy reflects a shift in stance, easing duties on car imports to encourage foreign investment.

Despite China's strong position, its EV exports face scrutiny in Europe and the U.S. over subsidy concerns, which may create opportunities for India. The European Commission is investigating China's BEV subsidies, and the U.S. views Chinese EVs as a competitive threat, indicating a complex and evolving landscape for the global EV industry. President Biden's remarks on immigration further underscore the geopolitical dynamics affecting the sector.</description>

			<title>May Day: Why May 1 is observed as Labour Day</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/may-labour-day-9301436/</link>
			<description>May Day, observed on May 1st, is known as International Workers' Day or Labour Day in various countries, honoring the labor movement's achievements. The day's significance dates back to the late 19th century, particularly the Haymarket Affair in Chicago on May 4, 1886. This event saw a violent confrontation between police and labor protesters after a bomb exploded during a rally, resulting in casualties on both sides. The aftermath led to the arrest of numerous protesters, with some receiving harsh sentences. Those who died were commemorated as "Haymarket Martyrs," and the incident profoundly impacted the labor movement, advancing the push for improved labor conditions globally.

The US recognized Labor Day as a federal holiday in 1894, celebrated on the first Monday of September, a practice later adopted by Canada. However, it wasn't until 22 years of protests that the US acknowledged the eight-hour workday. In contrast, The Second International chose May 1st to honor International Workers' Day in 1889, a date later reinforced by the International Socialist Congress for global demonstrations advocating for workers' rights.

Post the Russian Revolution in 1917, May Day gained prominence in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, often marked by parades showcasing military strength. In India, May Day was first celebrated in 1923, initiated by the Labour Kisan Party and led by Comrade Singaravelar, who advocated for it to be a national holiday.

The article also mentions President Joe Biden's views on immigration and its positive impact on the US, contrasting it with the xenophobic attitudes from certain countries and former President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.</description>

			<title>How the next government will push ‘balanced fertilisation’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/next-government-balanced-fertilisation-fertiliser-9301446/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the issue of balanced fertilisation in India and the government's policy goals post-Lok Sabha elections. It highlights the record consumption of urea at 35.8 million tonnes in the fiscal year ending March 2024, despite measures like neem coating to improve nitrogen use efficiency and reduce illegal diversion for non-agricultural uses. The article explains that balanced fertilisation involves supplying crops with primary, secondary, and micro-nutrients in the right proportions, which is crucial for plant growth and yield.

The Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS) system, introduced in April 2010, aimed to promote balanced fertilisation by linking subsidies to nutrient content, encouraging the use of complex fertilisers with balanced nutrient proportions. However, the exclusion of urea from NBS led to its increased consumption, undermining the system's objectives.

Recent price controls on non-urea fertilisers have led to nutrient imbalances, with DAP becoming the "new urea" due to its lower price compared to complex fertilisers, leading to over-application by farmers. The article suggests that a proper price hierarchy among non-urea fertilisers and bringing urea under NBS could help promote balanced plant nutrition.

The article also touches on India's heavy dependence on imported fertilisers and the impact of global prices on the country's subsidy burden. It mentions the Centre's approval of sulphur-coated urea and the potential for more balanced fertilisation policies in the future.

Lastly, the article includes unrelated content about President Joe Biden's views on immigration, contrasting his stance with former President Donald Trump's rhetoric, which is not related to the main topic of fertilisation policies.</description>

			<title>Chocolate industry meltdown: What led to the rise in prices of cocoa beans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/chocolate-prices-cocoa-beans-9301190/</link>
			<description>The chocolate industry is facing a crisis due to a significant increase in cocoa bean prices, which have quadrupled from the previous year, reaching $12,000 per tonne. This surge is attributed to a combination of factors including El Niño, climate change, black pod disease, and the low income of cocoa farmers in West Africa, particularly Ghana and Ivory Coast, which produce 60% of the world's cocoa. The bad harvest caused by El Niño and exacerbated by climate change has led to a predicted global cocoa shortfall of 374,000 tonnes for the 2023-2024 season. Consequently, chocolate prices in the US have risen by 11.6%.

Climate change poses a long-term threat to cocoa production, with erratic rainfall and extreme weather events affecting the moisture-sensitive trees. The situation is worsened by the low wages paid to cocoa farmers, who earn less than $1.25 a day, pushing them below the United Nations' poverty line. The financial struggles of these farmers have led to a decrease in investments for increasing yield and combating climate change, and have resulted in the prevalence of slave and child labor on cocoa farms.

Despite the hardships faced by farmers, the four largest chocolate companies have reported substantial profits, yet they have done little to improve the farmers' income. Experts and researchers argue that these companies could redistribute wealth along the supply chain to alleviate the situation, but without such measures, the scarcity of cocoa beans and the exploitation of farmers are likely to continue, further driving up chocolate prices.</description>

			<title>Why the Booker Prize’s links to slavery have come under criticism, again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/booker-slavery-link-9301160/</link>
			<description>The Booker Prize, a prestigious literary award, has been scrutinized for its historical ties to slavery through its original sponsor, the Booker Group. The controversy arose when BBC Radio host Richie Brave highlighted the Booker brothers' role as enslavers in the early 1800s. The Booker Prize website has since updated its language to reflect this accurately.

Established in 1969, the Booker Prize was initially exclusive to Commonwealth writers but later expanded globally. It was sponsored by the Booker Group until 2001, followed by the Man Group until 2019, and is currently sponsored by the charity Crankstart.

The Booker brothers' wealth stemmed from their involvement in the slave-driven sugar and cotton industries in British Guyana. Post-slavery, they received compensation for emancipated slaves and continued exploitation by employing indentured laborers from India, significantly impacting Guyana's demographic.

Philosopher John Berger, who won the prize in 1972, protested its slavery links by donating part of his prize money to the British Black Panther movement. More recently, novelist Kiley Reid addressed the challenge of reconciling the prize's past with its present significance, noting the pervasive legacy of racism in institutions. The article also touches on broader historical and social contexts, including the division of South America by European powers and the subsequent exploitation of African and Indian populations.</description>

			<title>Why Bombay High Court said banks can’t seek LOCs to stop debtors from going abroad</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/high-court-banks-debtors-abroad-9299608/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court has ruled that **public sector banks (PSBs) cannot request the issuance of Look Out Circulars (LOCs)** against loan defaulters. This decision invalidates the central government's Office Memoranda that previously allowed PSBs to do so. The court found that such LOCs, which prevent debtors from leaving the country, are violative of fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

The LOCs were challenged as they were seen as bypassing legal processes and were based on a clause that allowed PSB heads to request LOCs against defaulters, including guarantors and corporate officers. The petitioners argued that this infringed upon their fundamentalThe Bombay High Court has ruled that public sector banks cannot request Look Out Circulars (LOCs) against loan defaulters, overturning government provisions allowing this. The court found LOCs to be a violation of fundamental rights, emphasizing that banks shouldn't have unilateral power in such matters. It also criticized the distinction between public and private banks in issuing LOCs, calling it arbitrary. The judgment doesn't affect existing orders but suggests recourse through courts or the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act. The verdict can be challenged in the Supreme Court, and the government can frame laws consistent with constitutional rights.</description>

			<title>SC rejects application of ‘eggshell skull’ rule in a case: What is this legal principle?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/eggshell-skull-rule-9299405/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India reinstated a compensation of Rs 5 lakhs for medical negligence to Jyoti Devi, which was initially awarded by the district consumer forum but later reduced by the state and national consumer courts. The case highlighted the 'eggshell skull' legal principle, which holds an offender liable for all injuries caused, even if the victim has a pre-existing condition that exacerbates the injury. This principle was incorrectly applied in Jyoti's case, as she did not have a pre-existing condition that would have caused 'unusual damage'. The Supreme Court's decision was based on the prolonged suffering of Jyoti for over five years and the decade-long duration of the legal process. The 'eggshell skull' rule, also known as the 'thin skull rule', originates from an 1891 case in the US and is a common law principle in civil litigation for claiming enhanced compensation.</description>

			<title>Covishield could cause blood clots in very rare cases, manufacturer AstraZeneca has said. What does this mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/covishield-blood-clots-astrazeneca-tts-9298942/</link>
			<description>AstraZeneca has acknowledged that its AZD1222 vaccine, known as Covishield in India, has a very rare risk of causing low platelet counts and blood clots, known as Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS). This admission came to light through court documents related to a lawsuit in the UK, where individuals affected by TTS after receiving the vaccine are seeking damages.

The Indian government had previously advised caution when administering Covishield to individuals with low platelet counts. Several European countries temporarily halted the use of the vaccine in 2021 due to blood clotting concerns. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risk of TTS is very low, with data suggesting a rate of four cases per million adults in the UK and one per 100,000 in the EU.

In India, the government reported 26 potential thromboembolic events following the administration of Covishield, equating to a very low incidence rate. A committee on Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) confirmed 36 cases of TTS caused by Covishield, including 18 deaths, most of which occurred in 2021. Despite this, the Union Health Ministry maintains that the benefits of Covishield outweigh the risks, especially for preventing Covid-19 infections and reducing deaths. It also noted that the risk of blood clotting is significantly lower in South and Southeast Asian populations compared to European descent.

In 2023, the WHO updated its classification of TTS to include vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). The overall stance is that while there is a risk of TTS, it remains exceedingly rare, and the vaccines have a positive benefit-risk profile.</description>

			<title>Elon Musk visits China: Why rolling out Full Self-Driving cars matters for Tesla</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/elon-musk-china-self-driving-cars-tesla-9298563/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk has reportedly received tentative approval to introduce Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology in China. This comes after a meeting with Chinese officials and could be a significant boost for Tesla, which faces slowing demand in the US and competition in China. Tesla may continue its partnership with Baidu for mapping and navigation services essential for FSD, but it's uncertain if this will restrict Tesla from exporting FSD data to the US.

FSD is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that enhances safety and convenience, and Tesla aims to release it as a supervised autonomy system in markets where it can obtain regulatory approval. Tesla's vehicles come with an 'Autopilot' feature, which includes functions like 'Traffic-Aware Cruise Control' and 'Autosteer'. FSD adds capabilities like navigating on Autopilot, suggesting lane changes, and automatic parking, among others. These features are continuously improved through over-the-air updates.

The introduction of FSD in China could help Tesla compete better in the world's largest auto market. Despite annual promises since 2014, full self-driving technology remains a challenge for Tesla and other carmakers. Issues have included traffic violations and difficulties in recognizing pedestrians and cyclists. Tesla's approach to beta testing FSD with regular drivers has raised concerns, especially as it involves public road testing by drivers who paid for the feature.

The broader industry faces challenges in developing full self-driving cars, with debates over the best technology to use, such as cameras versus a combination of sensors. Tesla relies mainly on cameras, while others use a mix of technologies. The complexity of real-world AI and the need for extensive autonomous driving data are significant hurdles in achieving fully autonomous driving. Regulatory scrutiny over the safety of these systems continues, with investigations into Tesla's driver monitoring improvements and the adequacy of its vehicle recalls.</description>

			<title>Why RBI has advised banks to refund borrowers for overcharging on interest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-banks-overcharging-interest-9298344/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified unfair lending practices by banks and NBFCs, such as charging excess interest from the date of loan sanction or agreement, rather than from the actual disbursement date. In cases where loans were disbursed by cheque, interest was charged from the date of the cheque issuance, not when the cheque was given to the customer. Some banks charged interest for an entire month even if the loan was repaid within the month and collected advance installments while still charging interest on the full loan amount.

In response, the RBI issued a directive on April 29, instructing banks and NBFCs to review and correct their loan disbursal and interest charging practices to ensure fairness and transparency. The RBI's supervisory teams have advised banks to refund any excess interest and charges. The RBI emphasizes adherence to the Fair Practices Code, which promotes transparent interest charges and communication with borrowers regarding changes in interest rates and the option to switch to a fixed rate as per the bank's policy. However, these practices are reportedly not always followed by banks. The unrelated content about President Joe Biden's remarks on immigration has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Heatwaves in several parts of India: Why has April been hotter than usual?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/heatwaves-april-9297681/</link>
			<description>April 2024 in India has been marked by intense heatwaves, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting such conditions across various regions. The southern peninsular and southeastern coast have been particularly affected, while the northern plains have been spared so far. Heatwaves are officially declared when temperatures exceed normal by 4.5°C in the plains and 6°C in hilly regions. This year's severe heat is attributed to the El Niño weather pattern and persistent anticyclone systems, causing subsidence and preventing cooler sea breezes. The IMD's forecast had predicted these extreme conditions, which have predominantly impacted states like West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. The situation reflects a broader trend of increasing temperatures and heatwaves in regions previously unaffected, signaling a shift in climate patterns.</description>

			<description>In 1970, facing political unrest, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi dissolved the Lok Sabha, calling for early elections to seek a mandate on her policies like bank nationalization and abolition of privy purses. The Congress party split, with Indira leading her faction to victory in the 1971 elections with the slogan "Garibi Hatao." The election saw unprecedented violence and electoral malpractices. Indira's government, however, faced challenges, including accusations of involvement in the Maharaja of Bastar's assassination and a no-confidence motion. Despite these, she secured a two-thirds majority. Her tenure saw significant events like the creation of Bangladesh post-1971 war, but her election was later invalidated, leading to the declaration of Emergency in 1975, altering Indian politics significantly.</description>

			<description>The South China Sea dispute has intensified with the Philippines and China clashing over territorial claims. Central to this is the Sierra Madre, a WWII ship stationed by the Philippines at Second Thomas Shoal to assert sovereignty. China's aggressive tactics, including swarming Filipino resupply vessels, have escalated tensions. The ship, now dilapidated, remains a symbol of the Philippines' claim, with its removal risking Chinese dominance. The region's rich resources have led to overlapping claims, notably on the Spratly and Paracel islands. An international tribunal supported the Philippines' claims in 2016, but China rejected the ruling. The US has reaffirmed its defense commitments to the Philippines, indicating support against Chinese coercion in the disputed waters.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/delaying-polls-anantnag-rajouri-constituency-9297449/</link>
			<description>In the run-up to the Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha seat elections in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, four parties have requested a postponement due to blocked roads from snowfall, hindering campaigning. Contrarily, other parties claim the roads are navigable. The controversy stems from the 2022 formation of the Anantnag-Rajouri constituency, which amalgamated regions from Jammu and Kashmir, altering the demographic balance and sparking accusations of electoral manipulation to favor the BJP. The BJP has not fielded a candidate, instead supporting allies, amidst speculation that a delayed election could benefit pro-BJP candidates. The constituency's demographic is a mix of non-ST Muslims in Kashmir and ST Gujjars, Bakerwals, and Paharis in Jammu, with recent government actions seen as BJP's bid to gain influence in the Valley.</description>

			<title>Behind cannibal stereotype: Why Joe Biden’s comments offended Papua New Guinea</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/joe-biden-guinea-cannibal-stereotype-9296518/</link>
			<description>Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape rebuked US President Joe Biden for suggesting cannibalism in New Guinea during WWII. Biden's anecdote about his uncle's disappearance after a plane crash invoked outdated stereotypes, which Marape dismissed, emphasizing his nation's dignity. The article highlights the Korowai and Fore tribes' historical practices of consuming human flesh, not out of savagery but as part of complex social customs, often misunderstood by Western perspectives. The Fore ceased the practice in the 1960s after linking it to the fatal kuru disease. The piece contextualizes Biden's remarks within the broader misuse of the cannibal stereotype, historically exploited to justify colonial atrocities, and examines cannibalism's diverse roles and rationales across cultures and species.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘We do not have government by the majority… but by the majority who participate’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-upsc-voter-turnout-voting-9295719/</link>
			<description>The second phase of India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections saw a slight decrease in voter turnout at 66.7%, a 3% drop from 2019. This decline is notable given India's history of high participation rates, which are indicative of a robust democracy. The article emphasizes the importance of voting as a fundamental democratic exercise and a reflection of public trust in the political process. It highlights the struggles of marginalized groups to secure voting rights and how voting empowers individuals as stakeholders in society. The piece also discusses voter apathy, its potential dangers to democracy, and the need for greater accountability in the political system. It references the Indian Supreme Court's introduction of the 'None of the Above' option as a means to express dissatisfaction, underscoring its role in a vibrant democracy. The article concludes by examining the impact of voter disillusionment, particularly among the youth, on election participation.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand forest fire: How are forest fires caused and how frequent are they in India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/forest-fires-causes-frequency-india-9295213/</link>
			<description>In Uttarakhand's Nainital district, forest fires prompted the Indian Air Force to conduct firefighting operations using Bambi buckets. The fires affected Nainital, Haldwani, and Ramnagar forest divisions. Forest fires in India, which occur from November to June, are influenced by temperature, dry vegetation, and moisture levels. The Forest Survey of India notes that 36% of India's forests are fire-prone, with severe fires in dry deciduous forests. Northeastern states, parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and regions in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka are highly susceptible. Most fires are man-made, linked to agriculture and land-use changes. In Uttarakhand, causes include deliberate acts, carelessness, and natural factors. Prevention methods include watch towers, fire watchers, community involvement, and fire lines. Satellite technology aids in fire management. Separately, India's T20 World Cup team selection is underway, with focus on Samson and Gill, and uncertainty over KL Rahul's inclusion.</description>

			<title>How a new report links fashion giants Zara and H&amp;M to deforestation in Brazil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/new-report-zara-deforestation-brazil-9295010/</link>
			<description>An Earthsight investigation has revealed that cotton used by major brands like Zara and H&amp;M is linked to deforestation and human rights abuses in Brazil. Despite sustainability labels, the UK-based NGO found that cotton production in Brazil's Cerrado region, a biodiversity hotspot, is causing environmental damage. The report tracked 816,000 tons of cotton linked to European brands, produced for eight Asian manufacturers. It highlighted the role of SLC Agricola, responsible for 11% of Brazil's cotton exports, in deforestation. Better Cotton, a certification scheme, failed to prevent the implicated cotton from reaching the market. The findings have prompted calls for stricter supply chain regulations and accountability from European markets to mitigate negative impacts on the environment and human rights.</description>

			<title>Why fentanyl, reportedly the biggest killer of Americans aged 18-49, figured in Antony Blinken’s China visit</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/antony-blinken-china-vxi-jinping-fentanyl-opioid-9294866/</link>
			<description>US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's visit to China highlighted the fentanyl crisis, a synthetic opioid causing widespread addiction and death in the US. Blinken discussed with Chinese officials the need to control the production and export of fentanyl precursors. The US blames China and Mexico for trafficking fentanyl, which is often mixed into other drugs unbeknownst to users. The US has seen a dramatic increase in opioid-related deaths, with fentanyl being a significant factor. Cooperation between the US and China is crucial, as evidenced by the recent bilateral Counternarcotics Working Group. However, tensions over various geopolitical issues have hindered progress. The US seeks to address the crisis domestically and internationally, with the FEND Off Fentanyl Bill targeting illicit traffickers and precursor chemical producers. The issue is a major concern for US voters ahead of the presidential elections.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: What Election Commission can do if normal polling process is disrupted</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/repolls-election-commission-polling-process-9294027/</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India (EC) has annulled polls in certain stations in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh due to irregularities, with repolls scheduled subsequently. Additionally, the death of a candidate has postponed elections in Madhya Pradesh's Betul constituency. India's election laws cater to disruptions in polling, ensuring a fair and uninterrupted democratic process. Provisions include voiding polls for EVM tampering or damage, booth-capturing, and natural disasters. Repolls involve fresh voting, with specific measures to prevent repeat voting. The EC has the authority to countermand elections if booth-capturing is widespread, affecting the election's integrity. In cases of candidate death, the poll is adjourned, allowing the concerned party to nominate a new candidate. These laws maintain the sanctity and transparency of elections in India.</description>

			<title>What is a Bambi Bucket, being used by an IAF helicopter to fight Nainital forest fires?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/bambi-bucket-forest-fire-9294088/</link>
			<description>To combat the forest fires in Uttarakhand's Nainital district, the Indian Air Force deployed an MI 17 V5 helicopter equipped with a "Bambi Bucket" to douse the flames. The Bambi Bucket, a collapsible container for aerial firefighting, was filled with water from Bhimtal Lake and released over the fires. Invented in 1982 by Canadian Don Arney, the Bambi Bucket has been a game-changer in firefighting due to its ease of filling and effectiveness in water delivery. It releases a solid column of water, ensuring a more impactful and less evaporative drop. Available in sizes up to 9,840 liters, it's now used globally by over 1,000 operators. Arney's innovation earned him a place in the Inventors Hall of Fame in 2017.</description>

			<title>Why Canada is top preference for Indians wishing to study abroad, despite obstacles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/canada-top-preference-indians-students-punjab-9293999/</link>
			<description>Despite recent policy changes, Canada remains a top destination for Indian students, particularly from Punjab. The country's welcoming environment and excellent public universities continue to attract students, offering them a clearer path to post-study settlement. Canada's work permit and Permanent Residency (PR) policies are more favorable than those of the US, UK, and Australia, with higher visa success rates and lower refusal rates. Experts highlight Canada's transparent process and the high presence of Indian communities as confidence boosters for students. Even with a cap on international students, opportunities for Indian students in Canada are still abundant, with a high percentage already studying there. The support from local Indian communities also helps mitigate homesickness for students abroad.</description>

			<title>When Supreme Court junked the Election Commision’s first EVM experiment in Kerala</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/a-long-way-from-1984-when-sc-junked-ecis-first-evm-experiment-9292936/</link>
			<description>In 1982, the Supreme Court of India disapproved the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in elections, citing the lack of legislative backing and the need for voter training. This verdict came after EVMs were first used in Kerala's Parur Assembly constituency, leading to a contested election result. Despite the Election Commission of India's (ECI) assertion of its constitutional powers, the court ruled that only Parliament had the legislative authority to sanction EVMs. However, the concept persisted, and by 2004, EVMs had fully replaced ballot papers in the Lok Sabha elections, following legal amendments and gradual adoption across various states. This marked a significant evolution in India's electoral process from paper ballots to electronic systems.</description>

			<title>How ISRO used satellite remote-sensing to analyse glacial lakes in Himalayas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-isro-used-satellite-remote-sensing-to-analyse-glacial-lakes-in-himalayas-9292935/</link>
			<description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has reported a significant expansion of glacial lakes in the Indian Himalayan river basins, analyzing satellite data from the past four decades. The study found that out of 2,431 lakes larger than 10 hectares, 676 have expanded since 1984, with 601 lakes more than doubling in size. This expansion is attributed to the accelerated retreat of glaciers due to global warming, leading to the formation of lakes in depressions caused by glacial movement. ISRO categorized these lakes into moraine-dammed, ice-dammed, erosion-based, and others. Glacial lakes are vital freshwater sources but also pose risks of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which can devastate downstream communities. Satellite remote-sensing technology aids in monitoring these lakes, providing insights for environmental impact assessments and risk management strategies. Fieldwork, including early warning systems, is essential for critical sites to mitigate GLOF risks.</description>

			<title>Explained: Symbol Loading Unit (SLU), the ‘matchbox’ that feeds EVM candidate information</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/slu-matchbox-that-feeds-evm-candidate-info-9292931/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has directed the Election Commission to secure Symbol Loading Units (SLUs) for 45 days post-election results, marking a change from only storing EVM components. SLUs, crucial for loading candidate symbols onto VVPATs, will now be available for scrutiny if election results are contested. This decision prevents the reuse of SLUs across different phases of multi-phase elections, necessitating the procurement of additional units by the EC. Furthermore, the court has permitted candidates to request verification of EVM software for tampering, with a focus on second and third-place finishers. This move requires candidates to bear the cost, with a refund only if tampering is detected. The verification process involves inspecting the memory/microcontrollers of EVMs, with engineers certifying their authenticity. These changes do not affect voters but significantly alter the EC's polling organization, potentially impacting the Representation of the People Act regarding election petitions.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India dismissed petitions for 100% VVPAT slip verification with EVM counts, emphasizing the importance of trust in the electoral process. Justices Khanna and Datta expressed confidence in EVM security and dismissed concerns of tampering as unfounded. The court maintained that voter rights are safeguarded by existing measures like the seven-second VVPAT slip display. Justice Khanna directed additional security checks for EVM microcontrollers and sealing of Symbol Loading Units post-election. Instances of EVM-VVPAT discrepancies were deemed isolated, with the court rejecting the idea of returning to paper ballots or providing physical VVPAT slips to voters, citing potential misuse and malpractices.</description>

			<title>Looking back at the Chernobyl disaster, 38 years later: Who was responsible?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/chernobyl-disaster-38-years-who-was-responsible-9292695/</link>
			<description>The Chernobyl disaster of April 26, 1986, stands as a catastrophic nuclear event. Reactor 4's explosion released immense amounts of radiation, initially killing two workers, with subsequent deaths from acute radiation sickness. Predictions estimate up to 9,000 cancer-related deaths in affected areas. The disaster rendered 2,600 sq km uninhabitable and sparked debate over culpability. Faulty safety tests led to the meltdown, with some blaming operator error, while others cite design flaws and poor human-machine interaction. The Soviet Union initially concealed the incident, which released more radiation than the Hiroshima bomb. Decades later, responsibility remains contested, highlighting the complex interplay between human actions and technological systems.</description>

			<title>Is Japan moving closer to a future female empress?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/japan-female-empress-9292635/</link>
			<description>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is considering legal reforms to prevent a succession crisis in the imperial family, potentially allowing female members to retain royal status post-marriage and reinstating previously removed branches. This shift, influenced by public support for an empress, marks a departure from traditionalist views. However, critics argue these proposals are conservative ploys to preserve male-only succession. The debate reflects broader societal discussions on gender equality, with many Japanese favoring a more inclusive approach to imperial succession. Despite this, the likelihood of these reforms passing is uncertain due to the need for unanimous legislative agreement and opposition from conservative factions.</description>

			<title>The planet’s plastic problem: why we need a global plastics treaty</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/global-plastic-pollution-treaty-9292563/</link>
			<description>Negotiators from 175 countries are in Ottawa to draft a global treaty to address plastic pollution, aiming to finalize it by the end of 2024. This treaty is considered the most significant environmental agreement since the 2015 Paris climate accord. Plastic production has surged since the 1950s, leading to a crisis with billions of tonnes polluting the planet and contributing to climate change. The treaty may set production caps, recycling targets, and ban certain plastics and chemicals. However, oil-producing nations and industry lobbyists oppose these measures, favoring a focus on waste management over production reduction. The "High-Ambition Coalition" of 65 nations seeks to end plastic pollution by 2040, but faces challenges from major fossil fuel producers and the US's preference for voluntary action.</description>

			<title>Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction overturned: What the court argued, its implications</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/harvey-weinstein-rape-conviction-overturned-9292208/</link>
			<description>New York's highest court has overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction and ordered a new trial, citing judicial errors in the landmark #MeToo case. The Court of Appeals found that the trial judge allowed testimony from witnesses whose allegations were not part of the charges, thus prejudicing the case. Weinstein was originally convicted for assaults in 2006 and 2013 and sentenced to 23 years. The reversal is based on the misuse of "Molineux witnesses," who testified about uncharged acts, violating Weinstein's rights to be tried solely for the charged crimes. Despite this, Weinstein remains imprisoned due to a separate 16-year sentence from a 2022 LA conviction for rape, which his lawyers plan to challenge. The decision marks a significant blow to the #MeToo movement, following a similar overturning of Bill Cosby's conviction. Appeals may now be directed to the Supreme Court.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India has dismissed requests for 100% verification of VVPAT slips with EVM counts, maintaining the current electoral process. The court has, however, mandated new post-election procedures for the Election Commission (EC). These include the storage of Symbol Loading Units (SLUs) for 45 days post-results for potential election petitions and allowing candidates to request verification of EVMs in 5% of machines per Assembly segment. Verification requests must be made within seven days of result declaration, with costs borne by the candidates, refundable if tampering is detected. Additionally, the court suggested the EC consider machine counting of VVPAT slips with barcodes for efficiency, though it refrained from a definitive stance on this technical suggestion.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/supreme-court-rejects-vvpat-elections-case-9291828/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, on April 26, upheld the current process of vote verification using Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs), rejecting demands for complete cross-verification with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and dismissing calls to revert to ballot papers. The verdict, delivered by Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, came after the Association for Democratic Reforms petitioned for enhanced transparency in elections through barcode-enabled VVPAT slips for faster tallying. The court suggested the Election Commission explore electronic counting of VVPAT slips. VVPATs, which provide a physical vote verification system, were fully adopted by June 2017. Currently, VVPAT slips from five randomly selected polling stations per assembly constituency are counted, a practice established by a 2019 Supreme Court judgment. Despite opposition parties advocating for increased verification to ensure election integrity, the Election Commission has cited logistical challenges and potential result delays as reasons for maintaining the status quo.</description>

			<title>50 yrs of portugal’s Carnation Revolution: How Europe’s longest dictatorship was overthrown</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/50-yrs-of-portugals-carnation-revolution-how-europes-longest-dictatorship-was-overthrown-9291423/</link>
			<description>Portugal marked the 50th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which ended Europe's longest fascist rule and brought democracy. Antonio Oliveira Salazar's regime, which began in 1932, fell in 1974. Salazar, once Finance Minister, balanced Portugal's budget and stabilized its currency. As Prime Minister, he established the Estado Novo, a regime maintaining the Portuguese empire. The 1974 revolution, led by junior army officers, sought democracy and an end to colonial wars in Africa, leading to rapid decolonization. Today, the rise of the populist Chega party, which reveres Salazar's ideals, challenges this legacy. Chega, advocating "God, patriotism, family, and work," has grown significantly, reflecting on Portugal's current socio-economic issues.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: How a ‘new’ Japan promises to transform Asian geopolitics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-how-a-new-japan-promises-to-transform-asian-geopolitics-9291424/</link>
			<description>Japan is undergoing a significant shift from its post-WWII pacifism to becoming a major military power. This change is driven by external pressures such as China's rise, North Korea's military capabilities, and uncertainties in US security commitments. Internally, conservatives in Tokyo advocate for Japan to assume more responsibility for its own security and contribute to regional order. Japan has increased its defense spending, acquired counter-strike capabilities, eased its weapons export ban, and is revising its defense command structure with the US. These moves signify Japan's transition from a US protectorate to an active partner in Indo-Pacific security, reshaping the regional security landscape and aligning with India's vision of a multipolar Asia.</description>

			<title>How sending notice to party, not candidate, for poll code violations marks a shift in EC response</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/model-code-of-conduct-violations-sending-notice-to-party-not-candidate-marks-shift-in-ec-response-9291258/</link>
			<description>In a notable departure from past practices, the Election Commission (EC) has issued notices to political parties, specifically the BJP and Congress, for alleged Model Code of Conduct (MCC) violations by their star campaigners, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. This shift emphasizes individual accountability and suggests that parties may be held responsible for their campaigners' actions. The move raises questions about the extent of action against individual leaders and the consequences for parties with unsatisfactory responses. The EC's approach aligns with a "calibrated approach" announced by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, targeting "repeat offenders" and legally linking campaigners' conduct to their parties, reminding them of their constitutional commitments. This change is underscored by the fact that no sitting Prime Minister has previously received an MCC violation notice.</description>

			<title>Why a US court overturned Harvey Weinstein’s 2020 rape conviction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-court-overturned-harvey-weinstein-2020-rape-conviction-9290940/</link>
			<description>A New York appeals court has overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 sex crime conviction and ordered a new trial, citing serious errors in the previous trial, including the admission of invalid testimony. The Court of Appeals found that uncharged allegations had been erroneously admitted, which did not pertain to the complainants of the underlying crimes. Weinstein's lawyers argued that the trial was swayed by allowing testimonies from three women not involved in the case. While dissenting opinions criticized the decision for perpetuating outdated views on sexual violence, the majority ruled for a retrial. Weinstein, currently serving a 23-year sentence for separate convictions, will remain in prison despite the overturned New York ruling. The decision's impact on Weinstein is yet to be determined. The case has been a significant part of the #MeToo movement, following numerous allegations against Weinstein in 2017.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/army-tactical-missile-systems-us-ukraine-9290863/</link>
			<description>The U.S. has confirmed the provision of long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, following President Zelenskyy's request and a $61 billion funding bill passed by Congress. These missiles, with a range of 300km, are an upgrade from previous systems with shorter ranges. They are launched from HIMARS and MLRS platforms, previously supplied by the U.S. and U.K. National Security Adviser Sullivan cited Russia's intensified attacks on civilian infrastructure as the reason for the timing of this delivery. The move comes amid concerns of escalation and reports of North Korea providing ballistic missiles to Russia. The ongoing Ukraine-Russia war has seen continued demands for aid from Ukraine, with U.S. President Biden supporting aid despite opposition from some Republican leaders.

			<title>How American universities have long been hotbeds of protest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/american-universities-protest-israel-gaza-9290561/</link>
			<description>Protests have erupted across US college campuses in response to Israel's actions in Gaza, with significant police arrests at UT Austin and USC, and potential police action at Harvard and Brown. The movement, involving at least 30 universities, was sparked by NYPD's arrest of 108 Columbia University students demanding divestment from Israel-linked entities. This echoes the 1968 Columbia protests against Vietnam War policies and the influential 1960 Greensboro sit-ins, which contributed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Student activism has a long history in the US, from pre-Revolution protests to anti-apartheid and Black Lives Matter movements, often leading to significant institutional changes and reflecting broader societal issues.</description>

			<title>Maratha quota case update: hearing paused till June, here’s what has happened so far</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/maratha-quota-case-update-bombay-hc-9290326/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court is set to resume hearings on June 13 regarding the 10% reservation for Marathas under Maharashtra's SEBC Act, 2024. This follows political upheaval and the significance of Maharashtra's 48 Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming elections. The court's decision will impact applications for education and government jobs under the Act. The Maratha community, constituting nearly a third of the state's population, has seen previous reservation laws fail. The current challenge argues the Act's unconstitutionality for exceeding the 50% reservation ceiling without constitutional amendment. The Shukre Commission's extensive survey supports the Marathas' backward status, but its findings and the Act's validity face scrutiny in court.</description>

			<title>Microsoft unveils Phi-3-mini, its smallest AI model yet: How it compares to bigger models</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/microsoft-phi-3-mini-ai-model-llm-9290253/</link>
			<description>Microsoft has introduced Phi-3-Mini, a new small language model (SLM), as part of its Phi-3 series. This model is designed to be more capable and cost-effective than larger language models (LLMs), performing well on benchmarks in language, reasoning, coding, and math. Phi-3-Mini, with a 3.8 billion parameter count, is available on platforms like Azure AI Studio and HuggingFace. It supports a context window of up to 128K tokens, enabling it to process large text content efficiently. The model is also instruction-tuned for immediate use. Microsoft plans to release more models in the Phi-3 family, including Phi-3-small and Phi-3-Medium. SLMs like Phi-3-Mini are ideal for resource-constrained environments and quick response scenarios, such as chatbots. They require less computing power and energy, making them suitable for smaller devices and organizations. Microsoft's Phi-3-Mini is said to outperform its predecessors and other models of similar or larger size.</description>

			<title>Case before Supreme Court: Can Govt redistribute privately owned property?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/case-before-supreme-court-can-govt-redistribute-privately-owned-property-9289189/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is revisiting the interpretation of Article 39(b) of the Constitution, which addresses the distribution of material resources to serve the common good. Historically, the apex court ruled that private property does not fall under "material resources of the community," but Justice Krishna Iyer's minority opinion, later supported by a five-judge bench, argued otherwise. This view was influential in nationalizing coal mines in 1983. Currently, the court is hearing a case on the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act's amendment, which allows the state to acquire 'cessed' properties in Mumbai for redistribution. The case challenges the constitutionality of this amendment, questioning if privately owned resources are included in "material resources of the community." A nine-judge bench is now deliberating on this matter.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the debate around inheritance tax in India, sparked by comments from Sam Pitroda and political reactions from the BJP and Congress. It outlines the history of wealth-related taxes in India, including the now-abolished estate duty, wealth tax, and gift tax. The piece also touches on global discussions about taxing the wealthy to address income inequality, with proposals like a global minimum corporate tax rate and a 'Billionaire Minimum Income Tax' in the US. It highlights the challenges of implementing such taxes, including capital flight and administrative costs, and notes the IMF's observation of declining wealth tax rates worldwide. The article concludes with the effectiveness of wealth taxes and the potential revenue from a global minimum tax on billionaires.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/census-to-kranti-how-rahul-gandhi-framed-quotas-as-wealth-re-distribution-tool-9289231/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi's rhetoric on a caste census has evolved from a tool for social justice to a central goal, intertwining it with issues of inequality and wealth concentration. Despite internal dissent and BJP's criticism of threatening middle-class wealth, Gandhi remains unapologetic, advocating for an "X-ray" financial survey to inform revolutionary policies. Sam Pitroda's inheritance tax suggestion, contrasting with the Congress manifesto's tax stance, has sparked debate and confusion within the party. Gandhi insists on a caste census upon forming government, aiming for comprehensive socio-economic clarity. This stance marks a significant shift for Congress, aligning with socialist parties and challenging the Supreme Court's reservation cap, reflecting a broader strategy beyond electoral promises.</description>

			<title>What is Art 244(A), the constitutional promise of autonomy driving the election narrative at a tribal seat in Assam?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/article-244a-diphu-assam-9288844/</link>
			<description>In Assam's Diphu constituency, a long-standing election promise is the implementation of Article 244(A), which allows for an autonomous state within Assam. This provision, added in 1969, would enable the tribal-majority areas of Karbi Anglong, West Karbi Anglong, and Dima Hasao, currently under the Sixth Schedule, to have greater autonomy with their own legislature or council. Despite past peace accords and settlements promising enhanced autonomy and development packages, the actual implementation of Article 244(A) remains a central issue. Political parties continue to pledge its enactment, but progress post-elections is criticized as stagnant. The current focus is on the upcoming vote, with candidates reiterating commitments to autonomy, reflecting the region's complex history of autonomy demands and political negotiations.</description>

			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed restrictions on Kotak Mahindra Bank, instructing it to halt the onboarding of new customers via online and mobile banking channels and to cease issuing new credit cards. This directive follows the RBI's IT examination for 2022 and 2023, which revealed significant deficiencies in the bank's IT management and compliance. The bank experienced frequent outages, highlighting a lack of operational resilience and inadequate IT infrastructure. Despite ongoing discussions with the RBI, the bank's rapid growth in digital transactions has further strained its systems. The RBI's decision aims to protect customer interests and ensure the stability of digital banking services. Kotak Mahindra Bank will continue serving existing customers and is taking steps to address the IT issues.</description>

			<title>Why Centre filed an application to modify 2G spectrum scam judgement</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/application-modify-2g-spectrum-scam-judgement-9288254/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has sought to modify a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on the 2G spectrum allocation process. The original case involved the allocation of 2G licenses on a first-come-first-serve basis in 2008, which led to allegations of a massive scam and subsequent investigations. The Supreme Court canceled 122 licenses and mandated auctions for allocation to prevent misuse. The government now argues that auctions may not always be optimal, citing needs for spectrum in public interest functions and situations where auctions are not technically or economically viable. It seeks clarification on whether administrative allocation could be allowed in certain cases, referencing a 2012 court clarification that auctions are not a constitutional principle for all natural resources.</description>

			<title>Road ahead for Tesla: Why EV sector is struggling, how Elon Musk hopes to negotiate potholes and speed bumps</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/tesla-ev-sector-musk-9288255/</link>
			<description>Tesla Inc's shares rose over 10% after-hours despite a significant miss in revenue and earnings, marking the first decline in over four years with a 9% drop from the previous year. The company's operating profit and adjusted net income fell by more than 50% year-on-year, and future delivery volumes are projected to be notably lower. Tesla's inventory reached an all-time high of 28 days, and layoffs at its Texas factory numbered 2,600 due to low demand. Additionally, 4,000 Cybertrucks were recalled due to a faulty accelerator pedal. Surprisingly, the stock's rise post-earnings call was attributed to plans for more affordable vehicles, a potential Tesla robotaxi service, and a surge in software revenue from its full self-driving feature. Despite challenges, including competition from Chinese EV makers and the need to open its charging network, Tesla is pushing forward with new models, including a low-cost "Model 2" expected to launch by early 2025.</description>

			<description>India's general elections are unfolding amidst a severe heatwave, with climate change being a critical but underrepresented issue in campaigns. Despite experiencing climate-induced disasters, political parties have not prioritized it in their electioneering. However, both the BJP and Congress have included climate agendas in their manifestos. The BJP aims to continue its current policies, expand renewable energy to 500 GW by 2030, and promote a green credit system. It also plans to launch river health programs and a National Atmospheric Mission. Conversely, Congress proposes an independent authority to enforce environmental standards and a National Climate Resilience Development Mission, alongside funds for green transitions and infrastructure. Both parties commit to expanding forest cover, protecting ecosystems, and reducing pollution.</description>

			<title>US Senate passes Bill that may ban TikTok: What can be the implications?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/us-bill-banning-tiktok-9287878/</link>
			<description>The U.S. Senate has passed a bill that could mandate the sale of TikTok by its Chinese owner, Bytedance, or lead to its outright ban, reflecting ongoing U.S.-China tensions. The bill, which addresses national security concerns over TikTok's Chinese connections, suggests that Bytedance must divest TikTok within nine months for it to continue operating in the U.S. President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law, potentially triggering legal challenges and retaliatory actions from Beijing. Critics argue the bill infringes on free speech, with TikTok claiming it would harm American users and businesses. Previously, the Trump administration attempted to force TikTok's sale to a U.S. company, with Microsoft notably entering negotiations. The broader context includes tech bans as foreign policy tools, with countries targeting Chinese tech firms like Huawei in response to strained relations, leading to reciprocal actions and the development of independent tech capabilities.</description>

			<description>In a speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused Congress of attempting to provide a 5% reservation for Muslims in Andhra Pradesh, which he claimed was part of a larger plan to implement across India. The article discusses the legal challenges and changes to Muslim reservation in various states. In Andhra Pradesh, attempts to include all Muslims in the OBC category were struck down by the High Court for not excluding the "creamy layer" and lacking objective criteria. Despite the High Court's affirmation that Muslim reservations do not conflict with secularism, subsequent attempts to establish a 5% Muslim quota were invalidated. The Supreme Court is yet to hear the final appeal, following its decision on the Economically Weaker Section quota. The article also briefly mentions AstraZeneca's admission of rare side effects from its Covid vaccine.</description>

			<description>The period between India's third and fourth Lok Sabha elections (1962-1967) was marked by significant political upheaval. The nation faced a defeat by China and the deaths of Prime Ministers Nehru and Shastri. Indira Gandhi succeeded as Prime Minister, leading Congress to victory in the 1967 elections, which saw the end of simultaneous Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections. The elections expanded to 520 Lok Sabha seats and over 3,500 state Assembly seats, reflecting changes like new states and Union Territories. Despite internal challenges and the rise of opposition parties, Congress maintained a vote share above 40%, although it faced setbacks with non-Congress governments forming in several states. The era post-1967 ushered in a political dominance by Indira Gandhi, reshaping India's political landscape.</description>

			<title>How much wealth do Indian Muslims have? Here’s what a study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/wealth-indian-muslims-9286910/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's allegation that the Congress plans to redistribute gold to Muslims has been refuted as "lies" and "hate speech" by the Congress. A 2020 study by the Indian Institute of Dalit Studies reveals disparities in wealth ownership among different social groups in India. Hindu high castes hold about 41% of the nation's wealth, with Hindu OBCs at 31%, and Muslims, SCs, and STs owning smaller percentages. The wealth distribution is disproportionate to the population share of these groups. The study also highlights the variations in average household wealth, with Hindu high castes at the top. Additionally, Hindu OBCs possess the largest share of gold among social groups.</description>

			<title>How US colleges are witnessing protests over the Israel-Palestine conflict</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-colleges-protests-israel-palestine-9286916/</link>
			<description>U.S. colleges are embroiled in debates over student protests linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Arrests have been made at Columbia, NYU, and Yale, with students facing charges for their involvement. The protests were sparked by a Hamas attack on Israel and subsequent Israeli military action, which resulted in significant casualties. Tensions on campuses stem from differing views on the Middle East, with some student groups blaming Israel for the violence and others decrying perceived antisemitism in anti-Israel protests. Universities face a dilemma in balancing free speech with maintaining support from benefactors. High-profile resignations and cancelled speeches have occurred amidst congressional testimonies on antisemitism in colleges. The situation reflects the historical role of U.S. campuses as sites of political activism and debate.</description>

			<title>The story of Doordarshan’s iconic logo, now in controversy over its colour</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/dordarshan-logo-colour-9286815/</link>
			<description>Doordarshan (DD), India's public broadcaster, recently changed its logo color from ruby red to saffron, sparking criticism from opposition parties amid elections. They linked the new color to the ruling party, BJP. DD defended the change as a visual update, noting that saffron was part of its logo when it transitioned to color broadcasting in the 1980s. The article traces DD's history from its black and white transmission days in 1959, highlighting the iconic 'DD Eye' logo and the signature tune composed by Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Ahmed Hussain Khan. The 'Eye' logo, designed by Devashis Bhattacharyya, symbolized yin and yang and evolved over the decades, with students from the National Institute of Design (NID) contributing to its revamp. The article also briefly mentions the journalist's background and unrelated content about HPBOSE class 12 results.</description>

			<title>New World Meteorological Organisation report released: 5 charts that tell the status of climate crisis in Asia</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/wmo-report-climate-crisis-asia-9286724/</link>
			<description>The World Meteorological Organisation's 2023 report highlights Asia's accelerated warming, with the region experiencing more extreme weather and water-related events than any other. In 2023, 79 hydrometeorological events impacted over nine million people and caused over 2,000 deaths. The majority were floods and storms, exacerbated by Asia's surface temperature rising 1.87°C above the 1961–1990 average. Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are losing mass due to high temperatures and dry conditions, with significant losses over the past 40 years. Precipitation patterns have shifted, with areas like Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar experiencing below-normal rainfall, while others received excess. Sea surface temperatures in Asia have also reached record highs, particularly in the North-west Pacific Ocean, with warming rates in some areas more than triple the global average.</description>

			<title>What is the UK govt’s recent Bill, which could lead to some migrants being deported to Rwanda?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-bill-migrants-rwanda-plan-9286181/</link>
			<description>The UK's upper house passed the Safety of Rwanda Bill, affirming Rwanda as a safe country for deporting undocumented immigrants, despite the Supreme Court's previous ruling against such policies due to human rights concerns. This move follows a treaty signed with Rwanda to enhance migrant protections. The contentious plan, initiated by former PM Boris Johnson, involves flying migrants 6,400 km to Rwanda for resettlement assessments. The UK has already paid Rwanda £290 million, with an additional £50 million pending the Bill's passage. The UNHCR criticizes the policy, and the ECHR halted initial deportations. With upcoming elections, immigration remains a hot-button issue, and PM Rishi Sunak asserts that flights to Rwanda will commence within 10-12 weeks, notwithstanding potential legal challenges.</description>

			<title>Dawoodi Bohra leader wins legal battle: Who challenged Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin’s position as 53rd Dai, and why?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dawoodi-bohra-high-court-dai-9286169/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court dismissed a decade-long challenge to the leadership of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, head of the Dawoodi Bohra community. The dispute arose after the 52nd al-Dai al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin, passed away in 2014, and his son, Saifuddin, succeeded him. This succession was contested by Burhanuddin's half-brother, Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who claimed he had been secretly appointed as the successor in 1965. Qutbuddin's son, Taher Fakhruddin, continued the legal battle after his father's death in 2016. The court ruled on evidence, not faith, noting that the nass (succession) could be changed and revoked, supporting Saifuddin's claim, which was backed by witnesses and documents from 1969 and reaffirmed in 2011. The case's length was attributed to extensive evidence and disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</description>

			<title>How the rupee has ‘strengthened’ under Modi government</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rupee-modi-government-9285946/</link>
			<description>The Indian rupee has depreciated by 27.6% against the US dollar from 2014 to 2024, a slightly higher rate than during the previous decade. The article explains that the rupee's value is not only determined by its exchange rate with the dollar but also by its Effective Exchange Rate (EER) with a basket of currencies from major trading partners. The Nominal EER (NEER) shows the rupee depreciated 32.2-40.2% against this basket over the last 20 years, less than its 45.7% fall against the dollar. The Real EER (REER), adjusted for inflation, indicates the rupee has strengthened in real terms, suggesting an overvaluation that could affect India's trade competitiveness. The article highlights the complexity of currency valuation and its impact on the economy.</description>

			<title>Explained: What do countries and companies want in global plastic treaty talks?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/global-plastic-treaty-canada-significance-9285936/</link>
			<description>Global leaders are convening in Ottawa to draft a landmark treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution, potentially rivaling the 2015 Paris Agreement in environmental significance. The treaty seeks to manage plastics' entire lifecycle, addressing the industry's contribution to carbon emissions—currently 5% and potentially rising to 20% by 2050. Divisions exist among nations and interest groups on the treaty's scope, with some advocating for production limits and others opposing such measures. The "High-Ambition Coalition," including the EU and Japan, aims to eliminate plastic pollution by 2040, proposing legally binding reductions in plastic production. In contrast, the U.S. favors individual national plans. Industry groups argue against production caps, fearing consumer cost impacts, and prefer focusing on recycling and reuse. Consumer brands support the treaty, including production limits and comprehensive waste management strategies. Final negotiations are scheduled for December in Busan, South Korea.</description>

			<title>Why High Court upheld Karnataka’s ban on hookah</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-high-court-upheld-karnatakas-ban-on-hookah-9285368/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has affirmed the state's ban on hookah bars, ruling them as an illegal service under anti-tobacco laws. The decision is based on Article 47 of the Constitution, which mandates the state to improve public health and allows for the prohibition of harmful substances. The court found that hookah smoking involves services similar to serving food or alcohol, which distinguishes it from cigarette smoking in designated zones. Consequently, the ban extends to all forms of hookah, including herbal varieties, as they require an instrument and thus constitute a service. This ruling aligns with the directive principles of state policy aimed at protecting citizens' health under Article 21.</description>

			<title>No age restriction for health insurance now: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/health-insurance-for-all-ages-9285375/</link>
			<description>In a significant move, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has mandated insurance companies to offer health insurance to all individuals, including senior citizens, irrespective of their age or pre-existing medical conditions. This directive aligns with the government's commitment to include those over 70 in the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Insurers are now encouraged to design inclusive products that provide comprehensive coverage for various groups, particularly the elderly. The change aims to improve healthcare access and affordability for seniors, addressing the challenges they face with high premiums and limited coverage due to age-related risks. The IRDAI's guidelines also emphasize the importance of continuous coverage, prohibiting insurers from refusing renewal based on previous claims and advocating for fair premium adjustments. This reform is expected to foster innovation in the insurance market, benefiting the aging population and contributing to the broader goal of universal healthcare by 2030.</description>

			<title>Why the US may sanction Netzah Yehuda, an Israeli Defence Forces battalion</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-sanction-netzah-yehuda-israel-military-9284966/</link>
			<description>The U.S. is considering sanctions against an IDF battalion over alleged human rights abuses, a first in U.S.-Israel relations. The Axios report suggests the sanctions would prevent U.S. military aid to the battalion, with Secretary Blinken indicating a decision is imminent. Israeli President Netanyahu has publicly opposed such sanctions, especially as IDF soldiers combat terrorism. The allegations stem from incidents in the West Bank, including the death of Omar Assad, a U.S.-Palestinian citizen, after IDF detention. The IDF admitted to moral failure but denied violence, despite claims of mistreatment. The Netzah Yehuda battalion, accommodating ultra-Orthodox Jewish soldiers, has faced past indictments for abuse. The potential sanctions, under the Leahy Laws, coincide with Israel's Gaza offensive and U.S. political tensions, as Biden balances support for Israel with domestic and international criticism. Congress recently voted to support Israel with $26 billion, reflecting this delicate balance.</description>

			<title>Do Muslims have more children than others? Here’s what available data show</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/do-muslims-have-more-children-than-others-9284858/</link>
			<description>At an election rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized the Congress party for allegedly favoring "infiltrators" and those with larger families, hinting at the Muslim community. The article highlights the lack of recent census data on religious demographics in India. It notes that the Muslim population grew by 24.69% from 2001 to 2011, marking the slowest growth in the community's history. Additionally, it points out that Muslims have the lowest labor force and worker population ratios among all religious groups, although their unemployment rate is below the national average. The article concludes with a mention of the Indian cricket team's selection process for the T20 World Cup, focusing on the inclusion of players Sanju Samson and Shubman Gill, and the potential exclusion of KL Rahul.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: Why does sea level rise matter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/sea-level-rise-9284789/</link>
			<description>A study published in Science warns that a quarter of China's coastal land could be underwater within a century due to land subsidence and climate change, threatening millions. This issue extends globally, potentially impacting up to half a billion people. Sea levels have risen 21-24 centimeters since 1880, with the rate doubling since 1993. The acceleration could add another 20 centimeters by 2050, increasing flood risks worldwide. Global warming, causing glacier melt and thermal expansion of seawater, is the primary cause. Coastal cities in India and island nations like Indonesia face significant threats, with Indonesia relocating its capital due to flood risks. Rising sea levels also intensify storm surges and contaminate freshwater sources.</description>

			<title>SC allows abortion of 30-week foetus: What is the law on abortions, and what does the court consider?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-allows-abortion-30-week-foetus-law-9284545/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has permitted a 14-year-old sexual assault victim to terminate her nearly 30-week pregnancy, emphasizing the need to protect her physical and mental well-being. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, generally allows abortions up to 20 weeks, with exceptions up to 24 weeks under specific conditions. Beyond this, a medical board's approval is required. The court has occasionally allowed terminations past this period, considering the woman's rights and foetal viability. Recent cases highlight the liberal interpretation of the MTP Act and the evolving legal stance on reproductive rights, prioritizing women's autonomy over the rights of the unborn, marking a shift from traditional benchmarks and pointing to legislative gaps in India's abortion laws. This summary reflects the article's focus on the legal aspects of abortion in India without including unrelated content.</description>

			<title>New shoe sizing system proposed for Indians: What is ‘Bha’ and the need for it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bha-new-shoe-footwear-sizing-system-india-9284216/</link>
			<description>A comprehensive survey across India has led to the development of 'Bha', a new Indian footwear sizing system, set to replace UK/European and US sizes. The study, covering over 100,000 participants, revealed that Indians generally have wider feet, necessitating a size larger than ideal in existing systems. This mismatch has caused discomfort and health issues, particularly among women and diabetics. The proposed Bha system, based on extensive 3D foot scanning, suggests eight size categories, simplifying manufacturing and potentially fitting 85% of the population correctly. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–Central Leather Research Institute (CSIR–CLRI) has recommended Bha to the Bureau of Indian Standards for approval, with implementation expected by 2025. This change aims to enhance comfort and reduce returns, especially from online sales, benefiting both consumers and manufacturers in one of the world's largest footwear markets.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘If you want to test a man’s character, give him power’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-upsc-power-ethics-morality-9283268/</link>
			<description>The article explores the concept of power, its ethical implications, and its portrayal in popular culture. It references quotes like "With great power comes great responsibility" and delves into the true test of character when one is endowed with power. Originally attributed to Abraham Lincoln, the quote under scrutiny is likely from Robert G. Ingersoll, emphasizing that power reveals true character, especially in prosperity. The article discusses power's various interpretations, from a tool for social change to a means of coercion. It highlights Hannah Arendt's view of power as legitimate collective action and contrasts it with Marxist perspectives on power as class dominance. The piece concludes by questioning whether power is the ultimate measure of character, suggesting that adversity can also reveal a person's true nature.</description>

			<title>Whether copyright can be claimed over maths and science textbooks: What Andhra Pradesh HC held</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/textbooks-copyright-law-courts-9282945/</link>
			<description>The Andhra Pradesh High Court ruled that textbooks on mathematical equations and science are not subject to copyright as they are non-literary. This decision came after Deepthi Publications, a Guntur-based publisher, challenged a 2010 government order preventing private schools and colleges from self-publishing to combat piracy. The court quashed a criminal case against the publisher, stating that their books, which are based on CBSE and ICSE syllabi and aid in competitive exam preparation, fall under the fair use doctrine. The court emphasized that educational materials used for instruction are exempt from copyright infringement, and originality is required for copyright to exist. However, the court did not quash the government order, acknowledging its intent to protect against piracy and safeguard students' futures.</description>

			<title>Why some student visa hopefuls are attempting to go to Canada on visitor visas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/canada-student-visitor-visa-delays-9282594/</link>
			<description>In response to Canada's cap on international students, many Indian students are considering entering Canada on visitor visas and then applying for study permits. This trend follows the introduction of stringent requirements for study visas, including mandatory attestation letters from the student's intended province or territory, which has led to delays and increased competition for study permits. Some educational consultants are misleading students by suggesting this indirect route, despite it being legal. However, experts advise applying directly for study visas, as the process is becoming more streamlined. They warn that the visitor visa route is complex, costly, and subject to the same cap on international students. It's recommended that students apply for study visas to avoid complications and potential legal issues.</description>

			<title>Russia-Ukraine war: Have tanks become obsolete in modern warfare?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/russia-ukraine-war-tanks-obsolete-9281662/</link>
			<description>The Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted the vulnerability of tanks in modern warfare. Despite Russia destroying five and damaging three of the 31 M1 Abrams tanks sent by the US to Ukraine, and Ukraine losing 796 tanks since 2022, both countries continue to use and produce them. Drones, particularly FPV drones, have become a cost-effective method to target tanks' weak points. Ukraine's failure to fully protect its tanks from such attacks is one reason for its heavy losses. Tanks, however, still offer significant firepower, mobility, and psychological impact. History has shown their value in warfare, and with adequate infantry support and armor upgrades, tanks can be indispensable in urban combat. The narrative underscores the enduring relevance of tanks despite advancements in anti-tank weaponry.</description>

			<title>Attack and retaliation, anger and restraint: Connecting the dots in the Iran-Israel hostility</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-israel-hostility-9281462/</link>
			<description>On April 19, coinciding with Ayatollah Khamenei's 85th birthday, Israel launched a strike on Iran, targeting a military base near Isfahan. This action was in retaliation for Iran's April 13 drone and missile attack, which was a response to an earlier Israeli strike in Syria. The IAEA confirmed no nuclear facilities were damaged. Both nations have since maintained a silence, signaling a mutual desire to avoid escalation. The US was informed prior to the strike, suggesting coordination. Iran remains on alert, with President Raisi warning of a harsh response to any further invasions. Meanwhile, India has urged restraint from both sides, emphasizing diplomacy without issuing a formal reaction to the strike. The situation remains tense, with global implications hinging on the next moves by Israel and Iran.</description>

			<description>The article reflects on the enduring influence of Lord Byron, 200 years after his death, highlighting the cultural impact of the Byronic hero archetype. This character type, known for its rebellious charm and brooding intensity, often exhibits heroic qualities alongside self-destructive tendencies.

The article discusses the public's fascination with these complex characters, suggesting they offer an escape from societal constraints and allow for self-exploration. It also touches on the emergence of Byronic heroines, challenging traditional female characterizations and reflecting a shift towards more nuanced portrayals of women.

			<title>Punjabiyat: How Punjab can be bridge for national reconciliation between India and Pakistan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/maryam-punjabiyat-cultural-bonds-india-pakistan-punjab-9280346/</link>
			<description>Maryam Nawaz Sharif, Chief Minister of Pakistan's Punjab, emphasized her Punjabi roots while advocating for improved Indo-Pak relations at Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. She echoed her father's sentiment to foster friendship, not conflict, with neighbors. The concept of 'Punjabiyat'—a shared Punjabi identity—has been a recurring theme to bridge bilateral ties. Despite the division of Punjab in 1947 and subsequent wars, cultural bonds persist, marked by a common culture, empathy, and efforts to heal Partition's wounds. Cultural exchanges in films and music, and political initiatives like paradiplomacy, have sought to strengthen these ties. The Attari-Wagah land route, once a symbol of potential trade growth, remains a point of contention and hope for future reconciliation and mutual prosperity.</description>

			<title>How Jawaharlal Nehru won a third term in the 1962 elections, despite growing challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-nehru-won-a-third-term-despite-growing-challenges-9280350/</link>
			<description>The 1962 Indian general elections marked a significant evolution in the country's electoral process, with the Election Commission refining its procedures and recording the highest voter turnout to date. Despite Prime Minister Nehru's successful liberation of Goa and other territories from Portuguese rule, the Congress party faced its first substantial political criticism. The elections introduced key changes, including the abolition of two-member constituencies and the realignment of administrative boundaries due to the creation of new states and union territories. The Congress party emerged victorious, winning 361 Lok Sabha seats, while the opposition parties, despite their efforts, could not make a significant impact. The election also continued the practice of marking voters with indelible ink, although the experiment with photo identity cards was discontinued. Amidst the political shifts, Nehru began his third term as Prime Minister, confronting challenges such as linguistic nationalism, social unrest, and the aftermath of the Chinese invasion. His tenure, however, ended with his death in 1964, marking the longest prime ministerial term in India's history.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/musk-set-to-arrive-potential-win-win-for-tesla-and-india-some-challenges-too-9280347/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk's visit to India signals a potential $2 billion investment in a Tesla car manufacturing facility, aligning with the government's EV policy to import 8,000 electric cars at reduced duties. This move could mark a significant moment for India's auto sector, similar to Apple's impact on cell phone assembly. Musk will also discuss Starlink and his social media platform, avoiding controversies during the election period. The visit focuses on Tesla's influence on India's EV ecosystem and its potential as an export hub. Despite challenges like a small luxury car market and infrastructure needs, the new policy aims to attract global EV manufacturers and provide Indian consumers with advanced technology, supporting the 'Make in India' initiative. However, Tesla faces competition from local players and must navigate India's unique market conditions.</description>

			<title>Indian BrahMos missiles delivered to the Philippines: The missile’s significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/brahmos-missiles-philippines-development-9280055/</link>
			<description>India delivered BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to the Philippines, marking a significant step in becoming an arms exporter. The $375 million deal, signed in 2022, was highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of India's growing defense exports, totaling Rs 21,000 crore this year. The BrahMos missile, developed by BrahMos Aerospace—a joint venture between India's DRDO and Russia's NPOM—stands out for its speed, range, and precision. It's a two-stage missile capable of reaching supersonic speeds and performing complex maneuvers. The missile's versatility and stealth capabilities make it a strategic asset in defense and a symbol of India's advanced military technology. Ongoing upgrades aim to enhance its range and maneuverability, with tests being conducted across all Indian Armed Forces branches. The BrahMos has also been integrated into various platforms, including land-based systems, warships, fighter jets, and submarines, demonstrating India's commitment to advancing its missile technology and defense capabilities.</description>

			<title>Is the EU’s image failing in Southeast Asia?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/eu-image-failing-southeast-asia-9279961/</link>
			<description>A survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute indicates a decline in Southeast Asia's trust in the EU's commitment to free trade and the rules-based order. Trust in the EU as a global free trade leader fell to less than 14%, and its role in upholding international law dropped to third place. Confidence in the EU's contribution to global peace and governance also decreased, with only 41% of respondents believing the EU would "do the right thing," partly due to perceptions of the EU being preoccupied with internal affairs. The EU's stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict and deforestation legislation has affected its popularity, particularly with Malaysia and Indonesia. Despite these challenges, the EU maintains a strong partnership with ASEAN, being its fourth most important dialogue partner. The survey's findings suggest the EU needs to enhance cooperation and engagement to improve its image and partnership in Southeast Asia.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/lok-sabha-elections-voting-indelible-ink-9279884/</link>
			<description>The indelible ink, a symbol of Indian elections, is being produced by Mysore Paints &amp; Varnish Ltd. for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with around 26.5 lakh phials prepared. This ink, containing silver nitrate, has been used for decades to prevent multiple voting and is applied on voters' fingers at polling booths. Initially marked with a glass rod, the ink's application has evolved, but its purpose remains integral to the electoral process. The ink's formula, a closely guarded secret, ensures its resistance to various cleaning agents for up to 72 hours. Manufactured since 1962, the ink is now exported to over 25 countries, with diverse application methods tailored to different electoral systems.</description>

			<title>Fourth global mass coral bleaching triggered: What are corals and why are they important?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/global-mass-coral-bleaching-triggered-9279731/</link>
			<description>The fourth global mass coral bleaching event, driven by record ocean temperatures, has been announced by NOAA. This event poses a threat to marine life and the livelihoods of millions dependent on reefs. The rise in sea surface temperature to 21.07°C in March 2023 is attributed to increased greenhouse gas emissions, with oceans absorbing 90% of this excess heat. Coral reefs, vital for marine ecosystems and human economies, are suffering as a result. Corals, particularly hard corals that build reefs, are experiencing bleaching due to stress from environmental changes. While not immediately fatal, bleaching impacts coral reproduction and increases disease vulnerability. The current bleaching event, exacerbated by El Niño, has affected over 54% of global coral areas. Scientists warn that such events may become more frequent and severe, threatening the majority of coral reefs with even a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures. Efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C by reducing greenhouse gas emissions are critical but remain challenging.</description>

			<description>The Maldives High Court has overturned the 11-year sentence of former president Abdulla Yameen on graft and money laundering charges, ordering a retrial due to an unfair trial. Yameen's involvement in the MMPRC scandal, where over USD 90 million was embezzled, led to his initial conviction. Despite his release after a Supreme Court appeal, he was re-sentenced in 2022. His convictions barred him from the 2023 presidential race, which his party won with an anti-India campaign. Upcoming parliamentary elections will test the new government's policies amidst geopolitical tensions and domestic challenges.</description>

Students unable to secure visas for the May intake are now aiming for September. To improve visa chances, students must ensure their program isn't banned and may use the Web Form or CAIPS for application updates. Reapplication is a last resort due to additional costs.

			<title>As Aamir Khan’s fake video on Congress goes viral, how to spot disinformation amid elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/aamir-khan-video-congress-ai-elections-9279171/</link>
			<description>As India approaches the Lok Sabha elections, manipulated media and deepfake videos have surged online. Two viral videos of Aamir Khan, altered to show him endorsing political views, and a deepfake of Ranveer Singh criticizing the Prime Minister, highlight the issue. These deepfakes often use 'voice swap' technology, which can alter voice characteristics to create realistic fakes. Despite the challenge of detecting sophisticated deepfakes, the public is advised to verify sources, listen for audio anomalies, scrutinize visual inconsistencies, stay informed, and use AI detection tools like Optic's 'AI or Not' to assess content authenticity. Awareness and vigilance are crucial, especially during sensitive times like elections.</description>

			<title>Nestlé’s baby food sold in Asian, African countries had added sugars: Why is sugar harmful?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/nestle-sugar-baby-food-india-asia-africa-harmful-9278215/</link>
			<description>A report by Public Eye and IBFAN found that Nestlé's baby food products in Asia, Africa, and Latin America contain added sugars, unlike their European counterparts. Cerelac, a leading brand, has nearly 3 grams of added sugar per serving in India. Nestlé India claims to have reduced added sugars by up to 30% in the past five years. The report criticizes Nestlé for inconsistent nutritional standards and unclear sugar content labeling. It highlights the risks of added sugars, which can lead to health issues like diabetes and obesity. The WHO recommends limiting free sugar intake, and experts warn against adding sugars to baby foods due to its addictive nature and the risk of nutrition-based disorders. The study underscores the growing exposure to added sugars in low- and middle-income countries, driven by global food brands. WHO advises against added sugars before age 2, and a UNICEF-supported study found high sugar levels in many baby foods in Southeast Asia.</description>

			<title>Cost and benefit: Israel’s very expensive defence against aerial threats</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/iran-israel-missile-attack-cost-9278118/</link>
			<description>Israel's recent interception of Iranian missiles and drones, which saw 99% of over 300 projectiles neutralized, was a strategic success but came at a steep economic cost. The defense involved costly systems like the Iron Dome and Arrow interceptors, with each interception missile costing up to $100,000. The financial toll for Israel exceeded $550 million in one night, while Iran's expenses were significantly lower, at $100-$200 million for the attack. The disparity in costs highlights a strategic challenge for Israel, as Iran possesses a large arsenal capable of multiple attacks. This economic strain is prompting a shift towards more cost-effective defense technologies, such as microwave and laser beams, which promise cheaper and potentially unlimited defense capabilities.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ed-shilpa-shetty-raj-kundra-fraud-9277996/</link>
			<description>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth Rs 97.79 crore of businessman Raj Kundra under the PMLA, linked to a Bitcoin investment fraud case. The properties include a flat in Mumbai, a bungalow in Pune, and shares, all connected to Kundra and his wife, actor Shilpa Shetty. The case involves a Ponzi scheme started by Amit Bhardwaj and others in 2017, deceiving investors with promises of high returns from Bitcoin mining. Multiple FIRs led to the ED's money laundering probe. Kundra allegedly received 285 Bitcoins from Bhardwaj, which he retained after a failed deal to set up a mining farm in Ukraine. These Bitcoins are now valued at over Rs 150 crore. Kundra, previously arrested in a pornography case, was first questioned by the ED in 2018 and made a biopic about his jail experience in 2023.</description>

			<title>Did the comments of India’s envoy to Ireland breach IFS service rules?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ireland-envoy-breach-ifs-service-rules-9277730/</link>
			<description>The Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra, is under scrutiny for potentially breaching service rules after his public rebuttal to an Irish Times editorial. The editorial criticized India's democratic integrity under PM Narendra Modi, to which Mishra responded, calling the views "biased and prejudiced" and indirectly attacking the previous Congress regime. His comments have sparked demands from the opposition for his dismissal, citing a breach of the expected political neutrality enshrined in the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules. While some officials view his remarks as distasteful, they may not constitute an actionable breach. The incident has reignited discussions on the apolitical conduct expected from civil servants, referencing past controversies and reforms aimed at maintaining civil service integrity and discipline.</description>

			<description>Tensions rise in the Middle East after Iran's attack on Israel, raising concerns for India due to its friendly ties with both nations. India's trade with Israel has flourished since 1992, reaching $10.7 billion in 2022-23. Meanwhile, trade with Iran, despite fluctuations, stood at $2.33 billion in the same period. India's exports to Israel include diesel and diamonds, while it imports space equipment and potassium chloride. Investment ties with Israel and Iran show Indian firms investing more in Israel than vice versa. Though the conflict's impact on petroleum prices is uncertain, shipping disruptions in the Red Sea could affect global trade routes.</description>

			<description>The Allahabad High Court upheld an FIR against a Muslim man in an interfaith live-in relationship, citing Uttar Pradesh’s anti-conversion law. The law prohibits conversions through coercion or fraudulent means, including conversion through relationships like marriage. Punishments range from 1-5 years imprisonment to 3-10 years for mass conversions. It also declares marriages for unlawful conversion void and requires a stringent process for valid conversion, including declarations to the District Magistrate. Challenges to the law's constitutionality are pending before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, cases against the law have been filed in Allahabad HC. AstraZeneca's admission of rare side effects from its COVID vaccine may lead to legal payouts.</description>

			<title>‘Voluntary Code of Ethics’ for social media platforms: What EC told X on taking down elections-related posts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/voluntary-code-of-ethics-social-media-x-takedown-9276290/</link>
			<description>X (formerly Twitter) has complied with the Election Commission of India's request to withhold four posts during the Lok Sabha elections, despite disagreeing with the orders. The EC cited violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the Voluntary Code of Ethics for social media platforms. The MCC, in effect since March 16, prohibits unverified allegations and criticism of private lives of political parties and candidates. Established after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Voluntary Code of Ethics mandates social media platforms to facilitate grievance redressal and promptly act on EC's orders. X, while complying, advocates for freedom of expression and urges the EC to publicize future takedown orders.</description>

			<title>Why has Sonam Wangchuk suspended Ladakh’s Pashmina March again?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sonam-wangchuk-pashmina-march-9276088/</link>
			<description>Climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has suspended Ladakh's "Pashmina March" after initially planning it to raise awareness about grazing pasture loss. Wangchuk, known for his environmental activism, recently undertook a 21-day protest fast demanding Ladakh's inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. He highlights the loss of land to corporations and Chinese activities along the Line of Actual Control as reasons for the pasture loss. Wangchuk's activism reflects broader concerns in Ladakh, including dissatisfaction with the region's new administrative setup following its separation from Jammu and Kashmir. Despite attempts to engage with authorities, negotiations have been inconclusive, leading to Wangchuk's continued activism and protests.</description>

			<title>How a beam of sunlight was directed on Lord Ram’s forehead in Ayodhya temple</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/beam-sunlight-lord-ram-ayodhya-surya-tilak-9276021/</link>
			<description>A Surya Tilak ceremony was performed at the newly-built Ram temple in Ayodhya on Ram Navami, projecting sunlight onto Lord Ram’s idol's forehead. Astronomers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics designed a mirror-lens system to achieve this. They calculated the Sun’s position annually, directing beams through mirrors and lenses to focus on the idol. A 19-gear system adjusts the setup yearly based on the Metonic cycle. Due to temple construction, a modified version was used initially. Precision is crucial, with concern for cleanliness to prevent soot and dust accumulation. The final installation awaits temple completion.</description>

			<title>What is the dress code for advocates and when can it be relaxed?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/dress-code-advocates-9276050/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has exempted advocates at District and Trial courts from wearing black coats during the scorching summer months, providing relief from the heat and rapid courtroom transitions. While strict dress codes persist in higher courts, recent relaxations hint at possible changes. The Bar Council of India, empowered by the Advocates Act, regulates attire to ensure a dignified appearance. Notices often coincide with summer onset, permitting relaxation. High Courts, including Kerala, Punjab &amp; Haryana, and Delhi, have exempted gowns during summers. The Supreme Court briefly considered amending rules but dismissed the plea in 2022. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca's acknowledgment of rare vaccine side effects may lead to legal compensation.</description>

			<description>Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, two terrorist groups, were the focus of a recent ruling by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. Jaffar Ahmad Parray, detained under the Public Safety Act, was ordered released due to illegal preventive detention. Justice Rahul Bharti found flaws in the detention process, noting the police's reliance on a vague dossier and the District Magistrate's failure to consider Parray's representation. This decision echoes past cases highlighting the importance of proper procedure in preventive detention orders. In a related development, AstraZeneca acknowledged rare side effects of its COVID vaccine, potentially leading to significant legal compensations.</description>

			<title>What’s behind heavy rainfall in Dubai</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/floods-dubai-uae-9275782/</link>
			<description>The UAE experienced its heaviest rainfall ever due to a severe thunderstorm, disrupting air travel and causing flooding in homes and businesses. Dubai received 142mm of rain in one day, usually taking a year and a half to reach that amount. Flights were delayed, and popular areas like Dubai Mall were flooded. School closures and work-from-home orders were issued, while neighboring Oman also faced severe weather, resulting in casualties. Cloud seeding may have contributed to the heavy rains. Experts speculate climate change may intensify such events due to warmer temperatures increasing atmospheric moisture. However, attributing specific events to climate change is complex due to various factors.</description>

			<title>US university cancels pro-Palestine valedictorian’s speech: How Israel’s Gaza assault has polarised American campuses</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-university-israel-palestine-tabassum-9275516/</link>
			<description>The University of Southern California (USC) has revoked the opportunity for student Asna Tabassum to deliver her graduation speech due to her social media posts that were critical of Israel. USC's provost cited security concerns as the reason for the cancellation, stating that the heightened emotions from the Middle East conflict have created substantial risks. Tabassum responded by accusing the university of yielding to a hate campaign aimed at silencing her. The decision has sparked significant backlash, including from the Council of American Islamic Relations, which has demanded a reversal of the decision.

Tabassum, a biomedical engineering student and valedictorian, faced criticism from various groups labeling her pro-Palestine stance as anti-Semitic, based on her Instagram activity advocating for a single Palestinian state and criticizing Zionism. The article discusses the broader implications of this incident, highlighting the ongoing conflict in Palestine and its impact on U.S. college campuses, where it has become a free speech issue. It also mentions the suspension of pro-Palestinian student groups at several universities and a protest at UC Berkeley that required police intervention.

The article suggests that Israel's actions in Gaza have led to a significant shift in U.S. public opinion, particularly among the youth, against Zionism and Israel, with a poll indicating that half of the U.S. adult population believes Israel's offensive has been excessive. The article concludes with unrelated content about an upcoming IPL 2024 cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals.</description>

			<title>Anti-Maoist operations status report: What is the significance of Apr 16 encounter, and what happens now?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/anti-maoist-operations-9275484/</link>
			<description>Security forces engaged in a significant operation in Chhattisgarh's Kanker district, resulting in the alleged killing of 29 Maoists, marking one of the largest such operations since the state's inception. The operation penetrated deep into Abujhmad, a dense forest area known as a Maoist stronghold. While the casualties may include members of the CPI Maoists’ Partapur Area Committee, there's speculation that local tribal militias might also have been affected. Chhattisgarh, with a significant Maoist presence, remains a focus for government efforts to combat left-wing extremism. However, concerns persist regarding human rights violations and allegations of fake encounters. Despite these challenges, the government is intensifying its efforts, aiming to eradicate Naxalism within three years.</description>

			<title>‘Embryos same as children’: How a US court judgment impacts IVF, poses a problem for Republicans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/alabama-ivf-republicans-abortion-9273693/</link>
			<description>The Alabama Supreme Court's recent ruling equating frozen embryos with children has stirred debate over reproductive rights in the US. This ruling intersects with the Republican Party's pro-life stance, raising questions about their support for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). While IVF has facilitated millions of births, the court's decision aligns with the pro-life ideology. This creates a dilemma for Republicans, who advocate for both pro-life principles and IVF. The ruling's impact extends to potential regulations on IVF procedures, prompting concerns about legal liabilities. Alabama's response was a new law signed by Governor Kay Ivey, protecting IVF providers from legal repercussions. However, the law doesn't address the broader implications of the court's decision, leaving unresolved ethical and legal questions surrounding IVF.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/bjp-ayushman-bharat-senior-citizens-9273879/</link>
			<description>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unveiled its election manifesto, promising to extend the Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance scheme to cover senior citizens. The scheme, launched in 2018, currently excludes seniors but with this pledge, they would gain access to its benefits. India's ageing population, expected to triple by 2050, faces increased health challenges, with many lacking insurance coverage due to low awareness and affordability. The scheme aims to alleviate out-of-pocket expenses, offering coverage for prevalent ailments like cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Government data highlights significant savings for beneficiaries under the scheme, particularly in rural areas where private healthcare costs are substantially higher.</description>

			<title>Why Goans who took Portuguese nationality are facing issues in surrendering their Indian passport</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/goa-portuguese-nationality-passport-9273722/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) memorandum from November 2022 has led to the revocation of over 100 passports from Goans who acquired Portuguese citizenship. This move has left many unable to apply for Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI). Two affected individuals have filed petitions in the High Court of Bombay at Goa, denying suppression of material information. The issue arose due to a requirement for surrender certificates, citing Section 10(3)(b) of the Passport Act of 1967. The MEA’s decision has affected thousands in Goa, prompting calls for reconsideration and amnesty from the state government. The situation remains unresolved, affecting Goans' access to OCI and their ties to their homeland.</description>

			<title>What is Israel’s multi-layered air defence system, which helped thwart Iran’s attacks?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-air-defence-system-iran-attacks-9273448/</link>
			<description>Iran launched a major attack on Israel with over 300 armed drones and missiles, retaliating against an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel's multi-layered air defense system, with support from the US, UK, France, and regional allies, intercepted 99% of the projectiles. Systems like Arrow, David's Sling, Iron Dome, and Patriot, along with fighter jets, counter different threats. Israel is developing Iron Beam, a laser-based defense. Iran notified its neighbors 72 hours before the attack, allowing Israel to prepare. US bases in the region detected the attack early. Air defense involves detection via radars, satellites, and human intelligence, followed by interception. Israeli and allied forces intercepted drones and missiles from various locations, minimizing damage.</description>

			<description>China's economy exceeded expectations with a 5.3% growth in Q1 2024, driven by service sector expansion and robust external demand. Fixed-asset investment rose by 4.5%, indicating government support despite challenges like a sluggish property market. However, the jobless rate remained low at 5.2%, raising concerns about data interpretation amidst US trade tensions and European economic slowdown. Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1%, highlighting worries about consumer spending amid stalled real estate investments. China's growth outlook is clouded by real estate weakness, global demand softness, and structural constraints, posing risks to sustained growth. The World Bank projects a tough task for Beijing to maintain Q1 momentum amidst economic challenges and geopolitical tensions.</description>

The court's decision, prompted by a case on conserving the Great Indian Bustard, underscores the urgency to address climate risks. While India has seen limited climate litigation historically, the ruling is expected to catalyze more cases.

			<title>Even if convicted, why Trump could again become US president</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/convicted-trump-president-9273092/</link>
			<description>Former US President Donald Trump faced a criminal trial for allegedly covering up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, marking the first such trial for a former president. The case revolves around a $130,000 payment made to Daniels in 2016, orchestrated by Trump's then-lawyer, Michael Cohen. Trump initially denied knowledge but later admitted to reimbursing Cohen. Prosecutors argue the payment was an illegal campaign contribution. If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison, though first-time offenders often receive lighter sentences. Despite potential legal consequences, there's no legal barrier to Trump running for president again, even if convicted. While some voters see the charges as serious, Trump has historically used legal challenges to his advantage, citing them as evidence of conspiracy.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explained-tamil-nadus-decentralised-industrialisation-model-9272702/</link>
			<description>Tamil Nadu, ahead of its April 19 vote, stands out in India for its economic complexity, boasting a diversified GDP and employment landscape. Unlike Gujarat, TN's economy is less reliant on agriculture, with higher contributions from industry and services. The state's economic transformation is driven by medium-scale businesses rather than big corporations, facilitated by cluster-based industrialization. These clusters, like Tirupur for knitwear and Coimbatore for engineering goods, provide employment outside agriculture, reducing rural-urban migration. TN's entrepreneurial landscape spans various communities, from traditional Chettiars and Brahmins to newer entrants like Kammavar Naidus and Kongu Vellalars, fostering a diverse industrial base. This decentralized entrepreneurship, coupled with social progress indicators, underpins TN's industrial success.</description>

			<description>India’s shift from Look East to Act East policy underscores the importance of developing its island territories, especially the Andaman and Nicobar group, in response to growing Chinese naval capabilities. Located strategically near vital maritime chokepoints, these islands offer significant potential for India's maritime security and economic interests. Challenges include infrastructure development, environmental regulations, and coordination among ministries. Key recommendations include enhancing surveillance, building infrastructure, reducing mainland dependence, and leveraging international partnerships like the Quad. Expedited development is urged through streamlined clearances, international expertise, and incentivized habitation of uninhabited islands. The article emphasizes the urgency of fortifying India's presence in the Indo-Pacific region for security and economic gains.</description>

			<description>Sudan, after the fall of Omar al-Bashir's regime in 2019, has been embroiled in conflict, with a military coup in 2021 further destabilizing the nation. Despite a power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian groups, tensions remain, particularly between General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF's General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The country is on the brink of famine, with half of its population requiring aid. International efforts to mediate have been unsuccessful, and the US is seeking to restart talks post-Ramadan. The UN needs $2.7 billion to assist nearly half of Sudan's 51 million people, but funding is severely lacking. Violence continues to displace millions, both internally and across borders, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India, under Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, is addressing four significant cases with a nine-judge bench. Two cases involve state powers: one on taxing mining leaseholders and another on regulating "industrial alcohol." Two longstanding cases, pending for over 20 years, are also being heard. The first concerns the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act (MHADA), amended to allow state acquisition of dilapidated buildings if 70% of occupants agree, challenged for violating property owners' rights. The second case questions the broad definition of 'industry' under the Industrial Disputes Act, which includes state activities, and seeks legislative clarity.

			<title>Trump becomes first former US President to face criminal trial: What is the hush money payment case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-hush-money-payment-trial-9271912/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump is undergoing a criminal trial for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels, which could impact his political campaign. The trial, starting with jury selection, follows his indictment over 34 counts of falsifying business records. The case centers on a $130,000 payment made by Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in 2016, which Trump later admitted reimbursing. Cohen's guilty plea to federal campaign finance crimes led prosecutors to investigate Trump's involvement, considering the payment an illegal campaign contribution. Trump faces Class E felony charges, each with a potential four-year sentence, but conviction may not lead to prison time, with probation being a possibility.</description>

			<title>Pakistan man accused in Sarabjit Singh killing shot dead: What was the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pakistan-sarabjit-singh-killing-case-9271679/</link>
			<description>A Pakistani man, accused of killing Indian prisoner Sarabjit Singh, was shot dead in Lahore. Singh's 1990 arrest and 2013 death sparked India-Pakistan diplomatic tensions. Alleged to be an Indian spy, Singh was sentenced to death in Pakistan but claims of torture and unfair trial arose. His execution was stayed after Indian appeals. In 2013, Singh died following a jail attack. The assailants, acquitted in 2018 due to witness hostility, were linked to LeT founder Hafiz Sayeed. Singh's death was mourned in India; the government provided compensation and jobs for his daughters. The HRCP condemned the jail assault, highlighting systemic issues in prisoner protection.</description>

			<title>Gopi Thotakura to be the first Indian space tourist: What is space tourism?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gopi-thotakura-space-tourism-indian-9271691/</link>
			<description>Gopi Thotakura is poised to be the first Indian space tourist aboard Blue Origin's NS-25 mission. A seasoned pilot and entrepreneur, Thotakura's inclusion in the six-member crew marks a significant milestone, following India's first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, in 1984. Space tourism, despite its burgeoning market projected to reach $27.86 billion by 2032, faces hurdles like exorbitant costs and environmental impacts. Thotakura, a commercial jet pilot and co-founder of a wellness center, is an avid aviator with experience in diverse aircraft. The NS-25's sub-orbital journey will briefly transcend the Kármán line, offering passengers a glimpse of space. However, concerns over rocket emissions and a 3% astronaut fatality rate underscore the risks involved in this nascent industry.</description>

			<title>Who was Thiruvalluvar, and why has the BJP invoked him in its election manifesto?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/thiruvalluvar-bjp-manifesto-tamil-nadu-9271690/</link>
			<description>The BJP's election manifesto for 2024 includes a promise to establish Thiruvalluvar Cultural Centres globally to promote Indian culture and democracy. Thiruvalluvar, a revered Tamil figure, is at the center of a political tug-of-war in Tamil Nadu. His exact historical period and religious identity remain debated, with claims of him being a Hindu, Jain, or a Dravidian sage without religious labels. The 'Thirukkural', attributed to him, is a moral guide akin to the Bhagavad Gita in Tamil culture. Controversies have arisen over his portrayal, with the BJP accused of saffronizing his image, while scholars suggest he was likely a Jain. Political appropriation of Thiruvalluvar has been a strategy by various groups to connect with Tamil heritage and influence voters.</description>

			<title>Sensex down 930 points, Nifty down 0.65%: What triggered the fall?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/sensex-nifty-fall-9271258/</link>
			<description>On April 15, India's Sensex and Nifty indices fell due to rising tensions between Iran and Israel and concerns over US interest rate cuts and the India-Mauritius tax treaty amendment. The Sensex opened at 73,315.16, down by 930 points, and the Nifty fell by 180.35 points. Despite initial losses, both indices recovered slightly by midday. The conflict escalation after Iran's attack on Israel, the anticipated US inflation rates, and the tax treaty changes have led to negative investor sentiment. Foreign portfolio investors sold over Rs 8,027 crore in equities, and analysts expect outflows to continue until there's clarity on the treaty's benefits. The market's future depends on the evolving geopolitical situation and central banks are monitoring closely. Separately, India protested against pro-Khalistan slogans at an event in Canada attended by PM Trudeau, which has strained relations.</description>

			<description>The WHO's Global Hepatitis Report 2024 highlights India's significant viral hepatitis burden, comparable to tuberculosis as a leading infectious killer. In 2022, deaths from viral hepatitis reached 1.3 million globally, with a slight decrease in new cases. The report focuses on hepatitis B and C, blood-borne viruses that can cause chronic disease, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. Hepatitis B is preventable through vaccination, while hepatitis C is curable with medication. India accounts for over 11% of the global hepatitis burden, with low diagnosis rates despite free national diagnosis and treatment programs. Mother-to-child transmission drives hepatitis B cases, while hepatitis C is prevalent among injection drug users. The report emphasizes the need for widespread vaccination, improved diagnosis, and a 'treat all' approach for hepatitis B, akin to HIV treatment strategies. Despite India's low-cost diagnostics and treatments, the disparity in treatment coverage compared to tuberculosis remains significant, with minimal hep B treatment and only 21% of hep C cases receiving therapy.</description>

			<title>Lamp to Lotus, Two Bullocks to Hand: a story of symbols</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/lamp-to-lotus-two-bullocks-to-hand-a-story-of-symbols-9270434/</link>
			<description>Election symbols, integral to Indian politics, help voters identify parties, especially in a country with low literacy rates. Recognized parties choose from approved symbols, while independents and unrecognized parties get 'free symbols'. The Congress initially had 'Two Bulls with Yoke on' but post-1969 splits, the 'Hand' became its symbol. The BJP, originating from the Bharatiya Jana Sangh with 'Lamp', was allotted 'Lotus' after the Janata Party's dissolution. Symbol disputes often follow party splits, reflecting their significance in political identity and legacy. The Election Commission of India (ECI) plays a pivotal role in symbol allotment, ensuring symbols are secular and non-sentimental, with historical shifts marking changes in party dynamics.</description>

			<title>Explained: A short history of Iran-Israel ties and why they soured after 1979</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/history-israel-iran-relations-middle-east-9270079/</link>
			<description>Iran has retaliated against Israel for an earlier attack on its consulate in Syria, which resulted in the death of Iranian commanders. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard's response involved limited strikes, claiming damage to an Israeli military site, but no significant casualties. This escalation follows a series of regional tensions, including attacks by Hamas and Yemen's Houthis. Historically, Iran recognized Israel in 1948, but relations soured post-1979. Iran's Islamic Revolution marked a shift, with Israel viewed as an occupier and Iran challenging regional powers. Despite no direct military confrontations, both nations have engaged in proxy conflicts and strategic attacks, with the US's stance adding to the complexity amid its presidential elections.</description>

			<title>Contrast with Oct 7: Delhi’s call for de-escalation marks four key shifts in its Middle East diplomacy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/iran-attack-israel-india-strategy-diplomacy-9269223/</link>
			<description>India's diplomacy in the Middle East, a region marked by complex politics and conflicts, has undergone significant transitions. The recent call for de-escalation after Iran's strike against Israel contrasts with India's earlier solidarity with Tel Aviv, reflecting a balanced approach to the region's state actors. India's policy now acknowledges the internal dynamics of the Middle East, moving beyond the historical West vs Middle East perspective. The emphasis is on strategic engagement with diverse regional powers, irrespective of religious considerations, aligning with India's broader interests like the India Middle East Europe Corridor. This nuanced diplomacy is crucial as India navigates the intricate and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.</description>

			<title>A brief look at Iran’s military capabilities, amid its attacks on Israel</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-military-capability-israel-attacks-9269588/</link>
			<description>On April 14, Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Syria. This escalation has heightened concerns of a broader conflict in the Middle East, especially since the Palestinian group Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023. Iran, accused by Israel of backing Hamas and other militant groups, has criticized Israeli actions in Gaza, which have resulted in over 32,000 deaths. Iran's military capabilities include over 500,000 active personnel and 200,000 reserves, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) playing a significant role. The IRGC, designated as a terrorist organization by the US in 2019, controls the Basij militia and the elite Quds Force. Iran's arsenal, one of the largest in the Middle East, features ballistic missiles and drones capable of striking any target in the region, including Israel. Recent attacks saw 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles launched, though none entered Israeli territory, and a small number of 110 ballistic missiles reached Israel. Iran also continues to advance its drone technology, with the recent development of the Mohajer-10 drone.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-stake-iran-israel-conflict-tensions-9269260/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with India expressing serious concern and calling for immediate de-escalation. The conflict began with Iran's retaliatory attack on Israel in response to an Israeli strike in Syria. India, having strategic ties with both nations, finds itself in a difficult position as it has to balance its relationships. The situation is closely monitored by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, and advisories have been issued for Indian citizens in the region. Historical patterns of Iranian retaliation are noted, and the potential for the conflict to widen is a significant worry for India, which could impact its people, economic interests, and strategic needs in the region. The article also briefly mentions an upcoming IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals, unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<title>As Iran attacks Israel, four key questions on what is happening, why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/iran-attacks-israel-reason-9268984/</link>
			<description>Iran initiated a direct aerial assault on Israel with over 300 threats, including missiles and drones, in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike in Damascus that killed 13, including an Iranian general. The IDF, with allied support, intercepted most threats, preventing significant damage. Launched from multiple countries, this unprecedented attack marks a new escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. Iran deems the matter closed post-attack, but Israel's response is pending. President Biden condemned the attack, pledging US support for Israel and calling for a G7 meeting to address the situation, adding complexity to his Middle East policy amid re-election efforts.</description>

			<title>On Ambedkar Jayanti, a look at the significance of the Mahad Satyagraha</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/ambedkar-mahad-satyagraha-9268251/</link>
			<description>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a pivotal figure in India's struggle against caste discrimination, is remembered for his leadership in the Mahad Satyagraha of 1927, a landmark event in Dalit emancipation. Despite the Bombay Legislative Council's 1923 resolution for Dalit access to public water sources, ground realities remained unchanged due to upper-caste resistance. Ambedkar's Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha, founded in 1924, aimed to combat untouchability. The Mahad conference, initially a platform for awakening among Dalits, unexpectedly turned into a Satyagraha when Ambedkar led a procession to drink water from the previously forbidden Chavadar tank. This act of defiance, coupled with the subsequent burning of the Manusmriti, symbolized the rejection of caste oppression and ignited the Dalit movement, establishing Ambedkar as a leader of the oppressed. The Mahad Satyagraha set a precedent for organized resistance against caste-based discrimination.</description>

			<title>Here’s what to know about the hunger crisis in Gaza</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hunger-crisis-gaza-9268216/</link>
			<description>The Gaza Strip is on the brink of famine six months into the Israel-Hamas war, with a crisis exacerbated by Israel's siege and military operations. The blockade, in place even before the war, severely restricted humanitarian aid and commercial imports. Following a Hamas attack on Israel, Israel tightened controls, blocking food imports and targeting Gaza's port, farms, and infrastructure, displacing the population and destroying businesses. The U.N.'s IPC warns that famine is imminent, defined by severe food scarcity, acute malnutrition in children, and related deaths. Past famines in Somalia and South Sudan were also human-made, compounded by drought and conflict. Despite the availability of aid outside Gaza, access issues and disagreements between the U.N. and Israel over aid delivery persist, with critics accusing Israel of using aid restrictions as punishment. Global pressure mounts on Israel to ensure adequate aid and civilian protection.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-israel-axis-of-resistance-9268156/</link>
			<description>In a significant escalation of regional tensions, Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Israel on April 14. This aggressive move was in retaliation for an Israeli assault on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which resulted in the death of several Iranian generals. The attack is the latest in a series of hostilities between the two nations, with Iran accusing Israel of previous attacks and Israel condemning Iran's support for militant groups like Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas. These groups, backed by Iran, have been central to the country's strategy of regional influence and resistance against Western interests. The recent violence has raised fears of a broader conflict in a region already fraught with religious and ethnic strife, compounded by the actions of these militant organizations.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/operation-meghdoot-siachen-army-9268157/</link>
			<description>Operation Meghdoot, executed on April 13, 1984, marked India's strategic control over Siachen Glacier, outmaneuvering Pakistan. Key military figures like Gen AS Vaidya, Lt Gen CN Somanna, and others orchestrated the operation. The war game 'Exercise Walnut Cracker' was pivotal in planning, involving top brass from HQs 15 Corps. The operation's success hinged on the roles of 4 Kumaon and 19 Kumaon regiments, with the latter achieving a historic march across Zojila during winter. Author Amit K Paul's book and articles detail the operation's intricacies, including the war game's anticipation of Pakistani responses, which were ultimately deemed non-threatening. The operation's execution was seamless, with critical passes secured despite weather delays, showcasing the Indian Army's meticulous preparation and resilience. The operation remains a testament to strategic foresight and military tenacity.</description>

			<title>How the Jallianwala Bagh massacre changed the course of India’s freedom struggle</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/jallianwala-bagh-massacre-freedom-struggle-9268106/</link>
			<description>On April 13, 1919, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre became a defining moment in India's struggle for independence. British troops, under Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, fired on a peaceful gathering, with official reports claiming 379 deaths, though estimates suggest thousands. This act followed the Rowlatt Act's unrest and was a response to perceived threats of rebellion. The British initially supported Dyer, but condemnation grew as the massacre's brutality was revealed. Winston Churchill publicly decried the act, leading to Dyer's dismissal. The event shocked India, prompting Rabindranath Tagore to renounce his knighthood and Mahatma Gandhi to initiate the Non-Cooperation Movement. Historians view it as the end of moral legitimacy for British rule in India, turning victims into martyrs of nationalism.</description>

			<title>Regulating religious conversions to Buddhism: What is the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act ?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/gujarat-freedom-religion-act-conversions-buddhism-9267603/</link>
			<description>The Gujarat government has issued a circular stating Buddhism is a separate religion from Hinduism under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act (GFR Act), impacting religious conversions. The GFR Act prohibits conversions by force, allurement, misrepresentation, or marriage without District Magistrate's permission. Violations can lead to imprisonment and fines, with stricter penalties for women, minors, and SC/ST members. The 2021 amendment criminalizes conversion through marriage and places the burden of proof on the accused. The circular addresses non-compliance with the GFR Act for conversions from Hinduism to Buddhism, contradicting the constitutional inclusion of Buddhism within Hinduism for social welfare laws. The GFR Act's amendment faces legal challenges, with a limited stay granted against provisions concerning interfaith marriages, while the Supreme Court considers consolidating challenges to anti-conversion laws nationwide.</description>

			<title>Why text of amended tax treaty with Mauritius triggered stock sell-offs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-text-of-amended-tax-treaty-with-mauritius-triggered-stock-sell-offs-9267604/</link>
			<description>India has revised its tax treaty with Mauritius, introducing a Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to combat tax evasion and avoidance. This amendment aligns with the global Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework, aiming to prevent treaty abuse. The PPT will deny treaty benefits if the main intent of a transaction is to gain those benefits. The amendment has caused concern among Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) due to potential increased scrutiny and uncertainty about whether past investments will be grandfathered. Mauritius is a significant source of FPI for India, and the changes could impact future investment structures and lead to more litigation. The tax authorities now have the power to scrutinize transactions more closely, especially those not yet exited by investors. The amendment's implications are still unclear, and formal clarification is awaited to resolve ambiguities.</description>

			<title>What to expect of Olaf Scholz’s China visit?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/olaf-scholzs-xi-jinping-china-9267453/</link>
			<description>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is set for a diplomatic visit to China, including a meeting with Xi Jinping, amidst EU-China trade tensions and security concerns. Scholz's trip, his second as chancellor, comes after Germany's strategic shift to reduce reliance on China, aligning with the EU's stance. Despite this, Scholz's delegation of industrial executives suggests a desire to maintain business relations. Experts highlight Germany's internal divide on China policy and expect Scholz to address geopolitical issues like China's support for Russia and military activities near Taiwan. The visit also coincides with EU scrutiny over Chinese electric vehicles, reflecting broader challenges in balancing economic interests with political positions.</description>

			<title>Why India has advised citizens not to travel to Israel and Iran</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-india-has-advised-citizens-not-to-travel-to-israel-and-iran-9267381/</link>
			<description>In light of rising tensions in West Asia, India has issued a travel advisory against visiting Iran and Israel, urging citizens to register with Indian Embassies and minimize movement. This follows a labor shift in Israel due to suspended work permits for Palestinians and Arab migrants, leading to an influx of Indian workers. Tensions escalated after a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran's embassy in Syria, killing several Iranian military advisors. Global powers, including the US, France, and Russia, have issued similar travel warnings and called for restraint to prevent further destabilization. The situation remains precarious, with potential Iranian reprisal attacks anticipated, which could provoke severe responses from Israel depending on the targets.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: What Moscow terror attack suggests about ISKP, counter-terrorism cooperation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/moscow-terror-attack-iskp-9266899/</link>
			<description>In the aftermath of the Moscow terror attack at Crocus City Hall, four Tajik suspects were arrested by Russian authorities. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility, yet without direct affiliation, leading to speculation by IS watchers about the involvement of Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). Russian investigators suggested Ukrainian Special Services' involvement, citing the suspects' confessions and phone forensics. The attack, which lacked jihadist slogans or suicide bombers, seemed motivated by money rather than ideology. The incident raises questions about the credibility of IS claims and the potential shift towards mercenary recruitment. The attack's 'hit-and-run' nature signals a new urban warfare tactic, potentially inspiring lone-wolf attacks, as indicated by recent threats to European football stadiums and an FBI arrest in the US. The article underscores the weakening global counter-terrorism cooperation and the persistent threat posed by IS and its affiliates. Anju Gupta, a security analyst, emphasizes the need for thorough investigation of IS claims to understand the current terrorist threat landscape.</description>

			<title>Switzerland’s peace bid amid Russia-Ukraine war</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/switzerland-peace-conference-russia-ukraine-war-9266880/</link>
			<description>Switzerland is set to host a peace conference in Bürgenstock on June 15-16, aiming to facilitate dialogue for a lasting peace in Ukraine, following the G7 Summit in Italy. The conference, initiated at Ukraine's President Zelenskyy's request, seeks to involve 120 countries, including India, and will discuss a roadmap for peace based on international law. Switzerland's history of neutrality and role as a mediator in global conflicts underscores its suitability for hosting such discussions. The conference marks the beginning of a process that may eventually include Russia, despite initial skepticism. India's balanced diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine and its potential role in the peace process highlight its position as a credible, non-partisan player on the global stage. The event precedes the Lok Sabha election results, offering India a chance to influence global discourse.</description>

			<title>Explained: Vietnam’s $12 billion financial fraud, for which a businesswoman has been sentenced to death</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vietnam-scam-truong-my-lan-death-penalty-9266548/</link>
			<description>Truong My Lan, a prominent businesswoman in Vietnam, has been sentenced to death for her involvement in a massive financial fraud case, considered the country's largest on record, amounting to $12.5 billion, about 3% of Vietnam's 2022 GDP. Lan, who rose from selling cosmetics on the streets to chairing a major real estate company, allegedly diverted a large sum of money from the Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB) through shell companies, following a 2011 bank merger.

The court found Lan guilty of bribery, violating banking regulations, and embezzlement, along with her accomplices, including family members. Despite efforts to fight the case, the verdict was upheld. Notably, Lan's death sentence for financial crimes, particularly as a woman, is uncommon in Vietnam.

This trial reflects the government's crackdown on corruption within the private sector, possibly to reinforce the Communist Party's control amid the sector's rapid growth and recent scandals involving high-ranking officials. The verdict is also part of broader political maneuvers, as seen in the government's "Blazing Furnace" campaign targeting corruption among influential figures, including former presidents.</description>

Apple has been sending out these threat notifications since late 2021, offering advice on protecting devices and privacy. Recommendations include updating software, using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and activating Lockdown Mode, which restricts device functions to prevent access by attackers.</description>

			<title>Why Trump has refused to endorse a national abortion ban in US</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-abortion-ban-us-9266472/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump recently stated that he believes abortion laws should be determined by individual states, distancing himself from endorsing a national ban. This disappointed some of his conservative supporters who advocate for a nationwide abortion ban. Trump's stance contrasts with the growing demand among conservative Republicans for such a ban, especially after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Critics argue that the issue should focus on protecting unborn children rather than state jurisdiction. Trump's position is seen as a political move ahead of the presidential elections, recognizing the complexity of the abortion issue and its impact on independent voters. Meanwhile, Democrats are using Trump's statement to rally support, emphasizing the importance of abortion rights in the upcoming election. Trump's stance on abortion has been inconsistent over the years, and while some view his recent statement as a moderation, it's uncertain whether he will maintain this position in the long run.</description>

			<title>Swiss women win landmark climate change case: Why is it significant?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/swiss-women-climate-change-case-9266398/</link>
			<description>Europe’s highest human rights court recently ruled in favor of 2,000 Swiss women over 64, who sued the Swiss government for not doing enough to combat climate change. The court found that the government violated the women's right to life by failing to enact adequate climate policies and meet greenhouse gas emission goals. This landmark ruling could set a precedent for similar cases across Europe and beyond. It follows a recent decision by India's Supreme Court recognizing the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. The rise of climate litigation globally reflects a growing trend of holding governments and companies accountable for their contributions to climate change and insufficient mitigation efforts.</description>

			<title>How can students improve their chances of getting a Canadian visa?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/canada-international-student-study-permit-allocatio-enhance-their-visa-success-rate-9266204/</link>
			<description>Canada has adjusted its allocation of attestation letters for international students, which are necessary for study permit issuance. While there's a cap on visas, choosing provinces with more letters can improve chances. The allocation model aims for zero net growth, replacing each departing student with a new one. Overall, there's a 28% decrease in study permit approvals compared to last year. Certain student categories are exempt, but there's a focus on provinces with increased allocations like Alberta, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories. Traditional favorites like Ontario and British Columbia have seen decreases in allocations. Experts advise considering less popular provinces for better visa success rates.</description>

			<title>Explained: Karnataka HC quashes Centre’s circular on banning ‘dangerous’ dog breeds</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/karnataka-hc-quash-circular-dog-breeds-9266050/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka High Court has struck down a circular issued by the Centre that aimed to prohibit the sale, breeding, or keeping of 23 "dangerous" dog breeds. The court ruled that the ban could not be imposed without appropriate recommendation from a properly constituted committee. This decision came after the Karnataka HC had previously stayed the circular on March 19, with the Calcutta HC also ordering a partial stay and the Delhi HC seeking the Centre's response to a plea challenging the circular. The Karnataka HC emphasized the need for consultation with stakeholders and criticized the lack of representation from certified breeding organizations in the decision-making process. Additionally, the court noted that a blanket ban on the specified breeds would violate rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The Calcutta HC partially stayed the circular, particularly objecting to the directive mandating the sterilization of dog breeds, which it deemed potentially fatal, especially for young puppies. In Delhi, a plea challenged the circular's sterilization mandate, arguing against its scientific credibility and legitimacy. The court there sought a response from the Centre on the matter.</description>

			<title>A Sicilian volcano is blowing smoke rings in the sky. What are volcanic vortex rings?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/mount-etna-volcano-smoke-rings-vortex-9265785/</link>
			<description>Mount Etna, Europe's largest and one of the most active volcanoes, has been producing rare volcanic vortex rings since April 2, 2024. These rings are circular smoke formations caused by the rapid release of gas, primarily water vapor, through a nearly perfect circular vent in the crater. This phenomenon, first observed in 1724, has been documented at other volcanoes worldwide. However, Etna is particularly known for its prolific production of these rings, with dozens observed daily. While the recent activity from Etna's new vent has generated hundreds, if not thousands, of smoke rings, experts clarify that it does not necessarily indicate an impending spectacular eruption. The activity from the vent may slow down due to changes in the conduit's properties.</description>

			<description>India's first Lok Sabha election in 1951-52 marked a historic moment in the country's democratic journey. It involved over 176 million electors, with the majority being unlettered, showcasing a significant act of faith in the democratic process. Led by Jawaharlal Nehru's Indian National Congress, other parties in the race included the Socialist Party, Communist Party of India, and others. The Election Commission faced unprecedented challenges in organizing the elections, including logistical issues and ensuring the participation of women voters. Despite the hurdles, the elections were a success, with a voter turnout of 45% women. The results saw the Congress winning a majority of seats, solidifying Nehru's position. The election process involved innovative measures such as colored ballot boxes and papers to accommodate the illiterate population. This election laid the foundation for India's democratic principles and remains a significant milestone in its history.</description>

			<description>The Swiss government has announced plans to host a summit on June 15-16 aimed at initiating lasting peace in Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February 2022. More than 100 countries may participate, with India among the invitees, though Russia's attendance remains uncertain. The summit is a follow-up to a plan proposed by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis. However, it's cautioned that the conference won't lead to an immediate peace deal. Talks have been complicated by differing conditions, with Ukraine insisting on an end to hostilities and Russian withdrawal from occupied territories, while Russia emphasizes "denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine. Previous peace proposals, including a 10-point plan by Ukraine and a 12-point plan backed by China, have failed to gain traction. Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis stressed the importance of Russian involvement in the peace process, even if they're not present at the first meeting.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/the-path-ambedkar-showed-why-lower-castes-embrace-buddhism-9264683/</link>
			<description>The Gujarat government has stated that conversions from Hinduism to Buddhism in the state require prior approval from the district magistrate under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003. Thousands of Dalits, especially in Gujarat, convert to Buddhism annually, with approximately 2,000 conversions reported in 2023. This practice has historical roots dating back to Dr. B R Ambedkar's conversion in 1956 and beyond, as Buddhism emerged as a response to the orthodox Vedic religion, offering an alternative to the caste system. Ambedkar saw Buddhism as a revolutionary path to challenge caste-based discrimination. The conversion to Buddhism by lower castes continues to be significant across India, symbolizing not only emancipation but also following in Ambedkar's footsteps.</description>

			<title>History of Sulthan Bathery, which Kerala BJP chief wants renamed as Ganapathyvattam</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/kerala-bjp-wayanad-sulthan-bathery-ganapathyvattam-tipu-sultan-9264627/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the renaming of Sulthan Bathery, a town in Kerala's Wayanad district. K Surendran, the state BJP president and candidate for the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, argues that renaming the town is inevitable due to its association with Tipu Sultan, whom he characterizes as a historical figure responsible for massacres of Hindus and Christians.

Surendran proposes renaming Sulthan Bathery to Ganapathyvattam, reflecting its historical connection to a stone temple built by Jains from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the 13th century. The temple, originally known as Ganapathyvattam, was partially destroyed during Tipu Sultan's invasions in the 18th century.

Tipu Sultan used the Maha Ganapathy temple as a battery or store for weapons, leading the British to refer to it as "[Tipu] Sultan's Battery," which eventually evolved into the name Sulthan Bathery.

The controversy over renaming the town is part of the broader political landscape in Wayanad, where Surendran is contesting against sitting MP Rahul Gandhi (Congress) and Annie Raja (CPI). The article also mentions the historical context of Tipu Sultan's invasions in the region, including the destruction of temples and churches and forced religious conversions.

In addition to the discussion on Sulthan Bathery, the article briefly mentions the upcoming announcement of exam results by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education.</description>

			<title>What is the ‘Adjudicating Authority’ that has confirmed ED’s attachment of Rahul-Sonia-promoted company’s assets?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/adjudicating-authority-ed-attachment-rahul-sonia-company-assets-9264546/</link>
			<description>The Adjudicating Authority under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) has confirmed the attachment of assets worth Rs 751.9 crore belonging to the National Herald newspaper, which is promoted by the Congress party. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) provisionally attached these properties in November 2023 in a PMLA case against Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) and Young Indian (YI), the companies behind the newspaper. YI, controlled by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, is being investigated for allegedly acquiring AJL and its assets for a low price with Congress's involvement.

The PMLA allows attachment of properties suspected to be acquired from criminal proceeds, and this order must be confirmed within 180 days by the Adjudicating Authority. The accused can still use the property until confirmation, but once confirmed, the ED can take possession. Challenging this confirmation is possible through appeals.

Confiscated properties can remain inaccessible until the trial's conclusion, potentially deteriorating over time. Vehicles may also deteriorate while in storage, with the ED paying for parking and potentially losing more than the vehicle's value in rent.</description>

			<title>New FDTL rules: Why DGCA has asked airlines to indicate their implementation timelines</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/pilot-fatigue-new-fdtl-rules-aviation-9264258/</link>
			<description>The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has deferred the implementation of new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules, which include measures for managing stress and fatigue among pilots. Originally planned for June 1, the rules were postponed due to resistance from airlines. The DGCA has asked airlines to indicate when they can implement the new rules, with a tentative date expected by May 8. The new regulations aim to improve fatigue management through longer weekly rest periods and fewer night landings. However, airlines argue that implementing these rules would require hiring more pilots and could impact operations. Fatigue and stress among pilots have raised concerns about flight safety, prompting the need for better regulations. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates countries to establish fatigue management regulations. The DGCA's current regulations require airlines to establish limitations on flight duty time within its framework. The regulations also prohibit flight crew from accepting assignments that exceed prescribed limitations and require carriers to maintain a system for managing fatigue reports.</description>

			<title>Why revival of 1864 abortion law could resonate in US politics beyond Arizona</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-revival-of-1864-abortion-law-could-resonate-beyond-arizona-9263251/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of Arizona recently made a significant decision, resurrecting a law from 1864 that practically bans most abortions in the state. Under this law, doctors who perform abortions could face 2-5 years in prison. The law, dating back to the Civil War era, prohibits abortion unless it's necessary to save the mother's life, without exceptions for rape or incest. Although initially blocked by a court after Roe v Wade in 1973, recent legal developments have paved the way for its enforcement. The ruling has reignited the polarizing abortion debate, particularly as it may influence the upcoming presidential election in Arizona, a crucial swing state. Notably, even some Republicans have criticized the ruling, expressing concerns about its implications. This decision adds to a growing trend of states imposing stricter abortion laws, with implications for national politics.</description>

			<title>Why Supreme Court’s curative petition relief for Delhi Metro is significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-supreme-courts-curative-petition-relief-for-delhi-metro-is-significant-9263211/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) doesn't have to pay nearly Rs 8,000 crore to Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a Reliance Infrastructure company. This overturns a 2021 judgment upholding the arbitral award in favor of DAMEPL. The dispute arose from a public-private partnership between DMRC and DAMEPL for the Delhi Airport Metro Express. Despite operational issues and termination of the agreement, DMRC won the case after multiple court battles. The SC exercised its "extraordinary powers" in a curative writ petition to correct a "fundamental error" in its judgment, restoring the 2019 position and relieving DMRC of the payment obligation. This rare use of curative jurisdiction, initiated by the government, raises questions about judicial restraint and investor confidence.</description>

			<title>In allowing curative plea in DMRC case, how Supreme Court pushes the envelope</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/allowing-curative-plea-how-supreme-court-pushes-the-envelope-9263351/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has set aside a 2017 arbitral award that required the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to pay almost Rs 8000 crore to Reliance Infrastructure, owned by Anil Ambani. This move expands the scope of the court's intervention powers beyond constitutionally prescribed processes. The court invoked a sparingly used judicial innovation called a curative writ petition to revive a 2019 Delhi High Court judgment that partially set aside the Delhi Metro arbitration award. This innovation is used to correct a "grave miscarriage of justice." However, using this jurisdiction in a commercial case raises concerns about the finality of the court's ruling. The court's intervention also contradicts the principle of minimum judicial interference, which it has promoted since 2015. The prolonged timelines of court interference in commercial matters also raise questions about the enforcement of arbitral awards in India. Even the Supreme Court, in its curative writ, acknowledges the risks of its intervention and cautions against its routine use.</description>

			<title>How invasive species threaten natural ecosystems</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/invasive-species-natural-ecosystems-threaten-9262836/</link>
			<description>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands administration sought assistance from the Wildlife Institute of India to manage the growing population of chital (spotted deer) in Ross Island. Chital were introduced to the island by the British and have since spread rapidly, impacting the native flora and fauna. This highlights the issue of invasive species, which can threaten biodiversity and ecosystems. In India, the legal definition of invasive species is narrower, focusing on non-native species that threaten wildlife or habitats. Examples include certain fish and turtle species, like the red-eared slider, which are often abandoned by exotic pet owners and pose threats to local species. Invasive species disrupt ecosystems by dominating food chains and outcompeting native species. The proliferation of chital in the Andamans has affected native vegetation regeneration. Globally, invasive species have significant economic costs, with billions of dollars lost annually due to damage to ecosystems. For instance, the cotton mealy bug has severely impacted cotton crops in India.</description>

			<title>What is CDP-SURAKSHA, govt’s new digital platform to disburse subsidies to horticulture farmers?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cdp-suraksha-horticulture-9262824/</link>
			<description>The BJP-led government in India has introduced a new platform called CDP-SURAKSHA to distribute subsidies to horticulture farmers as part of the Cluster Development Programme (CDP). This initiative aims to boost the horticulture sector, which contributes significantly to India's agricultural gross value addition. The CDP-SURAKSHA platform is digital and allows for instant subsidy disbursal to farmers' bank accounts using e-RUPI vouchers. It integrates various databases and allows farmers to order planting material online. Once the material is delivered, farmers verify it, and the subsidy is released. The platform streamlines the subsidy process, ensuring farmers receive support upfront. Currently, the platform is being piloted in selected clusters, with plans for further expansion.</description>

			<title>When is a moveable asset ‘sizable’ enough to declare? It depends, says Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/when-is-a-moveable-asset-sizable-enough-to-declare-it-depends-says-the-supreme-court-9262793/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently ruled on a case concerning the disclosure of a candidate's private information in election papers. The court emphasized a candidate's right to privacy, stating that voters do not have an absolute right to know every detail of a candidate's private life. It was clarified that candidates are not required to disclose every movable property they own unless it constitutes a "sizable asset" or reflects upon the candidate's lifestyle relevant to their candidacy.

The case involved Karikho Kri, whose election to the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly was challenged for alleged non-disclosure of certain assets in his nomination papers. The High Court had declared Kri's victory void, citing non-disclosure of a vehicle as constituting "undue influence." However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision, stating that not every non-disclosure automatically amounts to a defect of substantial nature.

The Supreme Court emphasized that each case must be judged on its own facts, with no strict rule regarding the non-disclosure of movable assets. Factors such as the value of the assets and their reflection on the candidate's lifestyle are considered. For instance, the non-disclosure of high-priced assets reflecting a lavish lifestyle may constitute undue influence, whereas the non-disclosure of simple, low-value assets may not.

In summary, the Supreme Court's ruling highlights the importance of considering the relevance and impact of non-disclosed assets on a candidate's candidacy, rather than applying a blanket rule to all cases of non-disclosure.</description>

			<title>What a new 3-D map of universe hints about the nature of dark energy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/new-3-d-map-universe-nature-dark-energy-9260670/</link>
			<description>The universe's expansion, known since Edwin Hubble's observations in 1929, was found to be accelerating in the late 1990s, leading to the hypothesis of "dark energy." This mysterious force comprises about 70% of the universe. Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provided promising data. Operating for three years, DESI captured light from 6 million galaxies, creating a detailed 3D map of the universe's evolution. It revealed an increasing expansion rate, challenging established theoretical models. Initial hints suggest fluctuations in dark energy density, which could revolutionize our understanding of the universe, potentially leading to new physics. Further analysis of DESI data is underway, offering hope for deeper insights into dark energy's nature.</description>

			<title>Why a Brazil Supreme Court judge wants to investigate Elon Musk and X</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/brazil-supreme-court-judge-elon-musk-9260553/</link>
			<description>The Brazil Supreme Court has been investigating the spread of fake news, implicating Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Musk has accused the judge of betraying Brazil's constitution and people, calling for his removal. The dispute arose when the court ordered certain X accounts to be blocked, which Musk refused to comply with, citing concerns about free speech. The judge, Alexandre de Moraes, accused Musk of obstructing justice and inciting crime, leading to an investigation into Musk's alleged misuse of X. This isn't the first time the court has clashed with social media giants; similar conflicts have arisen with former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and others. While Musk claims to support free speech, X has complied with some government requests in the past, despite disagreement. The Indian government, for example, has issued orders affecting X, leading to compliance despite objections. However, Musk has also faced criticism for allegedly silencing critics on his platform.</description>

			<title>How and why US wants to establish a time standard for the Moon</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/lunar-time-standard-moon-9260264/</link>
			<description>The White House has directed NASA to establish a time standard for the Moon, called Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC), by the end of 2026. This standard will help coordinate activities on the lunar surface for international bodies and private companies. While most timekeeping on Earth is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), lunar time is different due to factors like gravity affecting the passage of time. A unified time standard is crucial as more countries plan lunar missions in the coming years. To create LTC, atomic clocks may be deployed on the Moon to account for its unique time flow. These clocks will need to be strategically placed to accommodate variations caused by factors like the Moon's rotation and local mass concentrations. Just as atomic clocks on Earth vary in rate from the Equator to the poles, lunar atomic clocks will provide a precise time standard for lunar activities.</description>

			<title>What is a citizen’s ‘right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change’, underlined by Supreme Court?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/the-citizens-climate-rights-9258997/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently ruled that people have a "right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change," citing Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. This decision emerged from a case concerning the conservation of the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB). The Court's judgment, delivered on March 21 by a three-judge Bench, emphasized the intersection of climate change and human rights, urging states to address climate impacts through a rights-based approach.

The case originated from a petition filed by conservationist M K Ranjitsinh, seeking protection for the GIB and the Lesser Florican, both facing extinction. The Court modified its previous order regarding overhead transmission lines in the GIB habitat, directing experts to assess the feasibility of undergrounding power lines in specific areas.

In its ruling, the Court highlighted India's obligations to combat climate change and emphasized the importance of integrating environmental principles into constitutional rights. While recognizing the absence of specific legislation on climate change, the Court affirmed the existence of a "right against adverse effects of climate change" for Indians.

Legal experts view the judgment as significant for environmental jurisprudence, expanding Article 14 to include environmental and climate justice issues. They anticipate its influence on public discourse and future government policies, setting a precedent for recognizing broader public interests where existing laws fall short.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/zaporizhzhia-attacked-again-the-nuclear-risks-from-reckless-military-action-9258996/</link>
			<description>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant faced a crisis following a drone strike, prompting concerns about nuclear safety amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia blamed Ukraine for the attack, but responsibility remains unclear. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed damage to one reactor but stated nuclear safety hadn't been compromised. However, the incident raised fears about the integrity of the containment system. The plant's reliance on external power sources poses a risk, with previous outages highlighting vulnerabilities. While nuclear reactors are designed to withstand certain impacts, deliberate attacks could pose unprecedented threats. The situation underscores the avoidable nature of the crisis, with the IAEA unable to prevent military actions near nuclear facilities. Director General Grossi urged restraint to avoid future attacks, emphasizing the inherent danger of targeting nuclear sites.</description>

			<title>When Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha formed coalition governments — what history says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/hindu-mahasabha-muslim-league-coalition-9258342/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent exchange between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge regarding historical associations of political parties in India. Modi suggested that the Congress manifesto had similarities to the Muslim League's agenda, prompting Kharge to accuse the BJP's ancestors of supporting the British and the Muslim League during India's freedom struggle.

Kharge's claims were then examined for historical accuracy. It's noted that during the 1937 provincial elections, Congress performed well, forming ministries in various provinces. However, non-Congress governments were formed in Punjab, Sindh, and Bengal. In Bengal, the Muslim League formed a coalition government with Fazlul Huq's Krishak Praja Party (KPP), despite Congress being the single largest party.

The article highlights that both the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha entered alliances with the British during the Quit India Movement of 1942. While Congress leaders were imprisoned for their involvement in the movement, the League and Mahasabha continued supporting the British war effort, aiming to maintain their political power. 

Additionally, the article mentions ideological similarities between the League and the Mahasabha, as noted by scholars and leaders like Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. This ideological convergence translated into political alliances, such as the League-Mahasabha coalition governments in Sindh and NWFP during the Quit India Movement.

Overall, the article provides historical context to the claims made by Modi and Kharge, highlighting the complex political landscape during India's freedom struggle and the alliances formed by various parties at that time.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/solar-eclipse-study-sun-aditya-l1-view-india-9258200/</link>
			<description>A team of Indian solar physicists is gearing up to closely observe the Sun during Monday's total solar eclipse to gain insights into the solar atmosphere. Led by Dipankar Banerjee from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), the team will be stationed in Dallas, Texas, to conduct experiments and observations during the eclipse. They aim to study the solar corona using ground-based telescopes and the coronagraph onboard the Aditya L1 spacecraft, which is stationed 1.5 million km from Earth. The eclipse provides a unique opportunity to study the Sun's corona, particularly its inner regions, which are normally difficult to observe due to scattered light. By employing narrowband imaging and conducting on-band and off-band observations, the team hopes to investigate high-frequency oscillations and variable phenomena in the solar atmosphere. These observations will also aid in calibrating instruments on the Aditya L1 spacecraft and provide insights into the Sun's activity during the current solar cycle.</description>

			<title>K Kavitha’s bail plea rejected: What court said on PMLA’s bail concession for women</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/pmla-bail-concession-women-k-kavitha-plea-9257301/</link>
			<description>The Delhi trial court denied interim bail to Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in the Delhi excise scam case. The court cited the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which allows bail for women but is not mandatory for the court to follow. Section 45 of the PMLA sets strict bail standards, placing the burden of proof on the accused. While there's an exception for women, it's not automatic and depends on specific conditions, such as not being a flight risk or tampering with evidence or witnesses. Kavitha's lawyer argued she should be granted bail based on a Delhi High Court ruling, but the trial judge disagreed. The judge found Kavitha not only engaged in evidence destruction but also influenced witnesses, making her ineligible for bail under the PMLA.</description>

			<title>How anti-money laundering law came to have a vast scope, granting police powers to ED</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/anti-money-laundering-law-pmla-evolution-9257298/</link>
			<description>The Congress party's manifesto, titled "Nyay Patra," for the Lok Sabha election, vows to end the weaponization of laws, arbitrary searches, and indiscriminate arrests if elected. It promises to enact a law on bail emphasizing "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" across all criminal laws. This proposal appears to be a critique of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which have been criticized for their stringent provisions leading to prolonged incarceration without trial. The PMLA, enacted to combat money laundering and terror financing, was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2021, despite criticism. The law grants the ED sweeping powers, including stringent standards for bail, which have been controversial. Amendments made in 2009 and 2012 expanded the ED's powers, allowing coercive action against politicians accused of corruption. These amendments, particularly those in 2012, have been criticized for leading to prolonged pre-trial incarcerations. Critics argue that such extended detentions before trial effectively amount to serving a sentence even before conviction.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘An unexamined life is not worth living’, by Socrates</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-unexamined-life-worth-socrates-9256767/</link>
			<description>The article delves into the famous quote attributed to Socrates, "An unexamined life is not worth living," and its implications. It discusses how Socrates, through his student Plato, criticized the Athenian democracy for its susceptibility to manipulation and blind faith in the Greek gods, which ultimately led to his trial and execution. The quote emphasizes the importance of introspection, ethical evaluation, and questioning one's beliefs and actions.

The article explores both the merits and critiques of Socrates' assertion. On one hand, self-reflection can lead to personal growth, moral clarity, and societal critique. On the other hand, critics argue that the examined life may not always lead to happiness or fulfillment, as it can be arduous and may not be accessible to everyone. Moreover, excessive self-analysis could lead to cynicism or narcissism.

In conclusion, while Socrates' notion of self-examination holds relevance in a world inundated with information and conflicting perspectives, its practicality and potential pitfalls warrant consideration.</description>

			<title>Two reasons why food inflation may soften in the months ahead</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/food-inflation-lower-reasons-9256361/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted the challenge posed by food price pressures to reaching the inflation target of 4%. Despite overall inflation standing at 4.85% in March, retail food inflation was at 8.52%, persistently high for nine consecutive months. However, there's optimism for a decrease in food inflation in the coming months, potentially allowing the MPC to consider cutting interest rates. This optimism stems from a global decrease in food prices, driven by bumper harvests and restored supply lines post disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine War. Specifically, the prices of vegetable oils have risen, but cereal prices continue to decline. Importing wheat is becoming more feasible due to lower global prices, potentially easing pressure on domestic production. Similarly, pulses imports have surged due to dry weather in major growing states, but the weakening El Niño weather pattern brings hope for improved rainfall and agricultural output. This could mitigate food inflation and benefit the government post the upcoming elections.</description>

			<title>Why Mexico suspended diplomatic ties with Ecuador after dramatic embassy raids</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/mexico-suspends-ties-ecuador-embassy-raids-9256265/</link>
			<description>Mexico has severed diplomatic ties with Ecuador after Ecuadorian police raided Mexico's embassy in Quito to arrest former Vice President Jorge Glas, who had been granted asylum there. President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador condemned Ecuador's actions as a violation of international law. Glas, convicted twice for corruption, has been at the embassy since December 2023. Despite Mexico's complaints, armed police entered the embassy and took Glas into custody. Glas alleges political persecution by Ecuador's center-right government. Mexico's progressive President Obrador's criticism of Ecuador's political violence strained relations even before this incident. The expulsion of Mexico's ambassador from Ecuador exacerbated tensions. Ecuador's justification for the embassy raid was Glas's "imminent flight risk" and the inability to diplomatically resolve the situation. The situation has drawn criticism from Latin American governments and the US State Department. Mexico plans to file a complaint with the International Court of</description>

			<title>What makes a total solar eclipse so rare?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/total-solar-eclipse-rare-9255264/</link>
			<description>On Monday, April 8, a rare event will occur: a total solar eclipse crossing North America, passing over Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Total solar eclipses are infrequent for any specific location, with about 400 years passing between occurrences. Solar eclipses happen when the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow. There are four types: total, annular, partial, and hybrid. Total eclipses occur when the Moon fully blocks the Sun, allowing observers to see the Sun's corona. Annular eclipses happen when the Moon is at its farthest point from Earth, leaving a ring of sunlight visible. Partial eclipses occur when the Moon blocks only part of the Sun. Hybrid eclipses shift between total and annular as the Moon's shadow moves. Solar eclipses occur during a new moon, but not every month due to the Moon's tilted orbit. Solar eclipses are relatively rare events, with total eclipses occurring about once every 18 months. The umbral shadow during a total eclipse covers less than one percent of the Earth's surface, making it rare for many people to witness it.</description>

			<title>Why Botswana threatened to send 20,000 elephants to Germany</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/botswana-elephant-population-germany-9255371/</link>
			<description>Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi recently warned of sending 20,000 elephants to Germany in response to Germany's proposed stricter limits on importing hunting trophies. Botswana, home to a significant elephant population, has been a sanctuary for these animals due to stable governance and conservation efforts. However, the increasing elephant population has led to conflicts with humans, damaging property and crops, and posing risks to livelihoods. Botswana has attempted to mitigate this by donating elephants to other countries, but with limited success. In 2019, Botswana lifted its ban on trophy hunting, arguing it helps control elephant numbers and benefits the local economy. Critics, including animal rights advocates, argue against trophy hunting, citing ethical concerns and disputing its economic benefits. Despite differing opinions, experts stress the need for nuanced approaches to conservation, considering the complex dynamics involved.</description>

			<title>Nehru, Bose, or… Maulana Barkatullah? Who was India’s ‘first prime minister’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/nehru-bose-maulana-barkatullah-indias-first-prime-minister-kangana-ranaut-9254798/</link>
			<description>Kangana Ranaut recently asserted in an interview that Subhas Chandra Bose, not Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister. She referenced the Provisional Government of Azad Hind (Free India) formed by Bose in 1943 as evidence. This government, established in Singapore, claimed authority over Indian civilians and military personnel in British Southeast Asian colonies and was recognized by Axis powers during World War II. Similarly, a Provisional Government of India was formed in Kabul in 1915 by the Indian Independence Committee. These provisional governments aimed to legitimize resistance against British rule but lacked widespread international recognition and control over Indian territory. Despite their symbolic significance, they cannot be considered the legitimate government of India due to these factors.</description>

			<title>SC stays order against Uttar Pradesh madrasa law: A look at madrasa education in the state</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/uttar-pradesh-madrasa-law-education-9254643/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently halted an Allahabad High Court decision that deemed the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004 unconstitutional. The High Court had ruled the Act violated secularism and fundamental rights by focusing on Islamic studies over modern subjects. There are around 16,513 recognized and 8,449 unrecognized madrasas in Uttar Pradesh, serving approximately 27 lakh students. The Act, enacted in 2004, has faced scrutiny, especially since 2017, with allegations of irregularities, foreign funding, and potential terror links. Concerns also arose over the payment of salaries to modern subject teachers in these madrasas. The discontinuation of a modernization scheme further fueled protests by teachers demanding overdue salaries.</description>

			<title>Why green hydrogen presents both major opportunities and significant challenges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-green-hydrogen-presents-both-major-opportunities-significant-challenges-9253910/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in India has introduced a scheme worth Rs 496 crore to support pilot projects focusing on green hydrogen as a vehicle fuel and developing infrastructure like refuelling stations. Major Indian commercial vehicle manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Volvo Eicher, and Ashok Leyland are intensifying efforts to develop hydrogen-powered trucks and buses. Indian energy companies are also scaling up green hydrogen production to reduce costs and compete with other fuels. Green hydrogen, produced from water electrolysis using renewable energy, offers emission-free production and has significant potential for reducing carbon emissions in transportation. The MNRE scheme aims to validate the technical feasibility and economic viability of green hydrogen-powered vehicles and refuelling stations. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) offer a promising alternative to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for heavy-duty trucks due to their lighter weight and increased payload capacity. However, challenges such as high production costs, storage, and transportation constraints need to be addressed for widespread adoption. Specialized cylinders for storing green hydrogen and robust safety standards are essential for handling and retailing the fuel. While advancements in battery technology may affect the long-term viability of green hydrogen-powered vehicles, efforts to develop infrastructure and reduce costs continue.</description>

			<title>Bengaluru and Cape Town: A tale of two cities hit by water scarcity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/bengaluru-and-cape-town-a-tale-of-two-cities-hit-by-water-scarcity-9253919/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe water shortage crisis faced by Bengaluru, comparing it to Cape Town's water scarcity situation in 2015-18. Dr. T V Ramachandra from the Indian Institute of Science highlights that if Bengaluru continues to mismanage its water supply, it could face a situation worse than Cape Town's. Both cities experienced critically low reservoir levels due to below-average rainfall, rapid urbanization, and inefficient water use practices. Measures such as water rationing and restrictions on water usage have been implemented in both cities. Bengaluru's BWSSB has imposed penalties for violators of water usage rules. The crisis disproportionately affects the poor, increasing health risks due to the lack of water for sanitation. However, BWSSB officials believe the situation will improve soon.</description>

			<title>NATO at 75: Why the alliance was formed, where it stands today</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nato-at-75-purpose-members-challenges-9253642/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on its 75th anniversary. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that NATO is bigger, stronger, and more united than ever with 32 member-states, but it also faces challenges, notably from Russia. NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members, based on the concept of collective security, where an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Its purpose was to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War. NATO has expanded over the years, including former Eastern Bloc countries. Despite concerns about its relevance post-Cold War, NATO has adapted and continues to serve various functions, including stabilizing Europe. Tensions have arisen within NATO, particularly regarding military spending and strategic coordination. Disagreements over funding and future commitments persist, especially regarding the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The article also briefly mentions the announcement of exam results by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education.</description>

			<title>4.8 magnitude earthquake hits New York City: why it is a rare event in the region</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/why-earthquakes-are-rare-in-new-york-9253858/</link>
			<description>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.8 struck near New York City, surprising residents in an area that rarely experiences significant seismic activity. The quake's epicenter was located in New Jersey, and tremors were felt from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts. While there were no reports of damages, the event raised questions about why earthquakes are uncommon in the region. Unlike the West Coast, where tectonic plates meet, the East Coast, including New York, is not situated near plate boundaries. However, there are fault lines in the area, such as the Ramapo Fault in New Jersey and smaller ones under Manhattan. These faults result from geological processes millions of years ago, and while they have become less active over time, they can still release stress, causing occasional earthquakes. The exact fault line responsible for the recent quake is unclear, as studying the region is challenging due to the lack of nearby plate boundaries.</description>

			<title>As Shoma Sen gets bail, what is the status of other accused in Elgaar Parishad case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/shoma-sen-bail-elgaar-parishad-case-9253584/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently granted bail to former Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, who had been arrested six years ago by the Pune Police for alleged Maoist links in the Elgaar Parishad case. This decision was influenced by Sen's prolonged detention and the fact that her trial has not yet commenced. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not oppose her bail, signaling a shift in their stance.

The Elgaar Parishad case stems from the Koregaon Bhima violence of January 1, 2018, where Maoist groups allegedly organized a gathering the day before the violence erupted. Sixteen arrests were made in connection with the case, with accusations against lawyers, activists, and academics for alleged Maoist affiliations.

Among the accused, eight have been granted bail, including prominent figures like poet P Varavara Rao, lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj, and former IIT professor Anand Teltumbde. However, some remain incarcerated pending appeal hearings or ongoing legal processes.

The courts have been considering the extended detention of the accused without a trial, with several directives issued to expedite legal proceedings. Despite the bail granted to some, others, including journalist-activist Sudhir Dhawale and lawyer Surendra Gadling, remain behind bars as their cases are still pending.

The judicial process is ongoing, with the courts emphasizing the need for timely trials and addressing concerns regarding lengthy incarcerations without convictions.</description>

			<title>Why are more German firms moving from China to Japan?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/german-firms-moving-china-japan-9252780/</link>
			<description>The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan, along with KPMG in Germany, conducted a survey revealing that 38% of German companies are moving production facilities from China to Japan, with 23% also relocating regional management functions. This shift is primarily motivated by economic, political, and social stability concerns. Factors such as rising costs in China, geopolitical tensions, and uncertainty about future trade relations with the US are prompting these changes. Japan is seen as a stable choice, offering a qualified workforce, advanced infrastructure, and legal protection of intellectual property. Additionally, lower wages compared to Germany and a more appealing living environment contribute to Japan's attractiveness for businesses. These findings highlight the growing trend of German companies favoring Japan as a destination for their operations.</description>

			<description>The Income-tax Department opened return filing utilities on its portal from April 1, 2024, marking the beginning of Assessment Year 2024-25. Around 23,000 taxpayers filed their income tax returns within the first three days. This early availability contrasts with the previous year when filing functionalities were delayed until May. The Department has operationalized filing functionalities for commonly used segments like ITR-1, ITR-2, and ITR-4, with ITR-6 for companies also available from April 1. However, some experts advise waiting for the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and Form 26AS, typically updated by the end of the financial year, to ensure accurate filings. These documents contain crucial details regarding TDS/TCS, interest, dividend, and other financial transactions. The delay in updating these documents is due to processes involving reporting entities like banks and financial institutions. The Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education also announced the results for the first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE) today, with over 10 lakh students appearing for the exams held from March 1 to April 20.</description>

			<title>Why RBI has kept policy rates unchanged</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-policy-rates-unchanged-9252604/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) recently convened and decided to maintain the repo rate at 6.5%, with a policy stance of 'withdrawal of accommodation'. This decision, reached with a 5:1 majority, reflects confidence in the economy's overall outlook, despite challenges in certain sectors. The RBI projects GDP growth at 7% and retail inflation at 4.5% for fiscal 2024-25. While inflation has moderated broadly, elevated food inflation persists, although core inflation remains benign. The RBI aims to anchor inflation to the target sustainably. It anticipates headline inflation to ease in the coming months due to favorable factors like harvests and expectations of a normal monsoon. The RBI will likely maintain a cautious approach, prioritizing inflation alignment while supporting growth. GDP growth for FY25 is forecasted at 7%, with geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions posing risks. Despite challenges, the economy shows resilience, supported by robust manufacturing and steady investment. Inflation is projected at 4.5% for FY25, with concerns over climate-related risks and potential price pressures in nonperishable food categories. Supply-side interventions have helped temper prices, particularly in cereals. Global commodity price upticks and pressures on deposit growth may influence lending and deposit rates, with external benchmark lending rates expected to remain stable. Overall, the RBI's stance reflects a balanced approach to managing inflation and supporting economic growth.</description>

			<title>Before SC’s 9-judge bench, question of whether states can levy excise duty on industrial alcohol</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/before-sc-can-states-levy-excise-duty-on-industrial-alcohol-9252199/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is currently deliberating on whether states have the authority to regulate and tax industrial alcohol. The case involves a complex interplay between state and central powers, with arguments focusing on constitutional provisions and past judicial decisions.

The central question revolves around whether states can control industrial alcohol, which is used in manufacturing processes and not for human consumption, or if this power rests exclusively with the central government.

Historical legal interpretations have played a significant role in shaping the arguments. For instance, a previous Supreme Court ruling in 1989 restricted states' authority to regulate only those alcoholic beverages intended for human consumption.

However, there are precedents, such as the Tika Ramji case in 1956, which suggest that states may have broader powers in certain industries under the Concurrent List.

Senior Advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, representing the State of Uttar Pradesh, contends that states should retain authority over industrial alcohol unless the central government explicitly asserts control through relevant legislation.

The outcome of this case could have significant implications for both state revenues and the regulatory framework governing industrial alcohol.

The next hearing is scheduled for April 9. In unrelated news, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will release the results of the Intermediate exams on April 12, accessible through the official website using roll number and date of birth.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the recent controversy stirred by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's amplification of an RTI reply regarding the Katchatheevu issue, accusing the former government of "callously giving away" the island to Sri Lanka. While External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar reiterated the government's stance on the issue, he did not suggest reopening the 1974 bilateral pact on Katchatheevu, citing that it's "sub judice." The BJP's actions are seen as a political move in Tamil Nadu, but they have raised concerns both in India and Sri Lanka, especially regarding India's international credibility and diplomatic image. The article emphasizes the importance of upholding agreements and warns against unilateral actions that could harm India's reputation and relations with neighboring countries. Sri Lanka has responded maturely to the statements, emphasizing that the issue was settled long ago. The article concludes by urging caution against actions that could be exploited by external powers and damage India's diplomatic standing.</description>

			<title>Why Tamil Nadu is claiming disaster relief funds from the Centre</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/tamil-nadu-karnataka-disaster-relief-funds-centre-9251548/</link>
			<description>Tamil Nadu has filed a suit at the Supreme Court, alleging that the Centre is withholding national disaster relief funds following Cyclone Michaung and subsequent floods in December 2023. Similarly, Karnataka has also filed a plea claiming denial of disaster relief funds for drought-affected areas. Both states seek additional funds from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), arguing that the Centre's inaction violates the Disaster Management Act of 2005.

The NDRF, established after the 2004 tsunami, provides funds for calamities such as cyclones, droughts, and floods. States facing calamities beyond their coping capacity can request funds from the NDRF. The process involves assessments by Inter Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) and committees, culminating in a decision by a high-level committee chaired by the Home Minister.

Tamil Nadu seeks Rs 37,902 crores for Cyclone Michaung damage and Rs 2,000 crore for relief operations. Karnataka seeks Rs 18,171 crores for drought relief. Both states allege delays in fund release violate citizens' rights to equality and dignity. The legal battle follows similar disputes between opposition-ruled states and the Centre, including Kerala's recent claim regarding bill assents and borrowing powers.</description>

			<title>Why has Israel killed Iranian generals in Syria and who are the Quds Force?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/quds-force-israel-killed-iranian-generals-syria-attack-9250654/</link>
			<description>Israeli warplanes conducted an airstrike on an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria, resulting in at least 13 deaths, including General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior leader of the Iranian Quds Force. Israel confirmed its involvement in the strike but denied that the building had diplomatic status. Iran has vowed revenge, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stating they will make Israel regret the attack. The Quds Force is the paramilitary and intelligence wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG), established in 1979 after the Islamic Revolution. The IRCG operates alongside Iran's regular armed forces and is known for its military actions, espionage, and cybersecurity attacks. Tensions between Iran and Israel stem from geopolitical rivalries, with Iran viewing Israel's alliance with the US as a threat to its security and interests. The Quds Force supports militant groups like Hezbollah and has been active in Syria's civil war, aiding the Syrian government and opposing US interests. General Zahedi, killed in the strike, was a close associate of Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated by the US in 2020. The strike raises concerns about escalating violence in the region, as both sides have engaged in proxy conflicts and covert operations against each other.</description>

			<title>Why Uttarakhand govt wants to evaluate the risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/risk-from-glacial-lake-floods-9249967/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand government has formed expert teams to assess the risk posed by five glacial lakes prone to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the region. These events have caused disasters in recent years, necessitating efforts to minimize their occurrence. The National Disaster Management Authority has identified 13 such lakes in Uttarakhand out of 188 in the Himalayan states. GLOFs occur due to sudden water discharge from glacial lakes, often triggered by factors like glacial calving or landslides. Studies show rising global temperatures increase the risk of GLOFs, threatening millions of people and infrastructure. Uttarakhand has experienced major GLOF incidents, prompting the categorization of sensitive lakes into risk levels. The state's increasing temperatures further exacerbate the risk.</description>

			<title>Massive earthquake hits Taiwan: What is the Ring of Fire?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/earthquake-taiwan-ring-of-fire-9249383/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent earthquake in Taiwan, the largest in at least 25 years, which resulted in nine deaths and over 1,000 injuries. Taiwan sits along the Pacific "Ring of Fire," known for frequent seismic activity due to tectonic plate interactions. The Ring of Fire encompasses numerous tectonic plates, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Taiwan specifically experiences earthquakes from the Philippine Sea Plate interacting with the Eurasian Plate. The article also explains how volcanoes form in the Ring of Fire through subduction, where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. This geological phenomenon results in the high concentration of earthquakes and volcanoes in the region.</description>

			<title>Why Vistara pilots are unhappy before the Air India merger</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/vistara-flight-disruptions-9248889/</link>
			<description>Vistara, a Tata group-owned airline, has experienced over 150 flight cancellations and numerous delays due to pilots going on mass sick leave, resulting from dissatisfaction with a new compensation structure. This structure reduces guaranteed pay for pilots, leading to fears of lower salaries. The situation worsened after an ultimatum from management, causing more pilots to call in sick. Additionally, concerns about career progression and rostering practices have contributed to the unrest. Vistara's CEO held a meeting with pilots, promising improvements in rostering and addressing merger concerns. Flight disruptions are expected to ease soon. The incident highlights potential challenges for the Tata group as it merges airlines, including people integration and HR issues. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce intermediate exam results today, affecting over 10 lakh students.</description>

			<title>Katchatheevu and Wadge Bank: The story of two India-Sri Lanka agreements from a half century ago</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/katchatheevu-and-wadge-bank-the-story-of-two-india-sri-lanka-agreements-from-a-half-century-ago-9247710/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the resurgence of the Katchatheevu issue by the BJP in Tamil Nadu ahead of the Lok Sabha election. The Katchatheevu island, located between India and Sri Lanka, has been a point of contention since the 1970s. In 1974, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India signed an agreement ceding the island to Sri Lanka but allowing Indian fishermen access for certain purposes. The article explores the historical background of the dispute, including the ownership claims by both countries and subsequent agreements.

It also highlights political maneuvering around the issue, including the role of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi and current Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in attempting to address the matter. Despite demands from various political parties in Tamil Nadu to retrieve Katchatheevu, Sri Lanka has refused to link its status to the fishing rights issue.

The BJP has criticized the Congress and DMK for allegedly surrendering the island to Sri Lanka, but concrete steps towards reclaiming it have not been taken. The matter remains pending in the Supreme Court, with the Indian government citing it as sub judice. Sri Lankan officials have stated that there has been no official communication from India regarding the issue.</description>

			<title>Why the Supreme Court gave bail to AAP’s Sanjay Singh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-the-supreme-court-gave-bail-to-aaps-sanjay-singh-9247688/</link>
			<description>AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh was granted bail by the Supreme Court after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) didn't argue its case on merits. Singh was arrested in October 2023 on money laundering charges related to the alleged Delhi excise scam. While Singh isn't accused of corruption, the ED accused him of laundering proceeds from the scam. The case largely relies on statements from businessman Dinesh Arora, who allegedly implicated Singh. Singh's lawyer argued that Arora's statements lacked consistency and evidence. The ED didn't oppose bail, opting for a concession instead of arguing on merits.</description>

			<title>What is Kallakkadal, which has flooded houses in Kerala’s coastal areas?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-kallakkadal-which-has-flooded-houses-in-keralas-coastal-areas-9247767/</link>
			<description>High sea waves, known as swell waves, have flooded hundreds of houses in coastal areas of Kerala, particularly in Alappuzha, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram districts since March 31. Relief camps have been set up for affected communities. This phenomenon, called Kallakkadal in Malayalam, is coastal flooding during the pre-monsoon season caused by swell waves on the southwest coast of India. Unlike tsunamis, which result from underwater disturbances like earthquakes, swell surges are formed by distant storms generating high waves that travel thousands of kilometers. The recent flooding was triggered by a low atmospheric pressure system in the South Atlantic Ocean. Kallakkadal often lacks precursors or local wind activity, making advance warning challenging, although systems like the Swell Surge Forecast System provide some early alerts. Despite being mistaken for tsunamis, Kallakkadal is distinct and is expected to impact Kerala and other western coast regions for the next few days. INCOIS has issued alerts for coastal areas prone to sea erosion to take precautionary measures.</description>

			<title>Turkey’s opposition scores ‘historic victory’ against President Erdogan’s party in local elections: What happened?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/turkey-opposition-victory-erdogan-elections-9247193/</link>
			<description>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) suffered a significant defeat in nationwide local elections, marking its largest electoral setback since Erdogan came to power. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) won municipalities in 36 of Turkey’s 81 provinces, including the five largest cities: Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Antalya. These elections were widely viewed as a referendum on Erdogan and his party, with the AK Party losing the popular vote for the first time. 

The AK Party's defeat was largely attributed to Turkey's struggling economy, marked by high inflation rates that have led to a cost of living crisis for many citizens. The opposition's victory is expected to bolster their morale and strengthen their position as they were previously divided after their defeat in the 2023 presidential and parliamentary elections. 

The decisive win of Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul solidifies his role as a prominent opposition figure and potential future presidential contender. This defeat could also signal a turning point in Erdogan's political career, potentially thwarting his plans to extend his rule beyond 2028.</description>

			<title>Sanjay Singh gets bail: What are the ED’s allegations against the senior AAP leader and MP?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sanjay-singh-bail-ed-allegations-aap-delhi-excise-9247016/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Sanjay Singh, a senior AAP leader, in a case related to the alleged Delhi excise scam. This decision came after the Enforcement Directorate did not oppose it. Singh was arrested in October 2023 and accused of being a "key conspirator" in the scam, where private entities allegedly received wholesale liquor business in exchange for kickbacks. The ED claimed the scam's proceeds amounted to over Rs 292 crore, some of which allegedly funded AAP's election campaign in Goa. Singh's alleged involvement included forming a special purpose vehicle to launder money generated from the scam. Previously, lower courts had denied Singh bail, stating there was prima facie evidence of his involvement in money laundering.</description>

			<title>Amidst Lok Sabha elections, why fake news, disinformation and fact-checking matter</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/lok-sabha-polls-fake-news-fact-checking-9246488/</link>
			<description>April 2 is International Fact-checking Day, established by the International Fact-checking Network in 2016 to recognize the importance of accurate information. In the midst of elections in India, various threats like misinformation, generative AI images, and deepfakes are prevalent. Fact-checking has never been more crucial, but what exactly is it? Fake news, defined as fabricated stories lacking verifiable facts, sources, or quotes, has a long history, notably with "yellow journalism" in the US in the 1890s. Although Donald Trump popularized the term "fake news," its documented use dates back to the 1890s. Misinformation is false information shared unknowingly, while disinformation is knowingly spread falsehoods. Fact-checking involves verifying facts, essential to combatting false and misleading information. With the democratization of mass communication tools, misinformation thrives, particularly in regional languages in India. Here are some tips to safeguard against fake news: check the source, verify news stories on credible outlets, verify images, and rely on fact-checking websites.</description>

			<title>Why Supreme Court barred unregulated soil extraction for linear projects</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-supreme-court-barred-unregulated-soil-extraction-for-linear-projects-9245830/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently overturned a 2020 notification from the Environment Ministry exempting extraction of ordinary earth for linear projects, like road and railway construction, from needing Environmental Clearance. The exemption was challenged for being arbitrary and bypassing legal procedures. The NGT instructed the Ministry to review the exemption, but it was only acted upon after the matter reached the Supreme Court. The Court found the exemption to be arbitrary and lacking in necessary safeguards. This isn't the first time such exemptions have faced legal scrutiny. Similar instances in the past have led to judicial intervention. In other news, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce the results of the first and second year intermediate public exams today.</description>

			<title>Utkala Dibasa or Odisha Day: Story of the state’s formation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/utkala-dibasa-odisha-day-state-formation-9245492/</link>
			<description>April 1 is celebrated as Odisha Day, marking the formation of the state of Odisha in 1936. It was carved out from Bihar and Orissa Province, with the addition of Koraput and Ganjam districts from the Madras Presidency. Odisha is one of the two Indian states with a formation date predating Independence, the other being Bihar, and it was the first state to be consciously created on linguistic basis.

The region now known as Odisha has a history dating back 3,000 years, with various local dynasties ruling over it. In 1568, it lost its independence to the Bengal Sultanate, later coming under Maratha and British rule. Despite movements for linguistic states emerging in the late 19th century, it remained part of the Bengal Presidency until 1936.

The movement for Odisha's creation gained momentum in the late 19th century, focusing on cultural revival and harking back to its ancient past. The Utkal Sabha, formed in 1882, and the Utkal Sammilani, formed in 1903 under Madhusudan Das's leadership, played significant roles. With the Indian National Congress adopting linguistic reorganization of provinces as a key agenda, Odisha Province was created in 1936 after extensive inquiries by three committees.

The new province was carved from Bihar and Orissa Province, Madras Province, and Central Provinces. However, 26 princely states within the Eastern States Agency remained until Independence. Today, Odisha celebrates its history and cultural heritage on April 1.</description>

			<title>What is ‘Havana syndrome’, linked to a Russian intelligence unit?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/havana-syndrome-russian-intelligence-unit-9245485/</link>
			<description>The Kremlin has dismissed a joint media investigation suggesting Russian military intelligence might be behind the 'Havana syndrome', a mysterious health condition affecting US diplomats and spies worldwide. The investigation implicates a Russian unit in using "directed energy" weapons to target US officials' brains. The syndrome, characterized by symptoms like hearing sounds, nausea, and memory loss, originated in Cuba in 2016, spreading to other countries including China and India. While initially suspected to be a "sonic attack," further research suggests high-powered microwaves may be involved, possibly causing permanent brain damage. The syndrome's occurrence in India has been limited, with suspicion of foreign involvement.</description>

			<title>On road to Viksit Bharat, India should target per capita, not aggregate, GDP. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/viksit-bharat-india-gdp-per-capita-china-comparison-economy-growth-9245440/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the economic growth trajectories of China and India since 1990. At the start of the period, China's per capita GDP was lower than India's, but over the next few decades, China experienced rapid growth, becoming the world's second-largest economy by 2010. In contrast, India's growth was slower, and while its nominal GDP increased, its relative position in the global economy improved only marginally.

The article emphasizes the importance of per capita GDP alongside aggregate GDP, particularly for countries like India with large populations. It discusses the significance of sustained economic growth rates over time and highlights China's remarkable transformation, both in terms of aggregate and per capita GDP.

India aims to achieve developed status by 2047, and improving per capita GDP is crucial for this goal. While India is currently classified as a lower-middle-income country and China as an upper-middle-income country, both nations aspire to reach higher income brackets in the future.

Overall, the article underscores the importance of sustained economic growth, particularly in terms of per capita income, for achieving developmental goals and enhancing global stature.</description>

			<title>What is the ‘Click here’ trend on X, and why has it been criticised?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/click-here-trend-meme-alt-text-criticism-9243358/</link>
			<description>The "Click here" trend on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) has gained traction among major accounts like BJP, Congress, AAP, Barcelona, and PSG. It involves posting rectangular photos with white backgrounds and black text saying "Click here," accompanied by an ALT box that opens to display additional text when clicked. This trend has been used for jokes, marketing, and spreading slogans.

X promotes this as a way to improve accessibility for visually impaired users, as screen readers can read the alt text accompanying images. Alt text also aids in SEO by helping Google understand webpage content. However, some have criticized the trend for misusing accessibility features, such as when major brands like McDonald’s and Red Bull used it for memes instead of its intended purpose.

Critics argue that using alt text for jokes or unrelated information undermines its accessibility purpose. This controversy highlights the importance of content creators understanding and using alt text appropriately. Studies have shown a significant lack of alt text usage across websites and social media, indicating a need for better awareness and implementation of accessibility features.</description>

			<title>Did Congress ‘give away’ Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/katchatheevu-island-modi-nehru-congress-dmk-9242985/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently criticized the Congress for its decision to relinquish the island of Katchatheevu, calling it "eye-opening and startling." This criticism stems from documents suggesting that the Congress, under Indira Gandhi's leadership, did not prioritize the island's importance and even considered giving up claims to it. Katchatheevu, a small uninhabited island between India and Sri Lanka, holds significant political resonance in Tamil Nadu, where it is a hot-button issue. 

Historically, Katchatheevu was controlled by various entities, including the Jaffna kingdom of Sri Lanka and the Ramnad zamindari of India. However, in 1974, as part of the Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime agreement, Indira Gandhi ceded Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka, believing it held little strategic value and to strengthen ties with Sri Lanka. This decision sparked protests, particularly in Tamil Nadu, where concerns about fishing rights and livelihoods persist.

Since then, there have been ongoing demands, particularly from Tamil Nadu politicians, to retrieve Katchatheevu. Efforts have included legal petitions and appeals to the central government. However, the Union government's stance remains largely unchanged, asserting that no Indian territory was ceded, and sovereignty was not relinquished. The issue continues to be contentious, with little action taken by the government due to the complexities involved, as stated by the former Attorney General.

In Tamil Nadu, this issue remains politically charged, with leaders like MK Stalin of the DMK urging Prime Minister Modi to address the matter. However, concrete steps towards reclaiming Katchatheevu have yet to be taken.</description>

			<title>Crashes, blowout, leadership shake-up: What explains the Boeing MAX’s issues?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/boeing-crashes-blowout-leadership-resign-safety-troubles-9242971/</link>
			<description>Boeing is facing significant challenges with its 737 MAX aircraft, leading to a top-tier management shake-up. CEO David Calhoun will step down at the end of the year, while Stan Deal, head of commercial airplanes, has been replaced by Stephanie Pope. The company's chairman will also be replaced. These changes come after a series of safety concerns, including a recent midair door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9.

The incident, which caused an emergency landing, highlighted ongoing issues with the aircraft's safety. Critics argue that Boeing's focus on profits over quality may be at the root of these problems. The company's philosophy shifted after its merger with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, prioritizing cost optimization and efficiency. Boeing has also faced challenges with the quality of parts, including those manufactured by suppliers like Spirit AeroSystems.

Despite these challenges, Indian carriers have ordered a significant number of 737 MAX aircraft. The Indian aviation regulator is closely monitoring the situation, conducting inspections and staying in touch with Boeing and airlines operating the aircraft.

In other news, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce the results of the Intermediate exams on April 12, accessible through the official website using roll number and date of birth. Last year, the pass percentages were 61% for first year and 72% for second year.</description>

			<title>Remembering Vaikom satyagraha, a 100 years later</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/remembering-vaikom-satyagraha-a-100-years-later-9241758/</link>
			<description>The article recounts the Vaikom Satyagraha, a significant non-violent protest that began on March 30, 1924, in the temple town of Vaikom, Travancore. This movement was part of a larger struggle against caste discrimination and for temple entry rights for lower castes, employing Gandhian methods of civil disobedience.

In the early 20th century, despite educational advancements among lower castes like the Ezhavas, societal and ritual discrimination persisted, with upper castes dominating government jobs. The agitation for temple entry was initiated by Ezhava leader T.K. Madhavan in 1917, gaining momentum with the involvement of the Indian National Congress and Mahatma Gandhi's support.

The satyagraha focused on gaining access to roads around the Vaikom temple rather than the temple itself. Despite arrests and counter-agitations, the protesters remained steadfast. The death of the Maharaja of Travancore in 1924 and subsequent negotiations led by Gandhi resulted in a compromise in 1925, opening three of the four roads to all castes.

The movement, which lasted over 600 days, demonstrated unity across caste lines and highlighted the issue of untouchability in India. Although the final compromise was seen as inadequate by some, including Periyar, the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation by the Maharaja of Travancore was a landmark victory, abolishing the ban on temple entry for marginalized castes.

The article also mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce Intermediate exam results on April 12, 2024, with the exams having taken place from March 1 to April 20, 2024. Last year's pass percentages were 61% for the first year and 72% for the second year, with girls outperforming boys. The results will be available on the official website.

This summary captures the essence of the article, highlighting the historical context, key events, and outcomes of the Vaikom Satyagraha, as well as providing a brief update on an unrelated educational announcement.</description>

			<title>Jacob Zuma banned from running in South Africa elections: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/jacob-zuma-banned-south-africa-elections-9241472/</link>
			<description>South Africa's Election Commission has disqualified former President Jacob Zuma from running in the country's upcoming elections in May due to his 2021 conviction and imprisonment for over a year, which under the constitution bars him from holding public office. Zuma, who has until April 2 to appeal the decision, leads the new uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which is showing potential to challenge the African National Congress's (ANC) dominance in polls. Despite the disqualification, Zuma is expected to continue his campaign against the ANC. His political career includes serving as president from 2009 to 2018, and his tenure was marked by controversies including corruption allegations and a significant relationship with the Gupta family, leading to accusations of state capture. Zuma resigned in 2017 amidst political pressure and was later imprisoned in 2021 for refusing to appear at a corruption inquiry, although he was released on medical parole after a few months.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: Why US allowed UNSC resolution on Gaza ceasefire to pass</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-expert-explains-why-us-allowed-unsc-resolution-on-gaza-ceasefire-to-pass-9240986/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant development in the UN Security Council (UNSC), where the US abstained from vetoing a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and the release of all hostages. This move is notable because historically, the US has used its veto power to support Israel. The abstention reflects a shift in US domestic politics, where there is a growing division over the country's stance on Israel, particularly in light of the upcoming presidential election. President Biden's administration is considering the Arab and Muslim vote, as well as the left wing of the Democratic party, which have been critical of Israel's actions.

The abstention also signals a change in the US's approach to Israel at the international level. Despite the US's long-standing support for Israel, there have been instances, such as during the Obama administration, where the US has distanced itself from Israeli policies. The UNSC resolution, while prescriptive, faces limitations in enforcement if the targeted country does not comply, as is the case with Israel.

The article also touches on the broader US-Israel relationship, suggesting that despite the current political messaging, the fundamental partnership between the two countries, including aid and defense cooperation, is unlikely to deteriorate. The US's commitment to Israel remains strong, exemplified by a 10-year, $38 billion aid program and joint projects like the Iron Dome.

The situation is further complicated by the internal politics of both countries, with the US Republicans seeking to capitalize on the situation and the Democrats distancing themselves from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu while maintaining support for Israel itself.

In summary, the US's abstention in the UNSC is a significant political message that reflects changing dynamics within US domestic politics and its international relations with Israel. However, it is not expected to fundamentally alter the longstanding US-Israel alliance or resolve the ongoing conflict. The article concludes with insights from Arun K Singh, a former Indian Ambassador to Washington DC and Tel Aviv.</description>

			<title>Why Good Friday is observed, and why its date changes every year</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/good-friday-jesus-christ-significance-origin-9240703/</link>
			<description>Good Friday is a significant day for Christians, marking Jesus Christ's crucifixion. Despite its somber origins, it's called "Good" because it represents the day Jesus made a sacrifice for humanity's sins. The term "Good" historically signifies a day of religious observance. The date of Good Friday varies annually, aligning with the first Sunday after the full Moon following the spring equinox. This variability is due to the method used to calculate Easter, which is independent of the Earth's actual motion around the Sun and time zones. Different Christian denominations may observe Easter on varying dates, with the Eastern Orthodox Church typically celebrating it later due to the Julian calendar. Good Friday is observed with various traditions worldwide, including re-enactments and church services, to honor Jesus's sacrifice and teachings. The Holy Week leading to Easter also includes Palm Sunday, commemorating Jesus's entry into Jerusalem.</description>

			<title>With less than 150 Great Indian Bustards remaining in the wild, what’s driving their extinction?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/great-indian-bustard-threats-conservation-power-9240502/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has decided to revisit its April 2021 directive that mandated burying all power lines in habitats of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB), a critically endangered bird, due to the central government's argument that the order is "practically impossible to implement" over extensive distances. The court has set up a seven-member committee to suggest measures to conserve the GIB and determine crucial areas where power lines might need to be buried.

The GIB, with fewer than 150 remaining in the wild, faces severe threats from power lines that criss-cross its habitats in the Kutch and Thar deserts. These regions are also key to India's renewable energy expansion due to their solar and wind energy potential. In 2020, a Wildlife Institute of India study estimated that power lines in the area kill about 84,000 birds annually, with the GIB being particularly vulnerable due to its size and frontal vision limitations.

Initially, the Supreme Court ordered that power lines in critical GIB habitats be buried to mitigate this threat, disregarding the associated costs. However, the central government has since raised concerns about the feasibility of this approach, citing high costs, technical challenges, and safety issues. They argued that underground cables are impractical for long-distance high-voltage power transmission and emphasized the importance of these areas for renewable energy, vital for meeting India's energy demands and international climate commitments.

In light of these challenges, the Supreme Court has indicated it may narrow the scope of its order from covering 88,636 sq km to prioritizing 13,696 sq km of the most critical habitat areas for the GIB in Rajasthan and Gujarat. The expert committee is expected to submit its recommendations by July 31. This case highlights the complex balance between developmental goals and wildlife conservation.</description>

			<title>What explains the frequent disagreements between state governments and Governors?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/state-government-governors-powers-disagreements-9240141/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing conflict between the Kerala state government and the Governor, reflecting a broader issue of friction between state governments and Governors across India. Here's a summary:

- **Kerala's Conflict**: The Kerala government has approached the Supreme Court, challenging the withholding of assent to several Bills by the President and the Governor. The state alleges that the Governor referred seven Bills to the President without any stated reason, some pending for up to two years. The Left Democratic Front-led government contends that this act is unconstitutional and lacks good faith.

- **Governor's Role**: The Governor, though intended to be an apolitical figure acting on the council of ministers' advice, holds constitutional powers like assenting to state Bills and determining majority deadlines. However, there's no clear protocol for public engagement between the Governor and the state when opinions differ, traditionally managed by mutual respect.

- **Historical Friction**: Instances of conflict have included decisions on government formation, majority deadlines, Bill approvals, and public criticism of state administrations. Notable events include the dissolution of the J&amp;K Assembly in 2018, the short-lived Maharashtra government in 2019, and various comments and actions by Governors in West Bengal, Nagaland, and Kerala.

- **Allegations of Central Influence**: Since the 1950s, there have been accusations that the Centre uses the Governor's position to destabilize state governments. Dismissals of state governments have occurred frequently, especially between 1971 and 1990, but have decreased with the rise of coalition governments and regional parties.

- **Experts' Views**: Constitutional experts argue that Governors have become political appointees, leading to a fundamental flaw in the Constitution. The Governor is answerable only to the Centre, not the people, which creates a conflict of interest.

- **Lack of Reforms**: Despite various commissions recommending reforms to the Governor's selection and tenure, including impeachment provisions, no government has implemented these suggestions.

- **Unrelated Case**: The article also mentions the arrest of Ajit P Menon, a close aide of the Cox and Kings owner, in connection with a Rs 400 crore Yes Bank fraud case.

This summary captures the essence of the article, highlighting the tension between state governments and the role of Governors in India's political landscape. If you need more details on any specific part, feel free to ask!</description>

			<title>Museum files lawsuits to ‘protect’ dignity of Michelangelo’s David: A look at Italy’s cultural heritage code</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/lawsuits-michelangelo-david-italy-cultural-heritage-code-9240185/</link>
			<description>Michelangelo's David, completed in 1504 and housed at the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, is a seminal piece of Italian Renaissance art. Recently, concerns have emerged about the statue's religious and political significance being undermined by the proliferation of souvenirs in Florence that inappropriately focus on David's genitalia. In response, Cecilie Hollberg, the gallery's director, has initiated legal actions under Italy's cultural heritage code, which protects national treasures from disparaging and unauthorized commercial use. This code allows cultural institutions to demand a concession fee for reproductions and ensures that uses align with the artwork's cultural purposes.

Recent legal precedents include a 2023 ruling against GQ Italia for an unauthorized magazine cover featuring David, and a 2022 decision that prohibited a German company from selling a puzzle of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man. These cases illustrate a shift towards enforcing longer-term protections for artworks beyond the typical copyright terms specified by the Berne Convention, which protects artworks for the artist’s lifetime plus 70 years. Once copyright expires, artworks usually enter the public domain, although Italy's approach under its cultural heritage code might challenge this standard, as it extends protections indefinitely. This ongoing legal framework development is testing the balance between public domain rights and cultural preservation.</description>

			<title>PM Modi speaks of returning Rs 3,000 crore attached by ED to West Bengal’s poor: How ED attaches cash</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-ed-west-bengal-cash-attach-procedure-9240001/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considering legal avenues to return approximately Rs 3,000 crore seized by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in West Bengal to the state's impoverished citizens. This statement was made during a conversation with Amrita Roy, a BJP candidate, and was later criticized by the TMC for allegedly breaching the Model Code of Conduct.

The article explains how the ED handles seized assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED conducts searches with a warrant, seizing assets with independent witnesses present. Previously, seized cash was held in fixed deposit accounts until case resolution, with the funds being returned with interest if the accused was acquitted, or deposited into the government treasury upon conviction. Valuables like gold were stored in lockers.

In 2018, the process was streamlined, and now seized funds are deposited directly into the treasury via personal deposit accounts, without accruing interest. The attachment aims to prevent the accused from benefiting from the assets until the trial concludes.

The ED has 180 days post-attachment to secure confirmation from the Adjudicating Authority. Confirmed attachments allow the ED to take possession, even issuing eviction notices for immovable property. However, these orders can be contested in the PMLA Appellate Tribunal and higher courts.

The article also details how the ED manages properties of no immediate use, such as appointing a custodian or auctioning post-trial. It outlines the ED's rights to claim profits from businesses and rent from residences attached during trials. Changes to the handling of attached vehicles are also mentioned, allowing the accused to use them while paying rent set by the transport department.

Lastly, the article briefly touches on a viral video of cricketer Virat Kohli patting Rohit Sharma during a match, unrelated to the main content.

			<title>Kerala govt goes to SC over Governor withholding assent to Bills: The issues and the law</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/governors-assent-to-state-laws-9239214/</link>
			<description>The Kerala government has approached the Supreme Court challenging the actions of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and President Droupadi Murmu regarding the withholding of assent to several state bills. The Governor withheld assent to seven bills, some for up to two years, and referred them to the President, who withheld assent to four bills without providing reasons. Kerala argues that this practice is unconstitutional and lacks good faith, asserting that it subverts the functioning of the state legislature and undermines its legislative authority as outlined in Articles 200 and 201 of the Indian Constitution.

Article 200 allows the Governor three options after a bill is passed by the state legislature: assent, withhold assent, or reserve it for the President's consideration. There is no specified timeline for these actions, which has led to prolonged periods of inaction. The President, under Article 201, can withhold assent but must return the bill with recommended amendments for reconsideration by the state legislature.

This legal struggle highlights the ongoing conflict between state governments led by opposition parties and Governors appointed by the central government. Similar issues have arisen in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Punjab, with state governments challenging the Governors' refusals to assent to legislation, suggesting a pattern of political rivalry and interference that potentially disrupts state governance.

The Supreme Court previously indicated that the term "as soon as possible" implies a constitutional obligation for timely decisions on bills, yet it has not set a definitive timeline. This issue remains central to the Kerala government's petition, as it seeks a resolution to ensure that state legislatures can function effectively without undue delay or obstruction from the Governor or the President.</description>

			<title>Why thousands of doctors are protesting in South Korea</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/doctors-south-korea-protests-reason-9238739/</link>
			<description>In South Korea, thousands of junior doctors have been on strike for approximately six weeks, protesting a government proposal to significantly increase medical school admissions and the number of physicians. This action has led to disruptions in hospital operations nationwide, with cancellations of surgical procedures and emergency rooms turning away patients.

The junior doctors are protesting poor working conditions and inadequate pay, insisting these issues be resolved before increasing the physician count. They argue that the plan to increase the number of junior doctors, rather than hiring more senior staff, will exacerbate the problem due to their longer working hours and lower labor costs. Reports suggest that junior doctors typically work 80 to 100 hours per week.

The government contends that more doctors are needed to address healthcare demands, particularly in rural areas, and to avoid an expected shortage of 15,000 doctors by 2035. Following the protests, the government initially took a firm stance, issuing back-to-work orders and threatening prosecution for non-compliance. However, they have recently expressed willingness to dialogue and consider suggestions to improve the plan.

Senior doctors at major hospitals have now joined the protest, further pressuring the government by submitting their resignations, although they continue to work. They demand that the government first abandon the plan to increase medical school admissions before any negotiations can proceed.

The medical community in South Korea, which is considered among the best in the world, generally believes that the number of doctors is sufficient and argues that the government’s proposed figures for increased admissions are arbitrary and lack transparency. They emphasize that without addressing the issues of pay and overwork among junior doctors, the plan to increase the number of physicians will not be effective in improving the healthcare system.</description>

			<title>Explained: The push for nuclear energy as climate solution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/nuclear-energy-climate-solution-problems-india-9237794/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant Nuclear Energy Summit held in Brussels, attended by representatives from 30 countries. The summit, organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), aimed to promote nuclear energy as a key component in addressing climate change and enhancing energy security, despite lingering concerns from incidents like Fukushima and the ongoing crisis at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant.

The IAEA has been actively promoting nuclear power through initiatives like 'Atoms4Climate' and engaging with climate conferences (COPs) to integrate nuclear solutions into global climate strategies. Despite its benefits of low emissions and constant availability for electricity generation, nuclear energy faces challenges such as high costs, lengthy construction times, and stringent regulations, which have hindered its rapid adoption compared to renewable sources like solar and wind.

Globally, the number of nuclear reactors has slightly decreased over the past two decades, and nuclear energy's share in global electricity production has been declining. However, recent climate goals have reignited interest in expanding nuclear capacity, with ambitious targets like tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 discussed at recent COP meetings.

India, with its modest but growing nuclear capacity, is planning significant expansions, though it has not committed to the tripling target. Key figures in India's nuclear sector argue for a more aggressive expansion to meet increasing clean energy demands.

Overall, while nuclear energy is recognized as a clean and reliable energy source, its growth is impeded by technological and financial challenges, demanding greater innovation and investment to realize its potential in the global energy mix.</description>

			<title>How the H5N1 bird flu threatens the very existence of birds and mammals</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/h5n1-bird-flu-mammals-9236846/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the global spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu since 2020, affecting birds in over 80 countries and leading to the culling of millions of poultry. The virus has expanded its reach to mammals, causing deaths among seals, sea lions, and even infiltrating Antarctica. Dr. Chris Walzer highlights the unprecedented scale of the outbreak, affecting hundreds of avian and mammalian species.

Bird flu, or avian flu, primarily infects poultry and wild birds, occasionally mutating into more lethal forms when it jumps from wild birds to poultry farms. The current H5N1 strain originated from a 1996 outbreak in China and has since evolved and spread globally, severely impacting wild birds and endangered species like the California condor.

The virus's spread to mammals is concerning, with infections reported in various land and marine mammals. Human infection is rare but possible through contact with infected birds. The underlying causes of the outbreak are not fully understood, but climate change and its effects on bird behavior and sea temperatures may contribute to the virus's spread. The article concludes with unrelated content regarding President Joe Biden's views on immigration and xenophobia.</description>

			<title>State of employment in India: What a new report says about youths and women, concerns and caution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/state-of-employment-in-india-what-a-new-report-says-about-youths-women-concerns-caution-9237158/</link>
			<description>The **India Employment Report 2024** highlights several key trends in the Indian labor market:

- **Labor Market Indicators**: There have been improvements in labor force participation rate, workforce participation rate, and unemployment rate after a long-term decline from 2000-2019. These improvements occurred during economic distress, including the Covid-19 pandemic.

- **Employment Conditions**: The report expresses concerns over poor employment conditions, such as the reversal of the transition to non-farm employment, an increase in self-employment and unpaid family work (particularly among women), lower quality of youth employment compared to adults, and stagnant or declining wages.

- **Employment Condition Index**: The index improved from 2004-05 to 2021-22, but disparities exist among states, with some consistently performing poorly and others well.

- **Informal Employment**: Informal employment has risen, with about half of the formal sector jobs being informal. Self-employment and unpaid family work have increased, especially for women, with 82% of the workforce in the informal sector and nearly 90% informally employed.

- **Self-Employment**: Remains the primary source of employment at 55.8% in 2022, with casual and regular employment at 22.7% and 21.5%, respectively. There was a shift from regular employment to self-employment from 2019 to 2022.

- **Gender Gap**: The female labor force participation rate is one of the world's lowest and has seen a significant decline from 2000 to 2019, followed by an increase from 2019 to 2022. However, it remains much lower than the global average.

- **Youth Employment**: There has been an increase in youth employment, but the quality is a concern. Unemployment among educated youths has intensified, with a higher rate among young women, especially graduates.

- **Non-Farm Employment**: The transition towards non-farm employment reversed after 2018-19, with an increase in agricultural employment.

The report suggests that while there are signs of improvement in some labor market indicators, significant challenges remain, particularly in terms of employment quality, gender disparities, and the informal sector's dominance.

Additionally, the article mentions **Aanchal Magazine**, a Senior Assistant Editor with The Indian Express, who specializes in macroeconomy and fiscal policy reporting.

			<title>An expert explains: What will it take to resume India-Pakistan trade?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-trade-explained-9237172/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complex relationship between India and Pakistan, particularly focusing on the potential resumption of trade. Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Muhammad Ishaq Dar, indicated a possible reconsideration of trade with India, which had ceased following constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The economic crisis in Pakistan and pressure from the business community due to high energy prices are influencing factors.

Trade indirectly occurs through third countries like Dubai, which is inefficient and costly. Despite the economic logic for direct trade, political challenges persist. Past attempts at trade, such as the short-lived decision to trade sugar and cotton in 2021, highlight the internal political struggle in Pakistan. The military's influence, especially the Army Chief's stance, remains a critical factor.

India's position is that trade cannot resume without Pakistan addressing terrorism. Historical context shows fluctuating trade relations, with significant military interventions from Pakistan. The article suggests that economic sense and regional stability may eventually lead to a softening of positions, but domestic politics in Pakistan and India's firm stance on Kashmir and terrorism make the path forward uncertain.

The article concludes that while economic partnership between the two nations is sensible, political inertia and strategic considerations dominate the discourse. Quiet diplomacy might offer a way forward, with the UAE playing a role in facilitating dialogue. The author, Dr. C Raja Mohan, emphasizes the need for both countries to be prepared to negotiate when the political climate allows. The article is by Dr. C Raja Mohan, an expert on international affairs, and was reported by Rishika Singh. The piece also briefly mentions other topics such as cultural affairs and honors awarded to military personnel.

			<title>Sanjiv Bhatt guilty in 1996 drug case: What happened</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sanjiv-bhatt-guilty-in-1996-drug-case-what-happened-9237103/</link>
			<description>Former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt has been found guilty in a 1996 narcotics case by a district court in Palanpur, Banaskantha. This follows a life sentence confirmed by the Gujarat High Court for Bhatt in a separate custodial torture case. The narcotics case dates back to Bhatt's tenure as SP of Banaskantha, where he allegedly instructed a police raid that led to the wrongful arrest of a lawyer, Sumer Singh Rajpurohit, with planted opium. Rajpurohit accused Bhatt of framing him due to a property dispute involving a former judge of the Gujarat High Court.

Despite evidence deficiencies acknowledged by police inspector Indravadan Vyas, leading to Rajpurohit's discharge, the case lingered with various investigations and court decisions over the years. In 2018, Bhatt was arrested following an SIT investigation, and charges were filed against him and Vyas under multiple sections of the IPC and NDPS Act. Vyas turned approver in 2021, while Bhatt's appeals and requests have been repeatedly rejected by the courts, including his claims of bias and unfair trial.

			<title>Why Supreme Court allowed Bloomberg’s article against ZEE to remain online</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-bloomberg-article-zee-slapp-9236658/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India recently overturned a lower court's order that had directed Bloomberg to remove an article about SEBI's investigation into Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The apex court criticized the trial court for mechanically applying the three-pronged test for injunctions without providing detailed reasons. The test, which assesses whether there's a prima facie case, potential irreparable loss, and balance of convenience, was deemed well-established but improperly applied.

The Supreme Court emphasized the need for courts to consider additional factors in defamation cases involving media, balancing free speech rights with reputation. They also addressed the issue of SLAPP suits, litigation used by powerful entities to silence media and public participation in important public matters. The court warned that pre-trial injunctions could act as a "death sentence" for journalistic material and could be misused to stifle free speech.

Highlighting international measures against SLAPP suits, the court noted the European Parliament's recent adoption of the 'Anti-SLAPP Directive' to protect journalists and media organizations from harassment litigation.

The article in question, published by Bloomberg, reported a significant accounting discrepancy at Zee Entertainment, which Zee claimed was defamatory and caused their stock price to drop. Zee had sought an injunction to remove the article, which was initially granted by the trial court and upheld by the Delhi High Court. However, the Supreme Court has now directed the trial judge to reconsider the order with their observations in mind. The unrelated content regarding Janata Dal (Secular) leader Prajwal Revanna's travel has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Why Robert F Kennedy Jr’s candidacy has Joe Biden sweating</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/robert-f-kennedy-rfk-jr-candidacy-9236572/</link>
			<description>Robert Francis Kennedy Jr., also known as RFK Jr, is running as an independent candidate in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. He has chosen Nicole Shanahan, a Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur, as his vice-presidential running mate. RFK Jr, a member of the prominent Kennedy political family, has a background as a lawyer, environmental activist, and anti-vaccine advocate. Despite his efforts, political analysts believe he is unlikely to win the presidency but could influence the outcome by drawing votes away from incumbent President Joe Biden. His campaign is attracting attention from voters who are dissatisfied with both President Biden and Donald Trump. RFK Jr's challenge will be to secure a place on the ballot in all 50 states, as the Democratic Party is taking legal steps to prevent this. Polls suggest a close race for the presidency, with former President Donald Trump potentially making a comeback. President Biden has emphasized the positive impact of immigrants on the U.S., contrasting his views with Trump's anti-immigrant stance.</description>

			<title>Travelling with cash during polls? Here are the EC rules to keep in mind</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/travelling-with-cash-during-polls-ec-rules-9236241/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the stringent measures taken by the Election Commission (EC) in India to prevent the misuse of money and other valuables to influence voters during elections. With the Model Code of Conduct in place, law enforcement agencies are vigilant about the movement of cash, liquor, jewelry, and other items that could be used for electoral bribery. The EC has set up static surveillance teams and flying squads equipped with videography to monitor and check the movement of such items. Cash or bullion over certain limits is subject to reporting and verification by the Income Tax Department, and if linked to a candidate or political party, may be seized. The EC has also established a district-level committee to address grievances and return seized items not linked to any crime or candidate. The article highlights the impact of these measures on ordinary citizens and the procedures in place for the return of seized items. The author, Damini Nath, is an Assistant Editor with The Indian Express, with a focus on housing, urban affairs, and the Election Commission.</description>

			<title>ICCC: Integrated farm data dashboard for customised solutions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/iccc-integrated-farm-data-dashboard-for-customised-solutions-9235150/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the inauguration of the **Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC)** by Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda at Krishi Bhavan in New Delhi. The ICCC is a technological hub that integrates various IT applications and platforms to aid in decision-making for agricultural practices. It employs advanced technologies like AI, remote sensing, and GIS to analyze data on weather conditions, crop yields, and production estimates, presenting them on large LED screens for visualization.

The ICCC also features a contact center and a helpdesk that can be converted into a call center for direct interaction between farmers and officials or the Minister via video conferencing. It aims to centralize comprehensive monitoring of the farm sector by collating geospatial information from multiple sources, including remote sensing, soil surveys, weather data, and crop surveys.

Looking ahead, the ICCC plans to generate individual farmer-level advisories through apps like Kisan e-mitra, using an AI/machine learning system that identifies farmers by mobile number or Aadhaar and provides customized advice in local languages using the Bhashini platform for translation. This initiative represents a significant step in utilizing technology to enhance agricultural productivity and decision-making.</description>

			<title>How Supreme Court is overseeing conservation of the Great Indian Bustard</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-conservation-great-indian-bustard-9234896/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has formed a seven-member committee to reconcile the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) with renewable energy development. This decision follows a 2021 judgment where the court mandated bird diverters on existing power lines and considered underground lines for new projects. The GIB, critically endangered with less than 200 in India, faces threats from power line collisions due to their poor frontal vision. The 2024 order arose after energy companies and the government expressed concerns over the feasibility of the 2021 directives, citing extensive potential GIB habitats that could hinder development. The court suggested defining a 'critical' area for underground lines and tasked the new committee with outlining conservation strategies and identifying areas for safe power line construction. The committee's recommendations are expected by July 31, with the court easing previous restrictions on underground power line construction. This move aims to balance the needs of endangered species protection with the growth of renewable energy infrastructure.</description>

			<title>Explained: When the Supreme Court stepped in against bail conditions imposed by various high courts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-quash-bail-conditions-high-courts-odisha-9234839/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has recently ruled that bail conditions prohibiting a person from engaging in political activities are unconstitutional. This decision came during the case of BJP leader Siba Shankar Das, where the Orissa High Court's earlier bail condition was overturned. The Supreme Court emphasized that bail conditions should not infringe on fundamental rights and should be judiciously imposed, aligning with the principles outlined in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

The article also discusses previous instances where the Supreme Court has struck down bail conditions considered unreasonable or infringing on rights, such as preventing public rallies or requiring inappropriate contact with victims in cases of crimes against women. These decisions highlight the court's stance on ensuring bail conditions are fair and do not amount to an indirect denial of bail.

Lastly, the article briefly mentions Vidhu Vinod Chopra's reflections on his career and collaborations with filmmakers Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Rajkumar Hirani, unrelated to the main legal discussion.</description>

			<title>How much should developed countries pay for climate action?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-finance-developed-countries-9234185/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving financial commitments and challenges in addressing climate change. Key points include:

- The **2022 climate change conference** in Sharm el-Sheikh established a **Loss and Damage Fund** to aid developing nations affected by climate disasters.
- The **Dubai conference** focused on the Global Stocktake (GST), acknowledging the need to move away from fossil fuels and increase renewable energy capacity threefold by 2030.
- The upcoming **COP29** in Baku, Azerbaijan, will concentrate on the **New Collective Quantitative Goal (NCQG)**, which aims to secure more than the previously unmet promise of $100 billion annually from developed countries for climate action in developing countries starting from 2025.
- The **NCQG** is crucial for developing countries, with technical groundwork completed at a ministerial meeting in Copenhagen.
- Adequate finance is the main obstacle to scaling up global climate action, with current flows falling short of the $100 billion target.
- Developing countries need about **$6 trillion annually** to implement their climate action plans, with expectations for this figure to rise.
- A global shift to a low-carbon economy may require **$4-6 trillion yearly** until 2050, with renewable energy expansion costing an estimated **$30 trillion** by 2030.
- India has proposed that the NCQG should be **at least $1 trillion per year**, primarily in grants and concessional finance.
- UN Climate Change's Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, called for climate finance to be "bigger and better," emphasizing the need for trillions, not billions.
- UN Climate Change faces financial difficulties, with its budget less than half funded, impacting its ability to facilitate climate meetings and agreements.
- The distribution of the new funding across various climate-related needs, such as mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage, is also a significant concern.

The article highlights the increasing financial demands for climate action and the pressure on developed countries to fulfill their commitments. It underscores the urgency of mobilizing substantial funds to meet the escalating costs of climate inaction.</description>

			<title>Archaeological Survey of India will ‘delist’ some ‘lost’ monuments. What’s happening, and why?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/asi-delist-lost-monuments-protected-9233382/</link>
			<description>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is set to delist 18 monuments deemed not of national importance, which were previously listed as "untraceable." This includes sites like Kos Minar No.13 in Haryana and the Telia Nala Buddhist ruins in Varanasi. Delisting means these sites will no longer be under ASI's protection, allowing for construction activities in these areas. Currently, ASI oversees 3,693 monuments, but this number will reduce to 3,675 after the delisting. The public has a two-month period to raise objections or suggestions regarding this decision.

The AMASR Act safeguards monuments over 100 years old, but many have been lost due to urbanization, encroachments, and neglect. Regular inspections are mandated by the Act, yet this has not been consistently effective. The ASI, established in 1861, has faced challenges in balancing conservation with uncovering new sites. In 2022, it was reported that 50 of India's centrally protected monuments were missing, with only 248 having security guards due to budget constraints. A 2013 CAG report revealed that 92 monuments were missing, and while some have since been identified, others remain untraceable. The current delisting includes monuments in various states, with many cases involving movable objects like inscriptions, making them difficult to locate. This summary omits unrelated content and focuses on the key points regarding the ASI's delisting of monuments.</description>

			<title>On Holi, a brief history of India’s love affair with bhang</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/bhang-holi-tradition-india-9230479/</link>
			<description>Bhang, often seen as a sacred and joyous substance, is deeply rooted in Indian culture and religion. It has been used for millennia, mentioned in ancient texts like the Vedas, and is recognized in Ayurveda for its healing properties, including anxiety relief. The British, during their rule in India, were surprised by its widespread use and noted its cultural significance, even acknowledging the potential distress that banning it could cause.

Bhang is linked to Hindu mythology, where it is said to have originated from a drop of amrita, the elixir of immortality, and is associated with Lord Shiva. It is traditionally consumed during festivals like Holi and Maha Shivratri, mixed into drinks like thandai and lassi, or eaten in snacks like pakoras. The tradition of consuming bhang during Holi is tied to a myth involving Shiva's deep meditation and his subsequent marriage to Parvati.

Legally, under the NDPS Act, cannabis is classified as a narcotic, but the act specifically excludes the leaves and seeds used to make bhang. While cultivation is banned, harvesting naturally grown leaves is legal. States have their own regulations, with some even licensing and taxing bhang sales. Enforcement is typically relaxed during Holi.

			<title>Beyond Holi and bhang, the many uses of cannabis – from medicine to rope-making</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/holi-bhang-uses-cannabis-medicine-9232220/</link>
			<description>Bhang, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is traditionally consumed during Holi in India and has various uses beyond the festival. It is cultivated mainly in the Indo-Gangetic plains and the Deccan region. The plant yields fibre, oil, and narcotics, with bhang being made from its seeds and leaves. It is mixed with milk or thandai for consumption. Cannabis has applications in manufacturing, such as in varnishes and soaps, and possesses medicinal properties.

The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has documented its diverse uses, including as a treatment for haematoma in animals, aiding paddy seed germination, and controlling threadworms in paddy nurseries. It is also used to treat cattle ailments and reduce swelling from insect stings. While the cultivation of cannabis for narcotics is illegal, its regulated cultivation for fibre and seeds is permitted for industrial and horticultural purposes. The practices mentioned are traditional and have been followed in various regions of India for a long time.</description>

			<title>Pakistan may ‘seriously examine’ resuming trade with India: Why it paused, what it constituted</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/pakistan-india-trade-pause-reasons-9232107/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Minister, Ishaq Dar, announced that the country is considering the resumption of trade with India, which has been halted since 2019. The suspension was a response to India's revocation of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and the imposition of a 200% tariff on Pakistani imports following the Pulwama attack. Despite the MFN status granted by WTO agreements, Pakistan had a negative list of Indian imports and allowed only a limited number through the Wagah-Attari border.

Trade between the two nations was not substantial, with India maintaining a trade surplus. Major exports to Pakistan included cotton and organic chemicals, while imports comprised mineral fuels, fruits, and nuts. The trade halt led to a significant drop in Pakistan's imports of these goods, except for pharmaceuticals during the pandemic.

There have been previous discussions about resuming trade, influenced by Pakistan's economic challenges, such as floods, inflation, and political instability, which have strained its resources and necessitated loans from the IMF and other countries. The current consideration for trade resumption is also driven by the potential for economic relief and the interests of Indian traders, especially from Punjab, who face increased costs due to the current indirect trade routes through Iran or Dubai.</description>

			<title>Why the Karnataka govt has moved the Supreme Court against the Centre over drought relief</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/karnataka-govt-sc-ndrf-drought-water-crisis-9231843/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the Union government for not releasing drought relief funds from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). Facing severe water shortages, the state claims 223 of its 236 taluks are drought-hit, with crop loss over 48 lakh hectares. The state seeks Rs 18,171 crore from the Centre, including funds for crop loss, drought relief, drinking water, and cattle care. Despite an Inter-Ministerial Central Team's assessment, the state has not received any funds after five months. The petition invokes Article 32 of the Constitution, alleging the Centre's inaction is illegal and violates fundamental rights. The opposition criticizes the move as a political stunt ahead of elections, while the state insists it was compelled to take legal action due to the Centre's non-response. The process for disaster relief involves detailed damage reports, on-ground inspections, and recommendations from a High-Level Committee for fund release, overseen by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.</description>

			<title>Why November-December, not March temperatures may decide this year’s rabi crop production</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/march-winter-temperatures-rabi-crop-production-9231534/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of weather conditions on wheat and other crops in India during the 2023-24 season. Wheat in central India faced challenges due to a warmer November and December, leading to premature flowering and reduced vegetative growth. This resulted in fewer tillers and seeds per plant, potentially lowering grain yields. In contrast, northwest and eastern India are expected to have high yields due to near-normal temperatures.

Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and parts of Rajasthan experienced a late onset of winter, affecting the crop's growth. Despite this, if the lower yields in central India are balanced by bumper harvests in other regions, India might still produce more wheat than in previous years.

Potato crops also suffered due to the warm winter, with reduced tuber formation and development. Retail prices for potatoes, onions, and tomatoes have increased as a result.

On a positive note, sugar production is expected to recover, with closing stocks reaching a four-year high. This is attributed to favorable rainfall in Maharashtra and the government's restriction on using sugarcane derivatives for ethanol production, leading to higher sugar output.

The article concludes with an unrelated mention of a political figure's travel on a diplomatic passport, which is not connected to the agricultural content.</description>

			<title>What is Ola’s Krutrim AI, dubbed as India’s indigenous AI?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/ola-krutrim-ai-9230622/</link>
			<description>Ola, an Indian multinational ridesharing company, has launched Krutrim AI, branding it as "India’s own AI." Krutrim AI is designed to be a personalized assistant that aligns with Indian aesthetics and sensibilities. It aims to cater to the diverse needs of Indian consumers and is built on Ola's foundation model. Despite an initial hiccup where it identified as an OpenAI language model due to a data leak, the issue was promptly resolved.

Krutrim AI can perform various tasks, including writing emails, providing information, learning new skills, planning travel, and more. Although currently only responding in English, it is intended to support multiple Indian languages and Hinglish in future iterations. The AI operates on a sophisticated model trained on a vast dataset encompassing Indian languages, social contexts, and cultural references, enabling it to understand and relate to subtle nuances.

The AI distinguishes itself by understanding user intent beyond keyword matching, using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning to improve its performance. Krutrim AI has potential applications across sectors, offering culturally sensitive interactions, personalized education, content ideation and localization, and automation of administrative tasks. The article also briefly mentions Bijin Jose, a technology journalist with a focus on artificial intelligence, and unrelated content about President Joe Biden's views on immigration.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan’s ‘piracy’ of Indian basmati rice varieties is concerning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/pakistan-piracy-indian-basmati-rice-9230794/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concerns raised by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and exporters over the unauthorized cultivation of IARI-developed basmati rice varieties in Pakistan. The issue gained attention after promotional videos from Pakistani seed companies surfaced online. Despite a decline in India's overall merchandise and agricultural exports, basmati rice exports have seen a significant increase, with projections for record-high shipments. IARI's high-yielding basmati varieties, which dominate India's basmati cultivation and exports, are being illegally grown in Pakistan, potentially challenging India's market position. The article suggests that India should address this intellectual property rights violation through bilateral forums and the World Trade Organisation, leveraging the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act and the Seeds Act, which restrict the cultivation and sale of these varieties to designated geographical areas within India.</description>

			<title>Who are ISIS-K, allegedly behind the Moscow attack</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/isis-k-moscow-attack-9230589/</link>
			<description>A tragic shooting occurred at Moscow's Crocus City Hall, resulting in at least 143 fatalities and numerous injuries. The Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) has claimed responsibility, which has been corroborated by US intelligence. While President Putin suggested a connection to Ukraine, the exact motives of ISIS-K remain unclear.

ISIS-K, an active ISIS affiliate since 2014, is known for its extreme brutality and has been a significant threat in Afghanistan and the surrounding region, despite a decline in membership since 2018. The Moscow attack marks a significant act of violence by ISIS-K outside its usual area of operation, reflecting the group's longstanding opposition to Russia, particularly due to President Putin's policies.

The article also mentions that ISIS-K has been critical of Putin for the past two years and that Russia's involvement in combating ISIS globally, especially in Syria, has made it a prime target for the group. This incident underscores the persistent global threat posed by ISIS-K and its affiliates.</description>

			<description>Shaheed Diwas, or Martyr’s Day, is commemorated on March 23 in India to honor Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and S Rajguru, who were executed in 1931 for the assassination of British officer John Saunders. Bhagat Singh's father, Kishan, sought mercy for his son, but Bhagat Singh disapproved, valuing principles over his life. The article recounts Bhagat Singh's arrest for bombing the Indian Parliament, his re-arrest for Saunders' murder, and the subsequent trial and execution. It highlights Bhagat Singh's independence and commitment to the anti-colonial struggle, contrasting with his father's plea for mercy. The article also mentions a cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals, but this is unrelated to the main story.</description>

			<title>Trump could earn $3 billion from his social media site Truth Social: The deal, its significance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-social-media-site-truth-social-9230422/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the upcoming public listing of Donald Trump's social media company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), which is expected to significantly increase his net worth. The merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp is valued at about $5.7 billion, and Trump, who owns 60% of TMTG, could gain $3 billion. However, it's uncertain when he will have access to the funds.

Truth Social, Trump's social media platform, was launched after he was banned from major platforms and is marketed as a free-speech alternative, mainly attracting conservative users. Despite its smaller user base compared to mainstream platforms, Truth Social has more users than its direct competitors in the alternative social media space.

Trump's legal expenses have increased due to numerous legal challenges, with his political action committee spending over $55 million on legal fees since early 2023. Additionally, Trump faces a $454 million penalty in a civil fraud case. The merger comes at a crucial time, potentially providing financial relief for Trump and TMTG, which reported a $10.6 million operational loss in the first nine months of 2023.

The article also mentions that Trump is currently restricted from selling his shares in TMTG for at least six months, but this may change with the expected appointment of allies to the company's board, who could facilitate an earlier sale of his stake.

			<title>Why has SEBI asked fund houses to stop overseas ETF inflows?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/sebi-fund-houses-stop-overseas-etf-9230021/</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has instructed mutual fund houses to halt new investments in schemes that invest in overseas exchange-traded funds (ETFs) starting from April 1, 2024. This directive comes as the investment limit of $1 billion in foreign ETFs is nearly reached, with the mutual fund industry already investing approximately $950 million, which is 95% of the cap. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has set an overall limit of $7 billion for mutual funds to invest in foreign stocks and funds, and there have been calls from the industry to increase this limit. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has indicated that any decision to revise the investment limit will be considered when the rupee is stable on a durable basis.

ETFs are marketable securities that track various assets and trade like stocks on exchanges, offering higher liquidity and lower fees than traditional mutual fund schemes, making them appealing to individual investors. They are also seen as more tax-efficient and come in various types, including equity, bonds, commodity, international, and sectoral/thematic ETFs.</description>

			<title>Pakistan’s Taliban problem, on either side of Afghan border</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistans-taliban-problem-on-either-side-of-afghan-border-9229980/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complex situation involving Pakistan, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and Afghanistan. It highlights Pakistan's airstrikes against TTP militants in Afghanistan, which the Taliban claim resulted in civilian casualties. The TTP, an umbrella group aiming to impose a strict version of Islam in Pakistan, has historical ties with the Afghan Taliban. Despite expectations, the Kabul regime has not acted against the TTP, which Pakistan alleges has found safe haven in Afghanistan. The article also touches on the TTP's past actions, including high-profile attacks and its role in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. The resurgence of the TTP is linked to the Afghan Taliban's return to power and Pakistan's lack of a coherent strategy. The situation has led to concerns in India and calls for action against all terror outfits to open dialogue opportunities. The article concludes with commentary on the implications of the Afghan Taliban's relationship with the TTP and the challenges it poses for regional security.</description>

			<title>Is Holi becoming warmer than before? What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/holi-becoming-warmer-study-9229260/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a study by Climate Central which indicates a significant warming trend in India since 1970, particularly in March and April. The study, analyzing temperatures from 1970 to 2023, found that northern and western regions of India experienced the most warming, with Jammu and Kashmir's average temperature rising by approximately 2.8°C. In April, Mizoram saw the highest increase of about 1.9°C. The likelihood of temperatures exceeding 40°C around Holi has increased, with nine states now experiencing this heat compared to only three in the early 1970s. Out of 51 cities studied, 37 have at least a 1% chance of reaching 40°C, with Bilaspur having the highest risk at 31%. The study attributes the warming trend to global warming caused by the release of greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution. Dr. Andrew Pershing and Dr. Akshay Deoras highlight the abrupt transition to warmer conditions and the increased risk of heat-related illnesses due to the early arrival of hot weather, particularly affecting Indian hilly states during outdoor festivals like Holi.</description>

It explains that under PMLA, an individual can be charged with money laundering without being an accused in the predicate offence, which is the underlying criminal activity. The article clarifies that "proceeds of crime" refer to any property obtained from criminal activity related to a scheduled offence. The Supreme Court has ruled that an individual involved in concealing or using proceeds of crime can be prosecuted under PMLA even if they are not accused in the predicate offence. The outcome of Kejriwal's involvement with allegedly tainted money will be determined at his trial. Additionally, the article briefly mentions Janata Dal (Secular) leader Prajwal Revanna's travel on a diplomatic passport without political clearance from the Ministry of External Affairs.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the legal debate surrounding the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the context of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's case. It explains that under PMLA, an individual can be charged with money laundering without being an accused in the predicate offence, which is the underlying criminal activity. The law defines "proceeds of crime" and lists scheduled offences related to money laundering. The article references two Supreme Court judgments that clarify the prosecution under PMLA is possible even if the individual is not accused in the predicate offence, as long as there is a connection to the proceeds of crime from the scheduled offence. The outcome of Kejriwal's involvement with allegedly tainted money will be determined at his trial, which is contingent on the trial for the excise scam.

			<title>Explained: On Holi, a look at Jaipur’s traditional celebrations with ‘Gulaal Gota’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/holi-tradition-jaipur-gulaal-gota-history-9229158/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the traditional Holi celebration in Jaipur, Rajasthan, where **Gulaal Gotas**—handmade lac balls filled with dry gulaal—are used instead of water balloons. This 400-year-old tradition involves local Muslim artisans known as Manihaars, who create these balls that burst upon impact during Holi festivities. The lac used is sourced from Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, and the process of making Gulaal Gotas is detailed, from boiling the lac to shaping and coloring it, and finally filling it with gulaal.

The economic aspect of this tradition is highlighted, mentioning that a box of six Gulaal Gota balls sells for Rs 150, with the entire family of artisans involved in the production. Despite being eco-friendly, the demand for traditional lac bangles, which provide year-round sustenance for the artisans, has declined due to the rise of cheaper, chemical-based alternatives.

The future of this craft is uncertain. The Indian government has provided artisan cards to support the makers, and there have been efforts to showcase the art internationally. Some artisans seek a Geographical Indication (GI) tag to protect their craft, but internal community issues and the younger generation's disinterest in artisan work pose challenges to the tradition's continuity. The article concludes with unrelated content about an upcoming IPL cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals.</description>

			<title>What is the Govt’s Fact Check Unit, the notification of which the Supreme Court has now stayed?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govt-fact-check-unit-notification-supreme-court-stayed-9228742/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has put a hold on the Centre's notification of the Fact Check Unit (FCU) under the Press Information Bureau (PIB) until the Bombay High Court makes a decision on the challenge to the amended IT Rules. The FCU was introduced in the 2023 amendment to the IT Rules, 2021, to legally fact-check online content related to the Central Government's business. Despite the stay, the PIB has had an official fact-checking unit for over four years.

The March 20 notification aimed to give the FCU legal authority and require online platforms to remove content marked as "fake" by the FCU. Non-compliance could result in the loss of legal immunity for these platforms. The FCU has been active since November 2019, addressing thousands of instances of "fake news."

The FCU's process involves stamping content as "fake" or "misleading" and publicizing the decision through its social media handles. It has also labeled news reports from established media as "misinformation." The FCU's actions have been limited to branding, but if the Supreme Court lifts the stay, online platforms will be legally obligated to remove such content.

The FCU is tasked with countering misinformation on government policies and initiatives. It operates on the "FACT model" — Find, Assess, Create, and Target — using technological tools for verification. The unit is based in New Delhi and headed by the PIB's Additional Director General, with a team for support.

The article also mentions President Joe Biden's remarks on the positive impact of immigrants in the US and his criticism of xenophobia from certain countries, contrasting his views with former President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. Biden spoke at a fundraising event, highlighting the contributions of immigrants to the US's economic growth.</description>

			<title>How three high courts have dealt with the Centre’s circular on banning 23 dog breeds</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/high-courts-circular-ban-23-dog-breeds-9228627/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the legal challenges to a circular issued by India's Centre, which banned the sale, import, and keeping of 23 foreign dog breeds and mandated their sterilization. The Karnataka and Calcutta High Courts stayed the circular's implementation, questioning its legality and the potential harm of mandatory sterilization, especially for puppies. The Delhi High Court sought the Centre's response to a plea challenging the circular, which was criticized for not following scientific protocols or comprehensive research on canine behavior. The circular was based on recommendations from an expert committee, but petitioners argued that not all stakeholders were consulted, and the identification of "ferocious and dangerous" breeds lacked profound expertise.

			<title>Who are the Majeed Brigade, the Baloch militants who carried out Gwadar attack?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/majeed-brigade-baloch-militants-gwadar-attack-9227648/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and its Majeed Brigade, which claimed responsibility for an attack on a complex near Gwadar Port in Pakistan. The BLA is a prominent separatist group in Balochistan, fighting for independence due to economic and political grievances since Pakistan's creation. The Majeed Brigade, named after two brothers who died for the Baloch cause, has been active since 2011 and is known for targeting Pakistani interests and Chinese nationals. The article traces the history of Balochistan's struggle, including the role of the National Awami Party (NAP) and its opposition to Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, leading to increased insurgency and state repression. The Majeed brothers became symbols of resistance, and their legacy continues to inspire BLA's actions, including attacks on strategic targets in Pakistan. The article also mentions an unrelated case of Janata Dal (Secular) leader Prajwal Revanna traveling on a diplomatic passport without political clearance.</description>

			<title>Kejriwal arrested: What is the Delhi excise policy case, and what is the Delhi CM accused of?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kejriwal-arrested-what-is-the-delhi-excise-policy-case-what-is-the-delhi-cm-accused-of-9227319/</link>
			<description>Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, has been remanded to the Enforcement Directorate's custody in connection with the excise policy case. The ED accuses him of being the central figure in a scam involving kickbacks from liquor businesses for policy favours, which were also allegedly used in election campaigns. The ED's investigation suggests a conspiracy involving Kejriwal and other AAP leaders, including payments from the "South Group," a collective from South India, to AAP leaders. Despite these allegations, Kejriwal's counsel argues that there is no credible evidence against him, and the case is constructed on unreliable witness statements. The controversy stems from a report alleging financial losses due to the excise policy, leading to multiple arrests, including that of former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The ED claims the policy was designed to benefit private entities and AAP leaders through a kickback scheme. Kejriwal had previously ignored nine summonses from the ED before his arrest. The article also mentions political activities unrelated to the case, such as candidate announcements for the Nehru-Gandhi seats and campaign events by other political figures.</description>

			<title>Why did the SC refuse to stay the appointments of two election commissioners?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-did-sc-refuse-to-stay-appointments-election-commissioners-9227168/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court dismissed challenges to the appointment of Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu as election commissioners and declined to stay the related Act. The NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) had sought a stay, citing concerns over the EC's independence. The law in question arose from a 2023 SC judgment that altered the EC appointment process to ensure independence, replacing the Chief Justice of India with a Union Cabinet Minister in the selection committee. Dr. Jaya Thakur and ADR challenged the law, arguing it compromised the ECI's independence. The Centre defended the appointments, stating the independence of the EC does not depend on the selection committee's composition. The SC refused to stay the law, adhering to the principle that laws are presumed constitutional until proven otherwise. The article also contains unrelated content about President Joe Biden's views on immigration, which is not included in this summary.</description>

			<title>9 takeaways from World Inequality Lab working paper</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/9-takeaways-world-inequality-lab-working-paper-9226928/</link>
			<description>The working paper "Income and Wealth Inequality in India, 1922-2023: The Rise of the Billionaire Raj" by the World Inequality Lab discusses the trajectory of income and wealth inequality in India. It highlights that inequality decreased after independence until the early 1980s but has significantly increased since the early 2000s. The paper, authored by Bharti, Chancel, Piketty, and Somanchi, uses a variety of data sources to analyze trends and draw conclusions.

**Key findings include**:
- India's average income grew at 2.6% per year from 1960 to 2022, with faster growth post-1990.
- The number of high net worth individuals (net wealth over $1 billion) rose from 1 in 1991 to 162 in 2022.
- Income tax filing increased from under 1% of adults pre-1990s to around 9% in 2017-2020.
- In 2022-23, the top 1% of earners received 22.6% of national income, the highest since 1922.
- The wealth share of the top 1% was at 40.1% in 2022-23, the highest since 1961.

The paper also compares India's inequality with other countries, noting that India's top 1% income share is among the highest globally. However, it suggests that the actual levels of inequality might be higher due to the poor quality of economic data in India. The authors propose implementing a super tax on billionaires and multimillionaires and restructuring the tax schedule to finance public infrastructure as potential solutions to address inequality.</description>

			<title>Why SC has stayed Govt’s ‘Fact Check Unit’ for now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-stayed-fact-check-unit-9226677/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has stayed the operation of the amended IT Rules that allowed the government to identify "fake news" on social media via a Fact Check Unit (FCU). The FCU, notified as a statutory body under the Press Information Bureau, was empowered to flag false information related to the central government on social media. The amendment, notified in April 2023, was challenged in the Bombay High Court for potentially violating free speech and being arbitrary. The High Court delivered a split verdict, with one judge striking down the rules and another upholding them. The case was then referred to a third judge for a decisive opinion. The Supreme Court's stay will remain until the Bombay High Court reaches a final conclusion. The amended rules had raised concerns about the government becoming the sole arbiter of truth regarding its business, leading to challenges on constitutional grounds. The Supreme Court's intervention highlights the delicate balance between judicial review and legislative powers, especially when the rules in question are not direct acts of legislation but are made by the Ministry through delegated powers. The stay is significant as it comes just before the Lok Sabha elections, where the rules would be crucial for the government's engagement with news about its business.</description>

			<title>Ae Watan Mere Watan: The story of Usha Mehta and Congress Radio</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/ae-watan-mere-watan-the-story-of-usha-mehta-and-congress-radio-9225440/</link>
			<description>"Ae Watan Mere Watan," a historical biography released on Amazon Prime, narrates the story of Usha Mehta and the underground Congress Radio during the Quit India Movement in 1942. The film highlights the movement's call for civil disobedience and the British government's crackdown on leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel.

Usha Mehta, then a 22-year-old law student, was inspired by Gandhi and left her studies to join the movement. She proposed setting up an underground radio station to inform the public, as the press was censored. Despite the risks and challenges, including a ban on amateur radio licenses and the need for technical expertise, Mehta and her team successfully established Congress Radio.

The station became a vital source of uncensored news and political speeches, broadcasting in English and Hindustani. It operated covertly, changing locations frequently to evade detection. However, it was eventually discovered, leading to the arrest of its operators, including Mehta. The trial attracted significant attention, and while some were acquitted, others received harsh sentences.

Usha Mehta was released from jail in 1946 and was later honored with the Padma Vibhushan. She remained a committed Gandhian until her passing in 2000. The film "Ae Watan Mere Watan" pays tribute to her legacy and the impact of Congress Radio on India's struggle for independence.</description>

			<title>‘Most polluted’ Begusarai: a striking finding, based on inadequate data</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/most-polluted-begusarai-a-striking-finding-based-on-inadequate-data-9225457/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a report on global air quality that identifies Begusarai in Bihar as the world's most polluted city, with Delhi being the most polluted capital. Other cities in Bihar also rank highly in pollution levels. The data, compiled by Swiss company IQAir, is sourced from various air monitoring stations. Despite Begusarai not being an industrial hub, the pollution is speculated to come from solid fuel burning and waste burning, as well as pollutant transport from northern regions of India. Dr. Sachchida Nand Tripathi from IIT Kanpur suggests that the actual pollution levels across Bihar towns don't vary significantly. A new network of over 500 air quality monitors called AMRIT has been set up for better assessment, but the data is not public yet. The article concludes with unrelated political news regarding Congress candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli, and campaign activities by PM Modi and AAP's Sunita Kejriwal.</description>

			<title>Can intermittent fasting worsen heart health? What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/can-intermittent-fasting-worsen-heart-health-what-a-new-study-says-9225456/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent study on intermittent fasting, which has raised concerns about its long-term safety. The study, presented at an international conference, suggests that intermittent fasting may significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular death. It followed 20,000 adults over 8 to 17 years and found a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death among those who ate within less than 8 hours per day. The risk was even higher for those with existing heart conditions.

Dr. Anoop Misra from Fortis C-Doc Hospital provided insights, suggesting that bingeing on calorie-dense foods during the eating window and the resulting spikes in sugar levels could be detrimental to heart health. The study's methodology and data have not been peer-reviewed, and experts like Dr. VK Bahl from Max Hospitals have raised concerns about the reliability of the dietary data collected through questionnaires.

While intermittent fasting has been associated with benefits like weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity, the article notes that there is no significant difference in weight loss outcomes when compared to continuous calorie restriction. Additionally, there are no long-term studies showing the impact of intermittent fasting on chronic diseases.

The article advises that intermittent fasting is not suitable for everyone, particularly young people, pregnant women, long-term diabetics, and those with heart disease. It emphasizes the importance of aligning the eating period with the circadian rhythm and not delaying meals to late in the day.

The author, Anonna Dutt, is a health correspondent with a background in media and journalism, and she has reported on various health-related topics, including the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccination programs. The article also briefly mentions unrelated content regarding a political figure's travel, which is not connected to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Was Aurangzeb born in Gujarat?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/aurangzeb-gujarat-9225080/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the Network18 Summit, responded to the Opposition's criticisms by highlighting that they had likened him to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, marking the 104th insult directed at him. This comparison was previously made by Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut, who noted that both Modi and Aurangzeb were born in Gujarat, and accused Modi of having an 'Aurangzeb-like attitude' against Maharashtra and Shiv Sena.

The article then delves into the historical context of Aurangzeb, who was born in Gujarat in 1618 and spent his early years there. It discusses the Mughal rule over Gujarat, including the establishment of British East India Company trading posts during Emperor Jahangir's reign and the subsequent instability during Aurangzeb's reign, marked by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's raids.

The article concludes with a separate piece of news regarding Janata Dal (Secular) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is involved in a sexual abuse case and traveled to Germany on a diplomatic passport without political clearance from the Ministry of External Affairs.</description>

			<title>Gaza and Haiti on the brink of famine: How this is assessed, what exactly it means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gaza-haiti-famine-how-this-is-assessed-9225283/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe hunger crises in northern Gaza and Haiti, where famine is imminent or approaching, affecting hundreds of thousands. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reports that in Gaza, 1.1 million people are at risk of severe hunger, and famine could occur without an end to hostilities and access to essential supplies. In Haiti, about 1.4 million people are on the brink of famine, with over 4 million needing food assistance.

The IPC, a coalition of global organizations, uses a five-tier scale to classify food access and hunger levels, with famine being the most severe, Phase 5. This phase is characterized by the absolute inaccessibility of food, acute malnutrition in children, and death due to starvation or malnutrition-related diseases.

The article explains that the current crises are exacerbated by pre-existing conditions: in Gaza, reliance on humanitarian aid and insufficient food supplies, and in Haiti, pre-existing emergency hunger levels. Hunger, malnutrition, and starvation are defined and described, highlighting the rapid and devastating effects of food scarcity on the body.

The most vulnerable groups include children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. The article concludes with the process of declaring famine by the United Nations, which, while not legally binding, aims to draw global attention to the crisis.</description>

			<title>Documentary Frida out: Five things you should know about Frida Kahlo, revolutionary artist and feminist</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/documentary-frida-five-things-to-know-about-frida-kahlo-9225225/</link>
			<description>The documentary "Frida," directed by Carla Gutiérrez, tells the story of Frida Kahlo using her own voice through diaries, writings, and archival footage. It highlights her personal art, which reflects her struggles with love, health, and Mexican culture, and her rejection of conservative values.

Kahlo was born in 1907 in Mexico City and faced health challenges from an early age, including spina bifida and polio. These experiences influenced her iconic style, including the long skirts she wore. Despite early aspirations to become a doctor, a bus accident at 18 led her to painting as a form of expression.

Her romantic life was marked by a tumultuous marriage to artist Diego Rivera, with whom she shared a bond over politics and art despite multiple infidelities. Kahlo's art often depicted her physical and emotional pain, using bright colors and symbolism rooted in Mexican culture.

Despite being overshadowed by Rivera during her lifetime, Kahlo's work gained recognition posthumously. She is now celebrated as a revolutionary feminist artist, and her self-portrait "Diego" set a record for the most expensive Latin American work sold at auction. Kahlo's legacy continues to influence and inspire.</description>

			<title>India to generate 600 kilotonnes of solar waste by 2030: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/india-solar-waste-new-study-9225154/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's growing solar waste challenge and the findings of a study titled ‘Enabling a Circular Economy in India’s Solar Industry – Assessing the Solar Waste Quantum’. **India produced 100 kilotonnes (kt) of solar waste** in FY 2022-2023, with projections to reach **600 kt by 2030**. The study, conducted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and researchers from the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), highlights that India's solar capacity has increased 23-fold in the last decade to 66.7 GW and is expected to rise to 292 GW by 2030.

Solar waste includes scrap from manufacturing and damaged modules from transportation, operational damage, and end-of-life modules. The study focused on waste from the field and found that by 2030, India's installed solar capacity will generate about **340 kt of waste**, with five states—Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh—expected to produce 67% of it due to their higher solar capacity.

The study also emphasizes the importance of managing solar waste for environmental, economic, and social reasons. It contains critical minerals like silicon, copper, tellurium, and cadmium, which are vital for India's economic development and national security. The report suggests maintaining a comprehensive database of installed solar capacity and incentivizing recyclers to manage solar waste effectively.

Two recycling methods are discussed: conventional recycling, which recovers materials like glass, aluminium, and copper but not silver and silicon; and high-value recycling, which uses mechanical, chemical, and thermal processes to recover these more valuable materials. The study urges immediate action, as solar waste is not just a future problem but a current one as well.</description>

			<description>The Election Commission of India (ECI) has adjusted the vote counting dates for the upcoming Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections. **Counting for Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh** has been moved to **June 2**, ahead of the original June 4 date, due to the expiration of their legislative terms on that day. The Lok Sabha elections will occur in **seven phases** from April 19 to June 1, with the first phase of polling for both Assembly and Lok Sabha seats scheduled for April 19. The ECI has also considered various factors such as weather, festivals, and logistics for security forces while scheduling the elections. The change in counting date is a rare occurrence, with officials emphasizing the importance of completing the election process before the legislative terms end. The ECI aims to declare results a few days before the term's end to allow time for formalities and documentation. The article also mentions past instances where the ECI has altered election schedules to accommodate local events or festivals.</description>

			<title>What has caused the water crisis in Bengaluru, neighbouring areas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-caused-the-water-crisis-in-bengaluru-9223131/</link>
			<description>Bengaluru is experiencing a significant drinking water crisis, with a daily shortage of 500 million liters. This issue extends beyond the city to the entire state of Karnataka and neighboring regions of Telangana and Maharashtra, largely due to below-normal rainfall and the nature of the local aquifers. Karnataka's aquifers, unlike those in North India, cannot sustain prolonged dry spells due to their rocky composition and quick depletion and recharge rates.

The state's reservoirs are at only 26% capacity, which is lower than usual for this time of year. The situation is exacerbated by the demands of the summer season, which increase water usage not only for households but also for industry, agriculture, and hydropower sectors. The crisis is attributed to seasonal rainfall variability and the state's lack of capacity to manage such fluctuations.

Long-term issues like unregulated construction, lake destruction, and climate change also impact water availability, but the current crisis is mainly due to the immediate rainfall patterns. While Bengaluru, as a major urban center, is the focus, rural areas may be facing even greater shortages. The need for resilience against multi-year droughts and the importance of valuing water as a resource are emphasized, suggesting policy changes to minimize groundwater usage through household pumps.</description>

			<title>World Bank report says women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns: what is the gender pay gap?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/world-bank-report-what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-9222848/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the gender pay gap, highlighting that women globally earn 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) defines the gender pay gap as the difference between the average wages of all working women and men, not just those with the same job and qualifications. The gap varies due to different calculation methods and factors such as labor force participation rates, types of jobs, and management positions held. For example, globally, women's labor force participation is 47% compared to men's 72%. In management, women often hold support roles rather than strategic ones, affecting average salaries. Part-time work and socio-economic factors also contribute to the gap.

The article further explains that employment patterns show women's earnings dip in their mid-30s to 40s compared to men in the same roles. The "motherhood penalty" suggests that women's career growth is impacted by taking breaks for family care. Claudia Goldin, awarded the 2023 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, notes that traditional roles lead to men advancing in careers while women step back, affecting both genders' work-life balance. Closing the gender pay gap is expected to take decades, with progress depending on policies like maternity/paternity leave and work flexibility. The article concludes with unrelated content about political candidate announcements and campaigns, which is not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>Why the B200 Blackwell chip will consolidate Nvidia’s stranglehold over the AI market</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/b200-blackwell-chip-nvidia-ai-9222412/</link>
			<description>Nvidia has introduced the B200 'Blackwell', a new AI chip that significantly outperforms its predecessor, the H100 'Hopper'. The Blackwell GPU boasts **208 billion transistors**, a substantial increase from the H100's 80 billion, enhancing its computational capabilities. It is touted to be **twice as powerful** in AI model training and **five times more capable** in inference tasks. This advancement means that tasks which required 8,000 Hopper GPUs can now be accomplished with just 2,000 Blackwell chips, reducing power consumption from 15 MW to 4 MW.

Major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI are expected to incorporate the Blackwell chip into their cloud services and AI products. Nvidia's market value has soared, making it the most valuable chipmaker globally, surpassing Intel and AMD. The company's dominance in the GPU market is set to continue, with GPUs becoming increasingly integral to AI applications, shifting the balance from CPUs.

Moody's 2024 AI outlook suggests that AI adoption will accelerate due to increased investment and technological advancements, despite a persistent shortage of high-performance GPUs. Nvidia's near-monopoly on GPUs, crucial for AI computations, has led to a backlog of orders. The B200's enhanced compute power promises to alleviate these shortages.</description>

			<title>Why have Sensex and Nifty tanked 1% each?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/markets-sensex-nifty-tanked-1-percent-9222385/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the performance of domestic equity markets in India, which fell by 1% due to weak Asian markets and anticipation of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. The Sensex and Nifty both saw significant drops. The US Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current interest rates, while the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the first time in 17 years, ending a long period of negative interest rates. The Reserve Bank of India is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% due to persistent inflation above the target. The article also mentions that the RBI's future decisions may be influenced by the US Fed's actions, with potential rate cuts expected later in the year. It concludes with a brief mention of stock performance of specific companies on the NSE and a separate note on a political figure's travel on a diplomatic passport.</description>

			<title>The big promise of small-scale LNG as fuel for India, with first SSLNG plant commissioned</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/small-scale-lng-vijaipur-fuel-energy-9221867/</link>
			<description>India has inaugurated its first small-scale liquefied natural gas (SSLNG) unit at GAIL's Vijaipur complex in Madhya Pradesh, marking a significant step towards increasing the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix from over 6% to 15% by 2030. This move is part of the government's broader strategy to adopt cleaner energy sources, as natural gas emits less pollution compared to coal and oil and is also more cost-effective.

The SSLNG unit addresses the challenge of transporting gas to areas not connected by the natural gas pipeline grid, which is essential for scaling up gas consumption and using LNG as fuel for long-haul trucks and inter-city buses. With large-scale pipeline projects taking years to complete, SSLNG offers a quicker solution to expand natural gas reach and consumption.

SSLNG involves the liquefaction of natural gas and its transportation in a smaller-scale operation compared to traditional large-scale processes. It enables the supply of LNG in liquid form to industrial and commercial consumers in regions without pipeline connectivity. The Vijaipur facility, GAIL's largest gas processing unit, exemplifies this approach with a capacity of 36 tonnes per day and utilizes an automated SCADA system for operation.

The business case for SSLNG is strong, with major oil and gas companies in India, including Petronet LNG Ltd, focusing on this high-growth segment. The use of LNG as a direct fuel for road and marine transportation is particularly attractive due to its cleaner emissions profile and cost advantages over diesel. Efforts are underway to establish a supportive ecosystem for the adoption of LNG in transportation, with initiatives like building LNG dispensing stations along major highways and collaborating with vehicle manufacturers for trials of LNG-fueled trucks and buses.

This development is poised to transform India's energy landscape, promoting the use of cleaner fuels and potentially leading to significant foreign exchange savings by reducing diesel consumption.</description>

			<title>Heat, aridity, clear skies: why forests are already ablaze in the Nilgiris</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/heat-aridity-clear-skies-why-forests-are-already-ablaze-in-the-nilgiris-9221517/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe forest fires in the Coonoor forest range in Tamil Nadu, India. The Indian Air Force has been deployed to assist with firefighting efforts using a "Bambi Bucket" to douse the fires. The Bambi Bucket is a specialized tool for aerial firefighting, particularly useful in inaccessible areas. The article notes that forest fire season in India typically runs from November to June, with the worst fires occurring in April and May. According to the 2019 India State of Forest Report, a significant portion of India's forest cover is prone to fires, with certain regions being extremely vulnerable.

The most forest fires in India occur in dry deciduous forests, with the Northeast, Odisha, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand being particularly susceptible. Recent data indicates a spike in forest fires across various regions, including the Konkan belt in Maharashtra and parts of South India. The article attributes the increase in forest fires to both human activities, such as negligence, and natural causes like lightning. Contributing factors include high temperatures, dry conditions, and dense tree populations. This year, an early dry season and above-normal temperatures have exacerbated the situation, leading to more frequent and severe fires.

The article also briefly mentions a statement by President Joe Biden on the contributions of immigrants to the US and his criticism of xenophobia, contrasting his views with those of former President Donald Trump. However, this section seems unrelated to the main topic of forest fires.</description>

			<title>Fresh tussle with Governor: Why Tamil Nadu has moved SC to have a minister reinstated</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/disqualification-over-graft-ravi-vs-tn-govt-again-9221516/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea from Tamil Nadu regarding the reinstatement of K Ponmudy, a senior DMK leader, as a minister. Ponmudy was disqualified after a conviction in a disproportionate assets case by the Madras High Court. The Supreme Court stayed the conviction, which technically removes the basis for his disqualification. However, Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi refused to reinstate Ponmudy, citing ongoing corruption cases and arguing that the stay of conviction does not negate the existence of the conviction itself. The case highlights the tension between the state government and the Governor, and is part of a broader discussion on the Governor's role, particularly in assenting to Bills. The Supreme Court has previously expressed concern over Governors not acting on Bills, leading to a special Assembly session in Tamil Nadu to address the issue.</description>

			<title>Vladimir Putin won the Russian elections with 87% of the vote. Who were his opponents?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/vladimir-putin-russia-elections-candidates-opposition-9221272/</link>
			<description>Russian President Vladimir Putin secured a significant victory in the recent presidential elections, obtaining 87.97% of the votes. This win extends his leadership for another six years, making him the longest-serving Russian leader in over two centuries. International reactions were mixed, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from China and North Korea offering congratulations, while the United States criticized the election's fairness.

The article discusses the restrictive political environment in Russia, exemplified by the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison. Critics argue the election process is rigged to favor Putin, with limited opposition candidates allowed to run. The election is seen as a means to legitimize Putin's rule and his policies, including the war in Ukraine.

The top three opposition candidates were Kharitonov from the Communist Party, Davankov from the New People party, and Slutsky from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), with vote shares of 4.7%, 3.6%, and 2.5%, respectively. The article highlights the complexities of Russian politics, where opposition parties often support Putin's party, and the challenges faced by candidates in positioning themselves within the political spectrum. It also touches on allegations of sexual harassment against Slutsky, which were dismissed by the Russian Parliament's Ethics Commission.

Lastly, the article mentions U.S. President Joe Biden's views on immigration and his criticism of xenophobia, contrasting his stance with that of former President Donald Trump. Biden emphasizes the positive impact of immigrants on the U.S. economy and the strength they bring to the nation.</description>

			<title>Pakistan carries out strikes inside Afghanistan: What is happening, and why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-strikes-inside-afghanistan-why-9221302/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan following Pakistan's air strikes that resulted in civilian casualties. Pakistan confirmed conducting anti-terrorist operations in Afghanistan, which led to an exchange of fire along the border and heated rhetoric between the two nations. Pakistan accused the Taliban government of supporting the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while the Taliban warned Pakistan against blaming Afghanistan for its internal issues.

The immediate cause of the strikes was an attack on a Pakistani security post by militants, which killed seven soldiers. Pakistan's retaliation targeted the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, accused of numerous civilian and law enforcement deaths. However, the strikes killed five women and three children, according to the Taliban.

The article explains that the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan has emboldened the TTP, which has found a safe haven there. This situation is a result of Pakistan's long-standing policy of promoting hardline Sunni Islam to counter Pashtun nationalism, which inadvertently led to the creation of the TTP. The TTP aims to establish an Islamic state in Pakistan, free from American influence.

The return of the Taliban to power has not been the allyship Pakistan hoped for, as the Taliban regime appears to support the TTP over the Pakistani state. Additionally, Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan immigrants due to economic strain has added to the tensions. The article concludes with President Joe Biden's remarks on the positive impact of immigrants in the US, contrasting with xenophobic attitudes in other countries.</description>

			<title>Floating pier off Gaza coast: How US plans to deliver humanitarian aid</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-us-plans-to-deliver-gaza-aid-9219881/</link>
			<description>The US Army has initiated a project to construct a floating pier off the Gaza coast to deliver humanitarian aid. This initiative, known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS), is a response to the crisis in Gaza, where Israel's actions have limited overland aid access. The pier, which will be built without US military presence on the ground, will involve a private company, Fogbow, and will consist of a floating dock and a 548-meter-long pier with a causeway.

The floating dock will be made of steel and delivered by a roll on, roll off ship, designed to avoid the need for ships to approach the shallow shore. The pier will be connected to the shore and constructed using one of three methods: a ribbon floating bridge, a Mabey floating bridge, or a foam floating bridge. These structures are designed to support heavy loads and rely on the principle of buoyancy to stay afloat. The aid will be transferred from the dock to the pier and then moved inland by trucks for distribution. The operation emphasizes the use of buoyancy and density principles to ensure stability and functionality of the floating structures.</description>

			<title>Why Kerala and the Centre are in a dispute over state borrowing limits at the SC</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kerala-centre-borrowing-limits-sc-9219386/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the financial dispute between the Kerala state government and the Central government of India. Kerala claims that the Centre's fiscal policies have led to a financial crisis in the state. The state filed a suit against the Centre, alleging that reduced borrowing limits and withheld tax shares have strained its finances. The 15th Finance Commission labeled Kerala as "highly debt stressed," and the state contends it has not received its fair share of taxes from the Centre. The cessation of GST compensation and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic have further affected Kerala's revenue collection.

The Supreme Court of India has been involved, with the Attorney General defending the Centre's actions, citing the impact of state debts on the country's credit rating. The court suggested negotiations, but talks failed to resolve the issue. Kerala insists it is entitled to more funds without conditions to prevent a financial crisis, while the Centre is reluctant to release funds without the state withdrawing its suit. The case is ongoing, with the next hearing scheduled for March 21.

			<title>Why Delhi’s Dolma Aunty Momos challenged the use of her trade mark, what the law says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/delhi-dolma-aunty-momos-trademark-passing-off-9219191/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court ruled in favor of Dolma Tsering, known as "Dolma Aunty," by cancelling the trademark registration of "Dolma Aunty Momos" that was held by Mohammed Akram Khan. The court recognized Tsering's claim that she was the original retailer of momos in Delhi since 1994 and had gained significant reputation. Tsering had applied for the trademark after Khan registered it in 2018, leading to a legal battle. The court's decision was influenced by the Trademarks Act of 1999, which protects registered trademarks and allows for legal action against infringement or unauthorized use. The ruling also referenced the concept of "passing off," where a brand attempts to deceive consumers by imitating another brand's product or service. The court ordered Khan's trademark to be removed from the register, acknowledging Tsering's longstanding reputation and the unchallenged allegations of non-use by Khan.</description>

			<title>Amid Nepal’s continuing political turmoil, confidence vote win for PM Prachanda, the task for India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nepal-politics-prachanda-india-relations-9218873/</link>
			<description>Nepal's Prime Minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, recently won a vote of confidence in Parliament, securing the support of 157 MPs. This follows his decision to end an alliance with the Nepali Congress and form a new one with the CPN-UML led by K P Sharma Oli. Prachanda has been a key figure in Nepal's politics, especially after leading the Maoist insurgency from 1996 to 2006. Despite a decline in parliamentary support, he has managed to maintain power.

The political dynamics in Nepal are closely watched by India, given the historical and economic ties between the two countries. India is Nepal's largest trade partner, and the relationship is significant for both nations. Nepal's geopolitical position between India and China adds complexity, with China increasing its influence in Nepal, which has implications for India's foreign policy.

Domestically, Nepal faces challenges such as political instability, economic pressures, and the emigration of its youth for employment. Prachanda's government must address these issues while balancing the delicate foreign relations with its neighbors. The article also touches on the broader regional implications, including India's role and the perspectives of other countries on immigration and xenophobia.

			<title>How the Karnataka government has justified its hookah ban</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/karnataka-government-hookah-ban-9218153/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka health department issued a notification on February 7, banning the sale and consumption of hookahs to protect public health. The notification cited violations of fire safety laws and potential risks to food safety, with penalties under the COTPA Act and other laws. Following this, the Karnataka government introduced and passed a bill on February 20 and 21, respectively, amending the COTPA Act to prohibit hookah bars, punishable by 1 to 3 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to 1 lakh rupees.

Several restaurant owners challenged the notification in the Karnataka High Court, arguing that the health department overstepped its authority and that the notification infringed on the rights of business owners as per the Constitution. They contended that hookah smoking is not banned under COTPA if done in designated smoking areas and that the ban unfairly targets hookah activities while ignoring other tobacco products.

The state government defended its authority to issue the ban, citing its responsibility for public health and sanitation under the State List of the Constitution, as well as executive power granted by Article 162 and the duty to prohibit consumption of harmful substances under Article 47. The government also claimed that hookah bars did not have designated smoking areas, which are required to be separate from eating areas. The amendment to the COTPA introduced by Karnataka, similar to those in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu, explicitly prohibits the operation of hookah bars. The case's judgment was reserved on March 11, and the outcome is pending.</description>

			<title>Is it illegal to watch child pornography? SC hears petition</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/illegal-watch-child-pornography-9218160/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has agreed to hear a plea challenging a Madras High Court order that stated merely downloading and watching child pornography is not an offence under the POCSO Act and the IT Act. The plea was filed by two child welfare NGOs, expressing concern that the ruling could negatively impact child welfare. The Supreme Court has issued notice on the plea and scheduled further hearing.

The Madras High Court had quashed proceedings against a man booked under the POCSO and IT Acts for downloading child pornography, stating that the acts do not cover mere downloading and watching without further action. The court highlighted the need for education over punishment for "Generation Z" children facing porn addiction and suggested counseling for the accused.

The ruling also discussed the distinction between pornography and child pornography, with the latter being punishable under Section 67-B of the IT Act, which covers various acts related to child pornography. The Madras High Court's previous ruling in 2021 held that even viewing child pornography is an offence, contrary to the private viewing of adult pornography, which is not prohibited by law.

			<title>Model Code of Conduct comes into force: What does it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/model-code-of-conduct-meaning-9217638/</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced that the Lok Sabha elections will be held in seven phases from April 19 to June 1, with results declared on June 4. This triggers the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), which includes guidelines for political parties and candidates to ensure free and fair elections. The MCC prohibits the government from announcing new policies and using official resources for campaigning. It also mandates equal opportunity for all political parties in terms of public meeting spaces and facilities.

The MCC is enforced through moral sanction rather than legal provisions, and the ECI can issue notices for alleged breaches, requiring a written response from the concerned party or individual. Notable incidents of MCC violations include notices issued to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in 2023 and actions taken against Amit Shah and Azam Khan during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. The MCC aims to provide a campaign-free environment for voters to reflect before voting and is crucial for the integrity of the electoral process.</description>

			<title>Are pulse oximeters biased? Behind racial bias in health technology</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/pulse-oximeter-biased-health-technology-risk-racial-9217433/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the findings of a UK government-commissioned study on racial bias in medical devices, particularly pulse oximeters. The study, led by Professor Dame Margaret Whitehead, identified a significant potential for racial bias in medical devices, which could lead to patient harm if not addressed. The bias arises from devices being modeled, developed, and tested based on a "standard patient" profile, which is typically a white, male, affluent individual born in the UK.

The report highlights that optical medical devices like pulse oximeters can be affected by factors such as skin pigmentation and other physical characteristics, leading to incorrect readings for racial minorities. AI-assisted devices and polygenic risk scores also show similar biases due to a lack of diverse data sets. The study points out that major genetic datasets used are predominantly based on people of European ancestry, limiting their applicability to other ancestries.

Evidence of harm from such biases has been observed in the US healthcare system, where racial bias in pulse oximeters has been linked to delayed disease recognition and treatment, worse organ function, and higher mortality rates among Black patients compared to White patients. The article also notes that technological discrimination is not limited to medical devices but extends to other areas like facial recognition software and no-touch faucets.

The UK government has accepted all recommendations from the study, which call for the inclusion of more diverse data in medical device development, transparency about device limitations, continuous monitoring by regulators, and feedback from the public and healthcare providers to improve the technology.</description>

			<title>Why has India developed an atmospheric testbed near Bhopal?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/india-atmospheric-testbed-bhopal-significance-9215690/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the inauguration of the first phase of India's Atmospheric Research Testbed in Central India (ART-CI) at Silkheda, Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh. Funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, ART-CI is equipped with 25 high-end meteorological instruments to study cloud processes during the monsoon over the Monsoon Core Zone (MCZ). The facility will enhance understanding of the Indian monsoon by providing ground-based and in-situ observations of weather parameters and transient synoptic systems like low-pressure areas and depressions from the Bay of Bengal.

The data collected will be used to improve weather models for more accurate rainfall predictions, crucial for the agriculture sector, which employs 45% of India's labor force. The southwest monsoon, accounting for 70% of India's annual rainfall, is vital for Kharif cultivation. ART-CI will also help in calibrating satellite-based observations for weather forecasting.

The second phase of ART-CI will include additional instruments like radar wind profilers and radiosondes. The facility's location in Silkheda is strategic for monitoring rain-bearing systems and is free from pollutants, making it ideal for meteorological research. Instruments like aethalometers, cloud radars, and doppler weather radars will provide continuous observations, aiding in better rainfall forecasts and helping farmers plan their activities. The establishment of ART-CI is a response to the need for more precise weather predictions amidst changing rainfall patterns due to climate change.</description>

			<title>Why self-censorship of political speech could be the future normal for AI platforms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/censorship-political-speech-ai-platforms-elections-9215504/</link>
			<description>In the context of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in India, Google has announced restrictions on election-related queries to its AI chatbot Gemini. This move is seen as a precaution to ensure high-quality information and avoid political controversy. Similarly, the Indian AI chatbot Krutrim has implemented self-censorship on sensitive political keywords. These developments highlight the challenges AI platforms face in balancing free speech with political correctness and avoiding government displeasure.

The article also discusses the broader implications of such censorship, with experts suggesting that self-censorship may become standard practice for AI platforms globally. The background of Google's decision includes recent controversies over Gemini's responses, including inaccuracies in historical image generation and differing answers to questions about world leaders. In response, the Indian government has advised AI companies to fine-tune their systems and issued an advisory requiring government clearance for deploying AI systems, raising questions about regulatory overreach.

The article concludes with insights from industry executives who believe that generative AI platforms should focus on creativity rather than factual accuracy, especially in politically sensitive areas. They suggest that specialized AI platforms may be more effective than a single platform attempting to excel at all tasks. The article also briefly mentions Vidhu Vinod Chopra's decision to cast Sanjay Dutt in Munna Bhai, despite industry reservations, leading to the film's success and subsequent projects about Dutt's life.</description>

			<title>What it will take to have simultaneous elections in India: Unpacking the Kovind committee report</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kovind-committee-report-simultaneous-elections-details-9215013/</link>
			<description>The High Level Committee on One Nation, One Election, led by former President Ram Nath Kovind, has submitted a report to President Droupadi Murmu recommending simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies. To implement this, the committee suggests 15 constitutional amendments through two bills.

**The first bill** focuses on transitioning to simultaneous elections and outlines procedures for early elections if needed. It introduces a new Article 82A, detailing the process and timing of simultaneous elections and the role of the Election Commission of India (ECI). It also proposes expanding Parliament's powers under Article 327 to include the conduct of simultaneous elections.

**The second bill** addresses municipal and panchayat elections and proposes the creation of a Single Electoral Roll by the ECI. This bill requires ratification by more than half of India's states as it involves state subjects.

The report also recommends amendments to laws governing legislative Assemblies in Union Territories to align their elections with the proposed system. Additionally, it suggests adding new sub-clauses to Article 325 for a unified electoral roll to be managed by the ECI, reducing the role of State Election Commissions to a consultative one.

The committee's recommendations aim to synchronize national, state, and local body elections, potentially streamlining the electoral process and reducing the frequency of elections across the country. However, these changes would require significant legal and constitutional adjustments.</description>

			<title>Ratification by states: What it will take to make One Nation One Election panel’s view legally tenable</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/ratification-states-panel-view-legally-tenable-9215031/</link>
			<description>The High Level Committee on One Nation, One Election, led by former President Ram Nath Kovind, has proposed significant legal changes to enable simultaneous elections in India. These include **15 constitutional amendments** and alterations to statutes governing Union Territories. The committee suggests that the President could initiate the process for simultaneous polls as early as June by declaring an "appointed date" for the first sitting of the House of the People after a general election.

The report indicates that while some constitutional amendments for aligning Assembly and Lok Sabha elections do not require state ratification, others, such as those for a common electoral roll and synchronizing local body elections with national polls, do. Article 368 outlines the amendment process, with varying requirements for a simple majority, a special majority, and in some cases, ratification by at least half of the state legislatures.

The committee asserts that the power to conduct Assembly elections primarily rests with Parliament, not the states, and therefore, the amendments needed for simultaneous elections do not need state ratification. However, this position could be subject to judicial review, as past Supreme Court rulings have struck down constitutional amendments not ratified by states when required.

The article also briefly mentions political developments, including the anticipation among Congress leaders for candidate announcements for the Nehru-Gandhi family's traditional seats and campaign activities by Prime Minister Modi and AAP's Sunita Kejriwal. However, these are separate from the main focus on the legal framework for simultaneous elections.</description>

			<title>Mumbai Central station could be named after Nana Jagannath Shankarseth: who was this social reformer celebrated as ‘architect’ of Mumbai?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mumbai-central-named-after-nana-jagannath-shankarseth-who-was-he-9214447/</link>
			<description>The Maharashtra cabinet has proposed renaming Mumbai Central station to honor Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, a significant figure in Mumbai's history known for his contributions to education, infrastructure, and social reform. Shankarseth, inspired by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, was a philanthropist who donated land for educational institutions, including the precursor to Elphinstone College, and played a key role in establishing Grant Medical College. He also contributed to the city's cultural heritage by supporting the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum and building temples.

In the realm of transportation, Shankarseth was instrumental in the launch of India's first train service. His legacy has been recognized sporadically, with tributes and a bust, but recent political moves aim to further commemorate his contributions by renaming several Mumbai railway stations with Indian heroes' names, reflecting a push towards cultural nationalism ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. This initiative is part of a broader effort to replace colonial names and celebrate Indian heritage.</description>

			<title>Is One Nation, One Election unconstitutional? How Kovind report addresses concerns</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-nation-one-election-kovind-report-concerns-9214446/</link>
			<description>The High-level Committee on One Nation, One Election, led by former President Ram Nath Kovind, presented an extensive report to President Droupadi Murmu. The report addresses concerns about the constitutionality and impact of simultaneous elections. It clarifies that:

1. **Simultaneous elections are not unconstitutional** as they do not necessarily require fixed terms to be altered, and past dissolutions of assemblies have occurred within constitutional bounds.

2. **They do not violate democratic principles** but rather optimize resource use and governance, without infringing on citizens' rights to vote.

3. **Federalism is not undermined** as the Constitution grants both Parliament and states the authority to manage elections, and simultaneous elections would not interfere with these rights.

4. **The issue of a hung Parliament/Assembly** can be managed as per the Sarkaria Commission's recommendations, ensuring the government has the House's confidence.

The report aims to address the challenges and uphold the integrity of the electoral process while enhancing governance efficiency.</description>

			<title>Einstein’s birth anniversary: When the scientist wrote to Nehru for support on Israel, and he refused</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/when-einstein-wrote-to-nehru-israel-9214388/</link>
			<description>The article commemorates Albert Einstein's birth anniversary and delves into his involvement in the political issues of his time, particularly the establishment of Israel. Einstein, a Jewish scientist, had to flee Nazi Germany and take US citizenship. He supported Zionism and the creation of Israel for persecuted Jews, seeking a "reasonable agreement with the Arabs." In 1947, as the UN was deciding Israel's fate, Einstein wrote to India's leader, Jawaharlal Nehru, urging support for Israel. Nehru responded with sympathy for the Jews but declined support due to concerns over Arab rights and the potential for violence.

Einstein praised India's abolition of untouchability and equated the plight of Jews to that of the untouchables. He highlighted the Jews' development work in Palestine, transforming the land without exploiting native workers. Nehru acknowledged the Jews' achievements but questioned their failure to win Arab goodwill and opposed imposing solutions against the will of the concerned parties. He also criticized British rule in Palestine for complicating the resolution of conflicts.

The article concludes with the historical outcome at the UN, where India voted against the partition of Palestine, reflecting its own partition experience, sympathy for Palestinians, and opposition to Western-backed division of nations. It also briefly mentions current political developments in India, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>BJP and simultaneous elections: An idea the party first proposed in 1984</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bjp-and-simultaneous-elections-an-idea-the-party-first-proposed-in-1984-9213970/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the BJP's long-standing advocacy for simultaneous elections to multiple levels of government, a concept recently endorsed by a high-level committee. This idea, along with a single voter list, has been a part of the BJP's manifesto since 1984 and has been promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The 1984 manifesto also introduced ideas like EVMs and voter ID cards, which are now standard. Despite these reforms, the BJP won only 2 seats in the 1984 elections dominated by Congress.

Subsequent manifestos have reiterated these ideas, with the 2014 manifesto focusing on eliminating criminality in elections and revising spending limits. The 2019 manifesto emphasized simultaneous elections and a unified voter list to reduce confusion. The article also touches on the evolution of corporate contributions to political parties, with the BJP initially opposing and later supporting such funding.

Other electoral reforms proposed by the BJP include compulsory voting, empowering the Election Commission, and setting spending limits. The party also aimed to strengthen the anti-defection law and introduce a comprehensive Electoral Reforms Bill. The 1999 manifesto proposed a fixed five-year term for elected bodies and considered a 'Constructive vote of Non-Confidence' system.

			<title>Pi Day: Behind the world’s most famous mathematical constant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pi-day-mathematical-constant-9212751/</link>
			<description>Pi Day, celebrated on March 14, honors the mathematical constant Pi (π), known for representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This day, initiated in 1988 by physicist Larry Shaw, promotes mathematics through various activities and was recognized by UNESCO as the International Day of Mathematics in 2019.

Pi is an irrational number, approximated as 3.14 or 22/7, and has been significant for over 4,000 years. Ancient civilizations like the Babylonians and Egyptians had their own approximations of Pi. Archimedes developed a method to calculate Pi that was used until the 17th century, involving inscribed and circumscribed polygons around a circle.

The pursuit of Pi's precise value continued with mathematicians like Christoph Grienberger and Ludolph van Ceulen, who calculated Pi to many decimal places, albeit laboriously. Isaac Newton later simplified Pi's calculation using calculus, and modern computers have now computed Pi to 31 trillion decimal places.

Pi's practical applications are vast, from architecture to engineering, and it plays a role in understanding the universe's deepest workings. While calculating Pi to extreme precision may seem less practical, the quest reflects the intrinsic value of knowledge and the allure of Pi's infinite, patternless nature, embodying the order of a perfect circle. Mathematicians' fascination with Pi continues as it remains a fundamental element in solving complex real-world problems.</description>

			<title>Financial implications of Congress Nari Nyay promises</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/financial-implications-of-congress-nari-nyay-promises-9213129/</link>
			<description>The Indian National Congress has announced a set of five promises aimed at empowering women, reminiscent of their 2019 election manifesto. The key proposals include:

1. **Mahalakshmi Scheme**: A yearly transfer of **Rs 1 lakh** to a woman from a poor family, with the exact number of families to be determined.
2. **Government Vacancies**: Reserving **50%** of all government job vacancies for women.
3. **Salary Contribution**: Doubling the central government's contribution to the salaries of **Asha, Anganwadi workers**, and **mid-day meal cooks**.
4. **Legal Counsellors**: Appointing legal counsellors for women's rights in every panchayat, though the financial implications are unclear.
5. **Working Women's Hostels**: Building hostels for working women in each district, with operating costs potentially covered by the residents.

Economists have provided various estimates for the financial outlay of these promises, factoring in India's poverty ratios and GDP. The Mahalakshmi scheme's outgo could range from **0.4% to 0.8%** of the GDP, depending on the poverty ratio considered. The financial impact of doubling salaries for social welfare workers is considered small relative to the GDP, and the costs for legal counsellors and hostels are yet to be estimated. The article also discusses the variability in India's poverty estimates and the challenges in calculating the exact financial burden of these promises. The unrelated content and advertisements in the article have been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>What makes Ludwig Göransson, the Oscar winner for ‘Oppenheimer’, a distinctive composer of our time</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/ludwig-goransson-oscars-oppenheimer-music-style-9212290/</link>
			<description>Ludwig Göransson, the Swedish composer, has won the Best Original Score at the 96th Academy Awards for his work on Christopher Nolan's film "Oppenheimer." The film, set in the 1940s, explores the Manhattan Project and the ethical dilemmas faced by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Göransson's score, which is his second Academy Award win after "Black Panther," uses a mix of electronic instrumentation, strings, bells, and violins to reflect the film's themes.

Born in Linköping, Sweden, Göransson was named after Ludwig Beethoven and showed an early interest in music, influenced by heavy metal and film soundtracks. His professional career began after studying at the Royal College of Scotland and the University of Southern California, where he met filmmaker Ryan Coogler. Göransson's success came with scoring for Coogler's films, including "Fruitvale Station," "Creed," "Black Panther," and the TV series "The Mandalorian."

Göransson's approach to scoring involves blending classic orchestration with modern electronic production, creating distinctive sounds for franchise films. His work on "Creed" and "The Mandalorian" showcases his ability to add contemporary elements to established musical styles. For "Black Panther," he researched African music, incorporating traditional instruments into the soundtrack.

When Hans Zimmer declined to score Nolan's "Tenet," Göransson stepped in, creating a soundtrack with retrograde melodies fitting the film's time-travel theme. For "Oppenheimer," Nolan encouraged Göransson to capture the essence of the protagonist through the violin, resulting in a soundtrack that balances the beauty of science with the ominous implications of the atomic bomb. The film's climactic nuclear test scene is marked by silence, amplifying the impact of Göransson's earlier compositions.</description>

			<title>Explained: India’s first indigenous Fast Breeder Reactor begins ‘core loading’, why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-first-indigenous-fast-breeder-reactor-kalpakkam-nuclear-9212492/</link>
			<description>India's nuclear power program has reached a significant milestone with the commencement of core loading at the country's first indigenous Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. This step is crucial for the second stage of India's three-stage nuclear program, which aims to utilize the country's thorium reserves to generate electricity. The FBR, once operational, will make India the second country after Russia to have a commercial operating FBR.

The Department of Atomic Energy's vision for the program is to convert fertile material, such as thorium, into fissile material for use in nuclear reactors. The FBR is a key component in this process, as it will allow for the efficient use of plutonium and the eventual full utilization of thorium. The program consists of three stages: the first involves Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), the second includes FBRs to multiply fissile material, and the third will focus on the ThU233 cycle using an Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR).

The FBR will initially use Uranium-Plutonium Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel and is designed to produce more fuel than it consumes through nuclear transmutation. The capital and per-unit electricity costs of this advanced technology are comparable to other nuclear and conventional power plants. The India-US civil nuclear deal has facilitated the import of uranium, accelerating India's nuclear program. By 2032, the Department of Atomic Energy aims to significantly increase the share of nuclear power in the energy mix, with plans to construct new PHWRs in 'fleet mode'. The progress on the FBR marks a visible transition to the third phase of the program, paving the way for the commercial utilization of thorium.</description>

			<title>Why Karnataka has banned food colouring used in gobhi manchurian and cotton candy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/karnataka-banned-food-colouring-gobhi-manchurian-cotton-candy-9212010/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government has taken a significant step to ban the use of harmful artificial colouring agents in popular snacks like gobhi manchurian and cotton candy. This decision comes after tests revealed the presence of prohibited colours, including Rhodamine B, in a substantial number of samples. The health minister emphasized the potential long-term health risks, including cancer, associated with these artificial colours. Violators of this ban face severe penalties, including imprisonment and hefty fines.

Rhodamine B, the chemical in question, is not approved for food use and is typically used in textile and plastic industries. It poses risks of acute toxicity and can cause eye and respiratory irritation. Although not classified as carcinogenic to humans, some animal studies suggest otherwise. The misuse of such dyes is attributed to a lack of awareness among small vendors, particularly in smaller cities.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India permits only a limited palette of natural and synthetic colours for food products, with specific restrictions on their use in different food items. The move by the Karnataka government aligns with these regulations to ensure food safety and public health.</description>

			<title>Is there a bubble in small stocks? What should investors do?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/small-stocks-mid-caps-bubble-investors-markets-9211542/</link>
			<description>The article discusses concerns about potential bubbles in the stocks of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) listed on Indian stock exchanges. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has observed signs of price manipulation in SME IPOs and trading, and the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) has advised fund managers to protect investors' interests. SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch acknowledged the signs of manipulation but noted that building a case requires time due to regulatory processes.

In 2023, SME IPOs saw a significant increase in funds raised compared to 2022, and the trend continued in the early months of 2024. The NSE and BSE have established SME platforms to facilitate the transition of unorganized sector SMEs to the organized sector, with the possibility of migrating to the Main Board as they grow.

Analysts have raised alarms over the high valuations of small and mid-cap stocks, which have seen substantial price increases and inflows from investors. This surge is much higher than the growth of the benchmark Nifty 50 index. AMFI and SEBI have taken steps to moderate the flow of money into small-cap stocks and ensure policies are in place to protect all investors from potential market corrections.

The article also highlights the overvaluation of the small-cap segment, with analysts suggesting caution and the possibility of a significant market correction in the near future. SEBI plans to introduce more risk disclosures for SME IPOs, and experts advise investors to be wary of overvalued small and mid-cap stocks, suggesting that the current market exuberance may not be sustainable. The article concludes with various opinions on the state of the Indian market and its valuation.</description>

			<title>CAA rules out: How Constituent Assembly debated the questions of citizenship, tying it to religion</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/caa-how-constituent-assembly-debated-citizenship-9210481/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) in India, which grants citizenship to migrants from specific religious communities who entered India before December 31, 2014, from Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Bangladesh. The CAA has been controversial as it links citizenship to religion, a departure from previous laws. The debates in the Constituent Assembly over 70 years ago are echoed in the current arguments for and against the CAA, particularly regarding whether Hindus and Sikhs should have a natural home in India. Some members of the Assembly argued for inclusive citizenship rights, while others were concerned about the potential for demographic changes in Assam due to migration. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed criticisms of the government's policies, emphasizing justice and equity over appeasement and defending the secular nature of the state. The article also briefly mentions filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra's reflections on his career and collaborations with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Rajkumar Hirani.</description>

			<title>The CAA Rules, unpacked</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/caa-rules-eligibility-minorities-refugees-9210464/</link>
			<description>The Centre has notified the rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was passed in December 2019. The CAA facilitates citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014. The law presumes these individuals faced religious persecution and reduces the naturalization period from 11 years to five.

Significant relaxations in the rules include the elimination of the requirement for a valid passport and Residential Permit. Now, various documents such as birth certificates, educational certificates, or any identity document from the countries of origin can be used to prove citizenship and religion.

The process for granting citizenship has been centralized, with the introduction of an Empowered Committee and District Level Committees (DLC) by the Centre, which will process applications electronically. This minimizes the role of state governments in the process.

Historically, steps towards easing citizenship for migrants from these countries began in 2002, with subsequent relaxations in rules over the years, leading up to the CAA. The government has provided various benefits to these migrants, allowing them to work, start businesses, and access other civic amenities.

			<title>Explained: The Laken Riley murder case, which triggered a Trump-Biden war of words</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/laken-riley-murder-trump-biden-immigration-speech-9210046/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a politically charged case involving the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia. President Joe Biden mentioned Riley's case in his State of the Union speech, mispronouncing her name and referring to the suspect as an "illegal," a term he later regretted using due to its negative connotations. The suspect, Jose Antonio Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, was apprehended after Riley's body was found on the University of Georgia campus. The case has been seized upon by Republican leaders, including former President Donald Trump and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, as an example of the dangers of illegal immigration. The article also touches on the broader political debate over immigration policies in the U.S., highlighting the passage of the Laken Riley Act, which mandates the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with theft, and the increasing number of border encounters. The case has become a flashpoint in the ongoing election cycle, with immigration as a key issue. The article concludes with a mention of the misuse of the phrase "Say Her Name" by Greene, originally intended to address systemic issues related to Black women and policing in the U.S. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>One missile, many weapons: What makes the latest Agni-5 special</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-missile-many-weapons-what-makes-the-latest-agni-v-special-9208831/</link>
			<description>India has successfully tested the Agni-5 missile, now integrated with MIRV technology, allowing it to carry multiple warheads and hit different targets. This marks a significant advancement in India's missile capabilities, enhancing its nuclear deterrence with the ability to inflict multiple damages simultaneously. MIRV technology, developed in the 1960s, enables missiles to carry several miniaturized, independently guided warheads, making it difficult for missile defense systems to intercept. India's Agni-5 can carry three to four warheads and has a range over 5,000 km, potentially qualifying as an intercontinental missile. The DRDO is also developing the Agni-P and the next-generation Agni-6 with expected MIRV integration. This development is seen as a strategic move in response to similar advancements by China and Pakistan. The test was conducted from Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Island, with DRDO confirming the mission's success.</description>

			<title>CAA: Issues in the legal challenge to the law</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/caa-issues-in-the-legal-challenge-to-the-law-9208839/</link>
			<description>The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), which was passed by the Indian Parliament in December 2019 and led to widespread protests, has had its rules notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs for implementation. The CAA amends the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide a pathway for citizenship to migrants from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, or Christian communities who entered India from Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Bangladesh before December 31, 2014. It excludes Muslim-majority areas in the Northeast and is under challenge in the Supreme Court on the grounds that it violates Article 14 of the Constitution, which ensures equality before the law. The Supreme Court is yet to hear the case after final hearings were scheduled to begin in December 2022. The government defends the exclusion of Muslims by stating that the three countries are Islamic nations where Muslims are in the majority. The court will examine whether the CAA's classification is reasonable under Article 14 and whether it discriminates against Muslims. Additionally, the fate of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, which is linked to the Assam Accord and determines who is a foreigner in Assam, is also under challenge and awaiting a verdict from the Supreme Court. The CAA's implementation could conflict with the Assam Accord if the cut-off date for entry into Assam is upheld by the court. The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Electoral bonds: ‘Matching’ code may be missing, but petitioners hope for ‘quid pro quo’ trends</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/electoral-bonds-matching-code-may-be-missing-but-petitioners-hope-for-quid-pro-quo-trends-9208829/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the upcoming public release of data on electoral bonds by the Election Commission of India (ECI), which will include details of bonds issued between April 12, 2019, and February 15, 2024. The data, provided by the State Bank of India (SBI), will be in two lists: one detailing the purchase of bonds, including dates, purchaser names, and denominations, and the other showing details of bonds encashed by political parties.

A key point of contention is the unique alphanumeric code on each bond, which is not expected to be made public. This code, a security feature, was not recorded in the SBI system, making it impossible to match donors with political parties. However, petitioners in the Supreme Court case are hopeful that the data will provide enough evidence to establish quid pro quo relationships between donors and parties.

Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), expects the SBI to release the unique numbers assigned to the data, which would allow voters to see who is funding whom. The Supreme Court has stated that SBI does not need to match the data, but others could potentially do so later.

ADR's founding member, Jagdeep Chhokar, anticipates that the data will reveal broad funding trends and possible quid pro quos, especially when correlating the dates of bond purchases with government policy changes or actions by investigative agencies.

The Supreme Court has also ordered the ECI to make public the data on bonds sold and encashed before April 12, 2019, which was previously submitted in a sealed cover. Commodore Lokesh Batra (Retd), an RTI activist, believes that the court's decision to disclose all political parties' receipts will allow for easy matching of the data provided by political parties and the SBI.

The article concludes with a brief mention of the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan, wife of BJD leader V K Pandian, from the Mission Shakti department to a non-public facing department following allegations of misuse of public office. The BJP has accused her of using the Mission Shakti scheme to influence voters. The authors of the article, Damini Nath and Ritu Sarin, are noted for their extensive experience in journalism and investigative reporting.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: Why do global sea surface temperatures matter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-global-sea-surface-temperatures-matter-9208281/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the record-breaking global sea surface temperature (SST) for February 2024, which was reported to be the highest since 1979. It explores the reasons behind the warming oceans, such as greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution and other factors like El Niño and reduced dust from the Sahara Desert. The consequences of rising ocean temperatures include increased ocean stratification, reduced carbon dioxide absorption, threatened marine ecosystems, and more intense storms. The article emphasizes the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate these effects. It is part of a series explaining fundamental questions about climate change and its impact.</description>

			<title>PM Modi announces Mission Divyastra success: What is the Agni-5 missile with MIRV technology</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/pm-modi-mission-divyastra-agni-5-mirv-9208303/</link>
			<description>India has successfully tested the Agni-5 missile, equipped with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle (MIRV) technology, which allows it to carry and deliver multiple warheads to different targets simultaneously. This advancement, named Mission Divyastra, enhances India's strategic defense capabilities, particularly against China, by enabling a single missile to target multiple locations that can be hundreds of kilometers apart. The Agni-5 missile, which can carry nuclear warheads, has a range exceeding 5,000 km, categorizing it as a long-range missile.

The Agni missile family, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), has been part of India's arsenal since the early 1990s. The MIRV technology is complex and was first developed five decades ago, with only a few countries possessing it. The Agni-5 missile has undergone multiple successful tests since 2012, with the latest test conducted off the coast of Odisha in December 2022.

The development of MIRV-equipped missiles is seen as a strategic move to maintain a balance of power in the region, especially in the context of India's rivalry with China. It is also considered a force multiplier, potentially reducing the number of missiles required for defense. The MIRV technology is particularly lethal because it allows for the release of multiple warheads at different speeds and directions, making it a significant addition to India's defense capabilities.</description>

			<title>Meet Raj Kapoor, today’s Oscars showman</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/meet-raj-kapoor-todays-oscars-showman-9208170/</link>
			<description>The 96th Oscars had a significant Indian connection with **Raj Kapoor**, a Delhi-born Canadian, serving as the executive producer and showrunner. Alongside him, **Katy Mullan** was the executive producer, and **Hamish Hamilton** directed the event. Kapoor, who has been producing shows for 24 years and is a University of Alberta graduate, described his role in the Oscars as a dream come true. The Academy praised Kapoor and his team for their deep love of cinema and expertise in live television, which contributed to the refreshed Oscars ceremony.

Kapoor's career highlights include six Emmy nominations, with a win for 'Adele: One Night Only'. His work spans various prestigious events like the Grammy Awards and 'Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration'. Ujwal Nirgudkar, an Oscar Academy member, expressed his happiness for Kapoor's success as the executive producer of the 96th Oscars.

The article also briefly mentions an upcoming IPL 2024 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals, with the latter leading the points table. However, this part seems unrelated to the main content about the Oscars.</description>

			<title>Why are the Academy Awards called Oscars – from a librarian to an actress, the claims behind the name</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/oscars-academy-awards-name-reason-9207844/</link>
			<description>The 96th Academy Awards, known as the Oscars, have a rich history dating back to their inception in 1927. The name "Oscar" itself is shrouded in mystery, with several theories about its origin. The official statuette, designed by MGM's Cedric Gibbons, led to the need for a more colloquial name by the mid-1930s. Various names were suggested and used briefly, but "Oscar" eventually stuck.

Bruce Davis, former Executive Director of the Academy, explores the possible origins of the name in his book. He dismisses Bette Davis's claim that she named it after her husband, as the name was in use before her win. Margaret Herrick's story of likening the statuette to her Uncle Oscar is also questionable, as there's no proof she had such an uncle. Sidney Skolsky's claim of coining the term out of disdain for the official term "statuette" is also doubtful.

Davis suggests Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary at the Academy with Norwegian roots, as another possible source. The nickname "Oscar" was eventually embraced by the Academy by 1939, and Lilleberg's contribution, though unacknowledged, was recognized internally.

The article concludes with an unrelated update on an upcoming IPL 2024 match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals.</description>

			<title>Why did SC reject SBI’s application for extension of time to submit details on electoral bonds?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-sbis-application-extension-electoral-bonds-9207859/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to provide details of donations made to political parties through Electoral Bonds to the Election Commission of India (ECI) without delay. The SBI's request for an extension to provide this information was denied, and the ECI is to publish the details on its website. The SBI had sought more time to comply with the court's order to disclose the details of bond purchasers and the political parties that received the funds, claiming that the data was maintained separately and matching them would be time-consuming. However, the court, led by Chief Justice Chandrachud, insisted that the information was readily available and should be provided promptly. The contempt petitions filed against the SBI's delay were dismissed, but the court warned that contempt proceedings could be re-initiated if SBI failed to meet the new deadline. Additionally, the Election Commission ordered the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department due to allegations of misuse of public office for electoral gain.</description>

			<title>In Gujarat, harnessing the value of dung to boost farmers’ income</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/in-gujarat-harnessing-the-value-of-dung-to-boost-farmers-income-9206961/</link>
			<description>India's first BioCNG station in Gujarat's Banaskantha district is a pioneering project that converts cattle dung into compressed biogas (CBG), serving as a sustainable fuel alternative. The station, operated by the Banaskantha District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union, processes 40 tonnes of dung daily to produce 550-600 kg of BioCNG, which is sold to vehicles on the Deesa-Tharad highway. The process involves anaerobic digestion in a sealed reactor, where organic matter from dung is broken down to produce biogas, which is then purified and compressed for use as fuel.

The project not only provides fuel but also generates bio-fertilizer from the residual slurry, which is separated into solid and liquid forms. The solid is sold as phosphate-rich organic manure or compost, while the liquid is reused in the digester or sold as liquid fermented organic manure. The Union's revenue from bio-fertilizer sales surpasses that from BioCNG.

The success of the BioCNG plant, operational since August 2020, has led to plans for expanding the model with four more plants by 2025, supported by Suzuki Motor Corporation. This model is deemed replicable and scalable, with potential for additional income for dairy farmers through the sale of dung.

In a decentralized approach, the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union has installed Flexi Biogas plants for individual farmers, allowing them to produce biogas for cooking and sell excess slurry as bio-fertilizer, further enhancing their income. The government subsidy makes this an affordable solution for farmers, contributing to the overall growth of sustainable energy practices in the dairy industry.</description>

			<title>Meant to reduce stress on big cats, why safari parks may be a double-edged sword</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/tiger-safari-corbett-tiger-reserve-uttarakhand-hc-supreme-court-nahargarh-biological-park-9206962/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has expressed its inclination to approve a Tiger Safari at Pakhrau in the buffer area of Corbett tiger reserve, specifically for local tigers that are injured, conflicted, or orphaned. The court has also tasked the CBI with completing an investigation into alleged irregularities within the Corbett reserve within three months. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, requires prior approval for construction within sanctuaries, and the concept of a tiger safari was first introduced in NTCA's 2012 guidelines. However, the NTCA's 2019 amendment allowing zoo animals in safari parks has been criticized for potentially endangering wild tigers and contradicting conservation efforts. The article discusses the debate around tiger safaris, with arguments for them as a means to reduce tourism pressure and support local wildlife, while counter-arguments highlight the ineffectiveness of such measures and the ethical concerns of prioritizing individual welfare over species conservation. The article also touches on the specific case of the proposed Pakhrau Safari Park and the broader implications of establishing safari parks within tiger reserves. The Supreme Court has appointed a committee to draft guidelines for tiger safari parks, emphasizing the need for site-specific solutions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The article concludes with a brief profile of the author, Jay Mazoomdaar, an investigative reporter with a focus on various issues including natural resources and biodiversity conservation. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission's order has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Trade agreement with EFTA: Why it marks a shift, could be a template for bigger deals</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/trade-agreement-with-efta-why-it-marks-a-shift-could-be-a-template-for-bigger-deals-9207019/</link>
			<description>The India-EFTA trade deal, signed before the election dates announcement, is anchored on a **$100 billion investment** over 15 years from four Western European nations. It presents a simpler and more complementary agreement compared to ongoing negotiations with the UK and the EU. The EFTA deal, being the first with such an investment commitment, could become a model for future agreements with developed countries, offering them greater market access to India's high-tariff environment in exchange for investments.

Previous multilateral and bilateral negotiations, including RCEP and FTAs with the EU, UK, and Australia, were dropped due to resistance from Indian industries seeking protection. The EFTA deal resumed after prolonged talks. Plans for a trade deal with the GCC are complicated by member diversity and rising geopolitical tensions in West Asia.

Despite concerns about the legal framework's effectiveness in boosting private investment, the EFTA deal signals India's increased openness to business and investment, a stance that has been subdued for much of the past decade. However, the deal notably excludes pension and wealth funds from the investment commitment, which could have bolstered investor confidence. The agreement clarifies that sovereign wealth funds are not covered by the EFTA states' promotional obligations. Additionally, there's a mention of the Election Commission of India transferring Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misusing public office for electoral influence.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘A woman without education is like a banyan tree without roots or leaves’, by Savitribai Phule</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/woman-without-education-is-like-a-banyan-savitribai-phule-9206783/</link>
			<description>Savitribai Phule, a pioneering figure in women's education in India, is remembered for her relentless efforts to empower women through education amidst severe opposition. Born in a lower caste in 1831, she was married at 10 and later educated by her husband, Jyotirao Phule. Together, they founded India's first school for girls in Pune in 1848, facing backlash from conservative society and nationalists.

Despite the challenges, including being attacked with cow dung on her way to school, Savitribai persisted, carrying an extra saree to change into. Her famous quote, "A woman without education is like a banyan tree without roots or leaves," encapsulates her belief that education is essential for women to be strong and self-sufficient.

Savitribai's contributions extended beyond education; she and Jyotirao established the Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha for pregnant widows and their children and adopted a child who became a doctor. They also founded the Satyashodhak Samaj to support Dalits and women. Savitribai's death in 1897 during a plague outbreak while helping a sick child further highlights her dedication to social reform. Her legacy continues to inspire and shape the role of women in society.</description>

			<title>Centre signs pact with Tripura govt, TIPRA Motha: The demands, significance of the agreement</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/centre-pact-with-tripura-govt-tipra-motha-significance-9206628/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant tripartite agreement signed by the Centre, the Tripura government, and the TIPRA Motha, addressing the tribal population's demands in Tripura. The agreement, signed on March 2, aims to resolve issues related to economic, political, land, linguistic, and cultural rights within a set timeframe. This accord halted the indefinite fast by TIPRA Motha's founder, Pradyot Kishore Manikya Debbarma, and led to the party joining the BJP-led state government.

Key demands of the TIPRA Motha include the creation of a "Greater Tipraland" for tribals, enhanced powers for the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC), direct funding, a separate police force, and revenue sharing from state gas exploration. The party also seeks official recognition of the Roman script for the Kokborok language.

The agreement is seen as a partial victory by Pradyot Debbarma, who believes that unity and continued advocacy will lead to full achievement of their goals. The accord follows discussions with Home Minister Amit Shah and involves forming a joint working group to implement agreed-upon points.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah called the signing "historic," acknowledging past mistakes and the current reality. The agreement also includes a commitment from all parties to avoid protests and agitations.

The TIPRA Motha's decision to join the NDA and the appointment of its members as ministers have been criticized by opposition parties, but Pradyot asserts that his party will not remain silent on tribal rights and will exert pressure on the government through various channels.

The opposition has accused TIPRA Motha of abandoning its core demand for Greater Tipraland and criticized its quick agreement to the accord's terms. However, the party maintains its autonomy in decision-making.

The article concludes with a brief mention of the Indian Premier League, noting Ruturaj Gaikwad's achievement as the leading run scorer, surpassing Virat Kohli. However, this section is unrelated to the main content of the article.</description>

			<title>When Gandhi first met Tagore: The story of their friendship, despite disagreements</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/mahatma-gandhi-rabindranath-tagore-friendship-santiniketan-9206038/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the profound friendship and intellectual engagement between Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, which spanned from 1915 until Tagore's death in 1941. Their first meeting took place at Santiniketan, West Bengal, shortly after Gandhi's return from South Africa. This encounter led to a tradition at Santiniketan where the school commemorates 'Gandhi Punyaha Din' annually, reflecting Gandhi's influence on the institution.

Despite Tagore's global fame and Gandhi's emerging leadership, their relationship was marked by mutual respect and a willingness to debate. They held differing views on philosophical and ethical issues, as highlighted by their disagreement over the interpretation of a 1934 earthquake in Bihar. Gandhi saw it as divine retribution for the sin of untouchability, while Tagore challenged this view, advocating for a moral superiority of human nature over such providential acts.

Their debates extended to lighter matters as well, such as the health implications of eating fried puris. However, their disagreements never overshadowed their respect for each other, with Tagore referring to Gandhi as 'Mahatma' and Gandhi addressing Tagore as 'Gurudev.' Their correspondence reveals a deep-seated regard and a shared belief in spiritual independence and humanitarian values, despite their intellectual differences.

The article concludes with unrelated content about President Joe Biden's views on immigration and xenophobia, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Explained: Scientists release findings on possibly the second biggest man-made methane leak, ever</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/second-biggest-methane-kazakhstan-9205277/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant methane leak in Kazakhstan, which is considered one of the worst in history, releasing 127,000 tonnes of methane from June to December 2023. The leak was detected by satellite instruments and has since been stopped, with the well being sealed. The incident is underlined by the broader context of methane's role as a potent greenhouse gas and its contribution to global warming. The leak's environmental impact is likened to the emissions from over 717,000 petrol cars driven for a year. The article also mentions the need for rapid reductions in methane emissions to limit near-term warming and adhere to the Paris Agreement's temperature thresholds. It concludes with unrelated content regarding President Joe Biden's views on immigration and xenophobia.</description>

			<title>India to sign trade agreement with EFTA today: What is the significance of the deal?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-to-sign-trade-agreement-with-efta-today-what-is-the-significance-of-the-deal-9205526/</link>
			<description>India has signed a significant trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. This deal is expected to bring in **$100 billion** in investment over 15 years and aims to help India diversify its imports, reducing reliance on China. The agreement comes at a critical time when many countries, including India, are entering election periods, potentially slowing down the progress of free trade agreements (FTAs).

The deal is seen as a strategic move for India, which competes with other nations like Vietnam and Mexico as attractive investment destinations. However, there's a risk of missing out on geopolitical opportunities due to delays in streamlining investment flows. The India-EFTA deal could also widen India's trade gap, although it promises economic activity and job creation. It is expected to boost India's services sector and includes potential joint ventures in pharma, chemicals, food processing, and engineering sectors.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, part of the EFTA investment, has shown strong returns, particularly in technology stocks. Despite these positive aspects, concerns remain about the widening trade gap and the competition Indian goods will face due to Switzerland's decision to eliminate import duties on all industrial goods from 2024. Exporting agricultural produce to Switzerland is also challenging due to stringent tariffs and standards. The article concludes with unrelated content about Indian filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra's career reflections.</description>

			<title>An all-weather link to Tawang, Sela Tunnel boosts readiness at China border</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-all-weather-link-to-tawang-sela-tunnel-boosts-readiness-at-china-border-9205450/</link>
			<description>The Sela Tunnel, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a significant border infrastructure project that ensures year-round connectivity between Guwahati and the strategic Tawang sector, facilitating faster military movement to the LAC. Constructed at 13,000 feet by the BRO, the tunnel provides all-weather access to Tawang via the Sela Pass on the BCT Road, which is crucial for the Indian Army's IV Corps based in Tezpur, Assam. The tunnel will save nearly 10 km of travel, reducing convoy travel time by about an hour, and allow transportation of heavy artillery. It complements the Nechiphu tunnel, together reducing the distance by 15 km and bypassing weather-related challenges, thus enhancing military deployment capabilities to Tawang. This development is strategically important as Tawang is a contested region with China and holds military and historical significance for India. The Sela Tunnel, built using the new Austrian tunnelling method, represents a significant advancement in India's border infrastructure and operational preparedness.</description>

			<title>SC quashes FIR over Art 370 protest: How the court relied on the 1947 Justice Vivian Bose ruling</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-fir-whatsapp-1947-ruling-justice-vivian-bose-9204747/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India quashed an FIR against a Maharashtra college professor who was charged for his WhatsApp status that criticized the abrogation of Article 370 and wished Pakistan on its independence day. The court's decision was influenced by a 1947 Nagpur High Court judgment by Justice Vivian Bose, which established that the impact of words should be judged from the perspective of reasonable individuals.

The professor, Javed Ahmad Hajam, had posted messages on a WhatsApp group that were deemed objectionable, leading to his charge under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code, which penalizes actions that promote enmity between different groups. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the professor's actions were an expression of protest and did not reflect any intention to promote enmity or hatred, thus falling within his freedom of speech.

The ruling referenced historical judgments, particularly Justice Bose's standard that the effect of words must be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong-minded individuals, not those easily swayed. This principle has been upheld in various cases over the years, emphasizing the importance of democratic values and the right to free speech in India.

			<title>Why the Singapore government struck a ‘deal’ to host Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/singapore-deal-taylor-swift-eras-tour-9203760/</link>
			<description>Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has defended the exclusive deal made with Taylor Swift for her "The Eras Tour" to perform solely in Singapore within Southeast Asia. The tour, which began in March 2023, has been a massive success, grossing around $1 billion by December 2023. Despite its success, the deal has drawn criticism from neighboring countries like Thailand and the Philippines, with concerns over the incentives provided to Swift from Singapore's Tourism Development Fund.

The deal involved an estimated $2 million to $3 million per show for exclusivity, which has significantly boosted Singapore's economy, particularly in the hotel and tourism sectors. Ticket sales have soared, with prices reaching up to $1,000 due to resellers. The exclusivity has also attracted fans from across Asia, contributing to the local economy.

Despite the criticisms, other Southeast Asian countries are interested in hosting similar events, recognizing the economic benefits. The article also touches on the broader issue of global artists' tour locations, noting that choices are influenced by factors like infrastructure, government policies, and available services.

The article concludes with an unrelated segment about Indian filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra and actor Sanjay Dutt's collaboration on the film "Munna Bhai." Chopra shared the backstory of casting Dutt despite his industry ban and the subsequent success of the film and its sequels.</description>

			<title>The nature of ‘royalty’ case: How an alleged typographical error led to 9-judge SC case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/royalty-nine-judge-supreme-court-case-9203353/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is currently hearing a significant case that has been pending for over 9,044 days. The central issue is whether 'royalty' should be considered a tax. This question arose from a dispute over the interpretation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDRA), specifically whether states can impose additional taxes on mining activities beyond the royalties mandated by the Act.

The case dates back to 1963 when India Cement Ltd. was granted a mining lease and was required to pay royalties to the Tamil Nadu government. The state later imposed an additional cess on top of the royalties, which India Cement challenged, leading to a Supreme Court case in 1970. The argument centered around whether the state legislature had the authority to impose a tax on royalties.

In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of India Cement, stating that royalties are a form of tax and that the state legislature cannot impose additional taxes on them. However, a subsequent case in 2004 brought attention to a possible typographical error in the 1989 judgment, suggesting that the phrase "royalty is a tax" should have read "cess on royalty is a tax."

The current nine-judge bench is revisiting this issue to clarify whether royalties are indeed a tax and if states have the authority to levy additional taxes on mining activities. The arguments presented so far have highlighted the complexities of tax law and the division of powers between the central and state governments regarding mineral rights and taxation.

The case continues with further submissions from the involved parties, and its outcome could have significant implications for the mining industry and tax legislation in India. Additionally, there is a separate but related matter involving the Election Commission of India and allegations of misuse of public office, which is not directly connected to the main legal question at hand.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-ed-case-against-louise-wife-of-congress-leader-salman-khurshid-9203914/</link>
			<description>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has accused Louise Khurshid, wife of senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid, and two others of laundering Rs 71.50 lakh of government funds intended for disabled individuals. The ED has attached assets worth Rs 45.92 lakh, including agricultural land and bank deposits, belonging to the Dr Zakir Husain Memorial Trust, managed by the Khurshids. The funds were allegedly not used for sanctioned camps but were laundered for personal gain. Allegations first surfaced in 2012, and despite denials from the Khurshids, investigations led to FIRs and a charge sheet filed in 2019. The ED's provisional attachment order is pending confirmation, and further legal actions may follow if sufficient evidence is found.</description>

			<title>Is ghee a ‘livestock product’? Here’s what the Supreme Court said</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/ghee-livestock-product-supreme-court-andhra-9203363/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India recently upheld a decision that ghee is a product of livestock, affirming the Andhra Pradesh High Court's ruling. The issue arose from a 1994 notification by the Andhra Pradesh government, which was challenged by livestock producers. They argued that ghee, being a derivative of milk, should not be regulated as a livestock product and that the notification process was flawed. However, both the High Court and the Supreme Court dismissed these arguments, stating that ghee is indeed a product of livestock as it is derived from milk, which comes from livestock. The courts relied on the clear legislative intent of the Andhra Pradesh (Agricultural Produce and Livestock) Markets Act, 1966, which includes derivative items like ghee as livestock products. The Supreme Court also referenced a previous ruling to support its decision that all animal husbandry products are considered 'products of livestock'. The ruling allows market committees to levy fees on the sale and purchase of ghee. In an unrelated matter, the Election Commission of India transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan to a non-public facing department following allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Linking Aadhaar with voter ID: Why EC wants changes in electoral forms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/linking-aadhaar-with-voter-id-rules-explained-9201995/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing issue of linking Aadhaar numbers with voter IDs in India. It highlights a petition in the Supreme Court that points out the lack of clarity in voter registration forms regarding the voluntary nature of this linkage. The Election Commission of India (EC) proposed amendments to the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and voter enrolment forms to make it clear that providing Aadhaar details is not mandatory. However, the Union Law Ministry reportedly rejected these amendments.

The EC had initiated a drive in 2015 to link Aadhaar with the electoral rolls to eliminate fraudulent entries, which was halted after a Supreme Court ruling limited Aadhaar's use. In 2019, the EC proposed the linkage again, leading to the passing of the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which allowed voluntary Aadhaar linking starting July 2022.

A recent Supreme Court petition by a Congress leader from Telangana called for amendments to give electors the option not to link their Aadhaar with their voter ID. The EC suggested changes to the enrolment forms to reflect that Aadhaar submission is optional, but the government deemed further amendments unnecessary, stating that clarifications from the EC would suffice.

Additionally, the article mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan, the wife of a BJD leader, from a public-facing department due to allegations of misuse of her position to influence voters. The BJP has accused her of using the Mission Shakti scheme for electoral gains. The article's author, Damini Nath, is an Assistant Editor with The Indian Express, covering housing, urban affairs, and the Election Commission.</description>

			<title>Why do we celebrate Women’s Day on March 8?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/womens-day-march-8-significance-history-origin-9202335/</link>
			<description>International Women's Day, celebrated on March 8, was officially recognized by the United Nations in 1975. Its origins trace back to the first National Woman's Day in the U.S. on February 28, 1909, honoring the 1908 garment workers' strike in New York. This event was part of the broader First Wave of Feminism, which began in the mid-19th century and included significant campaigns for women's rights, such as the 1848 women's rights convention by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott.

Clara Zetkin, a leader in the German Social Democratic Party, proposed the idea of an International Women's Day in 1910, leading to the first rallies in 1911 with over one million participants across Europe. The date of March 8 became globally recognized due to its association with Russian women's protests on February 23, 1913 (Julian calendar), corresponding to March 8 on the Gregorian calendar. These protests were a critical part of the Russian Revolution, which led to the establishment of a communist state and women gaining the right to vote in Russia.

In 2011, the Obama administration proclaimed March as 'Women's History Month,' commemorating the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day and acknowledging the ongoing struggle for women's equality. The article concludes with a contemporary event unrelated to Women's Day, detailing the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department in India due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>El Niño and the summer, monsoon: What is in store this year</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/el-nino-and-the-summer-monsoon-what-is-in-store-this-year-9201948/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the implications of the 2023-24 El Niño event for India, particularly concerning the summer temperatures and the southwest monsoon. The **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** has predicted a hotter summer with above-normal temperatures and more heatwave days from March to May. The **World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)** stated that the current El Niño, one of the strongest on record, has peaked and is now weakening, but it will continue to influence global climate patterns.

El Niño is characterized by abnormal warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters and affects global weather, leading to higher temperatures, dryness, and altered rainfall patterns. The 2023-24 El Niño has been linked to record-breaking global temperatures and is expected to contribute to higher-than-normal temperatures across India during the summer months. Heatwaves are anticipated to be longer and more severe, particularly in Central and Northern Peninsular India.

The southwest monsoon, which accounts for nearly 70% of India's annual rainfall, may be affected by El Niño, as past episodes have been associated with below-average rainfall. However, current global climate models suggest that ENSO neutral conditions will emerge by May, potentially leading to favorable conditions for the monsoon. If these predictions hold, the monsoon may not be adversely affected by El Niño, and there could be normal rainfall, assuming other ocean-atmosphere parameters remain conducive. The IMD is expected to release the Long Range Forecast for the monsoon by mid-April.

			<title>The ‘Architecture Nobel’: Why Pritzker laureate Riken Yamamoto’s work stands out</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-work-of-pritzker-laureate-riken-yamamoto-a-mission-to-defeat-isolation-9201983/</link>
			<description>Riken Yamamoto, a Japanese architect, has been honored with the 2024 Pritzker Architecture Prize, often dubbed the "Architecture Nobel." He is the ninth Japanese recipient since the prize's inception in 1979. The Pritzker Prize recognizes living architects for their talent, vision, and contributions to humanity and architecture. It includes a $100,000 award, a citation, and a bronze medallion.

The selection process involves a jury evaluating over 500 nominees, including visits to project sites, with the ceremony held in May. Japanese architects have claimed the most Pritzker Prizes, with Yamamoto joining a list of previous laureates who have significantly influenced global architectural discourse.

Yamamoto, 79, is known for his emphasis on community and visibility in his designs, which range from private residences to public institutions. His work often features transparent elements that connect the community, such as the Hiroshima Nishi Fire Station's glass walls. He advocates for architecture that fosters societal relationships and harmonizes individual freedom with communal living.

The article also touches on the challenges Japanese architects face, such as high inheritance taxes and limited space, which drive innovative design solutions. Yamamoto's approach is described as a remedy for societal isolation, creating spaces that encourage interaction and visibility, exemplified by his projects like the Koyasu Elementary School and Hotakubo Housing.

In his statement, Yamamoto criticizes the current architectural focus on privacy, suggesting that architecture should instead promote societal connections and cultural harmony. His philosophy and designs aim to address the isolation malaise of society by creating spaces that are not only functional but also foster community engagement.</description>

			<title>Kerala declares man-animal conflict a state-specific disaster: what changes with this</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-man-animal-conflict-state-specific-disaster-explained-9201527/</link>
			<description>Kerala has become the first state in India to declare man-animal conflict a state-specific disaster. This shift in responsibility from the forest department to the state disaster management authority allows for quicker, more decisive action under the Disaster Management Act. The Chief Minister leads the state-level authority, with district collectors heading the district authorities. This change enables the disaster management authority to override other norms, including the Wildlife Protection Act, to address the conflict more effectively. The decision follows increasing incidents of animal attacks and subsequent public outcry. Previously, only the chief wildlife warden could decide on actions against wild animals causing human fatalities, often leading to legal challenges. The new measure prevents lower courts from intervening in actions taken under this declaration. Kerala has previously declared other issues like snakebites, Covid-19, heatwaves, soil piping, and coastal erosion as state-specific disasters.</description>

			<title>Why scientists voted down proposal to declare start of the Anthropocene — and what it means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/scientists-voted-down-proposal-anthropocene-9201316/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the debate over the Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch that would mark the significant impact humans have had on Earth. Despite evidence of human influence from the peak of Mount Everest to the Mariana Trench, a committee of 18 scientists voted against declaring the Anthropocene as a new epoch in the geologic time scale (GTS). The GTS, which measures Earth's history, is divided into aeons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages, with transitions marked by significant events.

We currently live in the Holocene epoch, which began 11,700 years ago after the Last Glacial Period. The term Anthropocene was coined in 2000, suggesting that human activity has profoundly changed the planet. The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) proposed 1952 as the starting point for this epoch, reflecting the "Great Acceleration" of human population growth and environmental impact post-World War II.

However, the proposal was rejected by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), as it did not meet the chronostratigraphic standards for defining epochs. Critics argue that the proposal's recent starting point could confuse the long history of human transformation of the Earth. Others believe that the Anthropocene should be considered an "event" rather than an epoch, as it does not require a formal start date on the GTS.

The rejection of the Anthropocene proposal does not negate the undeniable and lasting human impact on the planet, which will be evident in future geological records. The concept of the Anthropocene remains relevant as a transformative time for Earth due to human activity. The article concludes by noting that the SQS vote was against the specific definition proposed by the AWG, not against the idea of human impact itself. Scientists continue to debate whether the Anthropocene should be officially recognized and how to define it.</description>

			<title>Bengaluru’s first driverless metro train, aided by AI: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bengaluru-first-driverless-metro-yellow-line-ai-9201108/</link>
			<description>The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has introduced the first set of six train coaches for the yellow line, which will feature a Communication-based Train Control (CBTC) system. This line, spanning 18.8 km and connecting RV Road to Bommasandra, is notable for being the first in Bengaluru to offer a driverless train service. It aims to ease traffic congestion on Hosur Road and includes 16 elevated stations, integrating with the Green and Pink Lines of the existing metro network.

The CBTC system, described as "one train talking to another," enables Unattended Train Operations (UTO) and is managed by the Operations Control Centre (OCC). The trains, equipped with AI, will perform daily self-checks, automated cleaning, and enter a sleep mode at night. Manufactured by CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Co Ltd and Titagarh Rail Systems Ltd, these trains are part of the Make In India initiative.

Special features include a hot axle detection system, real-time location updates, front and rear-view cameras, and an Emergency Egress Device (EED) for passenger safety. Before commencing operations, the trains will undergo extensive safety tests, including static and dynamic testing, system integration tests, and statutory safety trials by relevant authorities.

Initially, the driverless trains will operate with a train operator for six months and start with a 15-minute frequency. The yellow line was expected to be operational by 2022 but has been delayed to December 2024 due to setbacks in train deliveries and manufacturing challenges. The trains are undergoing a series of at least 37 mainline tests over four months and signalling tests for 45 days before they can start service.</description>

			<title>How RBI’s new directions on credit cards could benefit customers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/credit-card-networks-options-rbi-customers-9200530/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has mandated that credit card issuers must offer customers a choice of card networks and prohibited exclusive agreements with any single network. This decision aims to enhance customer choice and competition among card networks. Issuers have six months to comply with these new regulations. The RBI's review revealed that current issuer-network agreements limit customer options, prompting these changes. The norms apply to issuers with over 10 lakh active cards and exclude companies like American Express that operate their own networks. As of January 31, 2024, India had 9.95 crore active credit cards, with leading issuers being HDFC Bank, SBI Cards, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank. The new rules are expected to benefit customers by providing more options and fostering better card features due to increased competition.</description>

			<title>SC sets up panel to look into tiger safaris, ecological damage at Jim Corbett: What was the case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sc-panel-tiger-safaris-jim-corbett-what-was-the-case-9199887/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has mandated the formation of a committee to propose methods for rectifying ecological harm in Jim Corbett National Park due to unauthorized construction and deforestation. This committee will also address tiger safari concerns in national park buffer zones. The court's decision follows a Central Empowered Committee (CEC) report that highlighted over 6,053 trees were illegally cut down for the Pakhrau Tiger Safari in Uttarakhand.

The case originated from a public interest litigation regarding illegal tree felling and construction within the Corbett Tiger Reserve's Tiger Breeding Habitat. The Supreme Court's ruling cited numerous violations in the Pakhrau safari's development, including unauthorized road and building construction, excessive tree felling, and overspending of approved funds.

The CEC report implicated the District Forest Officer of Kalagarh and other officials for these irregularities, leading to arrests and investigations by the CBI. The then Forest Minister, Harak Singh Rawat, was identified as the main orchestrator.

The Supreme Court's committee, comprising representatives from various environmental and wildlife authorities, is tasked with evaluating the damage, identifying responsible officers, and recommending restoration measures. It will also consider the feasibility of tiger safaris in buffer zones and establish guidelines if deemed permissible. The committee's approach emphasizes ecocentrism, the precautionary principle, and the use of only injured, conflicted, or orphaned tigers in safaris.

Separately, the Election Commission of India transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan, wife of BJD leader V K Pandian, due to allegations of misusing public office for election-related activities. The BJP accused her of using the Mission Shakti scheme to sway voters. This unrelated matter was also mentioned in the article.</description>

			<title>India to restart Penicillin G manufacture: why was it stopped, what changed now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/india-to-restart-penicillin-g-manufacture-why-it-stopped-9199850/</link>
			<description>India is set to resume the domestic production of Penicillin G, an essential antibiotic, after a hiatus of three decades. This move is a result of the government's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which was initiated during the pandemic to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependency on imports. The scheme incentivizes companies based on incremental sales.

The decision comes in the wake of realizing the importance of self-reliance, especially after the supply chain disruptions experienced during the pandemic. The industry had previously seen a decline in API production due to the influx of cheaper Chinese products, leading to the closure of Indian manufacturing plants. The last such plant belonged to Torrent Pharma in Ahmedabad.

The revival of Penicillin G production is scheduled for mid-2024 by Aurobindo Pharma, based in Hyderabad. The delay in restarting production is attributed to the lack of perceived need, high initial costs, and the dominance of China as a major API supplier. The PLI scheme aims to address these challenges by providing financial support to fermentation-based bulk drug manufacturers, including antibiotics, enzymes, and hormones like insulin.

The impact of the PLI scheme has been significant, with a noticeable decrease in API imports. However, experts note that India still imports a substantial percentage of its APIs, indicating that it will take time for domestic manufacturing to fully recover. The scheme offers a tiered support system, with higher incentives in the initial years to encourage investment in this critical sector.</description>

			<title>Explained: Ladakh, Article 371, and the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/ladakh-article-371-and-the-sixth-schedule-of-the-constitution-9199902/</link>
			<description>Union Home Minister Amit Shah has proposed extending Article 371-like protections to Ladakh, addressing concerns about jobs, land, and culture raised by local organizations. However, he ruled out including Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which would grant autonomy to administrate tribal areas. Ladakh, now a Union Territory without a legislature, has seen demands for such inclusion since its separation from Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. Article 371 provides special provisions for certain states, allowing for autonomy and representation without interference from state and central governments. Shah assured the Ladakh delegation of local representation and participation through hill councils and up to 80% reservation in public employment. This move, if enacted, would mark the first time special provisions are introduced for a Union Territory rather than a state. The article also mentions the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<description>Byju Raveendran, the CEO of Byju's, informed employees that a legal issue with investors has led to blocked funds, affecting salary payments. The company is also involved in a legal case in the US regarding $533 million, which it claims is not misappropriated but transferred to a subsidiary. Once valued at $22 billion, Byju's now faces financial distress, legal challenges, and a potential leadership shake-up, with its valuation dropping below $1 billion. The company's rapid growth, fueled by aggressive marketing and global investments, has been marred by financial missteps, leading to significant losses and defaults on loans. Byju's is banking on a successful rights issue to stabilize its operations, while the outcomes of court proceedings will determine the future of the company and its leadership.</description>

			<title>Who was Ayya Vaikundar, and why TN Governor calling him ‘Sanatan Dharma saviour’ sparked a row</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/who-was-ayya-vaikundar-rn-ravi-controversy-9199546/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi's remarks on Ayya Vaikundar, a 19th-century social reformer. Ravi's statement that Vaikundar was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu meant to protect Sanatan Dharma has sparked criticism from politicians and followers of Vaikundar. Ayya Vaikundar is celebrated for his efforts to eradicate caste-based discrimination and promote equality through various social reforms, such as community eateries and common wells for all castes, and inclusive worship practices that challenged the prevailing caste system.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid homage to Vaikundar, praising his work towards creating a compassionate society. However, Ravi's interpretation of Vaikundar's teachings as aligned with Sanatan Dharma has been disputed by leaders of the Ayyavazhi sect and others, who argue that Vaikundar's mission was to eliminate ignorance and caste division, not to save Sanatan Dharma. The article also mentions historians' views that political appropriation of such figures should be logical and respectful of their unique historical context, which they believe Ravi's comments lacked.

Additionally, the article briefly touches on an unrelated issue regarding the Election Commission of India's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office. The BJP accuses her of using the Mission Shakti scheme to influence voters on behalf of the BJD. This part of the article seems to be separate from the main topic of Ayya Vaikundar.</description>

			<title>Why is ISRO building a second rocket launchport?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/isro-building-second-rocket-launchport-9199038/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated ISRO's second launchport at Kulasekarapattinam, Tamil Nadu, which will focus on commercial and small satellite launches. This new facility, costing Rs 986 crore, is expected to alleviate the load on the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, which will continue to handle larger missions. The Kulasekarapattinam launchport offers geographical advantages for Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) missions, allowing for more efficient fuel use and enhanced payload capacities due to its direct southward launch trajectory. The Tamil Nadu government has provided over 2,000 acres for this project, and ISRO Chairman S Somanath estimates a two-year construction period. The SSLV, designed for low-cost, quick-turnaround launches of small satellites, has seen both failure and success in its initial missions. The new launchport is strategically placed near the equator, which is beneficial for geostationary satellite launches, and is expected to support 20 to 30 SSLV launches annually once operational.</description>

			<title>Why the US Supreme Court restored Donald Trump’s candidacy in Colorado</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/us-supreme-court-trump-candidacy-colorado-9198553/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously in favor of former President Donald Trump, allowing him to contest the 2024 presidential elections. This decision came despite arguments that he was ineligible under the Fourteenth Amendment's Section 3, which bars individuals who engaged in insurrection from holding office. The Colorado Supreme Court had previously ruled that Trump could not be listed on the primary ballot, but the SCOTUS overturned this decision, stating that states have no power to enforce Section 3 concerning federal offices. The ruling ends challenges to Trump's candidacy in at least 36 states and has significant implications for the upcoming election where Trump is leading opinion polls.

			<title>What is Cuttack’s famed silver filigree work, which recently received GI tag</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/cuttacks-silver-filigree-work-gi-tag-9198045/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the awarding of the Geographical Indication (GI) tag to the Rupa Tarakasi, the renowned silver filigree work from Cuttack, Odisha. The GI tag, applied for by the Odisha State Cooperative Handicrafts Corporation Limited (Utkalika), recognizes products with unique qualities originating from a specific region. Cuttack's silver filigree is celebrated for its intricate designs and fine craftsmanship, where silver is crafted into delicate wires or foils to create jewelry and showpieces.

The origins of Cuttack's filigree art are traced back to the 12th century, with significant influence from various cultures and rulers over time. Historically, it shares characteristics with filigree work from regions like Arabia, Malta, and ancient Greece, suggesting a widespread cultural exchange.

Today, Cuttack's filigree artisans produce a range of products, including jewelry, decorative items, and religious artifacts. Despite the evolution of the craft, the fundamental process has remained consistent, with changes primarily in design and product offerings. The article also mentions the use of various metals in the crafting process, such as copper, zinc, cadmium, and tin.

			<title>GI tag for Majuli masks of Assam: History, cultural significance of the centuries-old art form</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/gi-tag-for-majuli-masks-history-cultural-significance-9197633/</link>
			<description>The traditional Majuli masks and manuscript paintings of Assam have been awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, recognizing their unique cultural significance and origin. The Majuli masks, part of the neo-Vaishnavite tradition since the 16th century, are used in bhaonas (theatrical performances) to depict various characters, including gods, goddesses, and demons. These masks are crafted from local materials like bamboo, clay, and cotton, and their creation can take from five days to one and a half months, depending on the size.

The art of mask-making is deeply rooted in the monastic institutions known as sattras, which are centers for religious and cultural activities. Currently, the mask-making tradition is primarily concentrated in four sattras on Majuli, the world's largest river island. Efforts are being made to modernize the art form and make it economically viable, with initiatives like selling masks to tourists and displaying them in exhibitions, including the British Museum.

Hemchandra Goswami, the head of Samaguri Sattra, has been instrumental in promoting mask-making beyond its traditional use in bhaonas. Workshops are held to train new artists, and there are plans to adapt the masks for contemporary uses to appeal to younger generations.

Majuli manuscript painting, also dating back to the 16th century, is performed on manuscripts made from the bark of the sanchi or agar tree. This art form, which has been patronized by the Ahom kings, continues to be practiced in Majuli's sattras and is an integral part of the island's cultural heritage. The GI tags aim to preserve and promote these traditional arts, ensuring their longevity and appreciation in the modern world.</description>

			<description>The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court acquitted former Delhi University professor G N Saibaba, reversing a trial court's life sentence verdict for alleged Maoist links under the UAPA. The High Court highlighted the prosecution's failure to adhere to procedural requirements, such as obtaining valid sanctions for the charges. The absence of these sanctions was deemed a fundamental error, leading to the conclusion that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences. The High Court also dismissed the state's argument for presuming terror charges based on the recovery of electronic evidence and pamphlets, stating that such items do not fall under the hazardous category as per the UAPA. This ruling underscores the importance of procedural safeguards in the judicial process, especially when serious charges are involved.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ins-jatayu-india-naval-base-lakshadweep-9197551/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the commissioning of **INS Jatayu**, an upgraded naval base at Minicoy in the Lakshadweep Islands, which marks a significant enhancement of India's security infrastructure in this strategically important region. INS Jatayu will be the second naval base in Lakshadweep after INS Dweeprakshak and is part of India's efforts to strengthen its presence in the Indian Ocean, especially in light of the strategic importance of the Lakshadweep Islands and their proximity to major maritime routes. The base will support a range of military and possibly civil aircraft, enhancing India's operational capabilities, including anti-piracy and anti-narcotics operations, and its role as a first responder in the region. This move comes at a time of growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean and strained relations with the Maldives. The commissioning of INS Jatayu is aligned with the government's focus on the comprehensive development of the islands, despite potential challenges posed by the fragile ecology of the region.</description>

			<title>Meet MethaneSAT, a satellite which will ‘name and shame’ methane emitters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/methanesat-satellite-methane-emmissions-9197297/</link>
			<description>MethaneSAT, a satellite designed to track and measure global methane emissions, was launched on a SpaceX Falcon9 rocket. It aims to provide detailed data with a wider field of view than previous satellites. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, contributes significantly to global warming and ground-level ozone formation. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), in collaboration with various institutions, developed MethaneSAT to monitor the oil and gas sector, offering near real-time public data to aid in reducing methane emissions. The satellite's advanced technology can detect small methane sources and "super emitters," addressing the underreporting of emissions by national governments. The launch aligns with global efforts to manage methane emissions, such as the Global Methane Pledge. MethaneSAT's data promotes transparency but does not guarantee changes in polluters' behavior.</description>

			<title>A new report card, where students, their friends, parents get a say: What has NCERT changed, why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/holistic-progress-card-ncert-explained-9197296/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the introduction of a new 'holistic progress card' (HPC) by the National Council for Educational and Research Training (NCERT), which aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of students' abilities beyond academic performance. The HPC, developed by PARAKH, will evaluate students on interpersonal relationships, self-reflection, creativity, and emotional application, and will be implemented for classes 1 through 8 as per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This card will replace traditional marks or grades with a 360-degree evaluation that includes self and peer assessments, as well as parental input on various aspects of a child's development. The HPC is designed to foster higher-order thinking skills and holistic growth, and it has already been adopted by several states and Union Territories. The change reflects the NEP 2020's emphasis on building self-awareness and self-esteem in students, moving away from rote memorization towards a competency-based evaluation system. The HPC is expected to provide valuable insights for teachers and parents to support individual learning paths.</description>

			<title>Kerala man killed on Israel farm: What are Indians doing there?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/kerala-man-israel-farm-hezbollah-indian-workers-9197115/</link>
			<description>An Indian national was killed and two others were injured when an anti-tank missile, allegedly fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon, hit an orchard in northern Israel. The Israeli Embassy in India condemned the attack. Tensions have escalated along Israel's northern border with Lebanon since October 2023, leading to casualties and displacements. Hezbollah, opposed to Israel and Western influence, has been active since the Lebanese Civil War. Israel's labor shortage, exacerbated by security concerns, has led to the recruitment of Indian workers, particularly in agriculture. The recent attack highlights the risks faced by these workers, who are often employed near conflict zones. The article also discusses the broader context of Indian labor in Israel, including caregivers, and the impact of the conflict on their employment and safety.</description>

			<title>Govt clarifies its AI advisory on elections: How to understand the concerns and criticism around the issue</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/govt-ai-advisory-elections-concerns-criticism-9196506/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Indian government's advisory on generative AI services in the context of elections. The advisory, initially causing concern among startups, was clarified to target significant platforms, not startups. It mandates large platforms to seek permission before deploying AI services, especially with Lok Sabha elections approaching. The advisory aims to prevent illegal content and protect the electoral process's integrity. Criticism arose over potential regulatory overreach and the legal basis of the advisory, as current laws don't explicitly cover large language models (LLMs). The government views the advisory as a due diligence measure under the Information Technology Rules, 2021, and a precaution against misinformation and deepfakes affecting elections. The article suggests that a balanced approach between regulation and innovation is necessary, considering the potential misuse of AI in sensitive areas like elections. The legal framework for the advisory is debated, but it's presented as an effort to ensure the safety of citizens and democracy. The article concludes with a brief mention of an upcoming IPL match, unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<title>Former DU professor GN Saibaba acquitted over alleged Maoist links: What was the case against him?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/du-prof-gn-saibaba-acquitted-maoist-case-bombay-hc-9196411/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court acquitted former Delhi University professor G N Saibaba and others, previously convicted for alleged Maoist links. The division bench found the prosecution's case unproven due to an invalid sanction under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), rendering the trial null and void. The court highlighted the failure to establish legal seizure of evidence and the absence of incriminating material against the accused. Consequently, the bench overturned the trial court's judgment and acquitted all accused, emphasizing the importance of due process and legal safeguards. Previously, the Supreme Court had set aside a similar High Court verdict and remanded the case for a fresh hearing, which led to this acquittal.</description>

			<title>Tata Motors demerger: What does it signal, what’s in it for shareholders?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/tata-motors-demerger-9196331/</link>
			<description>Tata Motors' shares saw a significant surge following the announcement of a demerger into two separate listed entities. The demerger will divide the company into one entity handling the commercial vehicles business and another incorporating the passenger vehicles business, including electric vehicles and the Jaguar-Land Rover division. This strategic move is expected to unlock value and enhance growth opportunities, with the passenger vehicles segment showing potential for self-sustainability. The demerger process will be carried out through an NCLT Scheme of Arrangement, ensuring that shareholders retain identical stakes in both entities. Analysts have mixed views on the potential value creation from the demerger, with some seeing it as a positive step towards competing with market leaders and capitalizing on growth opportunities, especially in electric and autonomous vehicles. The formalities and approvals for the demerger are anticipated to take 12-15 months, with no adverse impact on employees, customers, or business partners. Tata Motors' stock has risen significantly over the past year, reflecting investor optimism.</description>

			<title>SC upholds Rajasthan rule barring those with more than 2 kids from police force: What is the case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/rajasthan-2-kids-police-force-criterion-sc-9195700/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court upheld the Rajasthan government's rule barring individuals with more than two children from applying for police constable positions, stating it is constitutional and non-discriminatory. The rule in question is Rule 24(4) of the Rajasthan Police Subordinate Service Rules, 1989, which disqualifies candidates with more than two children after June 1, 2002, from appointment to the service. Exceptions are made if the number of children does not increase after that date or in the case of multiple births from a single subsequent delivery.

The case arose from an ex-serviceman's plea after his application for a constable post was rejected due to having more than two children post the specified date. His appeal was dismissed by the Rajasthan High Court, leading him to approach the Supreme Court, which also dismissed his challenge.

The ruling referenced a similar provision for panchayat elections upheld by the Supreme Court in 2003. The article also notes that several states have implemented policies linking family size to eligibility for various positions, including public employment, to promote family planning. The article ends with a mention of the Election Commission of India ordering the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>What is India’s disability law; how accessible are govt buildings to PwD?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/india-disability-law-accessible-government-buildings-pwd-9195391/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the efforts of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) in India to ensure public buildings are accessible to people with disabilities (PwD), in line with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. This act aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which India ratified in 2007. The CPWD has mandated that lifts should have audio and visual announcements, and emergency evacuation routes for PwD should be clearly marked, including Braille signage.

The CPWD's directive is part of a broader initiative to enforce compliance with accessibility laws and guidelines that were established years ago but have seen delayed implementation. The Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier Free Built Environment for Persons With Disability and Elderly Persons, first published in 2016, were updated in 2021 to include comprehensive standards for ramps, grab rails, lifts, toilets, and other features to enhance accessibility.

Despite these efforts, there is criticism from PwDs and activists regarding the lack of implementation of these guidelines. Experts point out the absence of awareness and accountability among engineers and public works departments responsible for executing these standards. The article also mentions the Accessible India Campaign, which aims to make public buildings, transportation, and websites accessible for PwD, and the progress made in retrofitting buildings to meet accessibility standards.

The article concludes with concerns about the inconsistent application of accessibility standards and the need for more stringent measures to ensure compliance. It highlights the challenges faced by PwDs due to the haphazard implementation of accessibility features and the lack of sensitivity among those responsible for their implementation.</description>

			<title>JMM bribes for votes ruling: How Supreme Court interpreted privilege for lawmakers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/jmm-bribery-case-supreme-court-verdict-criminal-prosecution-9195750/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, has ruled that **lawmakers cannot claim immunity** from criminal prosecution for bribery related to their speech and votes in the House. The Court emphasized that parliamentary privilege claims are subject to judicial review and are not absolute.

The case involved the interpretation of **Article 105(2)** and **Article 194(2)** of the Constitution, which protect members of Parliament and state Assemblies from legal proceedings related to their official actions. However, the Court clarified that privileges must pass the "necessity test," meaning they must be essential for lawmakers to perform their duties. Accepting bribes does not meet this criterion.

The Court also addressed whether a lawmaker could claim immunity if they accepted a bribe but voted according to their conscience or party line. Analyzing the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Court concluded that merely accepting a bribe constitutes an offense, regardless of the subsequent action taken by the public servant.

Furthermore, the Court held that creating a class of public servants with extraordinary protection would violate the right to equality under **Article 14** and be considered arbitrary.

Lastly, the Court stated that both Parliament and the judiciary have roles in addressing the actions of lawmakers, as the purposes of punishment by the House and criminal prosecution are distinct. This ruling ensures that lawmakers are held accountable and reinforces the integrity of the parliamentary system.</description>

			<title>Bribes for votes: Supreme Court draws a red line, pushes the envelope on House privileges</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/bribes-for-votes-supreme-court-draws-a-red-line-pushes-the-envelope-on-house-privileges-9195758/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has ruled that parliamentary privileges are not absolute and can be subject to judicial review. This decision extends the court's ability to scrutinize the actions of Parliament members, particularly concerning immunity from prosecution for bribery under Article 105(2) of the Constitution. The ruling emphasizes the separation of powers and the judiciary's independence as part of the Constitution's basic structure. It asserts that lawmakers can be prosecuted for corruption even for actions within the House, as such behavior undermines the Constitution's ideals and democratic principles. The court has gradually limited the scope of immunity from graft charges, as seen in the 2021 Kerala assembly ruckus case where the Supreme Court ruled that criminal acts, such as property damage, are not protected by parliamentary immunity. Additionally, the court is considering cases related to the Governor's powers in lawmaking and the balance between citizens' fundamental rights and parliamentary privileges. In a related development, the Election Commission has transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan, linked to a political leader, due to allegations of misusing her public office for electoral gains.</description>

			<title>All you need to know about ‘Super Tuesday’, a key day in the US Presidential elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/super-tuesday-us-elections-trump-haley-biden-9195312/</link>
			<description>Super Tuesday, set for March 5, 2024, is a pivotal day in the US Presidential election cycle, with voters from 15 states casting their ballots for Democratic and Republican candidates. This day is often seen as a strong indicator of the eventual party nominees.

The US election process begins with primaries and caucuses, where voters express their preferences for candidates. Victories in these events are crucial as they secure delegates who will later vote at the National Conventions to officially nominate the Presidential candidates.

Criticism exists over the delegate system, as it does not allow direct voter selection of candidates. Additionally, "superdelegates" have the power to vote independently of primary results, potentially influencing the party's final decision.

This year's primaries and caucuses run from January to June, with Super Tuesday being a significant event due to the large number of states involved. The Democratic Party sees President Joe Biden seeking re-election without significant opposition, while the Republican field has narrowed to Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, with Haley achieving a historic win in the Washington primary.

The article also touches on the anticipation surrounding the candidacy for the Nehru-Gandhi seats in India, highlighting the global nature of political campaigns and elections.</description>

			<title>What is the Punjab-Himachal dispute over the Shanan hydropower project</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/punjab-himachal-dispute-over-the-shanan-hydropower-project-9195344/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the dispute between Punjab and Himachal Pradesh over the Shanan hydropower project. The project, which dates back to the British era, was leased to Punjab in 1925 and the lease expired on March 2, 2024. Himachal Pradesh claims the project should revert to it post-lease, while Punjab has taken the matter to the Supreme Court, asserting ownership and control through the Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. The Centre has intervened by ordering a status quo to be maintained until a final decision is made, ensuring the project's uninterrupted operation. This order is an interim measure and not a basis for any claim or interest, with parties expected to resolve the dispute legally.

			<title>Warming up to climate change: What is carbon capture and can it help save the planet?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-carbon-capture-climate-change-9195282/</link>
			<description>Germany has recently decided to permit carbon capture and offshore storage for industries like cement production to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. This move is part of a broader adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies by various countries, such as the UAE's project to convert atmospheric CO2 into rock.

CCS technologies capture CO2 emissions from sources like refineries and power plants and store them underground. There are three main CCS techniques: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion. Post-combustion captures CO2 after fossil fuels are burned, pre-combustion does so before burning, and oxyfuel combustion burns fuel with pure oxygen to produce CO2 and water vapor, which are then separated.

While CCS is touted for its potential to combat climate change, its effectiveness and cost-efficiency are debated. Studies have shown that some operational CCS projects do not perform as claimed, and the technology is expensive compared to renewable energy sources. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has cautioned against overreliance on CCS, stating that the electricity required for extensive carbon capture by 2050 could exceed global electricity usage in 2022.

Critics argue that CCS provides a "social licence to operate" for fossil fuel companies, allowing them to continue extraction under the guise of climate solutions. The article suggests that while CCS has a role, it should not be the sole strategy for addressing climate change.</description>

			<title>As SC overturns Narasimha Rao decision, remembering its 1998 ruling in JMM cash-for-votes case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-overturns-narasimha-rao-decision-jmm-cash-for-votes-case-9195208/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has recently overturned a 1998 judgment that granted legislators immunity from criminal prosecution for bribery related to their speech and votes in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. This landmark decision reverses the court's previous stance from the case P V Narasimha Rao v State (CBI/Spe), where it was ruled that legislators were protected under Article 105(2) of the Constitution, which safeguards parliamentary freedom of speech and voting from legal proceedings.

The case stems from a 1993 no-confidence motion against then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao, where it was later discovered that Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MPs were allegedly bribed to vote against the motion. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed cases against six JMM MPs and Janata Dal’s Ajit Singh for accepting bribes.

The Supreme Court's recent ruling emphasizes that the intended purpose of Article 105(2) is not to shield legislators from the rule of law or allow them to engage in corrupt practices. The court's decision now holds that legislators can be prosecuted for bribery, marking a significant shift towards accountability and the integrity of parliamentary proceedings. This ruling is expected to have far-reaching implications for the conduct of legislators and the legal framework surrounding parliamentary immunity.</description>

			<title>Why Odisha wants to introduce Similipal’s black tigers to female big cats from central India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/similipals-black-tigers-female-big-cats-9194056/</link>
			<description>The Odisha government is seeking approval from the National Tiger Conservation Authority to introduce female tigers from the Central Indian landscape to the Similipal Tiger Reserve. This initiative aims to enhance the gene pool and balance the sex ratio within the reserve, which is home to the unique pseudo-melanistic royal Bengal tigers. Genetic studies indicate that these tigers, which have distinctive black-and-yellow stripes due to high melanin levels, are inbred and isolated. The recent Odisha Tiger Estimation revealed a total of 24 adult tigers in Similipal, with 13 being pseudo-melanistic. The introduction of more females, particularly from areas like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh where tiger reserves are overcrowded, is expected to increase genetic diversity. The NTCA's approval is required for such relocations, and a technical committee will assess the reserve's suitability for the new tigers. Previous relocation efforts in Odisha's Satkosia Tiger Reserve were unsuccessful, resulting in the death of a male tiger and the return of a female tiger to her original habitat after she allegedly killed two people.</description>

			<title>National leopard survey shows count up, but fewer animals outside tiger reserves: What this means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/national-count-leopards-explained-9193968/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the findings of the 2022 national survey on India's leopard population. The survey reports a significant increase in the leopard count to **13,874**, marking a **75%** rise from the 2014 estimate. However, a more accurate comparison with the 2018 figures, which accounted for a larger number of camera traps, shows an **8%** increase in the population. Notably, **33%** of leopards are found within protected areas, which only make up **11%** of their range in India.

The study highlights the contrasting situations of leopards in protected areas versus those outside. In tiger reserves, leopard numbers have risen by **21%** since 2018, while those outside these areas have seen a **1%** decline. The article underscores the threats leopards face due to conflict and poaching, particularly in unprotected areas. It also points out the challenges of habitat fragmentation and the need for policies to protect leopards from development and poaching pressures.

The leopard's adaptability has allowed it to survive in close proximity to humans, but this has also made it vulnerable. The article cites studies and data on leopard poaching and conflict, including the alarming rate of leopard deaths and captures. It concludes by emphasizing the leopard's resilience and the critical role of human perception and policy in ensuring the future of this species outside protected forests.

The author, Jay Mazoomdaar, is noted for his investigative reporting on various environmental and conservation issues. The article also briefly mentions an upcoming IPL 2024 cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals, but this is unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<title>How to bring about White Revolution 2.0</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/milk-demand-how-to-bring-about-white-revolution-2-0-9193873/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the findings of the **Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23**, which indicates that milk has become the top food expenditure item in India, surpassing spending on vegetables, cereals, and other food products in both rural and urban areas. The increase in milk expenditure is a positive sign for the dairy industry and farmers, but it faces challenges due to rising milk prices and the cost of feed and fodder.

To address these challenges, the article highlights the potential of **genetic improvement and breeding technologies** to increase milk yield and reduce production costs. It details the use of sex-sorted semen to ensure a higher probability of female calves, which are future milk producers. The article also describes advanced breeding techniques like **embryo transfer (ET)** and **in vitro fertilization (IVF)**, which can significantly increase the number of calves produced from high genetic merit cows.

The **Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union (Amul)** is mentioned as a key player in implementing these technologies, aiming to increase the use of sex-sorted semen and has established a Bovine Breeding Centre for breeding high genetic merit bulls and cows.

Furthermore, the article touches on the need to reduce feeding costs through the cultivation of high-yielding fodder grasses and the establishment of a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) plant by Amul, which would provide a balanced diet for cattle at a lower cost.

The overarching theme is the focus on reducing the cost of milk production at the farm level, termed as **White Revolution 2.0**, to maintain farmer incomes and the competitiveness of the Indian dairy industry without increasing consumer prices. The article concludes with a brief mention of unrelated topics and a statement by President Joe Biden on the role of immigrants in the US economy.</description>

			<description>Pakistan is attempting discreet diplomatic outreach to India after a period of estrangement. To facilitate this, Pakistan will host its National Day celebrations in New Delhi, honoring the 1940 Lahore Resolution that called for an independent Muslim state in India. The resolution outlined the creation of two separate autonomous units for Muslim-majority regions, which later became the basis for Pakistan's independence. National Day is observed at the Pakistani embassy in New Delhi with speeches, music, and the presence of Indian dignitaries.</description>

			<title>Why Thailand’s now-replaced WTO Ambassador questioned India’s agriculture subsidies, what India argued</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/wto-india-food-subsidy-farmers-thailand-9193340/</link>
			<description>Thailand replaced its Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) after India protested her comments regarding India's Public Stockholding (PSH) program.

Thailand, as part of the Cairns Group, criticized India's PSH program, claiming it is subsidized and distorts global food prices. India, with rice exports exceeding the WTO's de minimis limit of 10% for developing countries, has argued for a change in the subsidy calculation method.

The Cairns Group, supported by the EU and US, seeks to reduce India's farm support, while India demands a permanent solution for public stockholding.

During the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference, tensions escalated between India and Thailand, leading to Indian negotiators boycotting discussions where the Thai representative was present.

Indian farmers have expressed concerns about WTO restrictions on farm support and have requested its removal from the WTO agreement.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, said by former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-shastri-9193486/</link>
			<description>Lal Bahadur Shastri, India's former Prime Minister, coined the iconic slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" ("hail the soldier, hail the farmer") in 1965 amidst numerous challenges, including the Indo-Pak conflict and agricultural crisis. The slogan emphasizes the vital role of both soldiers and farmers in India's well-being and security.

Shastri's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by his swift actions during the conflict, which resulted in a ceasefire on Pakistan's terms. He also prioritized agriculture, allocating funds and reforms to lay the foundation for the Green Revolution and empowered key figures in the sector.

Over the years, the slogan has evolved, with subsequent leaders adding "Jai Vigyan" (hail science) and "Jai Anusandhan" (hail research) to highlight the importance of scientific advancement and research.</description>

			<title>What is grey zone warfare, mentioned by India’s Chief of Defence Staff recently?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/grey-zone-warfare-meaning-examples-china-taiwan-9193251/</link>
			<description>In the 2024 Raisina Dialogue, General Anil Chauhan introduced "grey zone warfare" as the latest form of informal warfare, citing examples from the South China Sea and China's actions around Taiwan. Grey zone warfare involves actions that fall between direct conflict and peace, such as economic operations, influence campaigns, and cyberattacks.

Experts believe grey zone warfare has emerged due to factors like nuclear weapons and technological advancements, making direct conflicts too costly. It allows countries to pursue objectives covertly or with obfuscated attribution.

Grey zone warfare methods include economic sanctions, disinformation campaigns, and proxy wars. Russia and China have been associated with such tactics. For instance, China's presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan's complaints about increased Chinese military activity are examples of grey zone warfare.

While grey zone warfare poses challenges different from open conflicts, experts warn that it can escalate in multiple dimensions and become difficult to manage. It can also be used to bait adversaries into escalation, normalize disputed claims, and project strength.</description>

			<title>Bribes for votes: Why SC will decide if MLAs and MPs immune from criminal prosecution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-mla-mp-immune-criminal-prosecution-corruption-9193229/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is considering overturning a 1998 ruling that granted legislators immunity from bribery charges in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution provide this protection, which was interpreted literally in the P.V. Narasimha Rao case. However, a seven-judge bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud is examining the issue, focusing on whether the purpose of these articles was to protect legislators from criminal prosecution, the definition of "in respect of," and when the offense of bribery is complete. Senior advocates Raju Ramachandran and P.S. Patwalia argue for a narrow interpretation of the immunity, while Attorney General R. Vankataramani and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta advocate for reconsideration. The court will ultimately decide whether to maintain or overrule the P.V. Narasimha judgement.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Modi and Mauritian Prime Minister Jugnauth inaugurated an airstrip and jetty built by India on Agaléga Islands. Despite denials, reports suggest the airstrip could be developed into a military base. The project aims to enhance India's reach in the Indian Ocean, especially amidst China's growing influence. The initiative is part of India's 'Neighbourhood First Policy' with Mauritius and involves Indian Navy detachments and the supply of defense equipment. India is also strengthening ties with neighboring countries such as Seychelles, Madagascar, and certain African nations, while its relationship with the Maldives has been affected by political changes.</description>

			<title>What India’s latest leopard population estimates suggest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-leopard-population-estimates-9192015/</link>
			<description>According to the 'Status of Leopards in India, 2022' report, India's leopard population has increased to 13,874 from 12,852 in 2018. Central India and Eastern Ghats have the highest population of leopards. Madhya Pradesh has the largest population, followed by Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. While tiger populations have positively impacted leopard populations in some areas, they have also negatively impacted them in others. Poaching, habitat loss, and road accidents remain significant threats to leopards. Leopard-human conflict is also a growing issue due to leopards' adaptability and presence outside protected areas. States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala have reported numerous fatal attacks and human-leopard encounters.</description>

			<title>Is the President immune from prosecution? US Supreme Court to decide on Trump case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/presidential-immunity-trump-us-supreme-court-9191776/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court (SCOTUS) is considering whether former President Donald Trump has immunity from criminal charges for attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Trump faces conspiracy charges related to the January 6th Capitol attack.

The Constitution does not specify presidential immunity, but SCOTUS ruled in United States v Nixon (1974) that the President can be required to testify and produce evidence in criminal cases. However, the question of whether a President can be prosecuted while in office remains unanswered.

Trump argues that the "absolute immunity" granted to former President Nixon in Nixon v Fitzgerald (1982) should extend to criminal liability for actions taken during office.

In contrast to the US, India's President and Governors have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution during their terms. However, the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers have no such protection and can be treated like ordinary citizens in court.</description>

			<title>Obesity on the rise, high levels of undernutrition persist in India: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/obesity-undernutrition-persist-india-new-study-9191754/</link>
			<description>India faces a double burden of obesity and undernutrition. Over the past 32 years, obesity has surged, particularly in women with a 9.8% prevalence in 2022. Childhood obesity has also increased significantly. Despite declining, undernutrition remains high, with India having the highest prevalence of thinness in girls and the second highest in boys globally.

Socioeconomic factors play a role, with junk food being more accessible and affordable than nutritious options. Obesity is more prevalent in urban areas and among the better-off, while undernutrition persists in remote and poor regions.

Obesity contributes to non-communicable diseases, while undernutrition increases susceptibility to these conditions later in life. The study recommends addressing both issues through programs that promote healthy nutrition and weight loss support.</description>

Li's upcoming report to Parliament will outline his plan to boost internal consumption and attract foreign investment. Germany plays a significant role in this growth strategy, with record levels of FDI. Visa liberalization measures have been implemented to encourage investment from Germany and other EU nations, demonstrating China's eagerness for international business collaboration.</description>

			<title>Why have GDP and GVA growth rates diverged in Q3?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-have-gdp-and-gva-growth-rates-diverged-in-q3-9191086/</link>
			<description>India's GDP grew by an unexpected 8.4% in Q3 of 2023-24, surpassing RBI estimates of 6.5%. This helped raise the full-year estimate to 7.6%. Growth was driven by manufacturing, mining, construction, and services, while agriculture contracted.

However, there is a discrepancy between GDP and GVA growth, with GDP growing at 8.4% and GVA at 6.5%. This is due to lower-than-expected annual GDP deflator and a sharp rise in net taxes.

Investment growth supported GDP, while private consumption growth remained subdued. The government attributed the GVA-GDP divergence to a fall in subsidies.

Economists believe GDP deflator growth could lead to lower real GDP growth in the future. They emphasize monitoring consumption growth and private investments for sustained growth.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-how-the-development-of-agalega-figures-in-indias-vision-for-its-maritime-neighbourhood-9191082/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Jugnauth inaugurated an airstrip and jetty on Agaléga Island, which belongs to Mauritius. The development aims to enhance socio-economic security for Mauritius and aligns with India's maritime vision. These facilities will improve the well-being of the island's inhabitants and create employment opportunities. They will also strengthen Mauritius' government presence and enable better monitoring of their Exclusive Economic Zone. India and Mauritius have close historical and cultural ties, with 70% of Mauritians having Indian origin. India's commitment to the SAGAR vision and willingness to assist maritime nations are underscored by this joint development. India respects sovereignty and has a track record of providing material support, information exchange, and joint exercises with Mauritius, but only upon request and in accordance with established mechanisms. India's development aid is not intended to create debt traps or violate sovereignty.</description>

			<title>Bengaluru bomb blast: What are improvised explosive devices, or IEDs?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bengaluru-bomb-blast-ied-9190684/</link>
			<description>An explosion at Rameshwaram Cafe in Bengaluru, which injured nine people, was caused by an improvised explosive device (IED), not a gas leak. Karnataka's Chief Minister confirmed the incident after reviewing CCTV footage. The article explains that IEDs are homemade bombs that can vary greatly in form and have been used for over a century. They consist of an initiator, switch, main charge, power source, and container, and may include shrapnel or hazardous materials to increase damage. Common materials for IEDs include fertilizers, gunpowder, and hydrogen peroxide. IEDs have been used historically in various attacks in India and are also used as distractions in war zones. The extent of damage depends on the IED's size, construction, and placement. The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/can-you-be-sued-for-defamation-if-you-retweet-defamatory-content-9190215/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has stayed a trial against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for retweeting an allegedly defamatory YouTube video. Retweeting may not always imply endorsement, according to the court. Kejriwal's counsel admitted the post was a mistake.

In Indian law, defamation can be civil (libel/slander) or criminal (IPC Section 499). Criminal defamation requires proof beyond reasonable doubt and carries up to two years' imprisonment. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of criminal defamation laws, but reasonable restrictions can be imposed under Article 19(2).

The Delhi High Court had ruled that retweeting defamatory content prima facie attracts liability. However, the Supreme Court has observed that retweeting may simply be sharing information and not an endorsement. The case will proceed with further hearings.</description>

			<title>How climate change has fuelled farmers’ protests in Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-farmer-protests-europe-9190128/</link>
			<description>European farmers are protesting due to rising costs, cheap imports, and the impact of climate change on agriculture. The EU's environmental regulations, aimed at reducing GHG emissions, have further exacerbated the situation. Farmers argue that these regulations are too strict, unfair, and economically unviable, especially with the added burden of energy costs and competition from Ukraine's neighbors. The backlash has led to a rollback of some regulations, but the EU still needs to curtail emissions from the sector to meet its Green Deal targets without further igniting farmer unrest.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sensex-nifty-jump-1-per-cent-factors-gdp-9189716/</link>
			<description>Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty surged over 1% following the release of better-than-expected GDP growth of 8.4% for Q3 FY24. Key contributors include strong growth in manufacturing, construction, and capital formation.

Experts attribute the market rally to the solid GDP numbers and highlight the potential for large caps like Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, and ICICI Bank to lead the surge. However, tepid private consumption might impact consumer staples stocks.

While fixed investment remains a key driver of growth, consumption lags behind. The services sector shows resilience, but agriculture underperforms.

Despite the positive GDP data, Nomura projects a more moderate growth of 6.1% in 2024 and 6.2% in FY25 due to factors such as the impact of elections on public spending and weak consumption.</description>

			<title>Why the Supreme Court overturned its 2018 decision, which set a time limit on courts’ stay orders</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-decision-2018-stay-interim-orders-9189641/</link>
			<description>In 2018, the Supreme Court (SC) aimed to address delayed trials by automatically vacating stay orders by High Courts after six months. However, in 2023, a five-judge SC bench has overturned this ruling, citing concerns about "doing injustice" by nullifying lawful stay orders.

The bench held that constitutional courts should avoid setting precise timelines for case decisions, leaving discretion to lower courts familiar with local issues. They emphasized that High Courts should prioritize applications to vacate stay orders to ensure faster disposal of cases.

The ruling was based on arguments that automatic vacation of stay orders without due process violates principles of judicial fairness and that setting timelines is within Parliament's legislative powers, not the court's.</description>

			<title>India-built airstrip inaugurated in Agaléga, Mauritius: Its strategic significance vis-a-vis Maldives and China</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/agalega-airstrip-inagurated-mauritius-maldives-and-india-9189103/</link>
			<description>Indian technical personnel have replaced Indian military personnel on one of three aviation platforms in the Maldives. India also inaugurated an airstrip and jetty on Mauritius' Agaléga Island, strategically located in the Indian Ocean.

Mauritius and the Maldives are crucial outposts for India due to their maritime and strategic significance. China's increasing presence in the region has heightened India's concerns. India's withdrawal of military personnel from the Maldives follows pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu's request.

After an MoU signed in 2015, India upgraded the airstrip on Agaléga Island to enhance Mauritius' capabilities in safeguarding its interests and monitoring its Exclusive Economic Zone. Despite domestic criticism, Mauritius has managed the situation better than the Maldives, where former Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid disputes claims of foreign military presence.

India's presence in the Indian Ocean supports its maritime security interests and strengthens its relationships with island nations. However, domestic politics in these nations can influence their policies and India must navigate its diplomatic efforts carefully.</description>

The plant is significant for India's semiconductor ambitions, as domestic manufacturing of these wafers is crucial for meeting national needs. The plant is part of a government-funded initiative to boost the domestic semiconductor industry, including a ₹76,000 crore chip incentive scheme.

Semiconductors are complex products requiring specialized facilities (fabs) for manufacturing. India aims to develop its semiconductor ecosystem by attracting foreign companies and promoting domestic research. Challenges include attracting highly skilled talent and fostering original semiconductor design research, but the government is investing in R&amp;D to address these issues.</description>

			<title>How does a chatbot remember the prompts you gave it? Understanding context windows</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-are-context-windows-in-ai-9188742/</link>
			<description>ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by GPT 3.5 or GPT-4, a large language model (LLM). The chatbot interacts with users through a chat interface, similar to messengers.

Context windows are crucial for AI models to recall information during a conversation. The size of the context window determines the amount of information the model can consider at once to generate responses. Larger context windows provide more information but require more computational power and can lead to irrelevant information being included.

GPT-4 Turbo has a massive context window of 128K tokens, while Google Gemini 1.5 Pro has a context window of up to 1 million tokens. While larger windows can enhance accuracy, they come with challenges such as increased computational power, memory bandwidth, and storage requirements. Additionally, large context windows can result in repetitive or contradictory responses and a higher carbon footprint.</description>

			<title>Why homesexuality is ‘natural’ in the animal kingdom</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/homesexuality-in-animal-kingdom-9188557/</link>
			<description>Researchers observed male humpback whales engaging in sexual activity for the first time in 2022. Homosexuality is prevalent in many animal species, attributed to both biological and environmental factors. Despite reproductive implications, homosexuality persists due to hypotheses such as "indiscriminate mating," where individuals indiscriminately mate without recognizing sex. Other hypotheses suggest adaptive functions, such as fostering social bonds and reducing intrasexual aggression. Studies have found a correlation between same-sex sexual behavior and sociality, and evidence indicates it may mitigate adulticide in males. Same-sex sexual behavior is considered a convergent adaptation in mammals, providing survival benefits.</description>

			<title>Who is Abdul Karim ‘Tunda’, linked to 40 terrorist bombings, and now acquitted in one case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/who-is-abdul-karim-tunda-acquitted-bomb-blasts-9188408/</link>
			<description>Abdul Karim "Tunda," an alleged bomb expert and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, has been acquitted in a 1993 train blasts case. The acquittal comes despite being linked to numerous terrorist attacks over the years.

Tunda, born in 1943, joined the neo-fundamentalist sect after witnessing communal violence during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. He later traveled to Pakistan and received training in explosives from the ISI.

After the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, Tunda is suspected of being involved in several bombings, including the December 6, 1993, train blasts. He was also accused of raising funds and scouting recruits for LeT.

Apprehended in 2013, Tunda faced multiple cases, but was acquitted in most. Despite being convicted in a 1996 blast case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court later commuted his sentence.</description>

			<title>Why Apple has shelved its car project: Vehicles are now more about software than hardware</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/apple-shelve-car-project-ai-significance-9188455/</link>
			<description>Apple has ended its 10-year electric self-driving car project, Project Titan, to focus on generative AI and mixed-reality headsets. The shift from mechanical to software-driven vehicles has made car manufacturing more software-centric, giving Apple an advantage due to its expertise in this area.

Apple's CarPlay smartphone integration platform, supported by most new US cars, has allowed it to dominate the car software experience. CarPlay has fostered customer loyalty and given Apple control over driver data, which is expected to become increasingly valuable in the future.

The growing demand for connectivity and digital offerings in cars is driving a shift towards software integration, creating opportunities for companies like Apple. Legacy automakers are facing software challenges and are actively hiring software engineers to address this gap.</description>

			<title>Did Morarji Desai really drink his own urine?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/morarji-desai-drink-urine-birthday-leap-day-9187741/</link>
			<description>The article discusses two notable aspects of former Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai's life. Firstly, he was born on February 29, 1896, and celebrated fewer than 25 birthdays due to the rarity of leap days. Secondly, he was known for consuming his urine, a practice that has become a subject of both humor and serious discussion.

In 1978, during Desai's tenure as Prime Minister, he sought to realign India's foreign policy, moving away from its pro-Soviet stance and improving relations with the United States. This included a state visit to the U.S. and hosting President Jimmy Carter in India.

The article highlights an interview with journalist Dan Rather where Desai, then over 80 years old, attributed his good health to a diet of natural foods and the daily consumption of urine, which he defended as a natural treatment with historical and cultural significance in India. Desai claimed that urine therapy could purify the body and cure diseases at no cost.

The article concludes with a brief mention of current political events, including the anticipation among Congress leaders for candidate announcements in key constituencies and campaign activities by Prime Minister Modi and AAP's Sunita Kejriwal. However, these political updates are unrelated to the main focus on Morarji Desai.</description>

			<title>Why $60 mn Google-Reddit AI deal foretells future of content licensing for LLMs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/google-reddit-60-million-ai-deal-9186430/</link>
			<description>Google and Reddit have entered into a $60 million agreement granting Google real-time access to Reddit's data, which will be used to enhance Google's AI products. This deal comes as Reddit prepares for a public listing, potentially boosting investor confidence. The partnership highlights the importance of user-generated content for AI platforms and the challenges of training AI models without infringing on content creators' intellectual property (IP) rights.

The agreement provides Google with access to Reddit's Data API, allowing for more accurate and relevant use of Reddit's content. This move is part of Google's efforts to improve its AI system, Gemini, which has faced criticism for its responses in the US and India. Google has been working to address these issues, including apologizing for inaccuracies in historical image generation and responding to legal challenges regarding IP rights.

The New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft over the use of copyrighted content underscores the ongoing debate about online content ownership and the need for AI platforms to respect IP rights. The music industry has also expressed concerns about AI's impact on IP rights. In India, copyright laws are being reevaluated in light of AI's capabilities, as current definitions do not fully account for AI-generated works based on copyrighted material.

The article also mentions a separate issue involving the Election Commission of India and a complaint of alleged misuse of public office, unrelated to the main topic.

			<description>The Supreme Court has banned Patanjali Ayurved from advertising its products due to misleading claims. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) filed a petition after Patanjali published ads attacking allopathic medicine, claiming it was "stupid" and responsible for COVID-19 deaths. Despite assurances from Patanjali to the court that such claims would cease, the company continued to publish misleading ads claiming "permanent relief" for diseases and superiority over conventional medicines. The court deemed Patanjali's actions "unacceptable" and imposed a blanket ban on all advertising of its medicinal products until further orders. The case will be heard again on March 19.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/national-science-day-cv-raman-9185655/</link>
			<description>In 1986, India instituted National Science Day to commemorate Sir CV Raman's discovery of the "Raman Effect" in 1930, earning him a Nobel Prize. The Raman Effect occurs when light passing through a liquid scatters, resulting in a different color due to changes in wavelength.

CV Raman, born in 1888, published his first research paper at 18 and began his breakthrough experiments on light scattering after becoming an assistant accountant general in Calcutta. His observations on the Mediterranean Sea's blue color led to the discovery.

Raman's discovery revolutionized quantum theory and gave birth to Raman spectroscopy, a tool for chemical analysis. Today, it has diverse applications, including studying art, detecting drugs, and conducting non-invasive examinations.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-karnataka-temple-bill-controversry-9184880/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government's proposal to increase Hindu temple taxation by diverting a portion of their gross income to a common pool failed in the Legislative Council due to opposition from the BJP. The Bill aimed to redistribute temple income to support lower-income temples and provide benefits to priests. However, the BJP criticized the government for targeting Hindu temples alone and claimed that the funds would not be used for religious purposes.

Other states have different approaches to temple revenue management. Telangana has a Common Good Fund where religious institutions contribute a percentage of their income for temple maintenance and religious education. Kerala has Devaswom Boards that manage temples and receive state funding, but revenue figures are not publicly disclosed.</description>

			<title>SC terms woman military officer’s 1988 discharge ‘illegal’: How courts have ruled for women in armed forces</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-woman-military-officers-armed-forces-9184035/</link>
			<description>- Lt. Selina John, a former permanent commissioned officer in the Military Nursing Service (MNS), was released from service in 1988 due to her marriage, which was deemed a violation of gender equality.


- The Armed Forces Tribunal deemed the termination illegal and ordered her reinstatement with back wages, but the Central government challenged this order in the Supreme Court.


- The Supreme Court upheld the tribunal's decision, stating that the government's rule terminating employment due to marriage was discriminatory and illegal.


- The court directed the government to pay Rs 60 lakhs in compensation to Lt. John and rejected the argument that women nursing officers were unfit for service due to marriage or childbirth.


- The Supreme Court's decision aligns with a previous ruling in 2020 that granted permanent commission to women officers in the Army, recognizing their right to pursue full-length careers.


- Despite this ruling, military nurses were not granted the status of ex-servicemen, affecting their re-employment opportunities and benefits.


- A Punjab and Haryana High Court division bench recently ruled that MNS officers should be considered ex-servicemen under the Punjab Recruitment of Ex-Servicemen Rules, 1982, acknowledging their service to the nation.</description>

			<title>US airman sets himself on fire: History of self-immolation as a tool of protest, politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/us-man-sets-fire-palestine-self-immolation-protest-9183426/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the history and impact of self-immolation as a form of political protest. It begins with a recent incident where a U.S. Air Force airman, Aaron Bushnell, self-immolated in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington DC to protest Israeli actions in Palestine. The article then traces the practice back to its modern origins with the self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc in Vietnam in 1963, which was a protest against the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government.

The article continues to explore other notable instances of self-immolation, including Jan Palach in Czechoslovakia in 1969, which was a call to action against Soviet occupation, and the anti-reservation protests in India in 1990, sparked by Rajeev Goswami's self-immolation. It also mentions the significant number of self-immolations in Tibet as a protest against Chinese occupation, highlighting the differing perspectives on whether these acts are violent or nonviolent.

Lastly, the article connects self-immolation to the Arab Spring, beginning with Mohamed Bouazizi's act in Tunisia in 2010, which led to widespread protests and the fall of several regimes in the Arab world. The article concludes with a statement from President Joe Biden on the contributions of immigrants to the U.S., contrasting his views with those of former President Donald Trump.</description>

			<title>Three proposals from Tesla, BYD and VinFast, three policy responses in India’s Electric Vehicles push</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/three-proposals-three-policy-responses-in-indias-ev-push-9182676/</link>
			<description>1.  Tesla is seeking lower import duties on EVs in exchange for a guaranteed financial commitment of about $2 billion in a proposed EV facility in India.
2.  VinFast Auto, a Vietnamese automaker, is setting up an integrated EV manufacturing site in Tamil Nadu and has requested import duty concessions for a limited time to familiarize customers with its products while a local manufacturing plant is being built.
3.  BYD, a Chinese automaker, was reportedly denied permission to build a $1 billion EV plant in India due to national security concerns. BYD is a leader in battery technology and has developed a cost-effective and safer "blade battery."
4.  The Indian government's approach to these three automakers has varied, with Tesla receiving potential tax incentives, VinFast following the regular dispensation, and BYD facing disincentives.</description>

			<title>Gyanvapi case: Why Allahabad HC called Mulayam govt order restraining puja in Vyasji ka tehkhana ‘illegal’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/gyanvapi-allahabad-hc-mulayam-puja-vyasji-ka-tehkhana-illegal-9182378/</link>
			<description>The Allahabad High Court upheld the Varanasi district court's decision allowing Hindus to worship in the 'Vyasji ka tehkhana', a cellar within the Gyanvapi mosque complex. The Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee's appeal against this order was dismissed. The Vyas family, who claim ownership of the cellar and have been conducting prayers there since 1551, were previously ordered to stop by the UP government in 1993. The Allahabad HC found this state order to be a continuous wrong.

The mosque committee argued that the cellar was part of the Hanafi Muslim Waqf property as per a 1937 ruling and that the Places of Worship Act of 1991 should maintain the religious character of the place as it was in 1947. However, the Vyas family presented a map from the 1937 case showing the cellar as separate and claimed that the mosque never had possession over it.

The Allahabad HC's interim order favored the Vyas family, stating that the existence of the cellar in their possession since 1937 is prima facie proof of continuous possession until 1993. The order also opens the possibility for further investigation into the religious character of other cellars in the Gyanvapi complex based on possession and continuous worship. The lead petitioner in the main Gyanvapi dispute has applied for an ASI survey of these cellars following the district court's order.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: What are emissions scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/emissions-scenarios-representative-concentration-pathways-rcps-9182274/</link>
			<description>The article discusses **emission scenarios** and **Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)**, which are used to project the impact of human activities on future global temperatures and sea levels. RCPs are based on different levels of greenhouse gas concentrations and their resulting radiative forcing, measured in watts per square meter, by the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels.

There are four RCPs:
- **RCP2.6**: Assumes a radiative forcing increase of 2.6 watts per square meter, representing the best-case scenario with significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
- **RCP4.5 and RCP6**: Intermediate scenarios with global average temperature increases of 2.4 and 2.8 degrees Celsius, respectively.
- **RCP8.5**: The worst-case scenario predicting a temperature rise of 4.3 degrees Celsius due to a tripling of pollutant concentrations.

RCPs incorporate scientific and socioeconomic data, including population growth, GDP, and energy sources, to model climate outcomes. They are not forecasts or policy recommendations but serve to illustrate a range of possible climate futures. The article is part of a series explaining climate change, with links to previous parts provided at the end.</description>

			<title>What is the new FPI fraud SEBI has warned investors against</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-the-new-fpi-fraud-sebi-has-warned-investors-against-9182277/</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued a warning about fraudulent trading platforms that falsely claim to be associated with its registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). These platforms are deceiving individuals by offering trading opportunities through FPI or FII sub-accounts with supposed special privileges. SEBI has received complaints about fraudsters using online trading courses, seminars, and social media to lure victims into downloading apps that falsely promise the ability to buy shares or subscribe to IPOs without an official trading or Demat account.

SEBI clarified that the FPI investment route is not available to resident Indians, except for a few exceptions mentioned in the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019. There is no such thing as an 'Institutional Account' for direct equities market access, and investors need a trading and Demat account with a SEBI-registered broker/trading member and depository participant. SEBI has not relaxed any rules for FPIs concerning securities market investments by Indian investors and advises caution against any schemes claiming SEBI endorsement for stock market access through FPIs or FIIs. These schemes are fraudulent and not approved by SEBI.</description>

			<title>As China signs panda conservation pact with US zoo, a look-back at ‘Panda diplomacy’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/as-china-us-a-look-back-at-panda-diplomacy-9182205/</link>
			<description>China has renewed its commitment to panda conservation by signing agreements with zoos in the United States and Spain. This move is seen as a positive sign for diplomatic relations, especially with the US, amidst recent tensions. The agreements are part of China's long-standing 'Panda diplomacy,' which uses the native giant pandas as ambassadors to foster international friendships.

The history of Panda diplomacy dates back to the 19th century and has been a tool for political alliances, such as during WWII. However, the practice of gifting pandas shifted to loaning in the 1980s due to conservation concerns. Zoos now pay a substantial fee to host pandas, with cubs born abroad incurring additional costs.

Recent years have seen a decline in panda loans to Western countries, reflecting strained relations. Despite the downgrade of pandas from "endangered" to "vulnerable," their low survival rate in the wild raises questions about conservation priorities. China's global image, affected by various geopolitical tensions, also influences the effectiveness of Panda diplomacy.</description>

			<title>Is the Philippines’ Marcos Jr the EU’s new best friend?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/philippines-marcos-jr-eu-best-friend-9182102/</link>
			<description>Since assuming office in 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has strengthened the Philippines' ties with the US and the EU, contrasting with his predecessor's contentious relations. Marcos Jr. has signed a defense agreement with the US and is repairing relations with the EU, damaged during Duterte's tenure due to his "war on drugs." The Philippines and the EU are resuming free trade talks, and the EU has signed a financing agreement for the Philippines' Green Economy Programme. Analysts suggest these moves are influenced by geopolitical shifts, particularly the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has prompted Europe to diversify its partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.

Marcos Jr.'s pro-Western stance has led to increased tensions with China, especially over South China Sea disputes. He has also canceled Chinese infrastructure projects, potentially opening opportunities for the EU's Global Gateway Initiative. Despite concerns about democracy and human rights in the Philippines, European leaders view Marcos Jr. as a reliable partner, willing to overlook certain issues to maintain strong relations. However, challenges remain, such as the International Criminal Court's investigation into Duterte and potential constitutional changes that could affect democracy and presidential power in the Philippines. Relations with other Southeast Asian nations are varied, with the EU being cautious or critical of their leadership and policies. Overall, the EU and the Philippines aim to continue improving their relationship, driven by strategic interests rather than personal relations.</description>

			<title>Explained: What is an LLM, the backbone of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-an-llm-the-backbone-of-ai-chatbots-like-chatgpt-gemini-9180776/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of computers from simple instruction-following machines to advanced entities capable of learning, thinking, and conversing, known as generative AI. It focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), which are a subset of generative AI that can predict text and "converse" with humans. LLMs are described as large, general-purpose models that can be pre-trained on vast datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks across various industries. They are categorized based on architecture (autoregressive, transformer-based, encoder-decoder), training data (pretrained and fine-tuned, multilingual, domain-specific), size, and availability (open-source, closed-source). The article explains that LLMs operate on deep learning principles, using artificial neural networks to predict word sequences. They are likened to a baby learning to speak by observing patterns and relationships in language. LLMs have diverse applications, including content creation, language understanding, and personalization in marketing. Their versatility allows them to generalize patterns and improve performance with more data and parameters. The article concludes by highlighting the continuous development of LLMs and their expanding role in AI. The author, Bijin Jose, is a technology journalist with a background in English literature and a focus on artificial intelligence.</description>

			<title>PM Modi flags off railway project in Jammu and Kashmir: Route, challenges, benefits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-railway-project-in-jammu-and-kashmir-explained-9180749/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Banihal-Sangaldan railway section, part of a line connecting Baramulla and Udhampur. This section includes India's longest tunnel and aims to enhance connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir. The project is significant for providing an alternative travel route to the Valley when roads are closed, promoting tourism, and boosting the economy. The Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway line is nearing completion, with the Valley expected to join the Indian Railways network soon. The line's construction faced geological challenges, leading to innovative tunneling methods. Once operational, it will reduce travel time between Srinagar and Jammu, facilitate goods transport, and lower transportation costs. Four cargo terminals are also planned along the route.</description>

			<title>3 ways in which the newly amended Electricity Rules boost rooftop solar power; empower consumers &amp; EV owners</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/new-amended-electricity-rules-rooftop-solar-consumers-ev-9180002/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of Power in India has introduced amendments to the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020, which aim to facilitate the installation of rooftop solar projects and enhance consumer rights. Key changes include:

- **Easing the requirement** for a technical feasibility report for rooftop solar projects.
- Allowing residential societies to choose between individual connections or a single-point connection through voting.
- Mandating DISCOMs to install an additional meter to address complaints about inaccurate meter readings.
- Reducing the timeline for obtaining new electricity connections and modifications, with specific provisions for electric vehicle (EV) charging points.
- Simplifying the process for rooftop solar installations by deeming proposals technically feasible if not studied within 15 days, and accepting solar PV systems up to 10 kilowatts without a study.
- DISCOMs will bear the costs of strengthening distribution infrastructure for rooftop solar projects up to 5 kilowatts.
- The period between the installation and commissioning of rooftop solar projects has been shortened from 30 to 15 days.

These amendments follow the launch of the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, which offers subsidies for rooftop solar installations, potentially benefiting 1 crore households and saving significant electricity costs annually.

For residential societies, the amendments provide a framework for opting for individual or single-point connections, with the decision made through a transparent ballot. The rules also outline the responsibilities of DISCOMs and residential associations regarding metering, billing, and collection based on the type of connection chosen.

Additionally, the rules now include provisions for EV owners to obtain separate electricity connections for charging points within revised timelines, enhancing the infrastructure for EVs in metropolitan cities. 

These amendments represent the fourth revision since the original notification in 2020 and reflect the government's commitment to promoting renewable energy and consumer empowerment.</description>

			<title>Congress alleges I-T Dept withdrew 65cr from its accounts: Do political parties have to pay Income tax?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/political-parties-congress-exempt-income-tax-9179802/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Congress party's allegations against the Income Tax Department for instructing banks to transfer over Rs. 65 crore from the accounts of the Congress and its affiliates, despite a pending tax demand challenge. The Congress treasurer termed this as "economic terrorism" and a targeted move by the central government. The law exempts registered political parties from income tax under certain conditions, which the Congress claims to have met. The party is challenging a Rs. 210 crore tax demand for the financial year 2018-2019, asserting that it has complied with all legal requirements for tax exemption. The case is currently with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which has reserved its order. The article implies that the move to transfer funds is politically motivated, aimed at financially impacting the Congress ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.</description>

			<title>Five questions the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2022-23 answers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/household-consumption-expenditure-survey-2022-23-9179539/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the changing patterns of consumption expenditure in India from 1999-2000 to 2022-23. It highlights that both urban and rural households are spending a smaller percentage of their total consumption on food, with rural India's expenditure on food falling below 50% and urban India's below 40% for the first time. The decline in spending on cereals is significant, indicating a shift towards better nutrition and high-value foods like eggs, fish, meat, and vegetables, especially in rural areas.

The article also critiques the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) baskets, which were set in 2012 and no longer accurately reflect consumer spending patterns. This discrepancy could lead to misguided policy decisions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regarding interest rates, which are based on retail inflation data from the CPI.

Furthermore, the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO) latest Household Consumption Expenditure (HCE) Survey includes the imputed value of free items received through social welfare programs, showing a higher Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) when these items are accounted for. The survey reveals that the benefits of these free items are not evenly distributed across different segments of the population, with some fractiles receiving more in absolute terms than others.

Lastly, the article suggests that the average monthly consumption spending can indicate a family's economic well-being and provides data on the urban-rural divide in consumption spending across different states and Union Territories in India. The article concludes with unrelated content, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Why has the Assam government decided to repeal the state’s Muslim Marriage Act?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/assam-government-repeal-muslim-marriage-act-9179070/</link>
			<description>The Assam Cabinet has decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act of 1935, replacing it with the ‘Assam Repealing Ordinance 2024’. This move is part of a broader effort to introduce a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and to combat child marriage. The 1935 Act, which made the registration of Muslim marriages and divorces compulsory, has been criticized for allowing child marriage and for its informal registration process that leads to non-compliance with current norms.

Advocates have pointed out that the Act's repeal could result in more unregistered marriages due to the complexity of the Special Marriage Act, which requires a one-month notice period and more robust documentation. The government's crackdown on child marriage and the push for a UCC come amidst concerns over the demographic impact of Bengali-origin Muslim migration and are seen as part of a series of interventions in family and marriage laws. The Assam government aims to eradicate child marriage by 2026 and is also considering a bill to ban polygamy. The state's tribal communities are expected to be exempt from the proposed UCC.</description>

			<title>PM inaugurates Signature Bridge in Gujarat: All about India’s longest cable-stayed bridge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/narendra-modi-inaugurate-gujarat-sudarshan-setu-signature-bridge-9179281/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Sudarshan Setu, also known as the Signature Bridge, in the Gulf of Kutch on February 25. This bridge is India's longest cable-stayed bridge and connects mainland Gujarat with Bet Dwarka island. The bridge spans 4,772 meters, with a 900-meter-long cable-stayed section, and was constructed for Rs 978 crore, funded by the Union government.

The Signature Bridge is a significant infrastructure project for Gujarat, providing all-weather road connectivity to Bet Dwarka island, which is a major pilgrimage and religious tourism spot. The bridge features 32 piers supporting seven cable-stayed spans, allowing the movement of fishing boats. It also includes walkways with solar panels and decorations related to Hindu scriptures and imagery.

The bridge's construction was part of National Highway 51 and was built by S P Singla Constructions Private Limited. Despite concerns raised due to the firm's previous project collapse, the Gujarat government officials were confident about the bridge's completion.

The inauguration of the bridge is expected to impact the local ferry boat service, with operators anticipating a decrease in passenger traffic. Discussions about fare adjustments and alternative business models, such as dolphin viewing tours, are underway among the boat operators.

The article also mentions political developments unrelated to the bridge, including the anticipation of candidate announcements for the Nehru-Gandhi seats and political campaigning in Gujarat. However, these details are not directly related to the main topic of the Signature Bridge.</description>

			<title>Why Maharashtra is exempting private schools from RTE quota admissions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/maharashtra-exempting-private-schools-rte-quota-9178656/</link>
			<description>The article discusses changes to the Right Of Children To Free And Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act) in Maharashtra. The RTE Act mandates that private schools must admit 25% of their Class 1 students from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, with fee concessions reimbursed by the state government. However, a new rule exempts private schools within a 1 km radius of a government or aided school from this requirement, directing students to these schools instead. This change aligns Maharashtra with Karnataka and Kerala, which have similar exemptions. The rationale is to encourage enrollment in government schools, which has declined due to the previous policy. Private schools have often not been reimbursed as required, leading to financial strain. The new rule has received mixed reactions, with some private schools welcoming it, while others criticize it for limiting access to quality education for disadvantaged students. The article also briefly mentions an upcoming IPL 2024 cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals.</description>

			<title>RBI to NPCI: Consider Paytm’s request for TPAP. What is it, how will it benefit users?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-asks-npci-to-consider-paytms-request-for-tpap-9178418/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has directed the National Payments Council of India (NPCI) to review One97 Communications' (OCL) request to become a Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP) for the Paytm app's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) operations. This comes after RBI's order to Paytm Payments Bank (PPBL), an associate of OCL, to cease operations by March 15, 2024, which would leave Paytm without a TPAP for UPI services. TPAPs are essential for offering UPI transactions and must comply with NPCI's security and compliance standards. The RBI has taken steps to ensure uninterrupted UPI services for Paytm users, suggesting that if NPCI approves OCL as a TPAP, the '@paytm' handles should be smoothly transferred to other banks. However, OCL cannot onboard new users until existing ones are satisfactorily migrated. The RBI also recommended certifying multiple banks to handle high-volume UPI transactions, reducing concentration risk in the UPI ecosystem. This migration applies only to customers and merchants with a '@Paytm' UPI handle. The article also mentions that there are currently 22 NPCI-approved UPI apps available. Separately, the Election Commission of India has transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office during elections.</description>

			<title>Govt announced Fair and Remunerative Price for sugarcane: How FRP differs from MSP</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/frp-msp-difference-9178410/</link>
			<description>The Centre has increased the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane to **Rs 340 per quintal** for the 2024-25 sugar season, up from Rs 315. This is particularly impactful for Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, major sugarcane producers with significant political representation. The FRP, set by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, is the minimum price sugar mills are legally bound to pay farmers. Failure to pay within 14 days can result in legal action and property attachment.

The FRP is linked to sugar recovery rates from cane, with the base rate set at a 10.25% recovery. Adjustments are made for variations in recovery rates. The government also provides a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for sugar and other crops to guarantee farmers a minimum income and manage market volatility. The MSP is determined annually based on various factors, including production costs and market trends, advised by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices.

In 2018, the government introduced an MSP for sugar to stabilize prices and ensure mills could pay the FRP to farmers. Measures included a fixed sales quota for mills, with penalties for non-compliance under the Essential Commodities Act. These steps were intended to help mills clear dues to farmers, addressing a longstanding issue of payment delays. The article also briefly mentions an upcoming IPL match, unrelated to the main content.</description>

**Feb-July 2022:** Russia initiated an invasion of Ukraine with airstrikes and a ground assault from multiple directions. Resistance was met, particularly around Kyiv, with high civilian casualties. After withdrawing from Kyiv, evidence of war crimes in Bucha surfaced. Ukraine sank Russia's Moskva ship, and by the end of May, Russia controlled most Ukrainian Black Sea ports except Odesa. Russia also made advances in Luhansk province, contributing to a global food crisis, which led to the Black Sea Grain Initiative.

**Aug-Dec 2022:** Fighting intensified in southern Ukraine, raising concerns of a nuclear incident at Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine's counter-offensive regained territory, and Russia faced setbacks, including a damaged supply route via the Kerch Strait bridge. By year's end, Ukraine had reclaimed significant areas, reducing Russian control to 14% of Ukraine.

**Jan-May 2023:** NATO's support for Ukraine continued with promises of military aid. The Battle of Bakhmut became emblematic of the war's stalemate. Despite heavy losses, Russia captured Bakhmut in May.

**June-Nov 2023:** Ukraine's counteroffensive began in June but faced challenges, and Western support appeared to wane. Russia maintained pressure on Kyiv with attacks and captured Avdiivka in February, marking a notable gain.

This summary focuses on the key military and political developments during the specified period, omitting unrelated content. The situation remains complex and dynamic, with ongoing military operations and geopolitical implications.</description>

			<title>Donor gametes are allowed: what the new rule on surrogacy says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/donor-gametes-are-allowed-what-the-new-rule-on-surrogacy-says-9177795/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent amendment to India's surrogacy regulations, which now permits the use of donor eggs or sperm for couples seeking surrogacy. This change reverses a previous ban from March 2023 on the use of donor gametes. The new rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes if one partner in the couple has a certified medical condition. Single women who are widowed or divorced can also opt for surrogacy but must use their own eggs.

The amendment is seen as beneficial for older women or those with certain medical conditions that prevent egg production. Experts suggest that surrogacy is often the last resort after other fertility treatments and is necessary for women with specific uterine conditions. The article also touches on the challenges to the surrogacy laws, particularly regarding the restrictions on single, unmarried women and the LGBTQ community, and the medical necessity of surrogacy in cases of IVF failure.

The article concludes with a brief profile of Anonna Dutt, the health correspondent who reported the story, highlighting her career and interests. It also mentions unrelated content about a political figure's travel, which is not connected to the main topic of surrogacy.</description>

			<title>Sita &amp; Akbar: How names of two lions became the reason for a plea in Calcutta High Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sita-akbar-lions-plea-calcutta-high-court-9177020/</link>
			<description>The Calcutta High Court has advised the West Bengal government to rename two lions in a North Bengal safari park to avoid controversy. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had filed a petition regarding the names 'Akbar' and 'Sita' given to the lions, claiming it was blasphemous and disrespectful to Hindu beliefs. Justice Saugata Bhattacharyya suggested animals should have uncontroversial names and not be named after revered figures. The court has reclassified the VHP's writ petition as a public interest litigation (PIL) to be reviewed by a regular Bench.

The issue arose when the VHP learned of the lions' names through media reports. Despite assurances from the safari park director that no official names were given, a memo from the State Zoo Authority suggested otherwise. The VHP's plea contends that the naming hurts Hindu religious sentiments and could lead to social unrest. They requested the court to mandate the use of non-religious names for animals.

During the hearing, the court sought clarity on who named the lions and considered the petition's admissibility. The state government indicated that 'Akbar' and 'Sita' were informal names from the lions' previous zoo in Tripura and mentioned the possibility of renaming them.

The article also briefly mentions Vidhu Vinod Chopra's account of casting Sanjay Dutt in 'Munna Bhai,' which is unrelated to the main story about the lions' naming controversy.</description>

			<title>First moon-landing by private company: What it means for lunar exploration</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/odysseus-private-company-moon-landing-9176916/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant milestone in lunar exploration with the successful landing of the US spacecraft 'Odysseus' on the Moon, marking the first time a private space company has achieved this feat. Built by Intuitive Machines and launched via SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, Odysseus carried six NASA payloads and landed in the Moon’s south pole region, following the footsteps of Chandrayaan-3 and Japan's SLIM. This event signifies a shift from the historic Apollo missions, focusing on establishing a sustainable infrastructure for long-term human presence and utilization of lunar resources.

The Artemis program, which heavily involves private and commercial space agencies, aims to create a sustainable lunar economy and infrastructure. Despite an initial setback with Astrobotic's failed mission, Odysseus's success under the Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative heralds a series of planned lunar landings, with NASA contracting 14 space companies for future missions. This initiative is a step towards the US's goal of returning humans to the Moon by 2026 through the Artemis program.</description>

			<title>‘The world’s most valuable chipmaker’: How Nvidia saw a 250% surge in revenues amid AI stock rally</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nvidia-stocks-most-valuable-chipmaker-ai-rally-9176651/</link>
			<description>Nvidia Corporation, a leading chipmaker known for its advanced chips used in AI applications, has seen a significant surge in its stock value, marking the most substantial increase in nine months. This surge is part of a broader AI stock rally, driven by a 'FOMO' (fear-of-missing-out) sentiment among investors, which has positioned Nvidia as the world's most valuable chipmaker, surpassing giants like Intel and AMD.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, Nvidia's revenues reached over $22 billion, a 250% increase from the previous year, exceeding analysts' expectations. The company's gross margins also saw a dramatic rise to above 700%. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the tipping point reached by accelerated computing and generative AI, with surging demand globally.

Nvidia's market capitalization has grown by more than $600 billion this year, bringing its valuation close to $1.90 trillion. Analysts have recognized Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, controlling over 80% of it. The company's success has also positively impacted related companies, such as SoundHound and Arm, in which Nvidia has invested.

The demand for Nvidia's GPUs, essential for AI model computations, has skyrocketed due to the generative AI boom. This demand has led to a shortage, as Nvidia struggles to keep up with the influx of orders. Moody's Investors Service predicts that AI investment will continue to rise as firms transition from exploration to deployment, although a shortage of high-performance GPUs is expected to persist through 2024.

Nvidia has been advocating for the superior capabilities of GPUs over traditional CPUs for handling computation-intensive tasks, such as those required by AI applications. The company's GPUs are now a fundamental component in advanced systems for training generative AI tools, with many systems using multiple GPUs for every CPU.

The company's data center business has seen over 10% growth, outperforming competitors like AMD and Intel. Nvidia's full-stack solutions, including proprietary software and systems backing the processors, have positioned it ahead in the AI chip race. Nvidia also offers CUDA, an API for creating parallel programs with GPUs, and has a presence in the mobile computing market with its Tegra processors.

Nvidia's dominance is attributed to high entry barriers and specialization premiums in the semiconductor chip industry, where Taiwan and South Korea are major players. The company has managed to dominate various sectors, including gaming, crypto mining, and AI.

To diversify and integrate further, Nvidia is launching 'Chat with RTX', a tool that allows users to run an AI-powered chatbot offline. This move coincides with efforts by industry leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son to invest in and expand the global semiconductor industry, highlighting the growing intersection between hardware and software in the AI landscape.</description>

			<title>CBSE’s open book exam plan: What is it, why now, how it can impact students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cbses-open-book-exam-plan-what-is-it-why-now-how-it-can-impact-students-9176166/</link>
			<description>The CBSE is considering implementing open book exams (OBEs) for Classes 9 to 12 as a pilot study in select schools. This initiative, based on the National Curriculum Framework, aims to shift from rote learning to competency-based assessments. OBEs allow students to use approved study materials during exams and focus on applying concepts rather than memorization. While not new to Indian education, previous attempts like the Open Text Based Assessment were discontinued due to shortcomings. OBEs are common in higher education and were used during the pandemic by various universities. Studies suggest OBEs reduce stress and promote analytical skills, but also highlight the need for skill development to maximize their benefits. The CBSE's proposal aligns with educational reforms emphasizing practical learning and diverse assessment methods.</description>

			<title>TMC vs BJP in Bengal: What is happening in Sandeshkhali?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/tmc-vs-bjp-in-bengal-what-is-happening-in-sandeshkhali-9174161/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political turmoil in Sandeshkhali, a village in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, which has become the focal point of BJP-TMC politics. The conflict began with an ED raid on TMC leader Sheikh Shahjahan's home in connection with public distribution system irregularities. Shahjahan escaped with the help of his supporters, who also attacked the ED team.

Local women have accused Shahjahan and his aides of sexual abuse and land-grabbing, leading to protests and the destruction of properties belonging to one of the accused. The article details how Shahjahan, once a CPI(M) supporter, joined TMC and allegedly began seizing land for fish farming, targeting those who resisted.

The situation escalated with the police's failure to arrest Shahjahan, leading to threats against the women protesters and political intervention from various parties. The State Governor and opposition leaders visited Sandeshkhali, condemning the situation and calling for inquiries, while the Chief Minister accused the BJP of instigating violence and fabricating conflicts.

The Calcutta High Court expressed concern over the inability to apprehend Shahjahan. Additionally, a Sikh IPS officer faced derogatory remarks from BJP workers, which were condemned by the Chief Minister and the West Bengal Police, emphasizing the state's commitment to social harmony. The officer involved denied the allegations.

The article concludes with unrelated content about an upcoming IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals. The summary focuses on the main political and social issues discussed in the article, omitting the unrelated content as per your request.</description>

			<title>New offer from Air India Express: how do ‘hand baggage-only’ fares work?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/new-offer-from-air-india-express-how-do-hand-baggage-only-fares-work-9174151/</link>
			<description>Air India Express has introduced a new fare category called "Xpress Lite fares," which are **cabin baggage-only** fares. This move is a significant shift in the Indian aviation industry, where such fares have not been popular due to regulatory constraints and consumer habits. The Xpress Lite fares will be lower than regular fares and include a **10 kg cabin baggage allowance**. Passengers can also pre-book check-in baggage at discounted rates or purchase it at the airport for a higher price.

The unbundling of fares allows airlines to offer lower base prices by separating services like baggage and in-flight amenities. This strategy appeals to **price-sensitive customers** and **corporate travelers** who prefer not to pay for services they don't need. Additionally, it can lead to fuel savings for airlines due to lower luggage loads and the opportunity to generate revenue from cargo space.

Historically, Indian carriers have struggled to implement such fares due to regulatory caps on check-in baggage charges. However, with the cap removed and Air India Express leading the way, other Indian airlines may soon adopt similar fare structures, potentially transforming the pricing model in the Indian aviation market. This strategy aligns with global trends where low-cost carriers have successfully used unbundling, and even full-service carriers have adopted it to remain competitive. Some low-cost carriers have also started offering bundled fares to attract passengers seeking additional comforts.</description>

			<description>The article discusses Israel's response to the disruption of maritime trade due to Houthi rebel attacks on Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea. To circumvent the danger zone, Israel, through its Transport Minister Miri Regev, has announced an alternative trade route involving the Mundra port in Gujarat, India. This new route will see goods shipped from Mundra to UAE ports like Jebel Ali, then transported overland through Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Israel. The route, which is a result of the challenges posed by the war, is expected to reduce travel time and costs for Israel and generate revenue for Saudi Arabia and Jordan. However, it is limited by the capacity of trucks compared to ships and relies on stable relations between Israel and the transit countries. The route may also play a role in the future India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), which aims to connect India to Europe via the Middle East. The article highlights the strategic economic implications of this new corridor amidst the ongoing conflict in the region.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking: Beyond MSPs and protests, some basic facts about Indian farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/farmers-protest-msp-indian-agriculture-economics-explained-9172435/</link>
			<description>The article provides an in-depth analysis of the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) issue in India, which has been a focal point of farmer protests. MSPs are government-announced prices for crops intended to ensure farmers a minimum profit in case market prices fall. The article discusses the historical context of MSPs, the shift in public opinion, and the political polarization surrounding the protests.

**Key points include:**
- The decline in agriculture's contribution to India's GDP from 54% to less than 18%, while the workforce in agriculture remains high at around 55%.
- The shift from a majority of cultivators to a majority of agricultural laborers on farms, indicating the growing infeasibility of farming.
- The small size of land holdings among Indian farmers, with about 70% having less than 1 hectare, and the high levels of indebtedness among them.
- The Terms of Trade (ToT) for farmers have been negative, suggesting that they are worse off financially.
- International comparisons showing India's low ranking in terms of producer protection and agricultural support.

The article concludes that MSPs are not the sole issue but part of a larger structural problem in Indian agriculture, which is unremunerative for most farmers. It suggests that short-term solutions like tweaking MSPs are insufficient and that comprehensive measures are needed to address the long-standing issues in the sector. The article also touches upon the lack of government support and the need for job creation outside of agriculture to alleviate the distress. The author invites readers to share their views and queries, indicating an ongoing discussion on the subject.</description>

			<title>Art 142, why SC quashed Chandigarh mayor’s election, and why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/art-142-why-sc-quashed-chandigarh-mayors-election-and-why-it-matters-9171963/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has annulled the results of the Chandigarh Mayoral election held on January 30, after it was found that the presiding officer, Anil Masih, had intentionally invalidated eight votes in favor of the AAP-Congress candidate, Kuldeep Kumar 'Tita'. The court declared Kuldeep Kumar as the validly elected candidate, using its constitutional powers to ensure justice and uphold the democratic process. The invalidated votes were deemed valid, giving Kuldeep a total of 20 votes against the BJP candidate Manoj Sonkar's 16. The court's decision came after evidence showed Masih had marked the ballot papers to render them invalid, which led to the BJP's Sonkar initially being declared the winner. The court criticized Masih's actions as unlawful and deceptive, leading to a show cause notice being issued against him. The mayoral position in Chandigarh is influential in setting agendas and calling meetings, with the term for the mayor lasting one year within the corporation's five-year term. This election was particularly notable due to the first-time alliance between AAP and Congress, which could indicate future collaborations for the Lok Sabha elections. The election had been postponed from its original date and was rescheduled after legal intervention by Kuldeep. The BJP had claimed a majority with the support of an SAD councillor, but the court's verdict prevented a potential shift in power that could have occurred if a fresh election had been ordered, especially after three AAP councillors defected to the BJP. The article also mentions a separate issue where the Election Commission of India transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan, wife of BJD leader V K Pandian, due to allegations of misusing her public office for electoral gains.</description>

			<title>Russia captures Avdiivka: What this means for Ukraine, the war, and Europe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/russia-captures-avdiivka-what-this-means-for-ukraine-the-war-and-europe-9171658/</link>
			<description>Summary: Russia celebrates a significant victory by capturing the strategic town of Avdiivka in Ukraine, a major resistance stronghold near Donetsk. This victory opens doors for further Russian advancement and poses challenges for Ukrainian forces. The fall of Avdiivka exposes Ukraine's shortage of arms and ammunition, affecting their ability to defend against the overpowering Russian military. Western aid delays, specifically a stalled $60 billion package in the US House of Representatives, exacerbate Ukraine's vulnerabilities. The fall of Avdiivka raises concerns in Europe about increasing defense spending amid Russia's assertiveness, emphasizing the shifting security landscape and the need for greater self-reliance.</description>

			<title>What is Article 142, invoked by SC to overturn Chandigarh mayoral poll results?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-article-142-chandigarh-mayoral-poll-results-9171621/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently overturned the results of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation's mayoral elections using its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. This article delves into the history and scope of Article 142, highlighting its unique ability to deliver complete justice even in situations where existing laws may not provide a remedy. The court's rulings in various cases, such as the Bhopal gas tragedy case, have shaped the understanding and application of Article 142. Criticism surrounding the broad and potentially arbitrary nature of these powers is addressed, emphasizing the need for self-regulation to prevent misuse. The article also discusses the judiciary's accountability and the importance of the separation of powers. Despite these criticisms, the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution limited the use of Article 142 to exceptional circumstances where existing laws fall short. Additionally, the Supreme Court has set limits on its own exercise of power under Article 142 to ensure justice according to law rather than sympathy or illegality.</description>

			<title>SC directs govts to follow ‘broad’ definiton of forests: How they are defined, what law says on conservation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-forests-definition-conservation-9171444/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has instructed governments to adhere to the expansive definition of forests from its 1996 T N Godavarman case until a consolidated record of all types of forests in India is compiled. The court recently ruled that the 2023 amendments to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, had weakened the Act by narrowing its scope. The government's amendments aimed to specifically identify forests as per government records, which was a response to perceived expansion of the Act's applicability. The court emphasized that the Act would apply to all lands identified as forests or resembling the dictionary meaning of forests. Future decisions will be based on the progress of expert committees identifying protected forest areas. The matter is set for final hearing in July.</description>

			<title>What are Money Bills and why are they the subject of a constitutional challenge?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/money-bills-supreme-court-criteria-electoral-bonds-9171044/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal debate before the Supreme Court regarding what constitutes a money Bill. This debate is crucial as money Bills offer a faster route for enacting laws by Parliament and involve specific conditions related to financial matters. Recent challenges have questioned the validity of passing certain Acts, like the Aadhaar Act and the Finance Act, through the money Bill route. Justices have expressed differing opinions on the constitutionality of these Acts as money Bills, highlighting the importance of clarifying this issue. The pending decision by a seven-judge bench will likely impact future legal challenges against Acts passed through the money Bill route, such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Aadhaar Act.</description>

			<title>Why Canada’s Opposition leader demanded to know ‘WTF!’ in the country’s Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canada-poilievre-justin-trudeau-arrivecan-wtf-9170678/</link>
			<description>Canada's Leader of Opposition, Pierre Poilievre, highlighted in Parliament that the Canadian government paid $258 million over several years to a small company involved in creating an app for safe travel during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company, GC Strategies, received numerous contracts without competitive bidding, leading to concerns of financial mismanagement. The Auditor General's report revealed that the Canada Border Services Agency and other government bodies failed to follow good management practices in the app's development and contracting process. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has responded by suspending contracts with GC Strategies and pledging cooperation with investigations. The scandal has compounded Trudeau's political challenges leading up to the 2025 general elections, with the Opposition linking the financial irregularities to the country's growing cost of living crisis and declining support for liberal immigration policies.</description>

			<title>Situation report in pulses, cotton: The crops in Centre’s MSP proposal to protesting farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/situation-report-in-pulses-cotton-crops-in-centres-msp-proposal-to-farmers-9170063/</link>
			<description>During recent talks, the Indian government proposed crop diversification in Punjab, suggesting cooperatives to procure five crops at MSP. The farmers demand guaranteed MSP for all crops nationwide and rejected the proposal. Punjab's heavy focus on water-intensive paddy cultivation has led to groundwater depletion. Despite efforts to diversify crops, cotton and maize cultivation areas have decreased, while pulses' area has risen. India aims for self-sufficiency in pulses by 2027 through MSP incentives and procurement schemes. Punjab contributes minimally to CCI's cotton procurement. NAFED procured significant quantities of pulses under PSS and PSF, but concerns exist regarding their disposal below MSP.</description>

			<title>La Nina impacted air quality in India in the winter of 2022: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/la-nina-impacted-air-quality-in-india-what-a-new-study-says-9170062/</link>
			<description>A recent study by Indian researchers from the National Institute of Advanced Studies and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has linked air quality in Indian cities to La Nina events. In the winter of 2022, northern cities like Delhi experienced cleaner air due to a deviation from normal wind patterns, while western and southern cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai saw worse air quality. The change in wind direction transported pollutants from agricultural waste burning in Punjab and Haryana to southern regions, impacting cities like Mumbai. The study suggests that the extended La Nina event lasting three years influenced these anomalous wind patterns, highlighting the potential impact of La Nina on air quality trends in India.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/round-4-government-punjab-farmers-protest-talks-9169756/</link>
			<description>During recent talks, the government proposed diversification into pulses, cotton, and maize to address farmers' concerns. They assured minimum support prices (MSP) for these crops without quantity limitations. The proposal includes procurement by cooperative agencies and legal contracts for farmers. Punjab Chief Minister and farm unions support the idea, citing benefits such as reduced water dependency and increased income. The proposal aims to address water scarcity issues and could aid in crop diversification. However, uncertainties remain, as farmers are reviewing the proposal before making a final decision. The move is crucial for Punjab, facing water scarcity and desertification issues due to paddy cultivation.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/kerala-cpm-tp-chandrasekharan-murder-life-imprisonment-9169593/</link>
			<description>The Kerala High Court upheld the life imprisonment of 10 individuals, including three CPI(M) leaders, in the T P Chandrasekharan murder case, a highly sensational crime from 12 years ago. Chandrasekharan, a former CPM member turned RMP leader, was brutally murdered by assailants in a calculated attack.

			<title>Warming up to climate change: How does climate change impact extreme weather events?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-impact-extreme-weather-events-9169603/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of climate change on extreme weather events due to the increase in global temperatures. It notes that rising temperatures have led to more frequent and intense events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. While it's challenging to attribute specific events solely to climate change, studies can indicate how warming climate exacerbates these events. For instance, heatwaves and droughts are becoming more severe due to global warming, leading to dire consequences like famine and displacement of populations. The article also mentions how warmer temperatures amplify hurricanes, with oceans absorbing much of the excess heat, causing marine heat waves and intensifying storms. Additionally, it highlights how higher temperatures contribute to more evaporation, heavier rainfall, and increased flooding.</description>

			<title>CJI Chandrachud speaks of criticism against court vacations: The debate, explained</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/cji-chandrachud-court-vacations-judges-criticism-debate-9169237/</link>
			<description>Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud addressed criticisms regarding the vacation days allotted to Indian judges, highlighting the misconception that judges have excessive holidays. He emphasized that judges work tirelessly every day, including weekends, with district judges engaged in legal aid camps and administrative tasks. The Supreme Court operates for 193 days annually, while High Courts and trial courts function for approximately 210 and 245 days, respectively. Despite scheduled breaks, judges are available in "vacation benches" to address urgent cases. The debate around vacation days stems from concerns about case backlogs and slow legal processes. Various recommendations have been made to reduce vacation periods and enhance court efficiency. Comparisons with apex courts in the US and the UK show differing workloads and vacation structures.</description>

			<title>Avdiivka falls: Five places Russia is fighting to break through Ukrainian lines</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/avdiivka-four-places-russia-is-fighting-ukraine-9168043/</link>
			<description>Russian forces have captured the Ukrainian stronghold of Avdiivka, marking a significant gain since their last major victory in Bakhmut. Ukraine faces ammunition shortages and challenges in replenishing its forces. Russia's offensive is concentrated along five major lines of attack across eastern and southern Ukraine. The fall of Avdiivka, a strategic location near Donetsk, allows Russian troops to move more efficiently and press their advantage in other areas.

Marinka, another key town, has been taken by Russian forces, enabling attacks on the Ukrainian stronghold of Vuhledar from the north. In the south, Russia aims to reclaim territory lost in Ukraine's summer counteroffensive near Robotyne. From Kreminna, Russian troops are advancing towards Kupiansk and Lyman, attempting to regain control over areas lost in late 2022.

In Bakhmut, Russian forces have regained momentum and are pushing towards Chasiv Yar, threatening the city of Kramatorsk with increased artillery fire. Despite heavy losses, Russia has maintained large troop numbers across these fronts, demonstrating a determination to advance their positions in the ongoing conflict. The situation remains tense, with both sides engaged in continuous and fierce fighting.</description>

			<title>Why is the GSLV rocket nicknamed ‘naughty boy’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/gslv-rocket-naughty-boy-why-9166963/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the launch of **INSAT-3DS**, a new-generation meteorological satellite by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which will enhance Earth monitoring capabilities. The satellite was launched aboard the **GSLV-F14 rocket**, which has had a checkered history with four failures out of 15 flights, earning it the nickname 'naughty boy'. However, this launch was successful, marking a significant achievement for ISRO.

The GSLV rocket is more powerful than the PSLV and can carry heavier satellites to geostationary and low earth orbits. Its issues have primarily been with its cryogenic engine, which is based on a reverse-engineered Russian design. Due to international pressure, Russia could not transfer the technology to India, leading to challenges for ISRO. Despite this, India has developed its own cryogenic engine, which has been successfully used in the LVM3 rocket for missions like Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3.

The successful launch of INSAT-3DS has temporarily alleviated concerns about GSLV's reliability, but it faces a significant test with the upcoming NISAR mission, a collaboration between ISRO and NASA. This mission is considered to be one of the most prestigious for GSLV. The article concludes with unrelated content regarding President Joe Biden's views on immigration and xenophobia.</description>

			<title>Why the Right wing in America dislikes Taylor Swift</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/why-right-wing-america-dislikes-taylor-swift-9165323/</link>
			<description>Former President Donald Trump criticized Taylor Swift for potentially endorsing Joe Biden, suggesting it would be disloyal after he signed the Music Modernization Act in 2018. Right-wing conspiracy theorists claim Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce, her boyfriend who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs, is a PR stunt to boost Biden's chances. Some conspiracy theories propose that the Pentagon is using Swift's large online following to combat misinformation and elevate Democrats' political aims. Others suggest that the NFL rigged games to allow Swift and Kelce to make a splashy endorsement of Biden. Swift's political involvement and endorsements have sparked dislike from the right-wing, particularly Republicans who view it as a departure from her country music roots. It remains unclear whether Swift's endorsements can significantly influence elections, but her massive fan base could potentially increase voter turnout for candidates she supports.</description>

			<title>Navalny dies in prison: How the anti-corruption crusader became Putin’s biggest rival</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/navalny-dies-prison-putin-rival-9165227/</link>
			<description>The death of Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has raised suspicions of a state-orchestrated political assassination. Navalny gained recognition as an anti-corruption activist and participated in protests against Putin in 2011-12. Despite facing obstacles, including arrest and being barred from running for public office, Navalny remained in the public eye through his YouTube channel, which produced popular videos criticizing the Kremlin. In 2020, he survived a poisoning attack with a nerve agent called Novichok, but upon returning to Russia in 2021, he was arrested and sentenced to 19 years in prison on controversial charges. Amnesty International recognized him as a "prisoner of conscience." Navalny was moved to a harsh penal colony in the Arctic Circle, where he spent significant time in isolation. His death leaves him as the last prominent Putin critic remaining in Russia, as others have either fled the country or died under mysterious circumstances. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin faces little opposition as he seeks to extend his rule beyond 2030.</description>

			<title>OpenAI launches Sora: How AI can create videos from a text prompt</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/openai-sora-videos-text-prompt-9164790/</link>
			<description>OpenAI has introduced a new AI model named Sora, which can transform text prompts into videos up to one minute long. Sora is designed to create complex scenes with detailed characters and backgrounds, understanding physical object interactions and emotions. Despite its capabilities, OpenAI acknowledges Sora's imperfections, particularly with complex prompts, and plans to consult security experts and policymakers to prevent misuse.

Sora represents a significant advancement in generative AI, as text-to-video generation has been challenging due to the complexity of moving objects in 3D space. OpenAI has demonstrated Sora's abilities with examples, including a video of a snowy Tokyo scene with sakura petals and snowflakes.

Competitors like Google's Lumiere and other companies have also developed text-to-video models, but Sora stands out with its longer video generation and detailed scene creation. OpenAI is taking safety measures before releasing Sora, including adversarial testing and feedback from creative professionals. They are also developing detection tools to identify Sora-generated content and plan to implement safety protocols similar to those used in DALL·E 3.

While promising, Sora has limitations, such as difficulty simulating complex physics and understanding cause and effect in specific scenarios. OpenAI is working on addressing these issues and engaging with various stakeholders to explore positive applications and anticipate potential abuses of the technology.</description>

			<title>Why has RBI put restraints on a certain card network?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-restraints-card-network-9164676/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has ordered an unnamed card network to stop allowing "unauthorized payments" through business cards. The regulator cited violations of payment system laws and concerns over non-compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. The RBI did not mention the specific card network, but mentioned that only one card network has enabled unapproved card payments by businesses. The arrangement involved an intermediary accepting card payments from corporates and transferring the funds to non-card accepting recipients via IMPS, RTGS, or NEFT. The RBI advised the card network to halt such arrangements until further notice, while clarifying that regular usage of business credit cards is unaffected. Visa has confirmed receiving the regulator's directive and instructed Business Payment Service Providers (BPSPs) to suspend transactions until further notice.</description>

			<title>Electoral Bonds verdict: How the proportionality test was applied in the case</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/electoral-bonds-verdict-how-the-proportionality-test-was-applied-in-the-case-9164082/</link>
			<description>A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, unanimously struck down the electoral bonds scheme, stating that the restrictions on free speech were not proportional to its goals: curbing black money and protecting donor privacy. The court emphasized that a law passed by Parliament cannot interfere with the fundamental rights listed in Part-III of the Constitution. The proportionality test, which determines if an action is a reasonable restriction, was applied in this case. The court also highlighted the importance of balancing competing fundamental rights, specifically the right to information and the right to privacy. The Chief Justice suggested that less intrusive methods, like the electoral trusts scheme, could be used to achieve the same objectives.

			<title>On what grounds RBI, EC objected to electoral bonds scheme</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/on-what-grounds-rbi-ec-objected-to-electoral-bonds-scheme-9164077/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by the electoral bonds scheme in India, particularly from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Election Commission of India (ECI). The RBI objected to the proposal of allowing other banks to issue electoral bearer bonds, citing concerns about multiple entities issuing bearer instruments and the potential for money laundering. The RBI argued that existing payment methods like cheques and digital payments could achieve the same purpose. The ECI raised objections regarding the impact on transparency in political finance and recommended reintroducing caps on corporate funding. The absence of key BJP figures in Tamil Nadu and the growing popularity of the DMK have raised concerns about the BJP's electoral prospects in the state.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court draws new red line: burden is on state to  be ‘least restrictive’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/electoral-bonds-scheme-sc-draws-new-red-line-burden-is-on-state-to-be-least-restrictive-9164175/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has struck down the electoral bonds scheme, stating that the state must prove its measure is the "least restrictive" and that there are other "equally effective" methods to achieve its goal. The court rejected the government's argument that electoral bonds are the only way to curb black money and suggested Electoral Trusts as a less restrictive alternative. It disagreed with the idea that a voter's right to know should be extinguished for donor privacy. The ruling questions whether donor anonymity can be a legitimate state interest for all donors and marks a departure in how the court balances competing rights. Previously, the court placed public interest over individual rights, but this ruling requires a proportionality test to ensure the state's action is proportional to its goal. This is a significant departure from previous cases.</description>

			<title>Shehbaz Sharif set to return as Pak PM: His career so far, why his brother Nawaz is not getting top job</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/shehbaz-sharif-profile-why-he-is-set-to-return-as-pak-pm-9163869/</link>
			<description>Shehbaz Sharif, a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), is expected to become the next Prime Minister of Pakistan. This comes as a surprise, as his older brother Nawaz Sharif was widely expected to assume the position. Shehbaz's political career includes serving as the Prime Minister of Pakistan until August 2023 and as Chief Minister of Punjab on multiple occasions. He is known for his efficient working style and infrastructure development, but his time as Prime Minister faced criticism for economic handling and allegations of corruption. Shehbaz's elevation is attributed to his better relationship with the military compared to his brother.</description>

			<title>Why did the Supreme Court strike down the Electoral Bonds Scheme?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-electoral-bonds-verdict-9163729/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has invalidated the Electoral Bonds Scheme (EBS), which allowed anonymous funding of political parties through the purchase of electoral bonds. The court also struck down amendments to electoral finance laws related to the introduction of the EBS. The petitioners argued that the scheme violated voters' right to information about political party funding. The court agreed, emphasizing the link between money and politics and the voters' right to know about potential policy changes influenced by large contributions. The court also reinstated the cap on political contributions from companies, highlighting the risk of unlimited corporate influence on elections.</description>

			<title>Electoral Bonds: How SC struck down amendments in three key laws, restored status quo restricting political donations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-electoral-bonds-verdict-restore-status-quo-9163356/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has struck down amendments made by the Indian government to key laws in order to facilitate corporate donations to political parties. These amendments, made through the Finance Acts of 2016 and 2017, were overturned alongside the Electoral Bonds Scheme. Before these amendments, political parties were required to declare all contributions over Rs 20,000 and maintain a record of donations for taxation purposes. The amendments removed the donation limit for companies and eliminated the requirement to declare and maintain a record of donations made through electoral bonds. The Supreme Court's judgment restores the previous regulations, emphasizing the importance of transparency and curbing corruption in electoral financing.</description>

			<title>Why does Kerala want the Centre to amend the Wildlife Protection Act?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kerala-centre-amend-wildlife-protection-act-9163205/</link>
			<description>The Kerala Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging the Union Government to amend sections of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The proposed amendments aim to address the escalating human-animal conflict in the state. Specifically, Kerala wants to devolve the powers of the Chief Wildlife Warden to Chief Conservators of Forests, simplifying procedures for dealing with wild animals posing a threat to human life. Additionally, Kerala seeks to have wild boar declared as vermin, allowing for the culling of their population to protect livelihoods. The state has witnessed a rise in human-animal conflicts, causing damage to agriculture and resulting in casualties. Kerala's previous attempts to control the wild boar population were hindered by a lack of licensed shooters and bureaucratic processes.</description>

			<title>Explained: China’s ‘Xiaokang’ border defence villages along the LAC, now being occupied</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/china-xiaokang-border-defence-villages-lac-9163202/</link>
			<description>Chinese residents have started occupying several of the model 'Xiaokang' border defense villages along the China-India border. These villages were constructed by China since 2019 but remained unoccupied until recently. Some of these villages are located near the Lohit Valley and Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh. The purpose of these villages, which consist of large double-storey buildings, is not entirely clear but they are believed to serve both civil and military purposes. China has constructed a total of 628 such villages along India's border with the Tibet Autonomous Region. The exact extent of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has been a point of contention between the two countries. China passed a new law in 2021, effective from January 1, 2022, concerning its land borders, which includes the border defense villages program. In response, India has announced the Vibrant Villages Programme to develop its border villages into modern villages and tourist attractions. This program aims to develop 663 border villages in the first phase, with select villages along the China-India border being prioritized for development. Both China and India have been focusing on building infrastructure and improving connectivity in their respective border regions.</description>

			<title>SC strikes down electoral bonds scheme as ‘unconstitutional’: What grounds did the verdict rely upon?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-strikes-down-electoral-bonds-scheme-as-unconstitutional-what-issues-did-the-verdict-mention-9162710/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India declared the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional in a unanimous judgment. The scheme allowed corporations and individuals to anonymously donate money to political parties through purchasing electoral bonds from the State Bank of India. The details of bond purchasers were accessible only to the bank. The court raised several issues, including whether the scheme violated the Right to Information, whether curbing black money justified restricting the Right to Information, whether the infringement of RTI was justified for donor privacy protection, and whether unlimited political contributions by companies were unconstitutional. The court concluded that the scheme violated the right to information, curbing black money was not a legitimate reason to restrict RTI, donor privacy extended to political contributions, and unlimited political contributions by companies were not permitted.</description>

			<title>Nvidia releases ‘Chat with RTX’ AI chatbot: The blurring lines between makers of GenAI software, hardware</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/the-blurring-lines-between-makers-of-genai-software-hardware-9162360/</link>
			<description>Nvidia Corporation is releasing a new tool called "Chat with RTX," which allows users to run an offline AI-powered chatbot on their Windows PC using their latest series graphic cards. The tool, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, enables users to customize a generative AI model by linking it to files, documents, and notes for queries. Nvidia's push into chatbots aligns with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's efforts to revamp the semiconductor industry and address the supply-and-demand issue of AI chips. Nvidia's advantage lies in its proprietary software, powerful GPUs, and full-stack solutions, making it a leader in AI chips. Altman, on the other hand, seeks investments to increase global chip-building capacity. This development suggests a convergence of interests between Nvidia and OpenAI, blurring the lines between hardware and software players in the AI industry.</description>

			<title>Can parties receive anonymous donations? Arguments before the Supreme Court in electoral bonds petitions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-cour-electoral-bond-verdict-anonymous-donations-9162164/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is deciding whether to strike down the central government's electoral bonds scheme, which allows anonymous donations to political parties through purchasing bonds from the State Bank of India. The petitioners argue that the scheme prevents citizens from knowing the source of donations and favors the ruling government. They also highlight gaps in the scheme, such as the lack of requirement for the donation to be connected to elections. The central government justifies the scheme by emphasizing confidentiality rather than anonymity and explaining their efforts to curb black money in politics. BCCI secretary Jay Shah emphasizes that centrally contracted players must participate in domestic red ball tournaments, considering guidance from the national cricket academy for players with physical limitations.</description>

			<title>Do high levels of ‘good’ cholesterol mean lower risk of heart disease? How HDL-C is actually linked to cardiovascular health</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/how-hdl-c-is-actually-linked-to-cardiovascular-health-9160272/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the difference between correlation and causation in diagnostic tests for health improvement. It explains that while correlations can predict risk, they do not identify the underlying cause of a disease. The example of ice cream sales and shark attacks is used to illustrate this point. The article also highlights the confusion caused by media headlines linking certain factors to health benefits without establishing causation. It specifically mentions HDL-Cholesterol (good cholesterol) and its correlation with low cardiovascular disease risk. However, clinical trials have failed to prove a causal link between HDL-Cholesterol and reduced risk. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the intricacies of markers like HDL-C and considering other factors such as LDL-C, Apolipoprotein-B, exercise, and overall health interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk. It concludes by cautioning readers to enjoy coffee for its taste rather than its potential health benefits.</description>

			<description>The article recounts the Pulwama terror attack on February 14, 2019, which resulted in the death of 40 CRPF personnel. The perpetrator, Adil Ahmad Dar, was a local recruited by Jaish-e-Muhammad. Post-attack, India's airstrike in Balakot and Pakistan's retaliatory actions escalated tensions. The NIA's investigation led to the arrest of several local suspects and the killing of four Pakistani terrorists. A significant breakthrough was achieved when a destroyed phone recovered from a terrorist provided crucial evidence. The chargesheet named both local and Pakistan-based Jaish leaders, and the investigation uncovered the network involved in the attack.</description>

			<title>Why Forms 45 and 47 are at the heart of Pakistan’s election rigging controversy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/form-45-pakistan-elections-controversy-9161589/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's February 8 election results have been marred by allegations of rigging and result manipulation. The controversy revolves around Forms 45 and 47, which are crucial for documenting and compiling election results. Form 45, also known as the 'Result of Count' form, records votes polled at a polling station and includes important information like the number of registered voters, votes cast, and candidate-wise breakdown of votes. It must be publicly displayed for transparency. After completion, Form 45 is submitted to the Returning Officer, who gathers results from all Form 45s to determine the final outcome. Form 47 documents the unconfirmed results in a constituency before official confirmation. Concerns arose when candidates were denied Form 45s, and discrepancies were found between the data in Form 45s and Form 47s. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party claimed that the results were falsely changed and challenged them in court.</description>

The article further examines consumer sentiments in rural India, which experienced a significant decline in January 2024, attributed to stagnation in commodity prices and reduced profits. Additionally, the article presents data from the Reserve Bank of India's consumer confidence survey, indicating negative consumer sentiment throughout Prime Minister Modi's second term. It concludes by questioning whether consumer sentiments can recover before the upcoming elections.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the complexity of love and relationships in the era of social media, highlighting the emergence of new terms to describe dating experiences. Terms like **ghosting**, **haunting**, **rizz**, **bread-crumbing**, **benching/cookie-jarring**, **situationship**, and **phubbing** are explored, each with its own definition and origin. For instance, **ghosting** is cutting off all contact without explanation, while **rizz** refers to charm or attractiveness. The article also examines why such terms proliferate, suggesting they provide a common language for shared experiences, help people find like-minded individuals, and reflect the influence of therapy language in everyday romance discussions. It warns against the misuse of psychological terms like **gaslighting** in casual contexts. The article concludes with a brief mention of the WBBSE releasing the Madhyamik exam results, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>What did Trump say about NATO funding and what is Article 5?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-nato-funding-article-5-9159886/</link>
			<description>Former US President Donald Trump has sparked controversy with his remarks suggesting he would not defend NATO allies who do not meet defense spending targets, even hinting at encouraging Russian aggression against them. This stance has raised concerns as it challenges the core principle of collective defense enshrined in NATO's Article 5, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. NATO, a political and military alliance formed in 1949, currently has 31 members, including the recent addition of Finland. The alliance's strength largely comes from the national defense spending of its members, with a commitment to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense—a target not met by most members last year. Trump's comments have been criticized for potentially undermining the security of all NATO members and increasing risks for American and European soldiers. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized that any suggestion of not defending allies weakens the security of all member nations. The article also mentions an unrelated update regarding the Election Commission of India's actions concerning a complaint of alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pm-modi-inaugurate-baps-temple-in-uae-features-9159741/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate the BAPS Swaminarayan temple in Abu Dhabi, which is the first Hindu temple in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The temple, built by the Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), holds significance for the Hindu community in the UAE and strengthens bilateral ties between the two nations. The temple features traditional architecture, including seven shikhars and intricate carvings representing universal values and different cultures. It sits on a 27-acre complex and was gifted 13.5 acres of land by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE. The temple is open to all visitors and boasts various amenities, including an assembly hall, community center, exhibitions, and classrooms. The construction of the temple involved the use of pink sandstone from Rajasthan and Italian marble, with over 20,000 tonnes shipped in for the project. The temple's inauguration underscores the unity and collaboration of people from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds, as exemplified by the Muslim king's donation of the land, the involvement of architects and designers from different faiths, and the support from various communities.</description>

			<title>As Congress backs farmers’ MSP demand, what has the govt committee set up in 2022 done so far?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/congress-farmers-msp-demand-sanjay-agrawal-committee-9159694/</link>
			<description>Farmers in India have been demanding the enactment of a law to guarantee minimum support prices (MSP) for all crops, as recommended by the Swaminathan Commission. In response, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge announced a decision to provide a legal guarantee for MSP, which they claimed would transform the lives of 15 crore farmer families.

This announcement coincides with the ongoing deliberations of a committee appointed by the central government to make MSP more effective and transparent. The committee, notified on July 18, 2022, is composed of 26 members, including government officials, agricultural experts, and farmers' representatives, though members of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) have not joined.

The committee's mandate includes suggestions on MSP, natural farming, and crop diversification, aiming to ensure remunerative prices for farmers' produce. Despite regular meetings and workshops, the committee, led by Sanjay Agrawal, has no specified deadline to present its report.

The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department following allegations of misuse of public office during elections. The BJP has accused her of using the scheme to influence voters on behalf of the BJD.</description>

			<description>The Australian government is considering a Bill that would establish a "right to disconnect" for workers, regulating whether employers can contact them outside of working hours. The aim is to address the blurring boundaries between work and personal life due to technology and remote work. The Bill has passed the Senate and will now go to the House of Representatives. Similar laws exist in countries like France, Italy, and Belgium. Critics argue that it may hinder business owners and impact women's participation in the workforce. In India, a similar Bill was proposed but not discussed in the House. The implementation and mechanisms for resolving disputes differ in each case.</description>

			<title>Why India wants to develop high-altitude pseudo-satellite vehicles, powered by the Sun</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/haps-high-altitude-pseudo-satellite-vehicles-9158726/</link>
			<description>The National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) in Bengaluru successfully tested a prototype of a new-generation unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) known as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite vehicle (HAPS). This UAV runs on solar power, can fly at heights of 20 km, and has the potential to remain in the air for months. HAPS vehicles are primarily used for surveillance and monitoring purposes and can be valuable in disaster management. While several countries and companies have developed similar vehicles, none have mastered the technology yet. NAL's prototype flew for eight and a half hours and aims to achieve a 24-hour flight next month. The goal is to develop a full-scale machine that can stay airborne for 90 days continuously by 2027. HAPS vehicles address the limitations of current UAVs and satellites, providing longer flight durations, better surveillance capabilities, and the ability to observe larger areas. They can be redeployed and reequipped with ease, unlike geostationary satellites. The development of HAPS faces technological challenges related to generating enough solar power, operating payloads, and charging batteries. Design considerations include creating a lightweight and stable aircraft suitable for the stratosphere, where wind speeds are low and observation is ideal. HAPS technology is a significant engineering challenge, and India's involvement places them in the race alongside other countries. The country's expertise in tropical areas could provide an advantage due to the presence of jet streams in the upper atmosphere.</description>

			<title>Wayanad elephant kills man: Behind escalating human-animal conflict in Kerala</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/wayanad-elephant-kills-man-behind-escalating-human-animal-conflict-in-kerala-9158201/</link>
			<description>The article highlights the escalating human-animal conflict in Wayanad, Kerala, particularly with wild elephants and tigers attacking humans. The data shows a significant number of wild animal attacks, leading to deaths and crop losses. Wayanad, located near various tiger reserves and forests, has been severely affected by such conflicts. The study identifies two major factors contributing to the conflict: the decline in forest habitat quality due to the cultivation of alien plants and changing agricultural practices that lure animals to farmland. The article discusses the steps taken by Kerala, such as constructing elephant-proof trenches and solar-powered fencing, eco-restoration programs, and land acquisition for forest conversion. However, the measures are not enough to address the crisis, and the state requested assistance from the central government, which was denied. The situation has caused protests and unrest in the affected communities.</description>

			<title>RLD ditches INDIA for NDA: What this means for the party, the two alliances</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/rld-ditches-india-for-nda-what-this-means-9157927/</link>
			<description>The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in Uttar Pradesh has switched sides to join the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), further fragmenting the INDIA bloc. The RLD, a farmers' party with support from the Jat community, brings perception benefits to the NDA rather than a significant number of votes. The party has seen a decline in its influence, losing seats in previous elections. The alliance with RLD may help the BJP consolidate Jat support and improve its chances in west UP. The RLD's departure is a blow to INDIA's unity and could prompt the Congress-SP alliance to focus on wooing Muslim voters. Some critics argue that the RLD has compromised on its ideology by joining the BJP, but the party has a history of switching sides.</description>

			<title>Kurt Campbell, Biden’s Asia czar, moves to State Department: What it means in Washington and New Delhi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/kurt-campbell-us-asia-czar-state-department-move-9157780/</link>
			<description>Dr. Kurt Campbell has been confirmed as the Deputy Secretary of State in the United States, joining the leadership team under Secretary Antony Blinken. Known for his extensive experience in Asia policy, Campbell's confirmation signals a strategic shift in President Joe Biden's approach to the region, particularly in an election year. Campbell has been instrumental in advancing U.S. initiatives across the Indo-Pacific, including the expansion of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), new cooperative mechanisms with Korea and Japan, the AUKUS maritime security deal, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

Campbell's efforts have significantly deepened U.S.-India relations, positioning India as a key partner in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy. The past year has seen numerous high-profile visits and initiatives, such as the US-India Initiative on Critical Emerging Technology and Indus-X, which aim to enhance collaboration in critical technologies like AI, telecommunications, and renewable energy.

Despite some challenges, the Indo-U.S. relationship enjoys strong bipartisan support and is characterized by positive public perceptions and increasing educational exchanges. Campbell's move to the State Department is expected to institutionalize Asia policy within the department, moving away from the personalized dynamics of the National Security Council. This transition is seen as a preparation for the integration of strategic initiatives into American bureaucracy, with long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy and its engagement with Asia. The article also notes that while there are concerns about Campbell's focus on Asia, his expertise is likely to continue shaping U.S. policy in the region, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming national elections.</description>

			<title>Protesting farmers want MSP law: How would such a guarantee work?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/farmers-protest-msp-guarantee-law-9157499/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing farmers' protests in India, which have reached their fifth day. The farmers are demanding a legal guarantee for the Minimum Support Price (MSP), which is a price set by the government to purchase crops from farmers, ensuring they get a minimum profit for their harvests. The article explains that farmers are often at a disadvantage in the market, as they are price takers and not price makers, leading to demands for MSP.

Economists are generally against government-fixed MSPs, suggesting they distort market dynamics and farmers' production decisions. Instead, they propose direct income support schemes, which transfer a fixed sum of money to farmers annually, avoiding market distortion and benefiting all farmers regardless of their crop choice.

The article also explores the concept of price deficiency payments (PDP), where the government pays farmers the difference between the market price and the MSP if the market price is lower. This system has been tried in Madhya Pradesh and Haryana with mixed results and challenges in implementation.

The article concludes by suggesting that a nationwide PDP scheme, with partial Central funding, could incentivize other states to develop the necessary market infrastructure and systems to support MSP for farmers, potentially leading to more equitable outcomes for farmers across different states. This explainer was originally published on January 8, and the article includes additional unrelated content and advertisements.</description>

			<title>What is a floor test, which Nitish Kumar won in the Bihar Legislative Assembly?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/floor-test-bihar-assembly-meaning-process-9157395/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent floor test held in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar won the vote, demonstrating the confidence of the MLAs in his new government. It explains that a floor test is conducted to determine if a government, suspected of losing its majority, still retains the confidence of the House. The leader of the party claiming majority moves a vote of confidence, and if the majority votes in favor, the government survives. Different methods of voting, such as voice voting and electronic voting, are explained. The article also mentions the Composite Floor Test, which is conducted when multiple parties claim to form the government. It concludes with an unrelated mention of Abdul Malik, a leader involved in a property dispute that caused protests in Haldwani.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: What are climate tipping points?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/warming-up-to-climate-change-climate-tipping-points-9156991/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of climate tipping points, which are critical thresholds in the Earth's system that, once crossed, can lead to irreversible changes and catastrophic consequences for the planet. These tipping points include the collapse of ice sheets, thawing of permafrost, death of coral reefs, and changes in oceanic currents. The Global Tipping Points Report from December 2023, led by Professor Tim Lenton, highlights that five major tipping points are at risk due to current global warming levels, and more are threatened as temperatures continue to rise. The report emphasizes the catastrophic societal impacts of crossing these thresholds, including conflict, displacement, and financial instability. It also notes that greenhouse gas concentrations reached record highs in 2023, and global governance is inadequate to address these threats. The article is part of a series explaining various aspects of climate change.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: ‘The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-town-square-internet-global-village-9156294/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of the Internet as a "town square" where ideas are shared and debates take place. It highlights how the term "town square" refers to a common space for gathering, discussing ideas, and holding debates. The ancient Greek practice of discussing ideas in public view is mentioned, with philosophers like Plato and Aristotle critiquing the fallacious arguments used by professional rhetoricians. The article also draws parallels between social media platforms like Twitter and the concept of a town square, noting the role they played during events like the Arab Spring. However, it raises concerns about the lack of regulation and common rules on these platforms, which hinders genuine and fair debate. The idea of a "global village" and the need for a free space for debate in an interconnected world are also discussed, along with the challenges and subjective nature of defining interesting and substantial debate. The article concludes with suggestions for setting standards and potentially exploring new platforms that foster meaningful discussion.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna: Why Charan Singh was a messiah for farmers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-charan-singh-was-a-messiah-for-farmers-9156566/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the views and proposals of Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former Union Home Minister of India, regarding reservations for farmers in government jobs and educational institutions. Singh believed that representation should be provided to the "sons or dependents of the actual tillers of the soil" to rectify the privileges enjoyed by city-dwellers. He argued that reservations would not only provide opportunities to farmers but also improve efficiency in government departments. Singh's proposal faced criticism for only including the "sons of cultivators" and excluding landless laborers. He emphasized that his focus was on providing representation to tillers of the soil, regardless of their caste. The article also highlights Singh's contribution to land reform laws in Uttar Pradesh, which empowered the middle peasantry. However, the current challenges faced by agriculture, such as decreasing yields, rising production costs, and climate change, make the need for reservations for farmers' children more relevant today.</description>

			<title>Pakistan polls: With Imran Khan’s team of independents in the lead, what happens now?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-imrans-independents-what-happens-now-9156222/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the uncertain political landscape in Pakistan following the recent elections. Despite expectations that Nawaz Sharif's PML-N, backed by the military, would win, independent candidates won the most seats, many of whom are supported by Imran Khan's PTI. The PML-N and PPP are the second and third largest parties, respectively. With no clear majority, the situation is unprecedented.

The National Assembly has 336 seats, with 266 elected directly and 70 reserved for women and non-Muslims. The independents' victory complicates the allocation of reserved seats, which is based on party strength in the Assembly.

Independents have three days post-election to join a party, which then impacts the distribution of reserved seats. The PTI-backed independents' decisions are unclear, with PTI alleging election rigging and seeking judicial intervention to secure reserved seats.

The article also references historical precedents and current legal complexities regarding the filling of reserved seats. The situation remains fluid, with potential alliances and party shifts that could influence the final government formation. The article concludes with an unrelated note about the Election Commission of India's actions against a BJD leader's spouse for alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Experts Explain | Darwin Day: How theories of evolution helped our knowledge of life on Earth</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/darwin-day-theories-evolution-life-knowledge-earth-science-9156108/</link>
			<description>The article celebrates **Darwin Day** and discusses the significance of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace's work on evolution by natural selection. It highlights how our understanding of life and evolution has expanded, detailing the inner workings of cells and the development of organisms from single-cell embryos. The concept of **genetic diversity** is emphasized as crucial for adaptation to changing environments, with natural selection favoring traits that increase survival and reproduction under new conditions.

The generation of new genetic variations is described as random, not specifically aimed at aiding survival but increasing the chances of adaptation when environmental changes occur. The article also touches on the divergence of populations leading to new species and the nearly **3.5 billion years** of evolution resulting in today's biodiversity.

Advancements in genetics, such as the discovery of DNA and its mechanisms, have allowed for a deeper understanding of life's fundamental processes, enabling scientific collaboration and faster validation of discoveries. The article explains that while DNA replication is highly accurate, errors do occur, creating genetic variations that contribute to the diversity and adaptability of populations.

Human evolution is detailed, noting our divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees and the coexistence of multiple human species. It argues for the equality of all individuals, regardless of genetic differences, and stresses the importance of diversity in human genetics, physiology, languages, histories, and cultures. The authors, **L S Shashidhara** and **Sutirth Dey**, express personal opinions and emphasize the shared knowledge and skills across human societies that contribute to our collective understanding and survival. The unrelated content about an IPL match has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>In Pakistan poll outcome, key question for India: Whom does New Delhi talk to with no civilian political power centre?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/in-pakistan-poll-outcome-key-question-for-india-9156118/</link>
			<description>The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, emerged as the winner in Pakistan's parliamentary elections. Independent candidates backed by PTI secured the most seats, surpassing the two main established parties, Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The PTI-backed candidates won a majority of the 101 independent seats. However, none of the three parties alone can achieve a simple majority in the National Assembly. The outcome raises questions about whom New Delhi should engage with in Pakistan, with the suggestion being to communicate with Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir. The final tally of the elections, released after a delay, led to concerns about the process and allegations of the Army rigging the polls. The article highlights key takeaways, including the Army's ability to manipulate the outcome in favor of established parties, PTI's success in various provinces, and the lack of a strong political power center in the civilian structure, giving the Army control over political actors.</description>

			<description>The Israeli government plans to expand its military actions in the south of Gaza to combat the Palestinian militant organization Hamas. The conflict began when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, resulting in many casualties. Israel aims to eliminate Hamas and has called for the evacuation of civilians in the city of Rafah. The decision has received criticism from Palestinians, Israel's allies, and international organizations. There are concerns that the military action could lead to more Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip, and there is a lack of safety and basic amenities for Palestinians. Egypt has expressed concerns about the potential consequences of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah and has threatened to suspend its peace treaty with Israel. The United States has also expressed criticism, with President Joe Biden stating that Israel's response is "over the top."</description>

			<title>What is Nazool land, behind recent dispute and violence in Haldwani?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/nazool-land-behind-dispute-violence-haldwani-uttarakhand-9155345/</link>
			<description>Violence broke out in Haldwani, Uttarakhand's Nainital district, during a demolition drive at a mosque and madrasa located on Nazool land, resulting in five deaths and numerous injuries. Nazool land refers to government-owned land that is leased to entities for a fixed period. After India gained independence from British rule, lands confiscated from opposing kings and kingdoms were categorized as Nazool land. These lands are typically used for public purposes like schools, hospitals, and government buildings. The property where the demolition took place was registered as Nazool land under the Municipal Council. The administration claims that a notice was issued, requiring the removal of encroachments or submission of ownership documents within three days. Locals had requested the administration to wait until the next hearing in the High Court on February 14, but the demolition proceeded after receiving court approval.</description>

			<title>What can the EU learn from Asia about AI regulations?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-can-the-eu-learn-from-asia-about-ai-regulations-9154977/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the new artificial intelligence (AI) governance and ethics guidelines released by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). These guidelines offer a voluntary approach to AI regulation, contrasting with the European Union's (EU) stricter proposed AI Act. ASEAN's approach is seen as more business-friendly and less specific, aiming to balance the economic benefits of AI with ethical considerations without over-regulation. The EU, on the other hand, is pushing for global alignment with its comprehensive AI law, which includes strict rules and penalties for non-compliance. The article highlights the differences in political systems and digital ecosystems between Southeast Asia and the EU, suggesting that ASEAN's diverse member states prefer a softer regulatory touch to foster innovation and avoid stifling their digital economies. However, the possibility of future, stricter AI regulations in ASEAN is not ruled out, with some member states already considering national AI laws. The article concludes by noting that the impact of the EU's AI Act on its digital economy will be closely watched by policymakers in Southeast Asia.</description>

			<title>SC says jail, not bail, is the rule under the UAPA: How courts have been granting bail in UAPA cases</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/uapa-bail-supreme-court-9154999/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the application of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in India, particularly in the context of bail denial. It highlights the case of Gurwinder Singh, accused of supporting a pro-Khalistan group, and denied bail under the UAPA. The law's Section 43D (5) shifts the burden of proof to the accused, challenging the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty.' The Supreme Court's 2019 ruling in Zahoor Ahmed Shah Watali v NIA set a precedent that courts should not scrutinize evidence but accept it at face value when considering bail under UAPA.

The article also references legal scholar Gautam Bhatia's view that defending a UAPA case is extremely challenging for lawyers. Despite the stringent rules, courts have granted bail in some cases, such as to student activists involved in anti-CAA protests and Dalit rights activist Anand Teltumbde, where the prosecution failed to make a specific case. The Supreme Court's ruling in Union of India vs KA Najeeb allowed bail under UAPA after prolonged incarceration, balancing it with the right to a speedy trial.

In July 2023, the Supreme Court in Vernon Gonsalves v State of Maharashtra differed from the Watali ruling, suggesting a need for at least a surface analysis of evidence's probative value when granting bail. However, the Gurwinder Singh case followed the Watali precedent without considering the Gonsalves ruling, indicating a potential need for a larger bench to settle discrepancies in future applications of the law. The article concludes by mentioning other unrelated news headlines and a political controversy involving the Election Commission of India and the BJD party.</description>

			<title>How ‘Chinese’ is gobi manchurian, and why did a Goan fair ban it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/chinese-gobi-manchurian-goa-ban-9154651/</link>
			<description>The Mapusa Municipal Council in North Goa has unanimously decided to ban the sale of gobi manchurian at roadside stalls during the Bodgeshwar temple fair due to health concerns. The dish, a popular Indian-Chinese fusion of fried cauliflower in a spicy sauce, has been criticized for being prepared in unhygienic conditions with the use of synthetic colors and low-quality ingredients. The decision has sparked debate, with some suggesting it reflects anti-outsider sentiment, as many vendors are not local to Goa. This is not the first instance of such a ban; similar restrictions were imposed in South Goa in 2022. The dish's origins trace back to the 1970s and the creation of chicken manchurian, which led to the rise of Punjabi-Chinese cuisine in India. Despite its popularity, especially in the South, gobi manchurian is largely unknown in China, leading to the term 'Chinjabi' to describe this uniquely Indian version of 'Chinese' food.</description>

			<title>PPP and PML-N in talks for forming coalition govt in Pakistan: What is the parties’ relationship like?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ppp-pml-nawaz-sharif-bhutto-coalition-pakistan-election-9154844/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political maneuvers in Pakistan following the general elections. **Shehbaz Sharif** of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) met with leaders of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), including **Asif Ali Zardari** and **Bilawal Bhutto**, to discuss forming a coalition government amidst delayed election results and allegations of vote rigging. This potential alliance is not new; both parties have previously formed coalitions, notably against former President **Pervez Musharraf** in 2008 and to counter **Imran Khan's** government in 2022.

The article recounts the history of the PML-N and PPP's cooperation, starting with their united front against Musharraf, who had marginalized them through military-backed parties. The parties' leaders signed the **Charter of Democracy**, aiming to restore civilian rule and ensure the military's accountability to civilian authorities.

The coalition faced challenges, particularly when **Asif Ali Zardari**, as President, hesitated to reinstate Chief Justice **Iftikhar Chaudhry**, leading to the PML-N's withdrawal from the government. However, the PPP continued to govern with other parties.

In 2018, after the PTI, led by **Imran Khan**, won the general elections amid accusations of military rigging, the PML-N and PPP formed the **Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)** to oppose Khan's government. The PDM eventually succeeded in ousting Khan through a vote of no-confidence in 2022.

Following Khan's removal, **Shehbaz Sharif** became Prime Minister, and **Bilawal Bhutto** was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Despite not contesting the latest elections together, the PML-N and PPP may again ally due to the inconclusive election results and to prevent Khan's return to power.

The article also mentions an unrelated incident in India, where an official was transferred due to allegations of misusing public office during elections, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Confusion in Pakistan: What happens now?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-elections-results-pti-imran-khan-nawaz-sharif-9154605/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the uncertainty and unrest following Pakistan's recent elections. Both Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif claim victory, but allegations of election manipulation and rigging are prevalent. The establishment initially backed Nawaz Sharif, while Imran Khan faced multiple obstacles, including imprisonment and persecution of his party members. Surprisingly, Imran Khan's popularity resulted in a strong showing for his loyalists. However, there were reports of manipulated results, leading to protests and clashes. International observers, including the US, expressed concern over electoral violence and interference. With no party holding a majority, a coalition government is likely, with Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto potentially leading it. Imran Khan's response to this outcome is yet to be seen, and the establishment may try to manipulate the situation further. International pressure, particularly from the US, may also play a role in shaping events.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/the-message-in-the-bharat-ratnas-how-the-politics-of-honour-works-9154262/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that former Prime Ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, as well as Dr M S Swaminathan, will be awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. This announcement is significant as it comes just before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, with the award for Dr Swaminathan and Charan Singh signaling the government's focus on farmers and agriculture. The recognition for Narasimha Rao highlights the Congress party's neglect of his accomplishments due to differences with Sonia Gandhi. The previous recipients of the Bharat Ratna under the Modi government have also been strategic choices, emphasizing political messaging and highlighting certain individuals' contributions.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code bans polygamy: Is the practice more prevalent among Muslims?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ucc-bans-polygamy-is-the-practice-more-prevalent-among-muslims-9153803/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly has passed the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024, which aims to bring uniformity in personal laws regarding marriage, divorce, and inheritance across communities in the state, excluding tribals. The bill extends the rule of monogamy to the Muslim community, disallowing men from having more than one wife. Data on polygamy in India is obtained from sources like the census and the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), but both have limitations. The census infers polygamy based on the difference in the number of married men and women, while the NFHS directly asks women if their husbands have other wives. The most recent census was conducted in 2011, and the NFHS-5 surveyed less than 1% of households in India. A 1974 study found that Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus had higher rates of polygamy than Muslims. Overall, the prevalence of polygamy has decreased in recent years. According to the NFHS-5, Christians reported the highest incidence of polygamy, followed by Muslims and Hindus. A study by the International Institute of Population Sciences showed a decline in polygynous marriages among the whole population from 1.9% in 2005-06 to 1.4% in 2019-21.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna P V Narasimha Rao: 4 things you did not know about the man who changed India’s economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/things-to-know-bharat-ratna-p-v-narasimha-rao-9153578/</link>
			<description>Former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao has been posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He is recognized for his extensive service to India and his visionary leadership in advancing the country's economy. Here are four key points about Narasimha Rao:

1. After his passing, Narasimha Rao's body was not allowed inside the Congress headquarters for ordinary workers to pay their respects, causing controversy. His funeral in Hyderabad also made headlines as his half-burnt body was shown abandoned with stray dogs nearby.

2. Narasimha Rao had a strained relationship with Sonia Gandhi, attributed to personal, political, and ideological differences. Their disagreements included the distribution of a Rajya Sabha ticket, progress in the investigation of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, and the Congress party's defeat in the 1996 Lok Sabha election.

3. Narasimha Rao considered converting Ayodhya into a Union Territory with a Vatican-like status. He even contemplated building a temple at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid but later decided to wait until after the 1996 elections.

4. Atal Bihari Vajpayee referred to Narasimha Rao as the "true father" of India's nuclear program. Narasimha Rao was actively involved in the program and, despite international speculation, he considered conducting nuclear tests in Pokhran but ultimately postponed them due to various factors, including the 1996 elections.

In summary, P V Narasimha Rao's contributions to India as a leader, his complicated relationship with Sonia Gandhi, his thoughts on Ayodhya, and his involvement in the nuclear program shaped his legacy.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna for PV Narasimha Rao: How he almost quit politics, then became Prime Minister</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/pv-narasimha-rao-bharat-ratna-significance-9152749/</link>
			<description>Former Prime Ministers **PV Narasimha Rao** and **Chaudhary Charan Singh**, along with agricultural scientist **MS Swaminathan**, will be posthumously awarded the **Bharat Ratna**, India's highest civilian honor. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced this on social media, praising Rao's transformative leadership that opened India to global markets and enriched its cultural and intellectual heritage.

The article recounts Rao's political journey, detailing how he was on the brink of retirement before the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 changed his trajectory. Despite other contenders for the role of Congress President, Rao's experience and support from key political figures, including President R Venkataraman, led to his election as Congress President and subsequently, Prime Minister of India.

The narrative also touches upon the internal dynamics of the Congress party during the selection process, highlighting the political maneuvering and the influence of regional support that contributed to Rao's rise. His intellectual reputation and ability to unite the party were significant factors in his favor.

In a separate note, the article mentions the Election Commission's order to transfer Sujata R Karthikeyan, wife of BJD leader V K Pandian, due to allegations of misuse of public office during elections.</description>

			<title>MS Swaminathan conferred Bharat Ratna: How the agricultural scientist helped India achieve food security</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bharat-ratna-ms-swaminathan-significance-profile-9152692/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the late Dr. MS Swaminathan, along with former Prime Ministers PV Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, will be posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna. Dr. Swaminathan, known as the 'Father of the Green Revolution,' was instrumental in India's agricultural self-reliance and modernization. His work transformed Indian agriculture, ensuring food security and prosperity.

Dr. Swaminathan's career was marked by significant contributions to agriculture and farmers' welfare. He chose agriculture over civil services, driven by the Bengal famine and Gandhiji's Quit India Movement. His research in genetics and breeding led to the development of high-yielding crop varieties, crucial for India's post-independence agricultural productivity.

The Green Revolution, which he spearheaded, involved providing high-yielding seeds, irrigation, and fertilizers, leading to a dramatic increase in wheat production from 10 million tonnes in 1964 to 17 million tonnes in 1968. This revolution debunked the notion that Indian farmers were incapable of self-sufficiency, as India had previously relied heavily on wheat imports from the US.

Dr. Swaminathan's efforts also extended to wheat, collaborating with Norman Borlaug to introduce dwarfing genes that increased productivity. Despite the Green Revolution's success, Swaminathan was aware of its potential drawbacks, such as environmental degradation and inequality among farmers. He advocated for sustainable practices and fair compensation for farmers.

For his pioneering work, Dr. Swaminathan was honored as the first World Food Prize Laureate in 1987. His legacy continues to influence agricultural practices and policies in India and around the world. This summary omits unrelated content and focuses on the key points of the article.</description>

			<title>What the white paper on economy says — and doesn’t</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-the-white-paper-on-economy-says-and-doesnt-9151991/</link>
			<description>The article presents a summary of a "white paper" on the Indian economy, comparing the economic governance of the Congress-led UPA government from 2004-2014 with the BJP-led NDA government from 2014-2024. The document is not a traditional white paper but a comparative analysis of two decades of governance on economic parameters.

**Key points from the white paper include:**
- The UPA government is criticized for abandoning economic reforms and undermining macroeconomic foundations post-2008 financial crisis, leading to high inflation, fiscal deficits, and bad loans.
- It is claimed that the UPA's borrowing was unproductive, halving capital expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure and neglecting infrastructure, which stunted industrial and economic growth.
- The NDA government's tenure is portrayed as a period of improvement, with lower average inflation and successful implementation of schemes like toilet construction and bank account openings.

The article also critiques the white paper for omitting significant issues such as unemployment, which reached a 45-year high in 2017-18, and the lack of a formal measure of poverty since 2011. It notes that while the NDA has achievements like GST and IBC, the white paper does not address all economic challenges, including the failure to conduct the decadal Census for the first time since 1881. The article suggests that analyzing two decades of economic performance is complex due to various influencing factors, such as fluctuating crude oil prices. Despite the white paper's claims, data indicates better GDP growth and lower fiscal deficits during the UPA era compared to the NDA's tenure.</description>

			<title>Why consumers from Gujarat are shelling out more for their electricity bills</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-consumers-from-gujarat-are-shelling-out-more-for-their-electricity-bills-9152000/</link>
			<description>The article discusses allegations made by Congress MLAs in the Gujarat Assembly regarding the state government's power purchases from Adani Power Limited (APL). They claim that power is being bought at triple the rate agreed upon in 2007. The government, however, states that the original Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) were amended through supplemental PPAs (SPPAs).

The PPAs, signed in 2007 with companies like Essar Power Gujarat Limited (EPGL), Adani Power Mundra Limited (APMuL), and Tata Power Company Limited (TPCL), are regulated by the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). These agreements cover pricing and technical aspects of power purchase, and can be modified through SPPAs.

Trigger points for revising PPA terms include Indonesia's 2010 coal import regulation changes, which increased prices, affecting the viability of power plants that use imported coal. In 2018, a Gujarat government committee recommended passing on the coal price hike to consumers, after generators expressed concerns about continuing production due to the cost.

In 2016, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) investigated companies, including Adani Power, for alleged overvaluation of coal imports. In May 2022, the Ministry of Power directed state governments and regulatory commissions to ensure coal imports for blending, with provisional billing and payment terms outlined to facilitate this process.

Additionally, the article mentions the Election Commission of India's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department following allegations of misuse of public office for election-related activities. The BJP has accused her of using the Mission Shakti scheme to influence voters on behalf of the BJD.</description>

			<title>White Paper red-flags NPAs, scams and policy freeze, skips growth years credit</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/white-paper-red-flags-npas-scams-and-policy-freeze-skips-growth-years-credit-9152046/</link>
			<description>The White Paper on the Indian Economy, authored by the Union Finance Ministry, has been critiqued for its overtly political tone, starting with a statement that aligns the Ministry with the current government. It highlights the economic challenges during the UPA's tenure, such as bad loans, high inflation, and corruption, framing these issues in the context of the upcoming 2024 election campaign. The paper attributes the economic growth between 2004-2008 to the previous NDA government's reforms and global conditions, while omitting the UPA's achievements and not addressing its own shortcomings.

The paper selectively presents data, acknowledging India's current top-five GDP ranking but ignoring the country's resilience during the UPA years, including during the 2008 global financial crisis. It downplays the crisis's impact on India, despite acknowledging the government's successful fiscal measures that led to a rapid recovery and an 8.5% GDP growth the following year.

The White Paper also lists the NDA government's achievements, such as GST and IBC reforms, but notes the ongoing employment-related stress. It mentions a reduction in the unemployment rate but raises concerns about the increase in unpaid workers and the decline in the quality of jobs.

The article concludes with information about the Election Commission's action against Sujata R Karthikeyan for alleged misuse of public office during elections, reflecting ongoing political dynamics.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan’s military is the biggest player in the country’s politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-elections-military-army-dominance-influence-9151188/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political landscape of Pakistan, particularly the influence of the military on its politics and elections. It highlights that despite the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) not being the most popular party, Nawaz Sharif is predicted to become Prime Minister again, largely due to the military's role in power transitions since 1947. The military's dominance is traced back to the allocation of resources at Partition and the first budget of Pakistan, which heavily favored defense. The article cites various authors who discuss the military's historical mistrust of politicians, its role in shaping civil-military relations due to the perceived threat from India, and its direct takeovers of power through coups in 1958, 1977, and 1999.

The military's involvement in politics has been acknowledged as unconstitutional by former Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. The article also notes the military's shift from direct rule to a more behind-the-scenes role in governance since 2008. The current situation with Nawaz Sharif's predicted victory, despite Imran Khan's PTI party's popularity and his imprisonment, is seen as a continuation of the military's influence over Pakistan's politics. The article is part of a series on the 2024 Pakistan elections, providing context on the complex civil-military relationship that shapes the country's political future. The unrelated content about filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra's career and collaborations has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/white-paper-silent-on-india-grew-fastest-2004-09-upa-9151603/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Union Ministry of Finance's 'White Paper on the Indian Economy' released before the Lok Sabha elections. It suggests that the paper selectively presents data to highlight the failures of the UPA government and the successes of the NDA government, while ignoring the successes of the former and the failures of the latter. The paper acknowledges India's economic growth and improved GDP ranking but attributes it to the previous NDA government's policies and global conditions rather than the UPA's efforts. It also downplays the UPA's achievements during the Global Financial Crisis and its fiscal performance in 2007-08. The article points out that while the NDA government has had successes like GST and IBC reforms, there are issues with employment quality and persistent inflation. The article concludes by mentioning the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of election influence, which is unrelated to the main economic discussion.</description>

			<title>Should some SCs get more quota benefits than others: What is the debate, in which apex court has reserved verdict</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/debate-over-subcategorisation-among-scs-for-reservation-9151568/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal debate in India regarding the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs) for reservation benefits. The Supreme Court reserved judgment on whether states can create separate quotas within the SC reservation to ensure equitable distribution among underrepresented castes. This issue arose from a 2004 Supreme Court decision (E.V. Chinnaiah v State of Andhra Pradesh) which held that only the President could notify communities for reservation benefits, preventing states from altering the list.

The debate has its roots in a 1975 Punjab government policy that provided reservation preferences to certain SC communities, which was struck down in 2004. The Punjab government's subsequent attempts to reintroduce these preferences were also struck down. In 2020, a Constitution Bench suggested that the 2004 decision needed reconsideration, acknowledging the existence of inequalities within SCs and the concept of a "creamy layer" that could exclude better-off castes from reservation benefits.

The arguments presented in court highlight the tension between treating all SCs equally and addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged within them. The article also mentions the potential impact of sub-classification on various SC communities across different states. The Supreme Court's decision will have significant implications for reservation policies and the treatment of SCs in India. The unrelated content about President Joe Biden's remarks on immigration was not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>Why Taylor Swift’s private air travel is a problem for the planet</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/taylor-swift-private-air-jet-carbon-emmissions-9151438/</link>
			<description>Taylor Swift's legal team has issued a cease and desist letter to Jack Sweeney, a student who tracks celebrity private jet activity, alleging harm and distress caused by his posts. Critics argue this is an attempt to silence discussions about Swift's carbon footprint. Reports highlight the significant pollution caused by private jets, with Swift's jet usage, including a short 13-minute flight, contributing to her criticism. Studies show celebrities' private jet emissions are substantial, with Swift's 2022 emissions being over a thousand times more than the average person's annual total. The article discusses the broader issue of the wealthy's disproportionate contribution to climate change and the need for climate justice linked to socio-economic equity.</description>

			<title>Rahul’s statement on PM Modi: All you need to know about Teli caste</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi-obc-teli-caste-9150791/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a claim by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not born into the Other Backward Class (OBC) but was instead from the general caste, specifically the Teli caste in Gujarat. Gandhi stated that Modi's community was classified as OBC in 2000 by the BJP government. The article elaborates on the historical engagement of the Teli and related sub-castes in the oil trade in Gujarat and their inclusion in the central list of OBCs in 1999 and 2000. It also touches upon the widespread use of the surname 'Modi' across various communities and regions in India, which does not denote a specific community or caste. The article mentions the controversy surrounding Rahul Gandhi's comment linking the surname 'Modi' to thieves, which led to a defamation complaint against him. Additionally, the article highlights the work of Shyamlal Yadav, an investigative journalist known for impactful reporting and being part of global investigations. The unrelated content about President Joe Biden's views on immigration and xenophobia has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>No change in EMIs: Why has RBI kept the repo rate unchanged again?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/no-change-rbi-repo-rate-emi-impact-9150980/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the repo rate steady at **6.5%**. This decision aligns with market expectations and was made by a majority of 5-1 during their bi-monthly review. The RBI maintains a cautious stance, termed as "withdrawal of accommodation," despite acknowledging stronger domestic economic activity. However, it has revised the GDP growth projection for FY 2025 to **7%**, down from the previous **7.3%**.

The central bank's inflation forecast remains at **5.4%** for the current fiscal year, with a particular focus on the unpredictable nature of food prices. One MPC member, Jayanth Varma, voted against the majority, advocating for a reduction in the repo rate and a shift to a 'neutral' policy stance.

Interest rates on various loans are expected to remain stable, although retail loan segments might see an increase due to raised risk weights and the Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR). Deposit rates may also rise due to competition from mutual funds.

The article highlights that this is the sixth consecutive policy review where the repo rate has not changed. The last hike was in February 2023, marking a total increase of 250 basis points since May 2022. The RBI's stance reflects its efforts to manage inflation, which continues to exceed its 4% target. Retail inflation has shown fluctuations but is predicted to be at **4.5%** in FY 2025.

Analysts suggest that there might be a strong case for the RBI to shift its policy stance to 'neutral' due to tightening financial conditions and high real rates. The liquidity situation has also become more stringent.

In an unrelated note, the Election Commission of India has transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan to a non-public facing role following allegations of misuse of public office during elections.</description>

			<title>Pakistan elections 2024: A short history of the country’s fraught experiments with democracy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/short-history-pakistan-elections-democracy-9149758/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed account of Pakistan's political history, focusing on the pattern of military coups, the struggle for democracy, and the role of the military in shaping the country's governance. It highlights the delayed process of constitution-making and the first general elections due to debates over national issues. The narrative covers the political turmoil from the first constitution in 1956 to the military coup by General Ayub Khan in 1958, the first general elections in 1970, and the subsequent emergence of regionalism and social conflict.

The article discusses Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's rise to power, his failure to implement significant reforms, and the events leading to General Zia-ul Haq's coup in 1977. It also examines the 1985 elections, which led to the formation of a two-party system and the military's shift from direct rule to 'oversight' through constitutional amendments and manipulation of election results.

The report further explores the military's influence in the 1990s, the return to dictatorship under General Pervez Musharraf, and the eventual move towards democracy with the 2002 elections. It recounts the military's continued intervention in politics, including the ousting of Nawaz Sharif in 2017, the rise of Imran Khan's PTI, and the military's shifting allegiances between political leaders.

The article concludes with the current political landscape ahead of the 2024 elections, where Nawaz Sharif has returned from exile and is allowed to run, while Imran Khan faces legal challenges and is barred from contesting. This piece is part of a series on the 2024 Pakistan elections, providing insights into the polls, key players, and the military's political influence.

			<title>Explained: The new process for picking Election Commissioners, why it was brought in</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/picking-election-commissioners-9149779/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the new process for appointing Election Commissioners in India, prompted by a Supreme Court ruling. Previously, appointments were made at the government's discretion, often from a pool of retired IAS officers. The Supreme Court's intervention came after petitions called for a transparent selection process, criticizing the opaque system that raised doubts about the institution's independence. The Court ruled that appointments should be made by the President based on a committee's advice, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. This decision reflects past recommendations for a consultative process. Following the ruling, the Centre passed a Bill establishing a selection committee, which has been criticized for potentially undermining the intended reforms and the Election Commission's independence. The President has since given assent to the Bill. The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department following allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Why the Union Budget’s plans for deep tech and research funding are significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/why-budget-plans-for-deep-tech-and-research-funding-matter-9149783/</link>
			<description>In the Interim Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a **Rs 1 lakh crore fund** to support research and development with long-term, low-cost loans. A new scheme will also be launched to boost deep-tech capabilities in the defence sector, with a broader policy to support deep tech startups across various sectors expected later.

Deep tech involves cutting-edge technologies like nanotechnology, biotechnology, quantum technologies, and AI, which are crucial for addressing global challenges and driving economic growth. India, with its strong science and engineering base, aims to be a leader in these areas, contributing to technology development and ensuring early adoption, intellectual property shares, and self-reliance.

The government has initiated missions like the National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage and the National Quantum Mission to incentivize research. The National Deep Tech Startup Policy (NDTSP) is awaiting approval to create an ecosystem for startups in technology domains, addressing challenges like funding, intellectual property rights, and regulatory frameworks.

Despite the initiatives, India's R&amp;D expenditure is below the global average, and the government is looking to partner with the private sector to increase funding. The National Research Foundation (NRF) aims to involve private industry in funding research, with a significant portion of its budget expected from the private sector.

The Rs 1 lakh crore corpus is intended to finance R&amp;D and benefit startups and private ventures. However, the scientific community remains skeptical about the reliance on private sector funding, citing past unpredictability and inadequate government funding.

The government's new initiatives aim to stimulate investment in research, but budgetary increases for science and research departments have been minimal, with some departments facing budget cuts. Political developments, including candidate announcements for the Nehru-Gandhi seats and campaign activities, are also highlighted in the article.</description>

			<title>Keeping Congress in crosshairs, Modi holds out Modi 3.0 promise</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/keeping-congress-in-crosshairs-modi-holds-out-modi-3-0-promise-9149904/</link>
			<description>In his speech before the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined his vision for a third term, dubbed "Modi 3.0," promising development and criticizing the Congress party for its governance failures, colonial mentality, and lack of commitment to the deprived. He accused the Congress of being anti-Dalit, anti-Adivasi, and anti-tribal, citing historical opposition to reservations and the denial of rights to SCs, STs, and OBCs in Jammu and Kashmir prior to the abrogation of Article 370.

Modi highlighted his government's welfare schemes aimed at SCs, STs, and OBCs, including housing, sanitation, and free ration programs. He attacked the Congress for its narrative against Indian traditions and for its economic performance, contrasting it with his administration's achievements in making India the fifth largest economy.

He promised further progress towards making India a developed nation by 2047, with initiatives to increase the number of doctors, provide tap water and housing for the poor, reduce power bills through solar panels, and expand gas networks. Modi envisioned growth in startups, record patent filings, and improvements in public transport, including bullet trains, aiming for self-reliance in various fields, including semiconductor production.

The speech also included criticism of the Congress for its treatment of former leaders and its opposition to the election of an Adivasi woman as President. Modi concluded by asserting confidence in his government's direction and the support of the people, contrasting it with the diminishing credibility of the Congress. The article also mentions unrelated content such as the transfer of a BJD leader's wife by the Election Commission, which is not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>What is the three-stage Hamas ceasefire plan that Netanyahu rejected</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-ceasefire-plan-details-9149500/</link>
			<description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed confidence in achieving total victory in Gaza, rejecting a ceasefire offer from Hamas. The proposed ceasefire by Hamas involves a three-stage plan, each with a 45-day truce, to exchange hostages and begin reconstruction in Gaza. The plan includes the release of Israeli women, boys under 19, and the sick and elderly in exchange for Palestinian women and children in Israeli jails, followed by the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the exchange of bodies and mortal remains. Hamas seeks guarantees from Qatar, Egypt, and others for the ceasefire's durability. US President Joe Biden finds Hamas's demands excessive, but is open to continued negotiations. The conflict has resulted in over 27,700 Palestinian deaths and at least 65,000 injuries. The war has also impacted the potential Israel-Saudi agreement, with Saudi Arabia insisting on the recognition of an independent Palestinian state with 1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital before normalizing ties with Israel.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand UCC Bill: What changes in marriage, divorce, guardianship, and adoption?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/uttarakhand-ucc-bill-what-changes-in-marriage-divorce-guardianship-and-adoption-9149384/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, 2024, introduces significant reforms in marriage, adoption, and guardianship. It mandates the registration of marriages and divorces, with penalties for non-compliance. The Bill aims to prevent bigamy and fraudulent marriages but may expose inter-caste and inter-faith couples to surveillance. It criminalizes extrajudicial divorce methods and certain remarriage customs, while recognizing mehr and dower payments. The Bill does not address the guardianship issue, maintaining the father as the guardian and mother as the custodian, which continues the discrimination against mothers. It legitimizes children from void marriages and live-in relationships but does not reform Hindu adoption practices. The Bill's enforcement through criminalization may disproportionately affect minority communities and enable misuse against inter-faith and inter-caste couples. The article suggests that while the Bill has positive aspects, it misses opportunities for reform and could have unintended negative consequences. The unrelated content regarding President Joe Biden's remarks on immigration has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Kerala govt to protest against Centre at Jantar Mantar: What are its grievances over money allocation?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/kerala-protest-against-centre-why-9149213/</link>
			<description>The Kerala government is planning a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to voice concerns over the central government's fiscal policies, which they claim are financially restrictive. The main issues highlighted include:

- **Tax Share Discrepancy**: Kerala alleges a significant reduction in state receipts by Rs 57,400 crore and claims it is not receiving a fair share of taxes from the central government. Comparatively, Kerala receives only Rs 21 for every Rs 79 of its own tax collection, while states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar receive higher contributions from the Centre.

- **GST Compensation**: The state reports a loss of Rs 12,000 crore due to the cessation of GST compensation from June 2022. Kerala is seeking an extension of the compensation period, which was initially promised for five years after the introduction of GST in 2017.

- **Reduced Allotment from Divisible Tax Pool**: Kerala's share from the central divisible pool of taxes has decreased from 3.87% during the 10th Finance Commission to 1.925% in the 15th Finance Commission, leading to a substantial drop in revenue.

- **Special Assistance for Capital Expenditure**: Kerala criticizes the impractical guidelines of the Centre's Special Capital Assistance scheme and opposes the co-branding of centrally sponsored projects, which has led to delayed transfers of funds.

- **Borrowing Limit Cuts**: The state's borrowing limit was reduced mid-fiscal without prior notice, which Kerala attributes to incorrect calculations by the Centre.

- **Inclusion of Off-Budget Borrowings**: Off-budget borrowings for state entities like KIIFB and KSSPL are being counted towards the state's borrowing limit, reducing Kerala's net borrowing ceiling.

The state government is demanding fair treatment and consideration of its financial challenges, including the impact of effective birth control measures on tax allocation and the need to address second-generation development issues. Kerala's Chief Minister, cabinet colleagues, and legislators are expected to participate in the protest.</description>

			<title>Inheritance in Uttarakhand UCC: What do Hindus, Muslims, and Christians gain or lose?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/inheritance-in-uttarakhand-ucc-hindus-muslims-and-christians-9149092/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill of 2024 proposes a unified legal framework for succession and inheritance that would apply to all individuals regardless of religion. It aims to replace the current system governed by various acts and personal laws with a single code that resembles the Indian Succession Act (ISA). Under the UCC, Class I heirs (spouse, children, parents, and certain heirs of predeceased children) will inherit equally, and in their absence, other relatives like siblings and their children, followed by the closest relatives, will inherit the property.

**For the Muslim community**, the UCC removes the one-third limit on testamentary succession imposed by the Shariat, potentially affecting vulnerable groups. The UCC ensures equal inheritance for male and female heirs, altering the current practice where female heirs receive half the share of male counterparts.

**For Hindus**, the UCC does not distinguish between ancestral and self-acquired property, nor does it mention coparcenary rights, which could affect the protection afforded by the coparcenary system. The Bill also does not address Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), which have implications for tax exemptions.

**For Christians**, the UCC changes the inheritance rights of parents, allowing them to inherit alongside lineal descendants, unlike under the ISA where they inherit only in their absence.

The UCC also recognizes children born out of live-in relationships as legitimate, granting them inheritance rights. However, live-in partners do not have non-testamentary succession rights, and the Bill does not clarify the inheritance rights for partners in existing polygamous marriages.

The Bill's impact is significant as it standardizes the scheme of succession across religions, alters the rights of heirs, and addresses the status of children from live-in relationships, while leaving some areas, such as the rights of transgender individuals and live-in partners, unclear.</description>

			<title>Why is Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s government protesting in Delhi?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/siddaramaiah-karnataka-government-protesting-delhi-jantar-mantar-9149053/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, is protesting in Delhi against the Union government's financial allocations. The protest is a response to the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations, which reduced Karnataka's share of the divisible pool of taxes from 4.71% to 3.64%, a significant decrease compared to the 14th Finance Commission. This reduction is seen as an injustice by the state government, which claims a loss of ₹1.87 lakh crore.

The state's grievances include a reduction in GST devolution, inadequate GST compensation, and the Centre's refusal to share cesses and surcharges with the states, amounting to ₹55,000 crore. Additionally, none of the ₹11,495 crore recommended by the 15th Finance Commission for specific projects was released to Karnataka.

Despite the Union budget nearly doubling from 2018-19 to 2023-24, Karnataka has not seen a commensurate increase in allocated resources. The actual share of taxes devolved to states is around 30%, lower than the 41% recommended by the 15th FC, leading to dissatisfaction in Karnataka.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has denied any discrimination against non-BJP ruled states, stating that tax devolution is based on the Finance Commission's recommendations without her discretionary influence. Meanwhile, the BJP in Karnataka criticizes the state government for political posturing after depleting state funds through guarantee schemes.</description>

			<title>How the govt wants to make movie theatres accessible for persons with visual and hearing disabilities</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/govt-cbfc-cinema-accessible-hearing-visual-impaired-9148441/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting in India has drafted guidelines to enhance accessibility for the hearing and visually impaired in cinemas. The guidelines require film producers to create two versions of a film: one standard and one with accessibility features like audio descriptions and sign language interpretation. Cinemas must then provide these versions, either through dedicated screenings or by offering assistive equipment during regular shows. The guidelines also call for a self-regulatory mechanism for accessible seating and staff training to assist disabled customers. A committee, including members with impairments, will monitor the implementation, and grievances can be addressed through a formal complaint process. These measures are in response to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and aim to ensure an inclusive movie-going experience. The guidelines will become mandatory three years after notification.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking | Stagnant sales but soaring profits: Making sense of quarterly corporate earnings</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-corporate-earnings-9147977/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the financial performance of India's publicly traded companies, highlighting a trend of **stagnating sales but rising profits**. It raises concerns about whether companies will invest in new capacities if they cannot significantly increase sales. The government expects the private sector to boost investment following the interim Budget, but this may be challenging if sales do not improve, especially for non-financial companies.

Key points include:
- **Total income growth** and **net profit growth** are crucial, with total sales being a major contributor to total income.
- **1,165 listed companies** have declared their results for the December 2023 quarter, showing less than 8% growth in total income but almost 26% growth in profits after tax (PAT).
- The growth rates of total income over the past three quarters have been low and slow, while PAT has risen sharply.
- There's a significant difference in top-line growth between finance and non-finance companies, with the latter struggling to increase revenues.
- Deflation in commodity prices is one reason for the revenue decline in non-financial companies, leading to marginal real sales growth.
- The article questions the sustainability of profit growth without sales growth and the willingness of companies to invest in new capacities despite having the means to do so.

The article concludes by emphasizing the challenge non-finance companies and the government face in expanding net sales in real terms, which is crucial for sustained economic growth. The author invites readers to share their views and queries.

			<title>Pakistan elections: The view from New Delhi as Army appears set to install Nawaz Sharif in power again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/elections-in-pakistan-the-view-from-new-delhi-as-army-appears-set-to-install-nawaz-sharif-in-power-again-9147579/</link>
			<description>Pakistan is set to conduct its 12th national general elections on February 8, 2024, with about half of its population eligible to vote. The elections are significant for the balance of power between the civilian government and the military. The military's influence is evident, with the previous election in 2018 seeing Imran Khan, a former cricket star, becoming Prime Minister with the Army's support. However, Imran Khan is now imprisoned, and the upcoming elections are focused on his absence and the charges against him.

The Army's current preferred candidate is Nawaz Sharif, a three-time Prime Minister who has returned to Pakistan and is seen favorably by the military. Asif Ali Zardari and his son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari are also political contenders, though their party's influence is now considered limited to Sindh.

The fairness of the elections is questioned by analysts, citing the arrest and harassment of PTI workers, denial of their election symbol, and reports of candidates being blocked from nominations. The military and other unelected forces are seen as manipulating the elections against Imran Khan and his party.

Punjab, with the largest voter base, is a key battleground for PTI and PML(N), with past winning margins being narrow. The youth vote and women's participation are also crucial factors, with economic issues like inflation, cost of living, and unemployment likely influencing voter decisions.

From India's perspective, the elections are predictable, with the military's choice clear. However, the alignment of election cycles between India and Pakistan could offer an opportunity for long-term engagement between the two countries. The article suggests that the upcoming elections could be a pivotal moment for the region's politics.</description>

- **Marriage Age**: Aligning the minimum age of marriage for Muslim women and men to 18 and 21, respectively, consistent with existing laws for other communities.
- **Succession**: The UCC removes restrictions on Muslims bequeathing property through a will, allowing them to leave their property to anyone without limitation. Intestate succession (without a will) would follow the Indian Succession Act, 1925, with property passing to Class-1 heirs (children, widow, parents) and then to Class-2 heirs (siblings, nieces, nephews, grandparents) if no Class-1 heirs exist.
- **Polygamy and Bigamy**: The UCC Bill prohibits polygamy and bigamy, requiring that neither party has a living spouse at the time of marriage.
- **Criminalisation of Certain Practices**: Practices like Iddat and Nikah Halala are criminalised, with penalties for forcing someone to comply with such conditions.
- **Hindu Succession**: The distinction between ancestral and self-acquired property is removed, and both parents are elevated as Class I heirs in intestate succession, potentially affecting the inheritance rights of children and widows.

The bill aims to standardise personal laws, impacting various communities and their traditional practices.</description>

			<title>How the Uniform Civil Code came to be included in the Indian Constitution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-the-uniform-civil-code-came-to-be-included-in-the-indian-constitution-9147625/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the tabling of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill in the Uttarakhand state Assembly by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. The bill aims to standardize personal laws across communities, covering marriage, inheritance, divorce, and adoption. It fulfills a BJP election promise and follows the submission of a draft by a committee led by retired Supreme Court judge Justice Ranjana P Desai.

The UCC is rooted in Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, which calls for a uniform civil code for all citizens. The article was adopted in 1948 after debates in the Constituent Assembly. Members of the All India Muslim League argued against the UCC, citing concerns over religious freedom and harmony. They proposed amendments to ensure personal laws wouldn't be changed without community approval.

Congress members, including K M Munshi and Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, supported the UCC, arguing it would promote equality and unity. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, chairman of the Drafting Committee, emphasized that most laws were already uniform and that the UCC would only address the remaining personal laws. He assured that the UCC would not be imposed but would apply to those who accept it.

Ultimately, the Assembly rejected the proposed amendments and adopted Article 44 as it stands today. The article summarizes the historical debate and the current legislative efforts to implement the UCC in Uttarakhand, with potential implications for other states like Gujarat and Assam.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code: Registration of live-ins, jail term raise questions of privacy &amp; liberty</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/uttarakhand-uniform-civil-code-registration-of-live-ins-jail-term-raise-questions-of-privacy-liberty-9147711/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill introduced in the Uttarakhand Assembly, which mandates compulsory registration of live-in relationships for heterosexual couples with the state. The Bill equates live-in relationships to marriage and requires partners to notify a Registrar within a month of starting or ending such a relationship. Failure to register or produce a certificate of the relationship could result in jail terms of up to six months.

The Bill aims to deter heinous crimes within live-in relationships and protect the interests of young adults, as per state officials. However, experts argue that compulsory registration infringes on personal freedom and privacy, a fundamental right recognized by the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy ruling.

The proposed Code also allows women deserted by their live-in partners to claim maintenance, similar to married women. Live-in relationships are currently recognized under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, but the new Bill seeks to formalize these relationships further.

The law will apply to residents of Uttarakhand, both within and outside the state. It also codifies the legal position that children born in live-in relationships are legitimate. The Registrar is empowered to conduct inquiries and maintain records, which will be forwarded to the police.

The article also references the Supreme Court's recognition of the right to privacy and the Delhi High Court's Naz Foundation ruling, which emphasizes the importance of privacy in developing human relations.

Lastly, the article mentions the Election Commission of India's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department due to allegations of misuse of public office for election purposes.</description>

			<title>Hits and misses of Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code: What the Bill does, and does not do</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/uttarakhand-uniform-civil-code-takeaways-9147379/</link>
			<description>The Uttarakhand government has introduced its own Uniform Civil Code (UCC) which applies to the state's residents, excluding LGBT individuals and members of Scheduled Tribes. The UCC borrows from secular laws and repeals inconsistent family laws. It mandates registration of live-in relationships and treats children born out of wedlock or in live-in relationships as legitimate. The Code abolishes the Hindu coparcenary property system, making all property pass as individual property. It retains certain matrimonial remedies and court discretion in property division, while criminalizing non-registration of live-in relationships, child marriage, and non-judicial divorce methods. The Code does not address marriage equality for LGBT persons, does not include irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a divorce ground, and does not fully address discrimination against mothers in guardianship laws. Penalties are introduced for various offenses, reflecting a move away from the recent decriminalization trend. The article also mentions an unrelated political issue regarding the transfer of a public official due to alleged misuse of office.</description>

			<title>Indians can travel to Iran without a visa: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/indians-can-travel-to-iran-without-a-visa-all-you-need-to-know-9147327/</link>
			<description>Indians are now eligible for visa-free travel to Iran under certain conditions. This relaxation, effective from February 4, applies to Indian ordinary passport holders visiting Iran for tourism and entering the country by air. The visa exemption allows for a 15-day stay and re-entry after six months. For longer stays or multiple entries within six months, or for other visa types, Indians must apply through Iranian representations in India. The initiative, announced in December 2023, includes India and 32 other countries, aiming to boost tourism and improve Iran's global image. Additionally, several countries, including Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Thailand, have recently waived visa requirements for Indian citizens. Currently, 27 countries offer visa-free entry to Indians. The article also mentions a political issue unrelated to the visa topic, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>What is the 8.5-acre land case in which Hemant Soren was arrested, what is he accused of</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/why-was-hemant-soren-arrested-explained-9147266/</link>
			<description>Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, arrested in a land scam case, has challenged the BJP and the ED to produce evidence of his ownership of 8.5 acres of land in Ranchi, vowing to quit politics if proven. The ED's investigation linked Soren to Bhanu Pratap Prasad, a revenue sub-inspector involved in illegal property acquisitions. Seized documents and mobile data suggest Soren's involvement in land fraud, leading to his arrest. Soren denies ownership, claiming the land is non-transferable 'Bhuinhari' land owned by the Pahan family. He accuses the ED of political motives and questions the credibility of evidence used for his arrest. A separate legal dispute established Raj Kumar Pahan as the rightful owner of the contested land. Additionally, an unrelated political controversy involves the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan, a BJD leader's wife, due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>How to stay safe from Skype scams, in which scammers impersonate police officers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-to-stay-safe-from-skype-scams-impersonate-police-9146872/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a scam incident involving a Mumbai resident, Kinjal Shah, who received an automated call falsely informing her that her contact number would be deactivated and was later asked to participate in a video call for an FIR statement. The caller, posing as a police officer, claimed she was involved in sending illegal messages from an alternate number. Kinjal became suspicious and realized it was a scam when the caller, among other things, insisted on a video statement and avoided a physical police station visit.

The article then provides advice on how to recognize and avoid such scams:
- **Be skeptical of unsolicited calls** demanding your presence without a formal notice, as per section 41A of the CrPC.
- **Police officers do not typically initiate video calls**; it's okay to not answer such calls.
- **A woman should be interrogated by a woman officer**; if this is not the case, end the call.
- **Protect personal information** and avoid sharing sensitive details over calls.
- **Capture evidence** like screenshots or recordings if you suspect a scam call.
- **Trust your instincts** and seek help if something seems suspicious.
- **File a complaint** at the nearest police station if you believe you're a victim of a scam.

			<title>How Uber, OLA, BluSmart, inDrive charge you  — and how Karnataka govt’s order can change it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/karnataka-government-order-cab-fares-9146669/</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government has issued an order that impacts the ride-hailing industry by setting uniform minimum fares based on vehicle cost and prohibiting surge pricing. This order affects companies like Uber, Ola, BluSmart, and inDrive, which must now adjust their business models in Karnataka. The minimum fares are divided into three slabs according to vehicle cost, with no consideration for vehicle type or features like air-conditioning. The fares are solely based on distance, not time, with a 10% surcharge allowed for nighttime trips.

Uber and Ola, which use algorithms to determine fares based on demand, will need to change their pricing strategies as the order disallows surge pricing and time-based fares. BluSmart, which operates electric vehicles and has fixed rates, is expected to be less affected due to its existing pricing model that doesn't involve surge pricing.

inDrive's model, which allows passengers and drivers to negotiate fares, will have to align its base fare with the new minimums, potentially making trips more expensive. The order does not address commission rates, but higher minimum fares could improve driver earnings. However, according to Fairwork India Ratings 2023, ride-hailing companies scored low on fair pay criteria, indicating issues with commissions, costs, and lack of clarity in their relationships with drivers.

The order aims to standardize fares and remove surge pricing, which could lead to better earnings for drivers but may also require significant changes in the business operations of ride-hailing services. The impact on consumer welfare and the overall business landscape remains to be seen, with calls for the government to reconsider the implications of such regulations.</description>

			<title>Explained: What’s in the new Public Examinations Bill, aimed at stopping cheating in exams?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/new-bill-to-stop-cheating-in-exams-explained-9145994/</link>
			<description>The **Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2024**, introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha, aims to ensure transparency and fairness in public examinations. It defines **unfair means** as actions like question paper leakage, unauthorized access to examination materials, tampering with answer sheets, and assisting candidates during exams. The Bill covers examinations conducted by authorities like the **UPSC, SSC, RRBs, IBPS, and NTA**, and extends to all central government recruitment.

Violations are treated as **cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable offenses**, with punishments ranging from **three to five years in prison** and fines up to **Rs 10 lakh**. Service providers can face fines up to **Rs 1 crore**. Organized crime related to paper leaks can lead to **five to ten years in prison** and a minimum fine of **one crore rupees**.

The Bill responds to widespread question paper leaks affecting millions of candidates. It seeks to deter unfair practices and assure candidates that their efforts will be rewarded without the influence of malpractices. The legislation also serves as a model for states to adopt similar measures. The Bill ensures that candidates are not liable for actions within its purview and will be governed by existing administrative provisions.</description>

			<title>Explained: China’s ‘suspended’ death sentence to Australian citizen, its likely impact on ties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-suspended-death-sentence-australia-writer-ties-9145557/</link>
			<description>Yang Hengjun, a China-born Australian writer, was sentenced to a suspended death sentence by a Chinese court, which will be converted to life imprisonment after two years. Detained since 2019, Yang's case has been a point of contention in China-Australia relations, which have seen recent tensions over trade and security issues. Yang, who migrated to Australia in 2002, has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese government and claimed to have worked for the Chinese foreign ministry, a claim denied by China. His trial was held behind closed doors in 2021.

The article also discusses the broader context of China's relations with Western countries, including Canada, highlighting instances of espionage charges and diplomatic tensions. It notes the release of another China-born Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, and the potential thawing of China-Australia relations with the election of Anthony Albanese as Australian Prime Minister. However, recent incidents, such as allegations against the Chinese navy injuring Australian divers and espionage charges against Canadians, have added complexity to these international relationships.

The article concludes with a mention of trade issues between China and Canada, the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, and the subsequent diplomatic fallout, including the arrest of two Canadians in China and trade restrictions. The situation improved in 2021 with the release of Meng and the two Canadians, signaling a possible easing of tensions. Separately, the article briefly mentions a domestic political issue in India unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>PM Modi says Nehru, Indira had a low opinion of Indians: Which speeches was he referring to, what did the former PMs say?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/pm-modi-nehru-indira-indians-lazy-9145553/</link>
			<description>In a speech in Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized the Congress leadership and the Nehru-Gandhi family, accusing them of having a low opinion of Indians' work ethic and intelligence. He referenced historical speeches by former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, suggesting they believed Indians were lazy and lacked intelligence, and were prone to complacency and hopelessness. Modi argued that these views were reflective of the Congress party's attitude rather than that of Indians as a whole. He cited Nehru's 1959 speech advocating for self-reliance and minimal government interference, and Indira's 1974 speech during the JP movement, calling for societal improvement without violence and maintaining hope and courage for the country's future. Additionally, there was a mention of the Election Commission transferring Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office for electoral influence.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: Is the Sun behind the rising global temperatures?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/is-sun-behind-rising-global-temperatures-climate-change-9145524/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the Sun on global warming. It explains that while the Sun is the primary source of energy for Earth, its brightness varies slightly due to an 11-year cycle. However, despite a small increase in solar radiation in the past, the Sun's energy output has only varied by 0.1% in the last five decades, which is not enough to account for the current global warming trend. The article concludes that the warming of the lower atmosphere and cooling of the upper atmosphere is consistent with greenhouse gas-induced warming, affirming that human activities are the main cause of recent global warming. Earth's temperature has been rising at a rate of approximately 0.15 to 0.20 degrees Celsius per decade since 1975, aligning with increasing greenhouse gas levels. The article is part of a series addressing common questions about climate change. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Polls in Pakistan: 10 data points to explain the elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-polls-10-data-points-9145480/</link>
			<description>Pakistan is set to hold national elections on February 8 amidst economic challenges and political turmoil. The country, with a population of 241 million, has approximately 128 million registered voters, though the turnout is expected to be lower than the 52% seen in 2018. A significant portion of the population is under 18, the legal voting age, with 44% of registered voters under 35, highlighting the youth's importance in the election.

Voters will elect 266 representatives to the National Assembly, following a first-past-the-post system. Additionally, 60 seats are reserved for women and 10 for non-Muslims, allocated proportionally to parties' performance. The provinces vary in population and representation, with Punjab being the most significant.

The Election Commission has registered 5,121 candidates, predominantly male, from 167 political parties or as independents. Major parties include PML-N and PPP, while PTI, led by Imran Khan, is barred from contesting under its symbol. The elections will take place across 90,582 polling stations, categorized by security sensitivity.

Economic issues dominate voter concerns, with inflation nearing 30% and the Pakistani Rupee losing half its value against the US Dollar in two years. Pakistan is currently under a $3 billion IMF bailout, leading to social spending cuts.

Allegations of election malpractice persist, with former Prime Minister Imran Khan arrested and PTI barred from elections, raising questions about the public's response to PTI's exclusion. The data is sourced from the Election Commission of Pakistan, the 2023 Pakistan Census, the IMF, and Dawn. This article is part of a series on the 2024 Pakistan elections.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/grammys-2024-sza-rb-music-story-9145166/</link>
			<description>SZA, an American singer-songwriter, won three Grammy awards for her album 'SOS', which includes the viral song 'Kill Bill'. Her music, known for its minimalist soul sound and heartbreak themes, has topped the Billboard charts for seven weeks, a record for a female artist this decade. SZA's unique vocal range and candid lyrics on sexuality and heartbreak have been widely appreciated. The album 'SOS' also features a conversation with Sadhguru, reflecting SZA's diverse influences, including her upbringing in a Christian-Muslim household and her initial studies in marine biology. Her transition to music was accidental, starting with recording vocals for her brother's tracks, leading to her discovery by Top Dawg Entertainment. SZA's stage name is inspired by the Supreme Alphabet from the Five Percenters, a Black nationalist movement. Her career began with mixtapes and EPs, and she has written songs for Rihanna and Beyonce. SZA's journey is marked by her honest expression and exploration of personal and societal themes.</description>

			<title>RBI monetary policy: Why repo rate is likely to remain unchanged for the sixth time</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-monetary-policy-repo-rate-change-mpc-9144616/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to maintain the repo rate at **6.5%** during its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting from February 6 to 8, marking a year since the last change. The stance is likely to remain as 'withdrawal of accommodation' in light of the aim to achieve a **4% CPI inflation target**. Despite the US Federal Reserve keeping its rates unchanged, the RBI may introduce liquidity measures to address the banking system's tight conditions, with a liquidity deficit recorded at Rs 3.46 lakh crore as of January 24.

CPI inflation reached **5.69%** in December, above the 4% goal but within the government's 2-6% range. The RBI projects a **5.4% inflation rate** for FY24. Goldman Sachs and other economists predict the repo rate will stay unchanged until at least Q3 of CY24, with potential rate cuts starting from August. The RBI's real GDP growth forecast for FY24 is **7%**, and India is on track to become the world's third-largest economy within three years.

Borrowers can expect relief as external benchmark lending rates linked to the repo rate will not rise, although interest rates on loans tied to the MCLR may increase due to incomplete transmission of previous rate hikes. The RBI is also expected to continue providing liquidity through 14-day variable repo rate operations to mitigate over-tightening risks. A formal change in monetary policy stance might be postponed until April. The article also mentions a political development involving the Election Commission and a BJD leader's spouse, unrelated to the RBI's monetary policy.</description>

			<title>Three ways to deal with the high govt debt</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/three-ways-to-deal-with-the-high-govt-debt-9144329/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's public debt situation in the context of the upcoming government post the April-May 2024 national elections. It highlights that the current government, led by Narendra Modi, will end its term with a public debt exceeding 80% of India's GDP. The debt-GDP ratio has seen fluctuations over the years, peaking at 88.5% in 2020-21 due to COVID-19 related expenditures and revenue shortfalls. The article also touches on the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) law, which aimed to reduce general government debt to 60% of GDP by 2024-25, a target that has been missed.

The rise in debt is attributed to increased borrowing during the pandemic and higher capital expenditure on infrastructure. The government's new fiscal consolidation path aims for a deficit-to-GDP ratio below 4.5% by 2025-26. The article suggests that high nominal GDP growth could help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, as witnessed from 2003-04 to 2010-11. The conclusion is that India needs a mix of fiscal consolidation and growth to manage its debt, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.

			<title>This Quote Means: From India’s first Budget, ‘If the… State is not built on durable foundations, it will be futile’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-india-first-budget-9144071/</link>
			<description>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim Union Budget for 2024-25, emphasizing the government's focus on the needs and aspirations of the poor, women, youth, and farmers to guide India's growth towards becoming a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047. The article draws parallels with the first budget of independent India presented by RK Shanmukham Chetty in 1947, highlighting the challenges of post-colonial India, such as refugee rehabilitation and food self-sufficiency. Chetty's speech underscored the importance of establishing the rule of law and increasing productivity to address communal disorders and industrial unrest.

The article reflects on the moral principles underlying fiscal policy decisions, suggesting that ethical considerations and values influence budgetary choices, which can show a preference for certain societal groups. It cites an IMF working paper on the moral perspectives in public finance, discussing the role of taxation and government spending in reflecting political and moral choices. The piece concludes by suggesting that moral principles should guide fiscal policy, as exemplified by Chetty's words from over 75 years ago.

Additionally, the article mentions the Election Commission of India's order to transfer Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misusing public office for electoral gains. This incident is highlighted to illustrate the ongoing challenges in maintaining ethical governance. The summary omits unrelated content as per your request.</description>

			<title>Northern Ireland gets a govt after two years: Why the long standoff, what has changed now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/northern-ireland-govt-standoff-explained-9144070/</link>
			<description>Northern Ireland has established a functioning government after a two-year paralysis due to Brexit-induced trade rule changes. **Michelle O’Neill** of Sinn Féin, historically linked to the Irish Republican Army, is the new First Minister. The government's dysfunction stemmed from the **Northern Ireland Protocol**, which placed trade checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, angering unionists who felt it weakened ties with the UK. The **Windsor Framework** and subsequent negotiations led to a new deal, easing trade checks and promising financial support for Northern Ireland. The devolved government, now operational, oversees local matters like health and social services, while the UK government manages broader issues. The resolution of the deadlock is expected to improve public services and address public sector concerns.</description>

			<title>Seven cheetahs born in Kuno: Challenges, survival chances, and the wild-vs-protected debate</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cheetahs-born-in-kuno-challenges-survival-9143959/</link>
			<description>Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh, India, celebrated the birth of seven cheetah cubs, a significant boost for Project Cheetah, which aims to reintroduce cheetahs to India. The cubs' arrival is a hopeful sign that cheetahs are adapting to Indian conditions, especially after previous losses.

Cheetah cubs go through several stages of development, starting as blind and helpless at birth, hiding in nests to avoid predators, and eventually learning to hunt with their mother by one year of age. At around 18 months, they separate from their mother, with males forming coalitions and females leading solitary lives.

Wildlife officials monitor pregnant cheetahs closely, ensuring they are well-fed and minimizing stress. Intervention is minimal unless necessary, such as in cases of neglect or danger. The survival of cubs is challenging, with high mortality rates in the wild. There's ongoing debate on whether cubs should be raised in enclosures or under free-ranging conditions, with concerns about genetic strength and the need for human intervention.

The article also mentions unrelated political news regarding the Election Commission of India's actions, which is not connected to the wildlife content.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/vijay-politics-party-tamil-nadu-films-history-politicians-9143820/</link>
			<description>Tamil actor 'Thalapathy' Vijay has announced the launch of his political party, Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam, and plans to contest in the 2026 Tamil Nadu State Assembly elections. He views politics as a sacred service and intends to immerse himself in it after fulfilling his film commitments. The article traces the history of Tamil actors transitioning to politics, highlighting the influence of cinema on Tamil Nadu's political landscape.

It discusses the legacies of former Chief Ministers like Annadurai, who used films to promote the Dravidian movement, and M Karunanidhi, who infused social reform ideas into cinema. M G Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa are noted for their film careers bolstering their political journeys. The article also mentions actor Vijayakanth's political venture with the DMDK and Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam.

Vijay aims for a transparent, non-partisan governance approach, respecting Tamil culture and the Indian Constitution. His fan club has seen electoral success, indicating his potential political influence. The article concludes with the author's background, emphasizing her contributions to The Indian Express in various sections.

			<title>More subjects, credit system: What changes CBSE has proposed for Class 10 and 12, why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/changes-cbse-has-proposed-for-class-10-and-12-why-9143822/</link>
			<description>The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in India is planning to overhaul the academic structure for Classes 9 to 12 to align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's recommendation for creditisation. This system aims to equate vocational and general education, allowing for seamless transition between the two. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) introduced by the University Grants Commission in 2022 will be integrated into schools, requiring students to earn credits to progress through grades and eventually into university programs. Credits will be stored digitally in the Academic Bank of Credits.

Under the proposed changes, an academic year will consist of 1,200 notional learning hours, equivalent to 40 credits. The curriculum will be adjusted to include teaching hours and credits for each subject. Students in Classes 9 and 10 will need to complete 10 subjects, including three languages (with at least two Indian languages) and seven core subjects. For Classes 11 and 12, six subjects are required, with at least one Indian language. The credits earned will be separate from exam marks.

CBSE will conduct external exams for core subjects in Class 10, while art, physical education, and vocational subjects will have a mix of internal and board assessments. Class 12 subjects will be divided into four groups, with external exams for languages and certain other subjects, and a combination of assessments for others. The grading system will remain unchanged, with students receiving grades from A1 to E based on their rank order in the exams. The credit system will not affect the grading process. The plan is currently under review by heads of CBSE-affiliated institutions.</description>

			<title>Explained: The four issues that CJI DY Chandrachud highlighted within the legal profession</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/issues-cji-dy-chandrachud-legal-profession-9143599/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Chief Justice of India's (CJI) address on the Supreme Court's 75th Foundation Day, where he highlighted four judiciary issues: the culture of adjournments, oral argument durations, court vacations, and equality for first-generation lawyers. 

**Adjournments**: The CJI criticized the frequent adjournments in courts, which contribute to case backlogs. Despite rules limiting adjournments, the practice persists, with the CJI noting 3,688 adjournment requests in two months.

**Oral Arguments**: To improve efficiency, the CJI suggested time schedules for arguments, similar to practices in constitutional bench matters. Past efforts to limit argument durations have met resistance, but recent cases have seen more structured and shorter hearings.

**Court Vacations**: The article mentions proposals to reduce court vacations to address case pendencies, with the Supreme Court reducing summer vacations from ten to seven weeks in 2014. Alternatives like flexi-time for legal professionals are also discussed.

**First-Generation Lawyers**: The CJI emphasized supporting first-generation lawyers and women in the legal profession. Recent statistics show increased diversity among judges and law clerks, and efforts to provide equal opportunities are underway, including remote court appearances and recognition in senior advocate designations.

The article concludes with a separate note on the Election Commission of India's transfer of an official due to alleged misuse of public office, unrelated to the judiciary issues discussed.</description>

			<title>Pigeon suspected of being Chinese spy released: A short history of animal spies</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/short-history-of-animal-spies-9142708/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

A pigeon suspected of being a Chinese spy was released by Mumbai police after eight months of detention. Initially captured with rings bearing Chinese-like words, it was later identified as a Taiwanese racing bird that had strayed into India. This incident echoes historical uses of pigeons in espionage, notably during World War I, where they were fitted with cameras and used to deliver messages, with a 95% success rate. The famed pigeon Cher Ami saved 194 soldiers in 1918 and received multiple honors posthumously.

The article also touches on the use of other animals in espionage, such as dolphins and sea lions by the US Navy for detecting submarines and mines, and the CIA's Acoustic Kitty project that aimed to use cats as listening devices. These examples illustrate the diverse methods of animal involvement in espionage activities over the years.

Lastly, the article mentions a recent political development in India, unrelated to the main topic of animal spies. The Election Commission transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan, the wife of a political leader, due to allegations of misusing her public office for electoral gains. This part of the article serves as an update on a separate issue.</description>

			<title>Why PETA wants to ban two age-old Assamese traditions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/peta-assam-buffalo-bulbul-fighting-9142486/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the revival of traditional buffalo and bulbul fights in Assam during the Magh Bihu festival. These events, which are part of Assam's folk culture and tied to religious practices, were halted following a Supreme Court judgment in 2014 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals. Despite this, some buffalo fights continued, leading to the Assam government framing SOPs for conducting these fights without cruelty. The SOPs allow fights only in traditional locations and within a specified period in January, with strict rules against animal mistreatment.

However, PETA India has challenged the revival in the Gauhati High Court, citing instances of animal cruelty during recent events. They have filed petitions seeking a ban on the fights and an interim stay during the court proceedings. The court has observed that any buffalo fight held beyond the stipulated period would violate government guidelines and has directed the district administration to prevent such events. The article also briefly mentions an upcoming IPL cricket match, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna for L K Advani: How his Rath Yatra contributed to the rise of the BJP</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bharat-ratna-l-k-advani-rath-yatra-bjp-9142401/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that L K Advani will be awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. Advani, a key figure in the BJP's rise to a national political force, was pivotal in the party's transformation during the late 1980s and early 1990s. His leadership and the controversial Rath Yatra in 1990 were significant in mobilizing support for the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which played a central role in the BJP's ascendancy. Despite the violence that followed the yatra, the BJP's political fortunes rose, culminating in the demolition of the Babri Masjid and subsequent communal riots. Advani's influence was instrumental in the BJP's national success, although he never achieved his prime ministerial ambitions, giving way to Atal Bihari Vajpayee post the Babri demolition. The article also mentions the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to alleged misuse of public office, unrelated to Advani's recognition.</description>

			<title>Will ‘Thalapathy’ Vijay disrupt Tamil Nadu politics?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/thalapathy-vijay-tamil-nadu-politics-9141593/</link>
			<description>Tamil actor Vijay, known as 'Thalapathy', has launched his political party, Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam, aiming to challenge the dominant DMK and AIADMK parties in Tamil Nadu. With a political landscape that has seen various cinema personalities enter politics, Vijay's move is significant as he is considered a superstar with unparalleled stature, similar to the legendary MGR. His party's ideology focuses on universal kinship and virtues like compassion, non-violence, and respect for life, as indicated by his statement quoting the Tamil text Thirukkural.

Vijay's appeal is believed to transcend caste, class, religion, and region, and he is expected to have an edge in rural areas. However, the success in Tamil Nadu politics requires a coherent ideology, as seen from the experiences of other actors-turned-politicians like Vijayakanth and Kamal Haasan. Vijay's party faces the challenge of lacking prominent faces, but talks are underway to bring in notable individuals such as retired IPS officer M Ravi, recently retired DGP C Sylendra Babu, and IAS officer U Sagayam.

Despite his reserved off-screen persona, Vijay's political journey is anticipated to impact Tamil Nadu's political scene, especially with the AIADMK struggling post-J Jayalalithaa's death. Vijay has stated that his party will not contest the 2024 Lok Sabha polls but will focus on the 2026 assembly elections. The article also briefly mentions an unrelated IPL 2024 cricket match.</description>

			<title>Will Europe ever return ‘looted’ Asian artifacts?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/will-europe-ever-return-looted-asian-artifacts-9141359/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the growing movement for the return of cultural artifacts taken during colonial times. It highlights several instances where European countries and museums have begun to return or consider the return of such items to their countries of origin. This includes France's pledge to return Khmer artifacts to Cambodia, Germany and France's review of African heritage objects, and the Netherlands' return of artifacts to Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The article also mentions the legal challenges involved, as the 1970 UNESCO Convention does not apply retrospectively to the peak phase of colonialism. Despite this, some European governments are proposing national laws to facilitate the restitution of objects acquired through colonialism. The return of these artifacts is seen as a gesture of goodwill and a step towards correcting historical wrongs, potentially offering soft-power benefits to European countries. The article also touches on the political complexities and reluctance of some museums to return valuable collections. Finally, it notes the potential for improved international relations through these acts of repatriation, as exemplified by the Dutch government's apology for historical colonization and subsequent artifact returns to Indonesia.

			<title>Multidimensional poverty: meaning, numbers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/multidimensional-poverty-meaning-numbers-9141495/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's progress in reducing multidimensional poverty, as highlighted in the Interim Budget speech by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. It states that **25 crore Indians** have been lifted out of poverty in the last decade. The NITI Aayog's discussion paper indicates a decline in multidimensional poverty from **29.17% in 2013-14 to 11.28% in 2022-23**, with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh seeing the most significant improvements.

The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) measures poverty using **10 indicators** across health, education, and standard of living, with India adding indicators for maternal health and bank accounts. A person is considered MPI poor if deprived in a third or more of these indicators. The MPI value represents the proportion of weighted deprivations faced by the poor divided by the total population. The data relies on interpolation and extrapolation from the National Family Health Survey, with recent trends suggesting an acceleration in poverty reduction since 2015-16. The article also briefly mentions Vidhu Vinod Chopra's reflections on his film career and collaborations.</description>

			<title>How a heavy metal drummer stripped Elon Musk of a $56 billion pay package</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/elon-musk-pay-package-drummer-9141259/</link>
			<description>A Delaware court has ruled against Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package from Tesla, deeming it unfair. The lawsuit was initiated by Tesla shareholder Richard Torenetta, who argued that the package was not necessary to incentivize Musk, as he already owned a significant portion of the company. The court's decision, if upheld on appeal, could impact Musk's wealth. The judge criticized the Tesla board for not questioning the necessity of the package and highlighted the lack of independence within the board, which includes Musk's brother and James Murdoch. The ruling suggests that the compensation plan was influenced by directors loyal to Musk. This decision is notable as it challenges what has been reported as the largest executive pay package to date.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: The crime of piracy, and how maritime forces respond to it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-piracy-somalia-indian-navy-9141173/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the persistent issue of piracy at sea, highlighting the factors that contribute to its prevalence, such as weak maritime enforcement, high traffic sea routes, poor governance, and legal complexities in international waters. It describes piracy as ranging from theft to hijacking ships for ransom, which disrupts global supply chains and increases insurance premiums. The Indian Navy's proactive role in anti-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden is emphasized, including their efforts in reducing the high-risk area and conducting successful rescue operations. The article also details the tactics used by pirates and the countermeasures employed by maritime forces, including surveillance, deterrence, and intervention strategies. It concludes that while maritime forces can manage piracy at sea, a long-term solution requires addressing the root causes on land, such as misgovernance and unemployment. The piece is authored by Vice Admiral Biswajit Dasgupta, who retired as Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, in July 2023.

			<title>How immigration has become the top issue in the 2024 US Presidential elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/immigration-us-presidential-election-border-9140994/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the US House Committee on Homeland Security's approval of impeachment articles against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for failing to enforce immigration policies. The move reflects the partisan divide over immigration, intensified by the upcoming 2024 Presidential elections. The US has seen a surge in migrants, particularly under President Biden's administration, with over 2.3 million migrants released into the country and 6 million taken into custody. Cities like New York, Chicago, and Denver have been overwhelmed, leading to calls for more federal aid.

The Republicans criticize Biden's immigration policies, which have included easing Trump-era restrictions and introducing new humanitarian "parole" policies. However, factors beyond Biden's control, such as labor market demands and global migration trends, have also influenced the rise in illegal border crossings. The core issues of mass undocumented migration include strict immigration laws, Congressional inaction on reform, and an overburdened immigration court system.

Legal immigration is described as nearly impossible, with a backlog of over three million cases in immigration courts. The last significant immigration legislation passed was in 1986, and current negotiations in the Senate are stalled due to political mistrust. The article suggests that immigration could be a decisive factor in the 2024 elections, with Trump potentially benefiting from the issue. The article concludes with a mention of a separate incident involving the Election Commission of India and a complaint against Sujata R Karthikeyan, unrelated to the US immigration topic.</description>

			<title>India’s snow leopard count: Why this Himalayan feat is only the first step to securing the cat</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-first-snow-leopard-count-wildlife-conservation-threats-9141070/</link>
			<description>The Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India (SPAI) has estimated **718 snow leopards** across regions like Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh. This assessment, conducted from 2019 to 2023, marks significant progress in understanding this elusive species.

Snow leopards inhabit approximately **100,000 sq km** of the higher Himalayan terrain in India. The study highlights the challenges of tracking the 'ghost of the mountains' due to its stealth and the difficult terrain it occupies, ranging from **10,500 to 17,000 feet** in altitude.

To address the challenges of identifying individual snow leopards, researchers have recommended manual evaluation using at least three marking patterns and employing multiple analysts. The SPAI report notes that the Wildlife Institute of India, in collaboration with NGOs, developed a protocol for estimating snow leopard populations.

The estimation process involved analyzing photographs from **1,971 camera trap locations**, identifying **241 unique individuals**, and extrapolating to the estimated population figure. In Ladakh alone, **126 unique adults** were identified from **10,789 images**, leading to an estimated population of **477** across **47,572 sq km**.

The article also discusses the impact of infrastructure development and tourism on snow leopard habitats, emphasizing the need for mitigating these effects to secure the species' future. The current count suggests a stable population, but it's just the beginning of understanding the snow leopard's patterns and trends at a landscape level. Climate change and demographic shifts pose significant challenges, and addressing them is crucial for the snow leopard's survival. The article concludes by stressing the importance of continued efforts to protect this species and its habitat.</description>

			<title>Why Mark Zuckerberg apologised to the parents of young social media users</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/mark-zuckerberg-apology-parents-social-media-senate-9140925/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a US Senate hearing where CEOs of major tech companies like Meta, X, Snap, TikTok, and Discord testified about their platforms' failures to protect children online. Parents of affected children highlighted the dangers of online content that promotes harmful body standards and child abuse. During the hearing, senators from both parties questioned the CEOs about their efforts to safeguard children, with some senators expressing frustration over the lack of sufficient protections.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced particular scrutiny over Instagram's policies on content related to child sexual abuse. The CEOs largely defended their companies, stating they are enforcing existing policies and working to improve child safety. Notably, the Snap CEO supported a Bill to create legal liability for harmful content recommendations to minors, while the X CEO stated the app does not cater to children and supported a Bill to aid victims of child exploitation.

The article also references past incidents that have brought social media's influence under scrutiny, such as the Blue Whale challenge and Facebook's data sharing with Cambridge Analytica. A bipartisan Bill, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), was introduced in Congress, with mixed support from the CEOs. Critics of the Bill argue that it could restrict free speech and threaten user privacy.

The article concludes with a separate note on the Election Commission of India's action against Sujata R Karthikeyan for alleged misuse of public office, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024: Why India Inc isn’t taking the investment baton from FM</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/budget-2024-why-india-inc-isnt-taking-the-investment-baton-from-fm-9139860/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the cautious stance of Indian companies regarding new investments due to factors such as excess capacity, high interest rates, and upcoming elections. Despite government efforts to boost private investment through measures like tax cuts and incentive schemes, investment announcements remain limited to specific sectors like aviation and power. The Reserve Bank of India's data shows a slight decline in capacity utilization in manufacturing, indicating underused production capabilities. However, there's a slight uptick in new investment announcements, particularly in the services sector.

The government's capital expenditure has increased significantly over the past four years, but the growth rate is expected to slow down, suggesting a shift towards private investment for economic growth. Industry experts express cautious optimism about the increase in private investment, supported by lower government market borrowings, which could lead to more credit availability for the private sector. The article implies that while there are signs of improvement, sustained private investment is necessary for a robust economic recovery. The Election Commission's action against a BJD leader's spouse for alleged misuse of public office is also mentioned, reflecting ongoing political dynamics.</description>

			<title>Aligarh Muslim University minority status case: 3 key legal issues argued before the Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/aligarh-university-minority-status-sc-9139270/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India concluded hearings on whether Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) can claim minority status under Article 30 of the Constitution. The key issue is the overruling of the 1967 decision in S Azeez Basha v Union of India, which stated that AMU, being established by law, could not claim minority status. Arguments presented included:

- **Petitioners' Argument**: Senior Advocate Rajeev Dhavan highlighted a contradiction in the Azeez Basha decision, arguing that it subordinates a fundamental right to a statute, making Article 30 ineffective. Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal contended that the administration's composition does not affect an institution's minority status, as per Article 30(1).

- **Respondents' Argument**: Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued that AMU had surrendered its minority status during the British rule, and the administration's control by the British government at the time of establishment is crucial.

- **1981 Amendment**: The amendment, which declared AMU as established by the Muslim community, was struck down by the Allahabad High Court in 2005. The Supreme Court is now considering whether the Azeez Basha ruling stands, which would render the 1981 amendment redundant.

The judgement has been reserved, and the outcome will determine the future of AMU's minority status and potentially impact the interpretation of Article 30 rights for minority educational institutions in India.</description>

			<title>Interim budget mentions blue economy 2.0: What this means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/interim-budget-blue-economy-2-0-what-this-means-9139321/</link>
			<description>The Interim Budget highlighted the promotion of the 'blue economy' for sustainable development. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a new scheme focusing on climate resilience, coastal aquaculture, and mariculture with a multi-sectoral approach. The 'blue economy' encompasses economic activities related to oceans, seas, and coasts, with an emphasis on sustainability. For India, with its extensive coastline and marine diversity, this is particularly significant.

The budget aims to enhance ocean health, increase aquaculture productivity, double exports, and create employment opportunities. It builds on a draft policy framework released in July 2022, which provided recommendations on various aspects of the blue economy, including governance, spatial planning, fisheries, and energy.

Additionally, during the G20 summit in New Delhi, the blue economy was a priority topic, emphasizing its global importance and India's commitment to sustainable ocean resource use.</description>

			<title>In Interim Budget 2024, Sitharaman says use of Nano DAP to be expanded: What is this made-in-India fertiliser?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sitharaman-nano-dap-fertiliser-budget-9138989/</link>
			<description>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the expansion of Nano DAP application across all agro-climatic zones in India. Nano DAP, a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to conventional di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), is expected to aid in achieving self-sufficiency in fertilizer production and benefit farmers. The product, launched by Home Minister Amit Shah and produced domestically in Gujarat, is in liquid form and boasts a smaller particle size for better assimilation in plants, leading to increased crop yields. It is also cheaper and more convenient for farmers to use. The expansion aligns with the government's goal to reduce fertilizer imports and enhance food grain production.</description>

			<description>The Bombay High Court delivered a split verdict on the IT Rules amendment, which allows the government to flag "fake news" on social media. Justice Patel struck down the amendment, citing it as censorship and an overreach of government power, while Justice Gokhale upheld it, dismissing claims of bias and stating that the rules do not penalize content unless it's patently false with malicious intent. The matter will now be referred to a third judge for a final decision, as the two judges' opinions differed. The Centre has agreed not to notify the Fact Check Unit for another 10 days. The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Interim Budget 2024: What Sitharaman said about withdrawing old tax demands, who will benefit</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/interim-budget-2024-withdrawing-old-tax-demands-9138738/</link>
			<description>The Interim Budget 2024 has introduced a proposal to alleviate the burden of old tax disputes for taxpayers. **Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman** announced the government's plan to withdraw outstanding direct tax demands up to **Rs 25,000** for the period up to FY09-10 and up to **Rs 10,000** for FY10-11 to FY14-15. This move is expected to benefit about **one crore taxpayers**, particularly those who have been consistent with their recent tax filings but have not received refunds due to these pending demands.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has implemented a demand management facilitation system to address issues where refunds are held up, resolving over **1.4 lakh cases** in the past year. The filing of Income-tax Returns (ITRs) has seen a significant increase, with **8.18 crore ITRs** filed for the assessment year 2023-2024, marking a **9% increase** from the previous year.

Income tax revenues are projected to constitute **19%** of the government's financial resources in FY25, with corporate tax at **17%**, GST at **18%**, and borrowings at **28%**. Additionally, the Election Commission of India has transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department following allegations of misuse of public office for electoral influence.</description>

			<title>Interim Budget 2024: Concerns over GDP, spending cuts; fiscal deficit is bright spot</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/interim-budget-2024-six-key-takeaways-9138579/</link>
			<description>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim Union Budget for 2024-25, focusing on the past achievements of the Modi government rather than new initiatives. The budget highlighted a nominal GDP growth of 10.5% for the coming year, with a real GDP growth rate adjusted for inflation projected between 6% to 6.5%. The fiscal deficit target is ambitiously set at 5.1% of GDP for FY25 and 4.5% for FY26, aiming to reduce borrowing costs for the private sector.

The government's expenditure is categorized into revenue and capital, with capital expenditure (capex) being more beneficial for economic growth. Despite setting a high capex target of Rs 10 lakh crore, the actual expenditure was Rs 9.5 lakh crore. Concerns were raised about reduced spending in key areas like health and education, as well as cuts in schemes for disadvantaged groups.

Income tax revenues are expected to be the largest contributor to government resources at 19%, followed by corporate tax and GST. The budget reflects a trend of fiscal consolidation and a focus on capital expenditure to stimulate economic growth. President Joe Biden's remarks on immigration and xenophobia were also noted, emphasizing the positive impact of immigrants on the US economy.</description>

The government's approach is encapsulated in the principles of "Reform, Perform, and Transform," aiming for robust economic growth and comprehensive development.</description>

			<title>RBI action against Paytm: probable causes, effects, and what happens to your money</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-paytm-causes-effects-9137548/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank, barring it from offering key services like account creation and wallets starting March, due to "persistent non-compliances and material supervisory concerns." Customers can still withdraw or use their existing balances without restrictions. Paytm, a leader in India's fintech space with over 100 million KYC-verified customers, has been under RBI scrutiny since 2018, particularly for KYC compliance and IT-related issues. The bank's parent company, One97 Communications, has been directed to terminate its nodal accounts by February 29, with all transactions to be settled by March 15. In response, Paytm's shares dropped, and the company is taking steps to comply with RBI's directions, expecting a potential impact of Rs 300-500 crore on its annual EBITDA. Paytm will continue its merchant services and expand partnerships with other banks, while its offline merchant payment network remains unaffected. The RBI's stringent actions follow previous fines and directives due to regulatory non-compliance, including a halt in onboarding new customers in March 2022. Concerns over data access by China-based entities, given the tense India-China relations, have also contributed to the scrutiny. Paytm's founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma holds a part-time chairman position at the bank.</description>

			<title>Biden says will respond to Jordan attack: Options US has, risks it must weigh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/biden-respond-jordan-attack-options-9137464/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the United States' potential response to a deadly drone attack in Jordan that killed three service members and wounded over 40. President Joe Biden has confirmed the US will retaliate but has not disclosed specifics, aiming to avoid a broader Middle East war. The attack has prompted calls for a strong response, with options ranging from direct strikes within Iran to targeting Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq and Syria. The US has previously conducted limited strikes against these militias and may consider a "tiered approach" involving multiple actions over time.

Officials believe Iran is responsible for supporting the militias behind the attacks on US forces. A direct strike on Iran is seen as a strong message but carries risks of escalation. Alternatives include targeting Iranian assets or leaders outside Iran, as was done in the 2020 drone strike that killed Quds Force leader Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

Congressional members are divided on the response, with some advocating for direct action against Iran and others urging restraint to avoid further conflict. Economic sanctions are also being considered as a non-military option to cut off funding to Iran and its proxies.

The article concludes with unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India's actions against Sujata R Karthikeyan, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>What is ‘Vyasji ka tehkhana’ inside the Gyanvapi mosque complex, where a Varanasi court has allowed puja</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/what-is-vyasji-ka-tehkhana-gyanvapi-mosque-9137431/</link>
			<description>The Varanasi District Court has permitted prayers in the southern cellar of the Gyanvapi mosque complex, known as 'Vyasji ka tehkhana'. The court directed the District Magistrate of Varanasi to make arrangements for worship within seven days. This decision follows the administration's takeover of the cellar on January 24, after a court order on January 17 appointed the district magistrate as the receiver.

The case was initiated by Shailendra Pathak Vyas, head priest of Acharya Ved Vyas Peeth temple. The tehkhana, facing the Nandi statue in the Kashi Vishwanath complex, has been a site of worship for the Vyas family for over 200 years, but was halted in December 1993. The prohibition of worship in the tehkhana was linked to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government's law and order policies following the Babri Mosque demolition.

The petitioner, Shailendra Pathak Vyas, is the maternal grandson of Pandit Somnath Vyas and currently serves as the head priest at the Acharya Ved Vyas Peeth. The tehkhana was historically provided to the Vyas family for worship and has been in their care since 1809. During a recent survey, idols of Hindu deities were found inside, supporting the family's historical claims to the site. The article also mentions an unrelated political issue regarding the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>How the post of deputy CM emerged, what powers it comes with</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/post-of-deputy-cm-history-powers-9137250/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political significance of the Deputy Chief Minister (Deputy CM) position in Indian states, particularly in the context of Bihar's recent government formation. Nitish Kumar, aligning again with the BJP, appointed two Deputy CMs, signaling political strategies ahead of national elections. The role of Deputy CMs is not constitutionally defined but is seen as equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. Currently, 13 states have Deputy CMs, with Andhra Pradesh having the most at five. The practice has become more common since the decline of Congress's dominance post-1967. Historical examples include Anugrah Narayan Sinha, the first Deputy CM of Bihar, and others who later became Chief Ministers themselves. The article also touches on the history of Deputy Prime Ministers in India, noting that the title does not confer the powers of a Prime Minister. Lastly, it mentions President Joe Biden's remarks on the positive impact of immigrants in the US and his criticism of xenophobia.</description>

			<description>The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has extended the deadline for property geo-tagging to **February 29, 2024**, offering a **10% refund** on advance tax payments for compliance. Geo-tagging, which assigns geographic coordinates to properties, is expected to enhance tax collection by identifying tax defaulters and unauthorized properties, thereby aiding urban planning and service delivery. Despite its potential benefits, residents have expressed concerns over technical difficulties, lack of awareness, and fear of government scrutiny. Other cities in India have also explored geo-tagging for various urban management purposes. Separately, the Election Commission has transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan, a bureaucrat and wife of a political leader, following allegations of misuse of office for electoral gains.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the upcoming interim Union Budget for India's financial year 2024-25, which will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

			<title>Test tube rhinos: Why rebuilding doomed species is a desperate race against time</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/test-tube-rhinos-why-rebuilding-doomed-species-is-a-desperate-race-against-time-9135853/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the efforts of scientists to rebuild the northern white rhino population through in vitro fertilization (IVF). They have achieved the first-ever rhino pregnancy by transferring a lab-made rhino embryo into a surrogate mother. The process of preparing a surrogate mother, particularly a southern white rhino, is complex and requires careful monitoring of the fertile window for implanting the embryo. However, even with successful IVF and surrogacy, the genetic viability of the northern white rhino population remains a challenge. One potential solution is to create sperm and eggs from stem cells extracted from preserved tissue samples. The article also highlights the importance of raising the first batch of IVF northern white calves with northern white adults to learn the social and behavioral skills of the species. The project is funded by the German government and other donors, but there have been questions raised about whether resources should be allocated to other endangered species. The article emphasizes the urgency of conservation efforts, as the northern white rhino was declared extinct in the wild in 2008.</description>

			<title>Explained: The 2021 murder case of Kerala BJP leader, in which 15 got death sentence</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/murder-case-kerala-bjp-leader-15-death-sentence-9135189/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the sentencing of 15 PFI-SDPI activists to death by an additional sessions court in Kerala for the murder of BJP leader Ranjith Sreenivasan. Ranjith, a 45-year-old advocate and BJP's OBC morcha state secretary, was an influential figure in the party and had contested the 2016 Assembly elections. He was also involved in welfare measures for coastal communities.

The background of the violence is rooted in the tensions between the Sangh Parivar and PFI in Alappuzha, which escalated in 2021 with several political killings. Ranjith's murder was a retaliation for the killing of an RSS worker, Nandu R Krishna, and was part of a series of tit-for-tat killings between the two groups.

The court's decision for the death sentence was based on the heinous nature of the crime, committed in the victim's home in front of his family, and the lack of potential for reform among the convicts, who showed no remorse and believed they were morally justified. The case is described as a "rarest of rare" due to the brutality and premeditation involved.

Additionally, the article mentions the ongoing trial for the murder of SDPI state general secretary K S Shan, with the accused RSS members currently on bail, and the appointment of a special prosecutor for the case. It also briefly touches on a separate issue involving the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/indian-stamp-act-1899-repeal-9134931/</link>
			<description>The Indian government is considering replacing the Indian Stamp Act of 1899 with a new bill to modernize the stamp duty system. The proposed 'Indian Stamp Bill, 2023' aims to address the current Act's shortcomings, such as the lack of provisions for digital e-stamping and uniform legislation across all states. The new bill introduces electronic stamps and digital signatures, aligning with the Information Technology Act, 2000. It also suggests increasing penalties for violations, with a maximum fine of Rs 25,000 and a daily penalty of Rs 1,000 for repeated offenses. The Ministry of Finance has invited public suggestions on the draft bill. Additionally, the article mentions the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misusing her public office for electoral gains.</description>

			<title>How – and why – the Archaeological Survey of India surveyed the Gyanvapi mosque</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/gyanvapi-mosque-kashi-vishwanath-asi-survey-9134755/</link>
			<description>The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has released an 839-page report following a physical survey of the Gyanvapi mosque, indicating the existence of a Hindu temple prior to the mosque at the site. The ASI was directed by the Varanasi district court to investigate if the mosque was built over a Hindu temple. The survey involved non-invasive techniques like Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), documentation, and photography, avoiding excavation due to the site's sensitivity. A 50-member team led by Alok Tripathi conducted the three-month survey, which did not include areas sealed by the Supreme Court. Hindu petitioners have approached the Supreme Court to allow the ASI to investigate an object found in the mosque's water tank, claimed to be a Shivling by Hindus and a fountain by Muslims. The ASI's report is said to be based on scientific techniques and is ready for judicial scrutiny, while the All India Muslim Personal Law Board disputes its conclusiveness.</description>

			<title>Why Meghalaya’s new state anthem has led to a controversy over the state’s Jaintia tribe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/meghalaya-new-state-anthem-controversy-jaintia-9134637/</link>
			<description>Meghalaya marked its 52nd statehood day by releasing an official state anthem, which was not performed on Republic Day due to the absence of a Standard Operating Procedure. Controversy arose because the anthem, featuring Khasi, Garo, and English, excluded the Jaintia language. Jaintia groups demand the inclusion of Pnar, emphasizing their distinct identity and history, including their own freedom fighters like U Kiang Nangbah. The government's selection of languages for the anthem is based on the Meghalaya State Language Act of 2005, which recognizes English and Khasi as official languages, with Garo as an associate language in certain districts. The government argues that including Jaintia would require changes to the act and could lead to further demands from other tribes. Some emphasize the commonalities among the Khasi and Jaintia, citing shared myths and ancestry, suggesting a cohesive community. The debate highlights the complexities of cultural representation and language in the state's identity.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-cipher-case-imran-khan-9134481/</link>
			<description>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and ex-Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi were sentenced to 10 years in jail for the cipher case involving the disclosure of a classified cable sent by Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington. The cable, which remains largely undisclosed, reportedly contained a US official's remarks on Imran's visit to Russia during the Ukraine invasion, hinting at potential consequences if a no-confidence vote against him succeeded. Imran has claimed the cable as evidence of a US conspiracy to oust him, which he first discussed publicly in March 2022. Following his ouster, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) government accused him of exposing an official secret, leading to an FIR and his conviction in another case. He remains imprisoned and is barred from the upcoming elections.</description>

			<title>Why hybrid vehicles could be a cleaner solution for India than EVs, at least for the next 7-10 years</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/hybrid-vehicles-cleaner-evs-india-automobiles-9134306/</link>
			<description>HSBC Research suggests that India should focus on hybrid vehicles as a practical solution for the next 5-10 years to aid in decarbonisation and reduce pollution. Hybrids, which combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, are currently less polluting than electric vehicles (EVs) and petrol/diesel cars. The report highlights that hybrids emit 133 g/km of carbon, which is 16% less than EVs at 158 g/km, and significantly lower than petrol and diesel vehicles.

The transition to EVs is supported by tax incentives, but the adoption faces challenges such as the need for state subsidies, charging infrastructure, and the current reliance on coal-fired power plants for electricity. The analysis indicates that emissions from hybrids and EVs will equalize when non-fossil power generation in India reaches 44%. By 2030, even with a 40% non-fossil fuel share, hybrids will still be 8% less polluting than EVs.

The article also discusses the global lithium value chain and India's dependence on imports for EV battery production, suggesting the exploration of alternatives to Li-ion batteries. The summary omits unrelated content and advertisements.</description>

			<title>What happened at the trial of Nathuram Godse, the man who killed Gandhi?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/nathuram-godse-trial-gandhi-death-9134078/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed account of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948, and the subsequent trial. Godse shot Gandhi at point-blank range at Birla House in Delhi, leading to Gandhi's death within minutes. Godse was immediately apprehended and later tried at a special court in Delhi's Red Fort. The trial began in May 1948, with Godse and his co-accused, including Narayan Apte and Vinayak Savarkar, being represented by counsel of their choice.

The prosecution presented a substantial amount of evidence, including 149 witnesses and numerous exhibits. The most significant witness was Digambar Badge, who was part of the conspiracy and later turned approver. The judgment, delivered on February 10, 1949, by Judge Atma Charan, convicted Godse, Apte, and others, sentencing Godse and Apte to death while acquitting Savarkar.

The convicts appealed to the Punjab High Court, where Godse, representing himself, maintained his stance as a patriot and did not express remorse. The High Court upheld the lower court's verdict on June 21, 1949, except for acquitting two of the accused. Attempts to appeal to the Privy Council were unsuccessful, and Godse and Apte were hanged on November 15, 1949, after their mercy petitions were rejected. The article was first published in 2023.</description>

			<title>How to grow seafood outside the sea — and why a Govt lab in Kochi has taken up this project</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-to-grow-seafood-outside-the-sea-and-why-a-govt-lab-in-kochi-has-taken-up-this-project-9133764/</link>
			<description>The ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in Kochi has partnered with Neat Meatt Biotech to develop lab-grown fish meat. This collaboration, underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding, is a pioneering initiative in India. Lab-grown fish meat involves cultivating specific fish cells in a lab to produce meat that mimics the taste, texture, and nutrition of conventional fish meat without harming any animals.

CMFRI will focus on genetic, biochemical, and analytical aspects, starting with high-value species like pomfret and kingfish. Neat Meatt will optimize cell growth media and scale up production. This effort aims to meet the rising seafood demand and alleviate overfishing, offering a sustainable, contamination-free alternative.

Globally, countries like Israel, Singapore, the US, and China are advancing in lab-grown fish meat technology. The industry is growing, with over 150 companies backed by significant investments. The US has even approved the sale of lab-grown chicken meat. This project positions India alongside these nations, aiming for a sustainable seafood future. The proof of concept is expected soon, and the initiative also aligns with global efforts to produce various lab-grown meats, promoting food security and environmental benefits.</description>

			<title>The river-linking project Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Centre have signed MoU for, who it helps</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-river-linking-project-rajasthan-mp-centre-have-signed-mou-for-who-it-helps-9133446/</link>
			<description>Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have signed an MoU with the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti to implement the Modified PKC-ERCP Link Project, integrating the PKC river link with the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP). This project is part of India's national plan for interlinking rivers. The ERCP, significant in Rajasthan, aims to transfer water within the Chambal basin to address water scarcity in 13 districts. The Modified PKC-ERCP will provide drinking and industrial water to these districts and the Malwa and Chambal regions of Madhya Pradesh, as well as irrigation over an area of 5.6 lakh hectares or more across both states.

The MoU was necessary because the original ERCP was planned based on a 50% dependable yield, contrary to the standard 75% dependable yield required for inter-state river projects. This was unacceptable to Madhya Pradesh. After deliberations, a modified proposal was created to align with the 75% dependability, incorporating components from both states' suggestions. The integration of the ERCP with the PKC Link Canal Project was decided by the Task Force on Interlinking of Rivers in 2019 and approved in December 2022. The project's DPR is being prepared, and upon its completion, a MoA will be finalized to cover various aspects of water management and sharing between the states and the Centre.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/countries-pause-funding-unrwa-9133389/</link>
			<description>UN officials have called for a reconsideration of the suspension of funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), following allegations of staff involvement in a Hamas attack on Israel. The agency, which provides essential services to two million Palestinians in Gaza, faces a reduction in services if funding is not reinstated. The US and other Western countries withheld funds after Israel's accusations, which included claims of Hamas misusing UNRWA resources and promoting anti-Israel sentiments. UNRWA has denied these allegations, confirming the termination of nine staff members implicated in the attack and clarifying the status of others. The agency is vital for the survival of Gaza's population, especially after recent conflicts, and risks running out of funds for aid work without restored financial support. The article also mentions President Biden's remarks on the positive impact of immigrants in the US, contrasting it with the anti-immigrant rhetoric of his predecessor.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/aaya-ram-gaya-ram-defection-meaning-history-9133319/</link>
			<description>Nitish Kumar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar for the ninth time after his party, Janata Dal (United), formed an alliance with the BJP. This move ended their previous alliance with the Mahagathbandan, which included the Congress and RLD. The term "Aaya Ram, gaya Ram" was used to describe politicians who frequently switch allegiances, originating from the actions of Haryana politician Gaya Lal in the 1960s. After winning an election as an Independent, he joined Congress, then defected to form a new party, and switched sides multiple times within hours. This term has since become synonymous with political defection, which became more prevalent as Congress's dominance declined, highlighting the importance of smaller parties and independents in forming governments. The article also mentions political defections in the 1960s and a recent order by the Election Commission of India regarding the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Why UGC’s draft guidelines sparked outrage over ‘dereservation’ in faculty recruitment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-ugcs-draft-guidelines-sparked-outrage-over-dereservation-in-faculty-recruitment-9133224/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy over the University Grants Commission (UGC)'s new draft guidelines on reservation implementation in higher education. The UGC and the Union government clarified that reserved faculty positions for SC, ST, OBC, and EWS will not be opened to the general category, countering a public outcry over a chapter in the draft that suggested reserved posts could be dereserved in exceptional cases. The draft aimed to update guidelines from 2006, reflecting changes in government instructions and court orders to clarify reservation rules. It covered quotas in faculty posts, reservation rosters, de-reservation, caste claim verification, and student admissions.

The controversy centered on the de-reservation chapter, which allowed for dereservation of reserved faculty vacancies in exceptional circumstances, a departure from current practice where reserved positions are not converted for general candidates. The draft extended dereservation to Group A, B, C, and D posts, whereas the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) only permits it for Group A in exceptional cases.

The government responded to the backlash by stating no new instructions permit dereservation, and reserved posts must be filled as per the 2019 Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act. The UGC chairman confirmed that dereservation will not be included in the final guidelines. The article also mentions a separate issue regarding the Election Commission of India's transfer of an individual due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>What is the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, which has claimed responsibility for killing 3 US soldiers in Jordan?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-troops-killed-jordan-attack-islamic-resistance-iraq-9132968/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a drone attack on a US military outpost in Jordan, which resulted in the death of three US servicemen. President Joe Biden attributed the attack to Iran-backed militant groups and vowed to hold those responsible accountable. The Islamic Resistance of Iraq (IRI) claimed responsibility for the attack, which targeted Tower 22, housing around 350 US Army and Air Force personnel. The article also touches on the broader context of the Syrian Civil War, the rise of ISIS, and the involvement of various countries in the Middle East conflict.

The IRI is described as part of the 'Axis of Resistance,' a collection of groups supported by Iran against Western interests. The Washington Institute's analysis indicates that the IRI encompasses all Iran-backed militias in Iraq, including those involved in recent conflicts with Israel and Hamas. The article reports on the extensive attacks by such militias on US military installations in Iraq and Syria, as well as the targeting of commercial shipping routes by the Houthis, prompting military responses from the US and the UK.

The piece concludes with concerns raised by US Republican politicians about the Biden administration's handling of the situation, with some calling for strong military retaliation against Iran. There are fears that the escalating conflict could lead to a full-scale war, considering the complex regional dynamics and the presence of influential non-state actors. The article also briefly mentions an unrelated domestic political issue in India. Overall, the situation underscores the volatile nature of Middle Eastern geopolitics and the potential for further escalation.</description>

			<title>Why the subsidy bill for Modi govt’s second term is much higher than the first</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/subsidies-under-modi-2-0-lok-sabha-elections-9132095/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the shift in the Narendra Modi government's approach to welfare and subsidies between its first term (Modi 1.0) and second term (Modi 2.0). During Modi 1.0, the government launched various schemes for universal access to essential services while reducing the subsidy bill, despite increased public funding for these services. This was possible due to lower international oil and fertilizer prices, allowing the government to raise excise duties and limit fuel subsidies to LPG cylinders for low-income households.

In contrast, Modi 2.0 has seen a significant increase in subsidies and transfers, with major subsidies jumping from 1% of GDP in 2018-19 to 3.6% in 2020-21. This increase is attributed to a policy decision to fully fund food and fertilizer subsidies and the economic impact of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, which led to increased public distribution system (PDS) offtake and MNREGA spending. Additionally, international fertilizer prices soared, doubling the fertilizer subsidy between 2020-21 and 2022-23.

Looking ahead, the article suggests that any rationalization of subsidies, such as targeted direct benefit transfers (DBT), may be postponed until the next government. The interim budget for 2024-25 is not expected to alter current prices, although there could be an increase in the PM-Kisan scheme's annual transfer ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. The article concludes with various unrelated topics, indicating a shift to other news items.</description>

			<title>Why Nitish Kumar’s exit undermines Opposition’s 2024 caste pitch, sharpens anti-Congress plank</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/nitish-kumar-exit-undermines-opps-2024-caste-pitch-sharpens-anti-congress-plank-9132074/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political implications of Nitish Kumar's return to the NDA alliance, particularly in the context of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. It highlights how this move has strategic significance for the BJP, as Nitish was previously an architect of the Opposition's social justice strategy against the BJP. His switch to the NDA is seen as a challenge to the Opposition's efforts to counter the BJP's Hindutva narrative with a social justice approach, a tactic used since the early 1990s.

The article also touches on the broader ideological battle between secular and communal visions in India, questioning the relevance of this dichotomy if leaders like Nitish can easily switch sides. It notes the disarray within the Opposition, with various parties announcing plans to contest elections independently, thereby weakening the united front against the BJP.

Furthermore, the piece reflects on the internal dynamics of the JD(U) and the BJP, suggesting that Nitish's presence in the NDA adds symbolic weight and could influence voter sentiment, especially in light of the Ram temple inauguration. The BJP views Nitish's inclusion as a strategic advantage that could simplify their electoral battle in Bihar and allow them to focus on other regions.

Lastly, the article provides background information on the author, Vikas Pathak, detailing his experience in journalism and academia, and mentions a separate incident involving the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office. This latter point seems unrelated to the main political narrative of the article.</description>

			<title>Nitish sworn in as CM for 9th time: Seven things to know about the Bihar leader</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/seven-things-to-know-about-nitish-kumar-9131822/</link>
			<description>Nitish Kumar, the JD(U) leader, has been sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar for the ninth time, marking his fifth alliance change in over a decade. Here are key points from his political journey:
- **Early Political Career**: Nitish began his political career during the JP Movement and later formed the Samata Party with George Fernandes in 1994. He first allied with the BJP in 1996 and briefly became Bihar's CM in 2000.
- **Resignation as Railway Minister**: He resigned as Railway Minister in 1999 following a train collision in West Bengal, later praised for introducing reforms like internet ticket booking and the tatkal system.
- **Departure from NDA**: Nitish left the NDA before the 2014 elections due to Narendra Modi being named the PM candidate, citing the need for a "clean and secular image" for the alliance's leader.
- **JD(U)'s Performance and Resignation**: Post the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish resigned as CM after JD(U)'s seat count dropped from 20 to 2. He returned as CM after his successor, Jitan Ram Manjhi, was expelled from the party.
- **Personal Life**: Nitish's son, Nishant Kumar, is an engineer who stays out of politics and is financially wealthier than his father.
- **Political Appeal**: Despite his history of changing alliances, Nitish is sought after for his governance record and appeal among certain voter demographics in Bihar.
- **Tenure Comparison**: Nitish has had multiple terms as CM but has served for a shorter duration compared to other long-serving CMs like Pawan Kumar Chamling, Naveen Patnaik, and Jyoti Basu.

The article also mentions the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan, related to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office. The BJP has accused her of using the Mission Shakti scheme to influence voters. However, this part seems unrelated to the main content about Nitish Kumar.</description>

			<title>Why soup was thrown at the Mona Lisa and how it relates to the ongoing farmers’ protests in France</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/soup-mona-lisa-farmers-protests-france-9131777/</link>
			<description>In Paris, two activists targeted the 'Mona Lisa' at the Louvre Museum to protest agricultural and environmental issues in France. The act, which involved throwing soup at the painting, was part of a broader movement involving groups like Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, advocating for sustainable food security and climate change awareness. French farmers have been protesting for better compensation, reduced bureaucracy, and protection from imports, partly by blocking roads with tractors. These protests are a response to government policies, including increased taxes on agricultural diesel and EU trade negotiations perceived as unfair. The French government has proposed easing some regulations and ending diesel fuel taxes for farm vehicles. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal acknowledged the farmers' plight and is considering measures against unfair competition from imports. The protests in France are part of a wider pattern of farmer demonstrations across Europe, sharing concerns over environmental taxes and fuel issues.</description>

			<title>Around 28% of Americans have no religious affiliation: What their reasons are, who this group is</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/americans-religious-affiliation-data-atheism-pew-9131654/</link>
			<description>The Pew Research Center's survey highlights a significant shift in American religious identity, with **28%** of U.S. adults now identifying as religious "nones"—those who describe themselves as atheists, agnostics, or "nothing in particular." This marks a considerable increase from the early 1990s when about **90%** identified as Christians.

The report, titled ‘Religious ‘Nones’ in America: Who They Are and What They Believe’, provides insights into the beliefs and demographics of this group. It reveals that **17%** of nones are atheists, **20%** are agnostics, and the majority, **63%**, believe in "nothing in particular." Notably, **19%** of nones are strict nonbelievers, while about half consider spirituality significant or view themselves as spiritual.

Regarding their stance on religion, **43%** of nones believe religion does more harm than good, while **14%** see it as more beneficial. The main reasons for their disaffiliation include skepticism of religious teachings, aversion to religious organizations, and a perceived lack of necessity for religion in their lives.

In terms of education, race, and gender, atheists and agnostics tend to be more educated than religious Americans, while those who believe in "nothing in particular" are generally less educated. The racial composition of nones mirrors that of religious Americans, and while nones are predominantly under 50, they are almost evenly split between men and women, with a higher proportion of men among atheists and agnostics.

The survey also found that nones are less civically and politically engaged than their religious counterparts, particularly those who identify with "nothing in particular." Scholars suggest that the rise in individualism due to industrialization and globalization may contribute to these trends, along with a growing distrust in organized religion, even as some maintain spiritual beliefs.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code to be passed in February: How did it come about and what can be expected?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/uttarakhand-uniform-civil-code-bill-9131222/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the upcoming passage of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill by the Uttarakhand Assembly on February 5. The UCC, a key BJP campaign promise from the 2014 general elections, aims to establish a uniform set of personal laws for all citizens, irrespective of religion, covering marriage, inheritance, divorce, and adoption, as per Article 44 of the Indian Constitution.

A five-member committee led by former Supreme Court Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai is set to submit its report before the assembly session. The UCC has faced opposition from parties like Congress and AIMIM, citing concerns over communal harmony and societal polarization.

Despite delays, the committee has incorporated over 2.5 lakh public suggestions and held 38 public meetings. The UCC intends to ensure gender equality, particularly in inheritance laws, and will address practices like polygamy and iddat, with strong input from Muslim women. It will maintain the current legal marriage age and introduce regulations for live-in relationships.

The enactment of the UCC in Uttarakhand may influence similar legislation in Gujarat and Assam. Goa remains the first state to implement the UCC. Additionally, the article mentions the Election Commission's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office for electoral gains. The summary omits unrelated content such as advertisements.</description>

			<title>As Maharashtra CM assures quota to Marathas, why OBCs are planning to take to streets and courts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/obcs-fear-shrinking-of-quota-pie-ready-to-take-battle-to-street-court-9130797/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing conflict over reservation policies in Maharashtra, India. The Maratha community is awaiting the finalization of rules for Maratha reservation, while the Other Backward Class (OBC) community fears that their 27% reservation share may be reduced. The proposed policy would allow Marathas to claim reservation within the OBC quota without exceeding the 50% total reservation limit set by the Supreme Court.

The issue is contentious because many Marathas in certain regions do not have Kunbi certificates, which grant OBC status, and therefore cannot claim OBC reservation. The state government has called for suggestions and objections to the policy until February 16, and it will take at least another fortnight before the rules are notified.

Chief Minister Eknath Shinde claims to have fulfilled his promise of Maratha reservations, while Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has clarified that the process for obtaining Kunbi certificates has been simplified, but not extended to those without existing records.

Senior OBC leaders and activists, including NCP Minister Chhagan Bhujbal, are planning to challenge the government's decision in court. The OBC community is not opposed to separate Maratha reservation but is against sharing their reserved quota.

The article also recounts the history of the reservation policy, noting that the SEBC Act, which granted Marathas a 16% reservation, was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2021. The current total reservation stands at 52%, and the political implications of the OBC unrest are expected to influence the upcoming general elections.

The opposition accuses the government of deceiving both Marathas and OBCs by not fulfilling promises related to Kunbi certificates and OBC quota. The article concludes with the anticipation of legal challenges and the potential impact on the general elections. The unrelated content and advertisements have been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Death by nitrogen: Why this Alabama execution is polarising</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/death-by-nitrogen-why-this-alabama-execution-is-polarising-9130539/</link>
			<description>Kenneth Smith, an Alabama inmate, was executed using nitrogen hypoxia on January 25, marking the first use of this method in the United States. The execution method, which involves breathing pure nitrogen, has been touted as effective and humane by proponents like State Attorney General Steve Marshall. However, it has faced criticism for being cruel and inhumane. The execution process took approximately 22 minutes, during which Smith displayed signs of distress, leading to a public outcry. Despite this, state representatives maintained that the execution proceeded as expected.

Smith's lawyers argued that the method was experimental and could violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment, but their attempts to halt the execution were unsuccessful. The U.S. Supreme Court, with dissenting opinions, allowed the execution to proceed. The debate over the death penalty in the U.S. continues, with arguments about its retributive justice and deterrent effects, although research suggests it has no deterrent value. The controversy extends to the methods of execution, with lethal injection facing its own set of challenges. Currently, capital punishment is legal in 27 states, with executions paused in 7 and at the federal level, while still retained by the U.S. military. The article also briefly mentions political developments unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Inclusion of ‘sage-soyare’ makes Maratha activist Jarange-Patil call off quota protest: What this means, what its impact will be</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/sage-soyare-makes-maratha-activist-jarange-patil-call-off-quota-protest-what-does-this-mean-what-will-be-its-impact-9130273/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the withdrawal of Manoj Jarange-Patil's protest following the Maharashtra government's inclusion of the term 'sage-soyare' in a draft notification. This term refers to relatives from the family tree and its inclusion is expected to simplify the process for Marathas to obtain Kunbi (OBC) certificates. Previously, the caste of a child was determined solely through the paternal line, but with this change, affinal relations and maternal lineage will also be considered for issuing Kunbi certificates. This is particularly significant for Maratha families in Marathwada, where obtaining historical Kunbi records has been challenging. The government's move is seen as a response to difficulties faced by these families and is subject to public suggestions and objections until February 16. A legal battle over the interpretation of the draft is anticipated. Additionally, the article mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Explained: The ICJ ruling on the genocide case against Israel for its actions in Gaza</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/icj-israel-genocide-emergency-measures-southa-africa-9130178/</link>
			<description>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that Israel must take all necessary measures to prevent genocide in Gaza, although it did not order a ceasefire. The court confirmed its jurisdiction over the case brought by South Africa, which accuses Israel of committing genocide. The ICJ has ordered six provisional measures and acknowledged a prima facie dispute between the parties regarding the Genocide Convention. The court highlighted Israel's military operations in Gaza, causing significant civilian casualties and displacement, and expressed deep concern over the humanitarian crisis. Despite calls for a ceasefire, legal experts anticipated that the court would not mandate such an action, as it could compromise Israel's self-defense. The ICJ's rulings are binding but not enforceable; however, they influence international bodies. The final decision on whether Israel is committing genocide may take years. Separately, the Election Commission of India has transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of election influence.</description>

			<title>Why European Union is shifting from being the global tech regulator to AI innovation advocate</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/european-union-shifting-global-tech-regulator-ai-innovation-advocate-9129957/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the European Commission's and India's efforts to foster AI innovation. The EU has set rules for startups to access supercomputers for AI development, following the EU AI Act aimed at trustworthy AI. India plans a similar approach, considering a public-private partnership to build high-capacity data centers for startups. The Indian government is also outlining an AI Mission with a significant budget to develop 'sovereign AI' and offer compute-as-a-service. The goal is to build 10,000 to 30,000 GPUs under the PPP model and 1,000-2,000 GPUs through C-DAC. Various incentives are being explored to encourage private computing centers, aiming to create a digital public infrastructure for startups to use at lower costs. The article contrasts this with the US, where companies like OpenAI and Google lead AI innovation without needing government-offered hardware services. The EU's AI Act, which includes safeguards and restrictions on AI use, has faced criticism, but it sets clear rules for law enforcement and consumer rights, with strong penalties for violations. Real-time biometric surveillance by governments is restricted to serious threats like terrorist attacks. The article also mentions a political issue in India, where an official was transferred due to alleged misuse of public office during elections.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/from-2021-civil-suit-to-2024-asi-survey-report-a-timeline-9129722/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal dispute over the Gyanvapi mosque, which intensified in 2022 when five Hindu women sought permission to worship at the site, claiming it was built over a Hindu temple. Key developments include:
- **August**: Filing of a civil suit by the women and the mosque committee's challenge based on the 1991 Places of Worship Act.
- **May 16**: Completion of a videographic survey revealing a contested structure within the mosque.
- **May 20**: The Supreme Court's transfer of the case to a district judge.
- **September to November**: Various legal challenges and orders, including the dismissal of pleas by the mosque committee and the rejection of requests for a scientific survey of the contested structure.
- **May to August**: Orders for a scientific survey and an ASI excavation, with subsequent legal challenges and an interim stay by the Supreme Court.
- **December 11 to January 25**: The ASI survey's completion and the court's review of the ASI report.

The article also mentions an unrelated issue regarding the Election Commission of India's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>The temple that Aurangzeb razed: Evidence from history on Gyanvapi and Kashi Vishwanath</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/the-temple-that-aurangzeb-razed-evidence-from-history-9129714/</link>
			<description>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has found evidence suggesting that a large Hindu temple existed before the Gyanvapi mosque at Varanasi. This conclusion is based on scientific studies and corroborated by historical texts. The temple is believed to have been destroyed by orders from Emperor Aurangzeb, who aimed to promote Islam and suppress other religions. Aurangzeb's policies marked a shift from Akbar's more inclusive approach, imposing higher taxes on Hindu traders and abolishing them for Muslims. The destruction of temples, including the Vishwanath temple in Kashi and the Keshavdev temple in Mathura, was part of a broader strategy to eliminate centers of non-Islamic teaching and ideas considered subversive by orthodox elements. Some historians suggest that the destruction was also a punitive measure against those who supported Aurangzeb's rival, Shivaji. The current Kashi Vishwanath temple was constructed adjacent to the mosque site in the 18th century by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar. The mosque's patron is unknown, and it does not appear in Mughal records. The article also discusses the incorporation of parts of the destroyed temple into the mosque's structure, possibly as a statement of Mughal authority.</description>

			<title>ASI opinion on Gyanvapi mosque: How the court is likely to view the report</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/asi-opinion-on-kashi-mosque-legal-questions-9129720/</link>
			<description>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) submitted a report to the Varanasi district court, which was later shared with both Hindu and Muslim litigants, confirming that the Gyanvapi mosque was built over a pre-existing temple. The report's significance lies in its potential as expert evidence in the ongoing litigation over the Kashi Vishwanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque complex. The courts will need to decide if the ASI report is conclusive and what the existence of a Hindu temple means for the religious character of the mosque as of August 15, 1947.

The ASI's findings, like those in the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi case, can be interpreted differently by the parties involved. The Supreme Court, in its 2019 decision, stated that title cannot be based solely on archaeological findings and must adhere to legal principles and evidentiary standards.

The maintainability of such a suit is contingent on the Places of Worship Act, 1991, which preserves the religious character of places of worship as of Independence Day 1947, with the exception of the disputed structure in Ayodhya. The Gyanvapi district court has upheld the maintainability, and the Supreme Court has made oral observations that the act of finding the religious nature of a place is not barred by the Act.

A constitutional challenge to the 1991 Act remains pending, and its fate could significantly affect the relevance of the ASI report. The Supreme Court has previously indicated that the 1991 law is a basic feature of the Constitution, emphasizing the State's obligation to uphold secularism and equality of all religions. The Act is seen as a legislative measure to protect secular values and prevent retrogression.

Lastly, the article mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to allegations of misuse of public office, which is unrelated to the main content of the article.</description>

			<title>Judge vs judge: How a spat between two Calcutta HC judges reached the Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/calcutta-high-court-judges-spat-supreme-court-9129507/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India intervened in a case of alleged irregularities in MBBS admissions in West Bengal, staying all proceedings at the Calcutta High Court after contradictory orders were issued by different benches. A special sitting was held due to serious allegations made by Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay against Justice Soumen Sen, accusing him of misconduct and acting under political influence. The matter is set to be taken up by the Supreme Court on the following Monday.

Justice Gangopadhyay had initially ordered a CBI inquiry into the case, citing a 'large picture of corruption' and the state's failure to arrest an individual after an assault on ED officials. Despite not being requested by the petitioner, he deemed a thorough investigation necessary. However, a Division Bench stayed this order, emphasizing the state's right to a fair investigation and questioning the need to involve the CBI without a specific plea.

The situation escalated when Justice Gangopadhyay defied the Division Bench's stay order, proceeding with the handover of documents to the CBI. The Division Bench responded by declaring his actions void and extending the stay on the CBI inquiry.

In a dramatic turn, Justice Gangopadhyay accused Justice Sen of misconduct, alleging that he was acting for a political party and had influenced another judge to dismiss cases involving a political figure. He called for the Supreme Court to reexamine the orders involving the state and questioned Justice Sen's continued presence at the Calcutta High Court despite a recommended transfer.

The article also mentions the Election Commission of India's transfer of an official due to allegations of misuse of public office and political involvement in elections. The BJP has accused the official of using a government scheme to influence voters on behalf of the BJD. This part of the article seems unrelated to the main legal controversy but highlights ongoing political disputes in the region.</description>

			<title>What are incestuous ‘sapinda’ marriages, and why has Delhi High Court reaffirmed the ban on them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/incestuous-sapinda-marriages-9129281/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 5(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which prohibits sapinda marriages among Hindus unless permitted by custom. Sapinda relationships are defined as being within a certain degree of lineage, with the prohibition extending up to three generations on the mother's side and five on the father's side. The court dismissed a petition challenging this section, stating that unregulated partner choice in marriage could legitimize incestuous relationships. The petitioner's marriage had been declared void due to being a sapinda marriage without established custom. The court found no merit in her argument that the prohibition violates the right to equality, as she failed to provide stringent proof of an established custom allowing sapinda marriages. The court also noted that partner choice can be regulated and that the prohibition does not violate the right to equality.

The article also compares the legal stance on incestuous relationships in several European countries and the United States, noting that some have less stringent laws compared to India. For instance, France abolished the crime of incest for consenting adults, Belgium and Portugal do not criminalize incest, and in the US, incestuous marriages are banned but relationships are allowed in some states. The article concludes with an unrelated note about the Election Commission of India ordering the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>ASI report says temple existed at the site of Gyanvapi mosque: 5 key takeaways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/asi-report-temple-gyanvapi-mosque-9129224/</link>
			<description>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has concluded in its report that a Hindu temple existed before the Gyanvapi mosque was constructed. The key findings from the ASI report include:

- An inscription on a loose stone indicates the mosque was built during Emperor Aurangzeb's reign, with repairs noted in 1792-93. Recent surveys show parts of the inscription have been scratched out.
- Historical records suggest Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of non-Islamic religious structures, including the Vishwanath temple at Kashi.
- The survey documented 34 inscriptions from reused stones of the original Hindu temples, in various scripts, indicating the prior structures were dismantled and repurposed.
- Names of Hindu deities and terms of significance were found in the inscriptions, suggesting the religious importance of the pre-existing structure.
- Pillars and pilasters examined during the survey were identified as parts of the original temple, with some figures mutilated for reuse in the mosque.
- The original temple had a central chamber and additional chambers on all sides, which now form part of the mosque's main hall. Decorative elements from the temple were altered or destroyed to fit the mosque's design.
- The main entrance to the central chamber, adorned with animal and bird carvings, is now blocked, and sculptural remains were found in cellars made from reused temple pillars.

The report provides evidence of the mosque's construction over a pre-existing Hindu temple, with architectural and inscriptional remnants supporting this conclusion. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India's actions has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>ASI hands over Gyanvapi mosque report, says ‘prior Hindu temple existed’: Tracing the RSS view on the dispute</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/asi-gyanvapi-mosque-report-hindu-temple-rss-9129015/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal dispute over the Gyanvapi mosque complex. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) reported finding evidence of a Hindu temple predating the mosque at the site. This is significant in the context of claims that the mosque was built over the destroyed Kashi Vishwanath temple. The report has historical and political implications, reflecting the longstanding tensions and religious claims over the site. The RSS, a Hindu nationalist organization, has been involved in similar disputes since 1959, focusing on the "return" of Hindu temples. The article traces the evolution of this dispute, highlighting key moments and shifts in focus, particularly the RSS's stance on Ayodhya, Mathura, and Kashi. It also touches on internal Hindu societal issues and the broader political landscape, including the BJP's position and the RSS's current views on the need for further temple-mosque disputes. The article concludes with an updated explainer on the history of the dispute and the author's credentials as an investigative journalist. President Joe Biden's comments on immigration and xenophobia are unrelated to the main topic and are not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>FPI disclosure norms deadline extended: Why is SEBI seeking investor data?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/fpi-disclosure-norms-sebi-investors-9128649/</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has extended the deadline by seven months for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to comply with additional disclosure requirements. These disclosures are aimed at entities holding significant portions of their equity Assets Under Management (AUM) in a single corporate group or with substantial holdings in the Indian equity market. The move is to prevent misuse of the FPI route for round-tripping by promoters and to ensure transparency in substantial acquisitions and public shareholding. FPIs not meeting the initial deadline will have additional time to provide details or reduce their holdings. Certain categories of FPIs, like sovereign wealth funds and regulated public funds with diversified holdings, are exempt from these enhanced disclosures. The measures follow concerns over potential market disruptions and are part of broader regulatory efforts to monitor high-risk financial activities and foreign investments, especially in the wake of policy changes during the Covid-19 pandemic to prevent opportunistic takeovers of Indian companies. Additionally, there's a mention of a political figure's transfer due to alleged misuse of public office, unrelated to the main financial regulations topic.</description>

			<title>Why was January 26 chosen to be India’s Republic Day?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/january-26-india-republic-day-history-reason-date-9128464/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of January 26 in India's history, marking the day the Constitution came into effect and the country's transformation into a republic. It traces back to January 26, 1930, when the "Poorna Swaraj" declaration was made, demanding complete independence from British rule. The date was chosen for Republic Day to honor this declaration and the subsequent struggle for freedom. The 1920s saw significant developments, including the rise of influential leaders and the Simon Commission's appointment, which led to widespread protests. The Nehru Report's call for dominion status was met with mixed reactions within the Indian National Congress, with some leaders demanding complete severance from the British Empire. The turning point came when the British reneged on the promise of dominion status, leading to a united front for a fully independent republic. The article concludes by explaining why January 26 was chosen for the Constitution's enactment, reflecting the spirit of the "Poorna Swaraj" resolution and India's journey to self-rule. The piece also mentions President Joe Biden's views on immigration and xenophobia, highlighting his support for immigrants' contributions to the US.

			<title>From Ram to Akbar to Gandhi: Artwork on the Constitution, who painted them</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/illustrations-constitution-who-painted-9127795/</link>
			<description>The Indian Constitution is renowned for being the world's longest written constitution, distinguished not only by its comprehensive text but also by its artistic illustrations. Each of the 22 parts features hand-painted images reflecting various historical periods of India, from the ancient Indus Valley civilization to the modern freedom struggle, including depictions from epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

The illustrations were crafted under the direction of Nandalal Bose at Santiniketan, while the Constitution itself was handwritten by Prem Behari Narain Raizada. The artwork captures India's rich geographical diversity and historical narrative, though it does not directly correlate with the constitutional text.

Nandalal Bose, a prominent figure in the nationalist movement and an associate of Mahatma Gandhi, led a team of artists, including his students and relatives, in this monumental task. The artists received modest compensation for their work, and the calligrapher Raizada requested only to have his name inscribed on each page as his remuneration.

The Constitution's images serve as a visual journey through India's history, religion, and culture, featuring significant figures like Mahavir, Buddha, Emperor Ashoka, and Rani Lakshmibai, among others. The artwork also pays tribute to India's freedom struggle, with scenes depicting leaders like Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose.

Art historian R Siva Kumar and DAG CEO Ashish Anand emphasize that the illustrations, while not directly linked to the Constitution's content, offer a vision of India's history and are expected to endure for centuries, reflecting the spirit of the nation.</description>

			<title>Emmanuel Macron is Republic Day chief guest: The bright arc of India-France ties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/macron-is-republic-day-chief-guest-the-bright-arc-of-india-france-ties-9128134/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the enduring partnership between India and France, highlighting the 25th anniversary of their strategic partnership and the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron as the Chief Guest for India's Republic Day celebrations in 2024. It reflects on the historical ties, with former French President Jacques Chirac's visits and support for India during critical moments, such as India's nuclear tests in 1998.

The strategic partnership is underscored by cooperation in defense, space, and civil nuclear matters, with significant advancements like the procurement of Rafale jets and collaboration between ISRO and CNES. Economic ties are also strong, with substantial French investment in India and bilateral trade. The digital collaboration includes the launch of UPI in France and the development of supercomputers.

Education and community engagement are other pillars, with initiatives to increase the number of Indian students in France and recognition of mutual degrees. Tourism between the two nations is robust, and France supports India's international aspirations, including a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

The article concludes by noting the opportunity for Modi and Macron to discuss mutual interests such as global conflicts and cooperation in defense and security during Macron's visit. The historical context of Chirac's admiration for India and Macron's previous visits set the stage for further strengthening of the bilateral relationship.

			<title>Gyanvapi case | The test ahead: Law on places of worship, and the challenge it faces</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gyanvapi-case-the-test-ahead-law-on-places-of-worship-and-the-challenge-it-faces-9128231/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal proceedings regarding the title suit of the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi mosque site. The key points are:

- The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, is central to the case, as it prohibits changing the religious character of places of worship as it was on August 15, 1947, except for Ayodhya.
- The Supreme Court, while not yet ruling conclusively, has observed that determining the religious nature of a place is not barred by the 1991 Act, provided the ascertainment is limited to the state of affairs as of 1947.
- A constitutional challenge to the 1991 Act is pending, with the possibility of being referred to a larger bench, but the Centre has not responded yet.
- An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report submitted to the Varanasi court suggests the existence of a Hindu temple before the mosque, but its reliability and implications for the mosque's religious character in 1947 are yet to be determined.
- The article references a similar ASI report from 2003 used in the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi case, which the Supreme Court found inconclusive in determining whether a temple was demolished to build the mosque.

The article also mentions unrelated content, such as other news headlines and a political issue involving the Election Commission of India, which are not directly related to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Why a Chemistry professor suggested adding salt to tea for the perfect cup</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/salt-in-tea-bitter-taste-effect-science-9127798/</link>
			<description>A new book called "Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea" by Michelle Francl has caused a debate between Americans and the British regarding the best way to prepare tea. Francl suggests adding a pinch of salt to tea to reduce its bitterness, which sparked disagreement. The US Embassy in the UK clarified that adding salt to tea is not official US policy. The UK's Cabinet Office responded with humor, stating that tea can only be made using a kettle. 

Tea is beloved in Britain since it arrived from China during the colonial era, while the US is primarily a nation of coffee drinkers. Both tea and coffee have a slight bitterness due to caffeine and tannin compounds. The salt tip seems to work because taste receptors on the tongue prevent the brain from confusing bitter and sweet flavors. Mixing salt with bitter compounds can mask the bitterness. However, the exact mechanism behind this is not well-known.

Francl's book explores over 100 chemical compounds in tea and provides brewing advice. She recommends using short and stout tea cups to retain heat, heating the cup separately for more aromatic compounds, and preferring loose tea over teabags for better circulation of tea leaves. Microwaves are discouraged for tea preparation. When using tea bags, large ones should be used and steeped quickly with dunking and squeezing to reduce sour-tasting tannins.

To avoid curdling, warmed milk should be added after pouring the tea. Francl also suggests adding a small amount of lemon juice to remove floating scum formed from chemical elements in the tea and water. The book connects the chemistry of tea with fundamental scientific discoveries, such as Emil Fischer's Nobel Prize-winning work on caffeine and George de Hevesy's isotopic tracing research.

In unrelated news, an IAS officer in Chandigarh ordered the sealing of establishments and suspension of liquor licenses for ten major vendors. As a result, the Home department transferred him out of the Excise department.</description>

			<title>January 26, 1950: How India observed its first Republic Day</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/january-26-1950-when-india-became-republic-9127785/</link>
			<description>On January 26, 1950, India became a sovereign and democratic republic, marking the end of British rule in the country. After two years of independence, the newly drafted Constitution of India came into effect, replacing the British-era Government of India Act of 1935. Dr Rajendra Prasad became the President of India, and the Constituent Assembly became the Parliament until the first general elections took place in 1951-52. To showcase state authority and prestige, India continued the tradition of military parades started during the British Raj. The Republic Day celebrations included a grand military parade in New Delhi, with participation from the armed forces and the Delhi Police. The parade featured a 31-gun salute, celebratory gunfire, and aerial displays by Indian Air Force planes. The President's horse-drawn carriage was flanked by the President's Bodyguard, and after the event, the President returned to Government House. Despite the celebrations, leaders recognized the challenges ahead, as inequality persisted in social and economic life. In a speech, Dr B R Ambedkar emphasized the need to address this contradiction for the success of political democracy.</description>

			<title>US signals cooperation with China on AI safety: what could happen, and what could it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/us-cooperation-china-ai-safety-significance-9127739/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a shift in the United States' stance on AI collaboration with China. Despite previous restrictions on tech transfers to China, the U.S. has agreed to work with Beijing to manage AI deployment risks. This change follows two key events: the signing of the Bletchley Declaration on AI standards and a meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi Jinping. Concerns about AI's potential for cyber attacks and misinformation are driving this cooperation, especially as many countries face elections.

The article also notes that the U.S. and China are on par in AI development, with China possibly taking the lead in implementation. It highlights China's advancements in AI models and facial recognition technology. The U.S. intends to maintain AI development oversight without slowing progress, recognizing the intertwined nature of U.S. and Chinese AI research ecosystems.

The potential U.S.-China AI collaboration could influence other regions, including India, which is leveraging technology for governance solutions like Aadhaar and UPI. India's approach to AI regulation is seen as a mix of European citizen-focused and American innovator-focused models. The emerging U.S.-China consensus on tech development and regulation could provide a new template for global AI governance. The article concludes with a brief mention of political developments in India unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>What are Odisha’s famous black tigers, and why is the state planning a safari around them?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-black-tigers-safari-naveen-patnaik-9127455/</link>
			<description>Odisha's Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik, has announced the development of a melanistic tiger safari near the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR), which will be the first of its kind in the world. This new safari aims to showcase the rare and majestic melanistic tiger species found exclusively in Odisha. The plan has received approval from the technical committee of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and is expected to be ready for visitors by October this year.

The STR, located in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district, is Asia's second-largest biosphere and the only habitat for melanistic royal Bengal tigers in India. These tigers have black and yellow interspersed stripes due to a unique lineage with higher-than-normal levels of melanin. However, they are more accurately described as being pseudo-melanistic since they are not entirely black.

Research conducted by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NBCS) suggests that a single mutation in the Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) gene results in the broadened or spread stripes seen in the Similipal black tigers. Genetic analyses indicate that these tigers may have originated from a small founding population and are inbred due to their isolation from other tiger populations.

The proposed melanistic tiger safari will encompass around 200 hectares of land near the Dhanbad-Balasore National Highway-18, approximately 15 km away from the STR. It will feature an open enclosure housing three melanistic tigers from the Nandankanan zoo and other rescued tigers unsuitable for the wild but suitable for display. The park will also include veterinary care facilities, a rescue center, staff infrastructure, and visitor amenities.

The safari's objective is to enable wildlife conservationists, researchers, and enthusiasts to observe these rare big cats up close and raise awareness about the need for their conservation. As the sighting of tigers is challenging in the expansive STR, the safari will enhance the attraction for visitors to Similipal.

The project requires further feasibility studies by an NTCA committee and other statutory clearances, including approval from the Central Zoo Authority. The state government's ongoing tiger survey suggests a higher number of royal Bengal tigers in the STR than reported by the NTCA, with their findings soon to be released.</description>

			<title>Moti Mahal vs Daryaganj: Who invented butter chicken? Delhi HC to decide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/moti-mahal-daryaganj-who-invented-butter-chicken-9126175/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court is currently handling a dispute between two restaurant chains, Moti Mahal and Daryaganj, over the claim of who invented butter chicken and dal makhani. Moti Mahal asserts that its founder, Kundal Lal Gujral, brought these dishes to India after Partition from Peshawar's Moti Mahal restaurant. However, Daryaganj, known for its appearance on Shark Tank India, also started advertising itself as the inventor of these dishes, attributing it to their forefather, Kundan Lal Jaggi. Moti Mahal filed a lawsuit against Daryaganj, alleging trademark infringement and passing off.

Moti Mahal's suit seeks a temporary injunction against Daryaganj, which would require them to refrain from certain actions until the court makes a decision. Moti Mahal claims that Daryaganj is misleading the public by falsely claiming to have invented butter chicken and dal makhani and by using a manipulated photograph of the Peshawar restaurant on its website. They want Daryaganj to stop claiming any association with Moti Mahal and using their trademarked tagline.

In response, Daryaganj argues that the photograph in question was jointly used by both parties' predecessors and that Moti Mahal has no exclusive rights to it. They claim that they cropped the picture to exclude the term "Moti Mahal" and avoid trademark infringement. While they agreed to remove the disputed photograph, Daryaganj is yet to file its complete response to the lawsuit.

The article explains that a trademark provides exclusive rights to its owner and its unauthorized use can be considered infringement. A trademark can be violated even if the infringing mark is not identical but is deceptively similar. Passing off is another form of infringement where one party tries to benefit from the reputation established by another in a trade or business. Moti Mahal argues that Daryaganj's claims and use of the manipulated photograph amount to passing off their trademark as their own.

In cases of trademark infringement, the owner can initiate legal action, seeking remedies like injunctions, damages, and accounts. An injunction is an official court order to prevent someone from doing something. The Delhi High Court has asked Daryaganj to file its response within 30 days, and the matter is scheduled for a hearing on May 29.

The article concludes with unrelated information about filmmaker Rohit Shetty, stating that he made a film called Cirkus during the pandemic to provide jobs for his associated workers but would not make the same film given a choice today.</description>

			<title>Health insurance companies to offer 100% ‘cashless’ treatment in hospitals from today: All you need to know</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/health-insurance-cashless-hospitals-treatment-9127009/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant change in India's health insurance sector, where general and health insurance companies will offer **100% cashless treatment** nationwide starting January 25. This initiative by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) aims to increase insurance penetration and simplify the claims process, which is often delayed and disputed in the reimbursement mode.

Under the new 'Cashless Everywhere' system, policyholders can receive treatment at any hospital without upfront payment, regardless of whether the hospital is within the insurance company's network. The insurance company will settle the bill on the day of discharge. Customers must notify their insurance company 48 hours before planned admissions or within 48 hours after emergency admissions.

The General Insurance Council, with the National Health Authority's support, will implement a technological platform to facilitate this system, which requires standardization of rates and services. Currently, only 56% of health claims are settled through cashless transactions, and the lack of network hospitals in rural areas poses challenges for policyholders.

The move is expected to benefit all stakeholders, reducing financial burdens on policyholders and potentially decreasing fraud in the industry. It will also streamline claim processing through common empanelment and interoperability with hospitals. Insurers believe this could be a game-changer for the industry, improving customer experience and increasing insurance penetration.

Policyholders must be aware that insurers will only cover expenses up to the sum assured in the policy, and certain illnesses may have a waiting period before coverage applies. During the fiscal year 2022-23, insurers settled 2.36 crore health insurance claims, paying out Rs 70,930 crore. The health insurance segment is projected to surpass Rs one lakh crore in premium mobilization during fiscal 2023-24.

			<title>Why Thailand seeks an ambitious trade deal with EU, what the hurdles are</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/eu-thailand-trade-deal-significance-9126857/</link>
			<description>The European Union (EU) and Thailand are set to hold a second round of talks on a free trade agreement. Bangkok aims to finalize the negotiations by early 2025, hoping to revive its sluggish economy. The deal would solidify the EU's focus on Southeast Asia, as it has already secured trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore, while negotiating with Indonesia and the Philippines. However, discussions between the EU and Thailand may face challenges, particularly regarding the protection of their respective fishery industries. The EU is seeking a more comprehensive deal than Thailand's previous trade pacts, and both sides are expected to address concerns related to market access, intellectual property, government contracts, environmental standards, and agricultural and fishery imports. Thailand considers the EU trade agreement a top priority and hopes to conclude the deal within the specified timeframe.</description>

			<title>As Army launches Op Sarvashakti, recalling Sarpvinash of 2003, that crushed terror base in Pir Panjal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/as-army-launches-op-sarvashakti-recalling-sarpvinash-of-2003-that-crushed-terror-base-in-pir-panjal-9126363/</link>
			<description>Operation Sarvashakti is a military operation launched by the Indian Army in the Rajouri-Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir. The objective of the operation is to target terrorists who have been carrying out attacks on security forces in the area. The operation involves deploying additional troops to increase the density of forces and enhance the chances of contact with terrorists. This operation is reminiscent of a previous operation called Operation Sarpvinash, which took place in the same forests over two decades ago. During that operation, Indian forces successfully flushed out terrorists who had infiltrated from across the border and had set up camps in the region. The current operation aims to eliminate the threat posed by terrorists in the area and restore peace.</description>

			<title>Turkey finally backs Sweden’s NATO bid: Why the opposition, why it changed its stance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/turkey-swedens-nato-why-it-changed-its-stance-9126127/</link>
			<description>Sweden's bid to join NATO has made significant progress with Turkey's parliamentary approval, overcoming a major obstacle that had persisted for nearly two years. This development follows Sweden's historical policy of neutrality, which was reconsidered after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Public opinion in Sweden shifted towards NATO membership, leading to a joint application with Finland in 2022. Despite Finland's successful bid, Sweden faced strong opposition from Turkey and Hungary.

Turkey's concerns centered around Sweden's perceived leniency towards groups like the PKK, which Turkey considers terrorist organizations. Additionally, tensions were heightened by Quran-burning incidents in Sweden. However, recent actions by Sweden, including tightening anti-terrorism laws and addressing Turkey's concerns, have led to Turkey's support. This support was also seemingly linked to a potential arms deal with the US.

Hungary's opposition mirrored Turkey's, with additional grievances over Sweden's criticism of Hungarian domestic policies. However, following Turkey's approval, Hungary appears to be more open to discussions on Sweden's NATO membership.

The inclusion of Sweden in NATO would significantly expand the alliance's Baltic Sea territory, providing strategic advantages and reinforcing security in the region. Sweden's military, though small, is well-equipped and experienced, with advanced aircraft and submarine capabilities.

In an unrelated note, the Election Commission of India has intervened in a domestic political issue, transferring an official due to allegations of misuse of public office during elections.</description>

			<title>Manipur ministers and MLAs meet Arambai Tenggol members: Who are the radical Meitei group?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/manipur-arambai-tenggol-radical-meitei-group-9126080/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant meeting held at Kangla Fort, Imphal, where Meitei MLAs, Lok Sabha, and Rajya Sabha MPs from Manipur's valley areas convened with the radical Meitei group Arambai Tenggol. This meeting was in response to a summons issued by Arambai Tenggol, which has evolved from a cultural outfit in 2020 to a radical organization implicated in Meitei-Kuki clashes. The group, along with Meitei Leepun, is accused of escalating violence and targeting community members, including an alleged incident involving a Naga woman.

The meeting aimed to address Arambai Tenggol's demands, such as delisting Kukis from the Scheduled Tribes list and various political and military changes. The session concluded with an oath-taking ceremony, and the group's leader, Korounganba Khuman, later claimed that the representatives were made to sign a set of demands to be presented to the Central government.

In a separate but related development, the Election Commission transferred Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department due to allegations of misuse of public office for electoral gains. The BJP has accused her of using the scheme to influence voters on behalf of the BJD. This transfer highlights the ongoing political dynamics and the scrutiny of public officials' roles in elections.</description>

			<title>Who will be Donald Trump’s running mate?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-will-be-donald-trumps-running-mate-9125979/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump's victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary has positioned him as the likely Republican presidential nominee. The focus is now on who will be his vice-presidential running mate. The race for the vice-presidential nomination is competitive, with several candidates being considered.

The US Constitution outlines the roles of the president and vice-president, with the latter being next in line should the president be unable to serve. The vice-president also serves as an advisor and representative to the president. Running mates are chosen by presidential candidates to help secure election victory, and voters cast their ballots for both positions as a team.

Several potential running mates for Trump have been discussed in the media, although Trump has not publicly confirmed his choice. The candidates include:

- **Elise Stefanik**, a former moderate Republican who has shifted to the right and criticized Nikki Haley.
- **Kristi Noem**, the Governor of South Dakota and a staunch Trump supporter.
- **J.D. Vance**, a Yale Law graduate and author who has become a vocal Trump supporter.
- **Kari Lake**, a former TV presenter and Trump advocate who ran for Arizona governor.
- **Tim Scott**, a Senator who could counteract accusations of racism against the GOP.
- **Sarah Huckabee Sanders**, former White House press secretary and Arkansas governor known for her conservative views.
- **Vivek Ramaswamy**, an entrepreneur who has criticized the current political climate and Nikki Haley.
- **Nikki Haley**, the last standing opponent to Trump in the primaries, has been critical of him and stated she would not serve in a Trump administration.

The article also mentions a separate issue regarding the Election Commission of India's actions against Sujata R Karthikeyan for alleged misuse of public office. However, this is unrelated to the main content of the article.</description>

			<title>Why Punjab moved SC against the expansion of BSF jurisdiction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-punjab-moved-sc-against-the-expansion-of-bsf-jurisdiction-9124717/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is scheduled to hear a dispute regarding the expansion of the Border Security Force (BSF) jurisdiction in Punjab, with final hearings set to begin next week. The controversy stems from an October 2021 notification by the Ministry of Home Affairs that extended the BSF's operational area from 15 to 50 kilometers from the border in Punjab, West Bengal, and Assam. This move was contested by the Punjab government in December of the same year.

The BSF's jurisdiction was expanded to combat the increased use of drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for surveillance and smuggling activities, as well as to address cattle smuggling issues. The expansion aimed to standardize the BSF's jurisdiction across states, mirroring the existing 50-kilometer limit in Rajasthan and adjusting Gujarat's limit from 80 to 50 kilometers.

Punjab's challenge to the central government's decision is based on concerns that it infringes upon the state's exclusive legislative powers over police and public order, as outlined in the Constitution. The state also argued that the expansion was implemented without proper consultation with the affected states. The Supreme Court will consider whether the notification was arbitrary or justified, its impact on state powers, and the criteria for determining BSF jurisdiction. Additionally, the court will examine if such a notification can be contested through an original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution.

			<title>The rooftop solar plan: India’s solar power capacity, target, and the way forward</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/the-rooftop-solar-plan-indias-solar-power-capacity-target-and-the-way-forward-9124675/</link>
			<description>The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, recently announced the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, a program aimed at installing rooftop solar systems on 1 crore (10 million) houses. The objective of this initiative is to reduce electricity bills for the poor and middle classes while making India self-reliant in the energy sector. The target for rooftop solar installations had been set at 40 GW by 2022, but it has been missed. The new program focuses on individual households, which have great untapped potential for solar energy. The details of the program have not been released yet, but it aims to accelerate the adoption of decentralized solar power in the country.</description>

			<title>Why Canada has put curbs on foreign students, and how Indians are impacted</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-canada-has-put-curbs-on-foreign-students-and-how-indians-are-impacted-9124633/</link>
			<description>The Canadian government has announced a **two-year cap on the number of international student visas**, starting from the academic session of September 1, 2024. This cap will result in a **35% reduction** in new permits compared to 2023, translating to about **360,000 approved study permits**. The permits will be distributed among provinces and territories to their Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs). Provinces are required to issue letters of attestation for accepted students, and the intake of study permit applications will be paused until March 31st as provinces set up their systems.

Additionally, changes to the **Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWP)** were announced, which will no longer issue permits to students studying under curriculum licensing arrangements, starting in September 2024. Work permits for spouses of international students will also be restricted, with exceptions for those in masters, doctoral, and certain professional programs.

The measures aim to maintain a **sustainable level of temporary residence** and ensure international students have the necessary resources to succeed in Canada. The government also intends to protect students from exploitation and maintain system integrity. The cap will only affect new applicants for undergraduate courses, not current students or those applying for Masters, PhD, or elementary and secondary school-level courses.

The visa cap is expected to significantly impact Indian students, who are among the largest groups receiving student visas in Canada. The number of international students in Canada has grown substantially, with over a million study permit holders as of December 2023, and the new rules will also limit open work permits for spouses to those enrolled in postgraduate or doctoral programs. The situation will be reassessed at the end of the year to decide on the number of study permits for 2025. The cap is not intended to be permanent.</description>

			<title>Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur: Why the Jannayak’s politics and policies still resonate</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/bharat-ratna-to-karpoori-thakur-his-politics-policies-9124428/</link>
			<description>The article announces the posthumous awarding of the Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur, a former chief minister of Bihar, in his birth centenary year. Known as 'Jannayak,' Thakur was a prominent leader who fought for the rights and dignity of the disadvantaged. Despite being from a minority caste, he became a significant backward caste leader but was later overshadowed by his mentees from numerically stronger castes.

Thakur's political career was marked by his participation in the freedom struggle, long tenure as an MLA, and two brief stints as chief minister. His tenure as chief minister is noted for radical policy decisions, including the removal of English as a compulsory subject, prohibition of alcohol, job provisions for unemployed engineers, and a layered reservation system known as the 'Karpoori Thakur Formula.' This formula provided 26% reservation across various social categories and had a significant impact on Bihar's social structure.

Despite facing severe backlash and derogatory attacks for his reservation policy, Thakur maintained a clean image and refused to enrich himself through government funds. His legacy continues to be relevant in Bihar's politics, with current leaders from various parties claiming to carry forward his vision and policies. The article also briefly mentions a political controversy unrelated to Thakur's legacy.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the significance of the New Hampshire primary in the 2024 presidential race, particularly for the Republican party, as the Democrats have largely settled on President Biden as their nominee. The primary is the first in the nation due to a longstanding tradition and law, and it often has a substantial impact on the momentum of candidates' campaigns. The Republican field has narrowed to Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, with Trump leading in the polls. The Democrats have restructured their primary calendar, prioritizing states with more diverse populations, leading to South Carolina and Nevada voting before New Hampshire. The New Hampshire primary remains a critical test for Republican candidates, with a history of predicting the GOP nominee with high accuracy. The article also briefly mentions a political issue in India unrelated to the U.S. primaries.</description>

			<description>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent figure in India's fight for independence, had a remarkable escape from house arrest in Calcutta during World War II. He traveled from Calcutta to Gomoh to Peshawar to Kabul to Russia, changing his identity three times along the way.

			<title>Looking for ‘dragon babies’: Could China see more births in 2024?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/dragon-babies-china-births-deaths-population-9124091/</link>
			<description>China has experienced a population decline for the first time since the 1960s, with the trend continuing into 2023. Amidst this, the concept of 'dragon babies' has emerged, referring to children born in the Year of the Dragon according to the Chinese zodiac. This period is considered auspicious, and historically, birth rates have increased during Dragon years due to the belief in the animal's luck-bringing properties.

The Chinese zodiac, a 2,000-year-old system, assigns an animal to each year, with the Dragon being particularly significant. A study by Louisiana State University economists found that children born in Dragon years tend to achieve higher educational outcomes, not due to inherent differences but because of their parents' higher expectations and increased investment in their success.

Looking ahead to 2024, another Dragon year, there may be a rise in births, contrasting with the recent low fertility rates and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The easing of China's Zero-Covid policy at the end of 2022 is expected to reduce the number of deaths related to the virus, but the overall trend of fewer births per woman might persist, influenced by factors such as women's education levels, living costs, and work pressures. This pattern is also observed in other Asian and European countries. The article concludes with an unrelated note on the transfer of an Indian official due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>How Bose’s INA helped India win independence — but not on the battlefield</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/subhas-chandra-bose-ina-helped-win-india-independence-not-battlefield-9123486/</link>
			<description>Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent figure in India's independence movement, revitalized the Indian National Army (INA) in 1943 to fight against British rule. Initially formed in 1942 with Indian prisoners of war, the INA grew under Bose's leadership to over 40,000 personnel, funded by donations from the Indian diaspora. Despite military setbacks, such as the failed Imphal offensive in 1944, Bose's efforts were not in vain. The INA's struggle inspired widespread nationalist sentiment in India, leading to public trials of INA officers that further fueled the independence movement. The trials and subsequent mutinies within the British Indian armed forces undermined British control, contributing to the end of colonial rule. Bose's legacy continued to inspire Indians, and his death in a plane crash shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945 marked the end of a significant chapter in India's fight for freedom. The INA's impact was profound, influencing the British decision to negotiate India's independence, which was realized in 1947.</description>

			<description>The proposed $10 billion merger between Sony Corporation's Indian arm, Culver Max Entertainment, and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) has been called off. The merger would have created a major entertainment entity by combining their networks, digital assets, production operations, and program libraries. The deal was initially set to complete by December 21, 2023, but Zee sought an extension until January 20, 2024, which was not fulfilled. Disagreements over the leadership of the merged entity and regulatory issues involving Zee's MD &amp; CEO Punit Goenka and Zee group patriarch Subhash Chandra led to Sony's discomfort, contributing to the termination of the merger. Sony had planned to hold a majority stake in the combined company post-merger. ZEEL has denied any breaches of the merger agreement and is considering legal action to protect its stakeholders' interests. The article also mentions unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India's actions, which is not connected to the merger story.</description>

			<title>PM Modi launches new rooftop solar power scheme: What it is, why it is needed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/modi-launches-new-rooftop-solar-scheme-pradhan-mantri-suryodaya-yojana-9122514/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the 'Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana', aiming to install rooftop solar power systems in one crore households. This initiative is part of India's efforts to boost its solar capacity, following the earlier Rooftop Solar Programme launched in 2014 with a target of 40 GW by 2022, which was not met and thus extended to 2026.

The scheme is expected to reduce electricity bills for the poor and middle class and contribute to India's energy self-reliance. As of December 2023, India's solar power capacity stands at 73.31 GW, with rooftop solar at 11.08 GW. Rajasthan leads in total solar capacity, while Gujarat tops in rooftop solar.

India's renewable energy capacity is currently around 180 GW, with solar power being a significant contributor. The country aims to reach 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 to meet its growing energy demands. The Rooftop Solar Programme provides financial assistance and incentives to expand residential solar capacity, with the goal of reaching 40 GW by March 2026. Consumers can benefit from the scheme through DISCOM projects or the National Portal, with subsidies directly transferred to their bank accounts. Surplus solar power can also be exported to the grid, offering monetary benefits to consumers.</description>

			<title>Rahul Gandhi prevented from visiting Batadrava Than: Significance of this Assam shrine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/rahul-gandhi-prevented-batadrava-than-significance-9122417/</link>
			<description>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's visit to Assam's Batadrava Than as part of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was halted, with only two other Congress members being allowed to proceed. The Than management committee and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had requested the visit be postponed due to a religious ceremony. Batadrava Than, a significant site for Assamese Vaishnavites, was established by Srimanta Sankardeva, who promoted a caste-free society and devotion to Lord Krishna. The Than is central to Assam's Neo-Vaishnavite movement, which emphasizes worship through art. Politically, Thans are integral to Assamese identity and have been focal points in land rights discussions, with recent government plans to restrict land sales around Thans to indigenous people only. A beautification project was also initiated at Batadrava Than, highlighting its cultural and political significance.</description>

			<title>Sri Lankan Catholic church moves to declare Easter attack victims as ‘saints’: What this means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sri-lankan-church-easter-attack-saints-meaning-9122350/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Catholic church in Sri Lanka is planning to declare the 273 people who were killed in the 2019 Easter Sunday suicide bombings as "saints." The process of declaring saints in the Catholic Church involves verifying their virtuous lives, any miracles they may have performed, and their ascension to heaven after death. The bishop of their diocese initiates the process, and it is then reviewed by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Vatican. If approved, the person is recognized as a "Servant of God" and later as "Venerable" by the Pope. Beatification and canonization require the confirmation of miracles attributed to the person. Martyrs, on the other hand, can be beatified without a verified miracle but still require canonization to be declared saints. In the case of the Easter Sunday victims, the Catholic church plans to declare them as saints on April 21, 2024, five years after their sacrifice.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: What is the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, and what happens when we breach it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-the-1-5-degree-celsius-threshold-9122204/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of the **1.5 degree Celsius threshold** in climate change, as outlined in the **Paris Agreement**. This limit is set to prevent extreme and irreversible impacts of climate change, with the aim to keep the rise in Earth's temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The baseline for pre-industrial levels is generally considered to be from 1850 to 1900, despite some warming already occurring due to the Industrial Revolution.

The **1.5 degree Celsius limit** is not a magical number but an aspirational target to minimize climate risks. Breaching this threshold would lead to more frequent and intense heavy precipitation, droughts, stronger hurricanes, longer-lasting wildfires, and accelerated sea ice melt contributing to sea level rise. The **World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)** reported a 66% chance that one of the years between 2023 and 2027 could exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius warming limit for the first time. The year 2023 was already 1.48 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, with some days exceeding the 1.5 degree Celsius mark.

However, breaching the 1.5 or 2 degree Celsius thresholds refers to long-term warming over 20-30 years, not just temporary fluctuations. The article emphasizes that the lower the temperature increase, the lower the risks of climate impacts. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>How food inflation in India has been de-globalised, what factors can drive prices now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/food-inflation-india-factors-reasons-9121289/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significant drop in world food prices from their peak in 2022, highlighting a 13.7% decrease in the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index in 2023. Despite this global trend, India's domestic food inflation has remained high, with a 9.5% increase in December 2023. The article suggests that India's food inflation is now more influenced by domestic factors than global ones, due to the government's measures to limit the impact of international prices through export bans and reduced import duties.

The article also notes that while global disruptions have previously affected India's edible oil and cereal prices, the current situation is different. India's significant import dependence on edible oils and pulses limits the transmission of global price changes to domestic inflation. However, with the government's restrictions on exports and favorable import duties, the potential for export-led inflation is minimized.

Furthermore, the article mentions that the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea has had little impact on India's food imports, as most of the country's imports do not pass through the affected routes. It also points out that domestic production factors, such as the sowing area for wheat and the conditions for a good harvest, will likely be the main determinants of food inflation in the coming months.

In summary, while global food prices have declined, India's food inflation remains high due to domestic production issues and government policies that have decoupled domestic prices from global trends. The focus is now on domestic factors like cereal, pulses, and sugar production, which are expected to drive food inflation in India. The article concludes that the drivers of food inflation in India are now more "domestic" than "global."</description>

			<title>Ram temple at Ayodhya: A 200-year journey, with many milestones</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ram-temple-at-ayodhya-a-200-year-journey-with-many-milestones-9120892/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed historical account of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which has been a significant and contentious issue in Indian politics. The movement's origins date back to the 18th century with the Marathas' request to the Nawab of Awadh for control over Ayodhya. The dispute became a judicial matter in 1822, with claims over a mosque built by Babur at the birthplace of Lord Ram. The conflict saw several violent clashes, notably in 1855 and 1858, with various parties filing legal complaints and FIRs.

The 20th century saw increased efforts to build a Ram temple at the site, with petitions to the government and resolutions passed by Hindu organizations. The idol of Ram Lalla was placed in the mosque in 1949, leading to further disputes and political involvement. The movement gained momentum in the 1980s and 1990s, with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) playing pivotal roles. The Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, leading to nationwide riots and political repercussions.

The legal battle continued with various court orders and the formation of committees. In 2010, the Allahabad High Court divided the disputed land, a verdict later stayed by the Supreme Court. In 2019, the Supreme Court awarded the land to Hindu petitioners, leading to the establishment of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust and the laying of the foundation for a Ram temple by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2020. The temple's inauguration is set for January 22.

The article also mentions unrelated content, including the transfer of an official by the Election Commission of India and the author's background, which are not included in the summary. The focus remains on the historical and legal aspects of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and its impact on Indian society and politics.</description>

			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, the study mentioned in the article found that adults aged 60 and older who took a daily multivitamin for two years scored higher on memory and cognitive tests compared to those who took a placebo. The study suggests that multivitamins can be a safe and accessible approach to protecting cognitive health in older adults. However, experts caution that the benefits were small and it's unclear if they would translate to tangible improvements in people's lives. It's important to note that more research is needed to understand who specifically benefits from taking multivitamins.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/davos-meeting-2024-5-key-takeaways-9120670/</link>
			<description>At this year's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, held from January 15 to January 19, several key themes emerged. One prominent topic of discussion was Artificial Intelligence (AI), with conversations focusing on its transformative potential for human welfare, as well as concerns about regulation, job losses, misinformation, and inequality. Overall, the sentiment leaned towards the belief that the benefits of AI outweigh the negatives. Another significant theme was the fragility of the geopolitical situation, including wars in the Middle East and Europe, threats to global supply chains, and uncertainty around food security. However, no concrete plans for peace were offered regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict. Climate change also took center stage, emphasizing the need for businesses to adapt and countries to unite in taking action. China's economy, facing a slowdown, sought to attract more investment from the West. Finally, India's transformation as one of the fastest-growing economies and its contributions to women's health and gender equity were highlighted.</description>

			<title>This Quote Means: With Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya, recalling what Gandhi said about ‘Ram Rajya’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-quote-means-ayodhya-ram-temple-gandhi-ram-rajya-9120495/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of 'Ram Rajya' in the context of the upcoming consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, India. 'Ram Rajya' refers to an ideal state of governance, associated with Lord Ram's rule after his return to Ayodhya. The term has been invoked by various Indian leaders, including Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who noted its presence in the Indian Constitution, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who emphasized its relevance to economic prosperity and political integrity.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mahatma Gandhi have also been mentioned in relation to 'Ram Rajya'. Modi highlighted Gandhi's interpretation of the term as a welfare state where everyone is happy. Gandhi, in his writings, clarified that 'Ram Rajya' is not a religious concept but a divine rule representing the Kingdom of God, emphasizing equality, justice, and respect for all religions. He associated it with non-violence and moral authority, suggesting that it should be achieved through self-introspection and internal transformation rather than revolutionary means.

The article also touches upon Gandhi's political style, which did not separate religion from politics but used it to unite people, as seen in his support for the Khilafat movement. Lastly, it mentions a recent administrative action by the Election Commission of India unrelated to the main topic. The summary omits any advertisement or unrelated content as requested.</description>

			<title>What is the India-Myanmar border Free Movement Regime, which the Centre is planning to end?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-myanmar-border-free-movement-regime-explained-9120124/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Indian government's decision to fence the entire India-Myanmar border to regulate movement and address security concerns. The Free Movement Regime (FMR), allowing visa-free travel for locals up to 16 km across the border, has been under scrutiny due to issues like illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The FMR was part of India's Act East policy to strengthen ties with Myanmar but has faced criticism for facilitating illegal activities. The porous border and the military coup in Myanmar have led to an influx of refugees into India, raising security and environmental concerns. The article suggests that while the FMR needs better regulation, complete removal or full fencing may not be practical due to the impact on local livelihoods and essential travel. The situation is complex, with insurgent groups exploiting the border's porosity for illegal activities, and the Indian security forces face challenges in managing the unfenced and difficult terrain. The article concludes that a balanced approach is needed to address these issues without harming local interests.</description>

			<title>How Ramayana became popular outside India, from east Asia to the Caribbean</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/how-ramayana-became-popular-outside-india-9119917/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the spread of the Ramayana beyond India, highlighting two significant periods: the early Common Era (CE) and the 19th century. Initially, the epic traveled to Southeast Asia along three routes, carried by Indian traders, priests, and scholars who influenced local cultures. The Ramayana became part of many countries' cultural heritage, with Thailand's Ayutthaya kingdom and Cambodia's Angkor Wat temple incorporating elements from the epic.

In modern times, the Ramayana continues to be significant in Southeast Asia, with variations like Thailand's Ramakien and Laos's Phra Ram. These versions have adapted the story, drawing from different sources like the Tamil Kamban Ramayana and incorporating local folklore.

The 19th-century girmitiya migration spread the Ramayana to Africa and the Caribbean, where indentured laborers from India brought their culture and religion, including the Ramcharitmanas. This text provided comfort and a connection to their homeland in unfamiliar lands. The Ramayana remains alive through traditions like Ramleela and has been translated into local languages, reflecting its enduring legacy in the diaspora. The article concludes with a contemporary reference to the Election Commission of India's actions regarding a complaint of alleged misuse of public office, unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Autonomous driving: India, an unlikely market, packs a surprise for ADAS gear makers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/autonomous-driving-india-an-unlikely-market-packs-a-surprise-for-adas-gear-makers-9119553/</link>
			<description>Mobileye Global Inc., an Intel-owned Israeli company specializing in advanced driver assistance technology, has seen a significant surge in demand from India, leading to order inflows nearly four times higher than forecasted. This increase has prompted Mobileye to consider India a priority market. The company's CEO, Amnon Shashua, announced a new operating system, 'DXP', and highlighted the interest in Mobileye's SuperVision package, which offers autonomous capabilities for vehicles. The demand in India is broad-based, not limited to a single customer, and is seen as having great potential for safety and convenience improvements.

India's demand for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) comes despite its dangerous roads and traffic patterns. Car manufacturers are now offering ADAS as standard on mid-segment vehicles, with features like lane keep assist, collision warning, and adaptive cruise control. This trend is driven by consumer demand for safer vehicles and government road safety initiatives, making ADAS technology more affordable.

The article also explains the five levels of autonomous driving, from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation), with most carmakers currently offering Level 2 ADAS features. The transition to higher levels of automation faces challenges such as cars not recognizing pedestrians or traffic signals. The adoption of ADAS is seen as a step towards improving road safety in India.</description>

			<title>When China ceded Hong Kong to the British in 1841 — and how its impact is felt till date</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/china-hong-kong-british-ceded-opium-war-9119319/</link>
			<description>The article provides a historical overview of Hong Kong's relationship with Britain and China. It begins with the cession of Hong Kong to Britain in 1841, following the First Opium War, and the subsequent Treaty of Nanking which allowed Britain to increase its influence in China. Hong Kong's strategic location contributed to its growth as a major port city. The population expanded rapidly, and further territories were added to British control.

Post-World War II, despite decolonization trends, Britain retained control over Hong Kong, which became a point of contention for Communist China. Economic reforms in China led to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, agreeing to return Hong Kong to China in 1997 under the 'one country, two systems' principle. However, this transition has been fraught with tension, as many Hong Kong residents value their political freedoms and economic system. Protests have been frequent, especially with recent laws that seem to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, indicating a struggle between maintaining 'two systems' and China's push for 'one country'.</description>

			<title>How school teachers are faring in India: 5 broad takeaways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sottter-tiss-teacher-report-9118698/</link>
			<description>The "State of Teachers, Teaching and Teacher Education Report for India (SOTTTER)" by TISS highlights several key issues in the Indian education sector:

1. **Teacher Certification and Quality**: While 90% of teachers have professional certification, only 46% of primary school teachers have the necessary Diploma in Elementary Education (D.El.Ed). A significant number of these teachers scored low in the qualifying exams, and only 32% passed the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET).

2. **Subject Knowledge and Language Competency**: There's a concern about the low subject knowledge among primary teachers, especially in mathematics, with average TET scores as low as 46%. Additionally, competency in regional languages is low, which is problematic given the emphasis on regional language instruction in the National Education Policy 2020.

3. **Private Sector Employment**: The private sector employs a substantial portion of teachers, offering better facilities but poor pay and working conditions. Over 50% of teachers in private schools work without written contracts, affecting salary and job security.

4. **Teaching Workforce Demographics**: The teaching workforce is older in government schools and younger in private schools. Female teachers, especially younger ones, are more likely to work without contracts. The median age of women in teaching is also lower than that of men, indicating a trend of feminization in the profession.

5. **Workload and Student-Teacher Ratio**: Government school teachers often teach multiple grades simultaneously due to poor student-teacher ratios and have additional administrative responsibilities. This, along with unsupportive parents, adds to the challenges faced by educators.

The report underscores the need for improvements in teacher training, employment terms, and overall support for educators to enhance the quality of education in India.</description>

			<title>Maldives and Lakshadweep: How do the two groups of islands compare as tourism destinations?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/maldives-and-lakshadweep-9118096/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contrasting tourism dynamics and challenges of Lakshadweep and the Maldives. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to visit Lakshadweep led to a backlash from Maldivian officials and social media users, with some Indians canceling trips to the Maldives. The Maldives, a well-established tourist destination, has seen a consistent increase in tourist arrivals, especially from India, contributing significantly to its GDP. In contrast, Lakshadweep has limited tourism due to its small size and concerns over environmental impact and local livelihoods. Despite the potential for high-end, low-volume tourism, infrastructure and policy challenges have hindered development. However, optimism remains as the Prime Minister's interest could lead to new projects and a focus on sustainable tourism. The article also touches on the need for an Integrated Island Management Plan and the local opposition to aggressive development policies. The end of the article mentions unrelated content about political journalism and an election-related transfer ordered by the Election Commission of India.</description>

			<title>What is the Nagara style, in which Ayodhya’s Ram temple is being built</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/nagara-style-ayodhya-ram-temple-9118010/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the upcoming inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, designed by Chandrakant Sompura and his son Ashish in the Nagara style of temple architecture. This style, which originated in the fifth century CE during the Gupta period in northern India, is characterized by a raised plinth, a sanctum sanctorum (garbha griha), and a distinctive mountain peak-like tower (shikhara). The shikhara represents the natural and cosmological order in Hindu tradition, with temples often featuring a circumambulatory passage and halls (mandapas) along the same axis.

Adam Hardy's work describes Nagara and Dravida as "the two great classical languages of Indian temple architecture," with a vocabulary and grammar for assembling parts. Five modes of Nagara architecture are identified: Valabhi, Phamsana, Latina, Shekhari, and Bhumija, each with distinct characteristics and historical significance. The Latina mode, for example, features a single curved tower and was predominant for three centuries.

The article also contrasts Nagara with the Dravida style, noting differences such as the smaller vimanas (compared to gopurams) and the presence of boundary walls in Dravida temples. The Ram temple incorporates a hybrid feature with a long boundary wall, despite the absence of an elaborate gopuram. The article emphasizes that temple architects historically did not adhere strictly to any mode but rather innovated on existing traditions, leading to a variety of designs within each mode. The summary omits unrelated content about political updates.</description>

			<title>The history of Iran’s Chabahar port, and its imperative for India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/history-of-iran-chabahar-port-india-9117732/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the strategic significance and development of the **Chabahar port** in Iran, which is crucial for both Iran and India. The port offers India an alternative trade route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. It is also a key component of the **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)**, enhancing connectivity to northern Europe.

India's involvement with Chabahar began in 2002, with significant developments including a trilateral agreement with Iran and Afghanistan in 2016 and the inauguration of the Shahid Beheshti port's first phase in 2017. Despite challenges, India has continued to invest in the port's development, with the Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) taking over operations at Shahid Beheshti in 2018.

The development of Chabahar has faced delays due to geopolitical issues, particularly Iran's relations with the US. Sanctions and diplomatic tensions have hindered progress, but recent developments, such as India's renewed ties with Afghanistan and allocation of funds for the port, signal continued commitment.

The future of the Chabahar project is tied to the fluctuating US-Iran relationship and regional stability, with recent conflicts in the Red Sea and tensions between Iran and Pakistan adding to the unpredictability. Despite these challenges, the article suggests that through diplomatic efforts and efficient management, the Chabahar port can remain a vital transit hub.</description>

			<title>How the legal debate over sub-categorisation among SCs has evolved over the years</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/legal-debate-sub-categorisation-among-scheduled-castes-9117612/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the upcoming hearing by a seven-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court of India, led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, on the issue of sub-categorization within the Scheduled Castes (SCs). The states argue for a separate quota within the existing SC reservation to better represent underrepresented castes. The court will determine if states have the authority to make such sub-classifications or if it is the President's sole prerogative.

The issue dates back to 1975 when Punjab created sub-categories within its SC reservation, giving preference to the Balmiki and Mazhbi Sikh communities. This was challenged and struck down in 2004 by the Supreme Court, which held that all SCs must be treated as a homogenous group, and states cannot alter the list, as per Article 341 of the Constitution.

However, the 2004 decision was questioned, leading to a 2020 ruling that called for its reconsideration, acknowledging the existence of inequalities within the SCs. The concept of a "creamy layer," or income ceiling for reservation eligibility, previously applied to Other Backward Castes (OBC), was extended to SCs in 2018, affecting the sub-classification debate.

The matter is now before a larger seven-judge bench, as only a larger bench can overrule a smaller bench's decision. The outcome will affect various communities across different states, including Balmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs in Punjab, Madiga in Andhra Pradesh, Paswans in Bihar, Jatavs in UP, and Arundhatiyars in Tamil Nadu. The article also mentions an unrelated issue regarding the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Explained: Iran and its proxies and widening violence in the Middle East</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-proxies-middle-east-pakistan-hamas-9117325/</link>
			<description>Iran has conducted missile strikes on Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan in retaliation to attacks on its territory or against its interests. Tehran's actions were specifically in response to a bombing during a commemoration for Qassem Soleimani, a key figure in Iran's proxy network, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2020. The strikes targeted Islamic State militants in Syria, alleged Israeli spy sites in Iraq, and bases of the Baluchi militant group Jaish al Adl in Pakistan.

Iran has cultivated a network of proxy forces across the Arab world, which has expanded since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. These proxies, including groups in Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, have variously engaged in military actions against U.S. and Israeli interests. Iran claims it does not directly control these groups but supports their anti-Israel and anti-U.S. stance.

The article details Iran's support for groups like Hamas in Gaza, the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen. These groups form part of the "axis of resistance" against Israel and the U.S., with recent actions being a response to Israel's actions in Gaza.

Each proxy has its own local interests, such as Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon, the Houthis' control in Yemen, and the PMF's economic interests in Iraq. The article also touches on internal challenges within Iran, including nationwide protests and security concerns raised by attacks from Sunni radical groups.

The relationship between Iran and Russia is highlighted, noting their cooperation in Syria and shared opposition to U.S. policies. The article concludes with the assessment that Iran aims to avoid direct military confrontation with the U.S. or Israel but is willing to engage through its proxies, with the risk of escalation through miscalculated attacks. An unrelated note mentions the transfer of an Indian official due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>JAA, BLF, BLA: Who are the militant groups Iran, Pakistan have hit in cross-border strikes</title>

			<description>Iran and Pakistan have conducted air strikes against targets within each other's borders, claiming to target "terrorist" groups that threaten national security. The conflict escalated when Iran attacked the Jaish al-Adl (JAA) in Pakistan's Balochistan, a group seeking Baluchi rights but labeled as terrorists by Tehran. JAA, active since 2012, has conducted various attacks on Iranian forces and officials. In response, Pakistan targeted the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) and Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in Iran, both labeled as terrorists by Pakistan. These groups, active since the mid-2000s, have attacked Pakistani targets, including Chinese interests, and are accused by Pakistan of having ties with India, a claim both deny. The article also briefly mentions political developments in India unrelated to the Iran-Pakistan conflict.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/iran-pakistan-and-the-baloch-militancy-9116284/</link>
			<description>Tensions between Iran and Pakistan have escalated following cross-border military actions. Iran struck bases in Pakistan, alleging they were used by militants, which led to a strong Pakistani response and reciprocal strikes. Both nations have a history of fluctuating relations, influenced by their alliances and sectarian divides. Their ties have seen cooperation and conflict, particularly over the Baloch insurgency and geopolitical alignments. The Baloch, divided by the Iran-Pakistan border, have long-standing grievances and seek a separate state. Recent events suggest both countries aim to deter further conflict, despite their internal and external challenges. India's position aligns with Iran, citing a shared stance against terrorism. The situation remains delicate, with potential implications for regional stability and international relations.</description>

			<title>Markets crash: Causes, what retail investors should do</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/markets-crash-causes-what-retail-investors-should-do-9116077/</link>
			<description>The stock market in 2023 showed resilience, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty gaining around 20%. This was driven by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, improved corporate sector performance, the expectation of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in 2024, and higher inflows from foreign portfolio investors. However, the rally did not last long, as domestic equity indices plummeted in January due to factors such as fears of rate cut delay by the Fed, weaker quarterly results from HDFC Bank, a rise in US bond yields, profit booking, and foreign portfolio investor outflows. Experts suggest that short-term volatility should not worry retail investors. It is important for investors to have a long-term vision and not try to time the market.</description>

			<title>Why big animals got smaller, even before climate change</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-big-animals-got-smaller-even-before-climate-change-9116023/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a study on the evolution of animal sizes over time, challenging the existing theory known as Cope's Rule. The research, led by Shovonlal Roy from the University of Reading, suggests that animal size changes are influenced by competition for resources and the risk of extinction due to environmental factors. The study found three scenarios affecting body size: animals growing larger when competition is less, some becoming larger before going extinct, and species shrinking when competition is high. It also notes that many species, including polar bears, have become smaller in recent times due to rapid climate change adaptation. The study was published in the journal Communications Biology. The article concludes with a brief mention of an upcoming IPL 2024 cricket match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals.</description>

			<title>China’s population fell for the second year in a row in 2023. But why?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-population-fall-explained-reasons-significance-9115917/</link>
			<description>In 2023, China experienced a population decline for the second consecutive year, with 11.1 million deaths and 9 million births. This demographic shift led to India surpassing China as the world's most populous nation. The Chinese government reported a total population of 1.4 billion, highlighting a trend of decreasing Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which stood at 1.3 births per woman in the 2020 Census, significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. 

The decline in TFR is attributed to the legacy of the One-child policy introduced in 1980 to boost economic growth, which was later questioned for its necessity and effectiveness compared to voluntary birth planning campaigns in neighboring East Asian countries. Despite the end of the One-child policy in 2016 and the allowance for up to three children in 2021, population growth goals remain unmet, influenced by factors such as women's education, employment, societal pressures, and the high cost of raising children.

The aging population is growing, with those aged 60 and older increasing, and life expectancy rising due to advanced healthcare. This demographic shift necessitates greater investment in elderly care and may place additional pressure on the younger population to support the aging demographic. Amidst slower economic growth, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of promoting family values and policies to address the aging population challenge. The article concludes with unrelated content about Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Sanjay Dutt, which is not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>What is Boeing’s India Engineering and Technology Center, which PM Modi will inaugurate in Bengaluru?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pm-modi-boeing-bietc-bengaluru-9115940/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Boeing's largest investment facility outside the USA in Bengaluru, the Boeing India Engineering and Technology Center (BIETC), which represents an investment of Rs 1,600 crore over a 43-acre campus. The BIETC aims to be a hub for collaboration with India's startup, private, and government sectors, focusing on developing next-generation aerospace and defense products and services. 

The center also launched the Boeing Sukanya Program to encourage more Indian women to enter the aviation sector, offering STEM education opportunities, scholarships for pilot training, and creating STEM Labs at 150 locations. BIETC plans to employ a diverse engineering workforce of over 3,000, utilizing technologies like AI/ML, IoT, Cloud, and Additive Manufacturing.

Boeing is partnering with the Indian armed forces to support the defense sector and Aatmanirbhar Bharat. It has announced 107 job openings in India, with 97 positions in Bengaluru across various domains. Additionally, Boeing India has invited applications for the BUILD program to foster innovation among university students and startups.

The company collaborates with seven incubators across India for the BUILD program and has a strong supply chain with over 300 local companies, contributing to the manufacturing of parts for Apache helicopters and the 737 aircraft family. Boeing's sourcing from India is approximately $1 billion annually, and it employs over 6,000 people in India, with an extended workforce of 13,000 through its supply chain partners.</description>

			<title>Somnath: A brief history of the temple, and why Nehru opposed the President inaugurating it</title>

			<description>The article discusses the historical and political significance of the Somnath temple, juxtaposed with the recent inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It highlights the temple's turbulent history, including attacks and reconstructions, and the British narrative framing it as a symbol of Hindu victimization by Muslims. Post-independence, the reconstruction of Somnath was a contentious issue, with Nehru opposing government involvement in religious affairs, emphasizing secularism.

			<title>Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo interview: ‘India’s policy frame is not focused on inequality’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/abhijit-banerjee-and-esther-duflo-interview-indias-policy-frame-is-not-focused-on-inequality-9114522/</link>
			<description>The article features a conversation with economists Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee discussing the challenges of policy-making in the absence of reliable data, particularly in India. They highlight the importance of credible and politically insulated surveys for formulating appropriate policy responses. The discussion touches upon the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and Public Distribution System (PDS), suggesting that they have had a positive impact on poverty alleviation, although the effectiveness of other targeted schemes remains unclear due to lack of data.

The conversation also delves into the issue of inequality and social mobility, emphasizing the need for public discourse on these topics. They argue that the lack of focus on inequality in national policy frameworks could lead to a crisis of social mobility, as the rich are able to invest more in their children's education, creating an unfair advantage. The economists suggest that improving educational outcomes, particularly in government schools, is crucial for addressing these issues.

Furthermore, they discuss the challenges in secondary and post-secondary education, including pedagogical approaches that suppress curiosity and the counterproductive obsession with government jobs in India. They propose that the government could create more jobs by offering different terms of employment and rethinking the structure of government employment.

Lastly, the article touches on the issue of malnutrition in India, with a particular focus on the low protein consumption and the need for increased awareness and dietary changes to address this problem. The economists conclude that while there is no single solution to these complex issues, it is essential to continue exploring and implementing strategies that can lead to positive change.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: ASER’s 2023 survey results show gaps in learning; tech access is an avenue beyond schools</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-gaps-in-learning-persist-but-access-to-tech-offers-avenues-beyond-physical-school-9114524/</link>
			<description>The ASER 2023 'Beyond Basics' survey by NGO Pratham focused on 14-to-18-year-olds in rural India, assessing their ability to apply reading and math skills to daily life, their aspirations, and digital literacy. Conducted across 28 districts in 26 states, the survey found that:

- **30%** of youths are working, often for their parents, but do not see it as their future career.
- **One in four** cannot read a Std II-level text fluently in their regional language, with girls outperforming boys.
- Over **half** struggle with basic division, while **57%** can read English sentences, and **73%** of those understand the meaning.
- Boys generally have better arithmetic and English reading skills and greater access to smartphones.
- **90%** of households have smartphones, with **95%** of boys and **90%** of girls able to use them.
- Boys outperform girls in digital tasks, which improve with education and reading proficiency.
- Two-thirds use smartphones for educational activities, while **80%** use them for entertainment.
- The survey highlights the importance of basic skills for daily tasks and the potential for digital technology to overcome educational barriers.

The findings suggest a need for more flexible educational policies to accommodate various learning opportunities and leverage technology to enhance skill development beyond traditional schooling. Dr. Rukmini Banerjee, CEO of Pratham, emphasizes the role of schools as platforms for diverse learning experiences.

			<title>Black Wednesday: What led to a market crash of 2.23%?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/black-wednesday-what-led-to-a-market-crash-of-2-23-9114390/</link>
			<description>The Indian stock market experienced a significant decline of 2.23% on Wednesday, influenced by the US Federal Reserve's indication that interest rate cuts would be postponed until a sustained decrease in inflation is observed. This, coupled with rising US bond yields and a sharp drop in HDFC Bank shares by 8.16% due to disappointing third-quarter results, led to widespread sell-offs. The Sensex and Nifty fell by 1,628.01 points and 460.35 points, respectively, with banking stocks being the hardest hit. Market analysts attribute the sell-off to various factors, including the Federal Reserve's less urgent stance on rate cuts, higher bond yields, and overvaluation concerns in the Indian stock market. Despite positive economic indicators and corporate earnings, the elevated valuations prompted suggestions for a market correction and a shift towards fixed income investments. Additionally, domestic political developments involving the Election Commission and allegations of misuse of public office by a political leader's spouse were noted.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/sensex-nifty-fall-9113307/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant drop in India's domestic equity indices, which fell over 1.7% due to both global and local factors. Globally, comments from a US Federal Reserve official suggested a cautious approach to interest rate cuts, contrary to market expectations of a reduction starting in March. This led to concerns that anticipated sharp rate cuts may not occur, affecting bond yields and potentially dragging down global equity markets.

Domestically, the Indian market is dealing with overvalued stock prices, particularly in the mid and small-cap sectors, which may necessitate a correction. Despite strong economic performance and corporate earnings, the high valuations have raised the possibility of profit booking and a shift of investments to fixed income.

The article also mentions a political development where the Election Commission of India transferred an official due to allegations of misuse of public office during elections. The summary omits unrelated content as per your request.</description>

			<title>Who are the Jaish al-Adl terrorist group, whose bases Iran has destroyed in Pakistan?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/jaish-al-adl-bases-iran-destroyed-pakistan-9113093/</link>
			<description>Iranian forces conducted a cross-border operation into Pakistan's Balochistan, targeting the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, which Iran accuses of terrorism. The strikes, which hit two alleged strongholds of the group, resulted in civilian casualties, including the death of two children. Pakistan condemned the airspace violation and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires. Jaish al-Adl, active since around 2013, has been involved in attacks against Iranian security forces and has been linked to the older Jundallah organization. The group, which operates across the Iran-Pakistan border region, aims to fight for the rights of the Baloch people, a marginalized ethnic minority in both countries. The DNI of the United States has listed several attacks attributed to Jaish al-Adl, highlighting their tactics and weaponry. The ongoing conflict reflects broader tensions between Iran and Pakistan over the handling of Baloch insurgents.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking: 3 main concerns global investors have about Indian economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/global-investors-concerns-indian-economy-9112774/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's economic growth and the factors influencing it. It highlights India's GDP growth, which has surpassed expectations by growing over 7%, making it a standout economy when most developed countries are facing recession. India's growth is contrasted with China's economic slowdown and the geopolitical shift towards closer ties with the US.

The article identifies India's large population and potential as a domestic market as key advantages for attracting global investment. However, it also points out concerns regarding India's economic health, particularly the weak "private consumption demand" among low- and medium-income segments, which has been a persistent issue since before the Covid pandemic.

The government's role in driving investment demand is acknowledged, with public capital expenditure (capex) reaching an 18-year high. However, the reliance on government spending raises questions about the sustainability of this growth if private consumption does not increase.

The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) hawkish stance on interest rates due to inflation concerns is mentioned as a potential obstacle to economic growth. The article suggests that high interest rates could dampen consumer demand and discourage business investment.

Despite these concerns, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about India's economic prospects, expecting a virtuous growth cycle driven by capex leading to job creation, income growth, and increased consumption activity. The article concludes with two risks to this optimism: potential electoral reversals for the current government and geopolitical tensions affecting global trade and investment flows. The summary omits unrelated content and advertisements.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: Did we know 2023 was going to be the warmest year? Why climate warnings need to improve</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/2023-warmest-year-why-climate-warnings-need-to-improve-9112389/</link>
			<description>The year 2023 was the warmest on record, with each day being more than 1℃ above average. The future is uncertain, and the information provided by the climate community is not actionable at local levels. The warming trend is expected to continue in 2024, but the location and intensity of climate-related events may vary. Factors like reduced sulphate aerosols, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires likely contributed to the record warming. El Niño is forecasted to dissipate, and a La Niña may emerge in 2024, which could absorb heat from the atmosphere. It is challenging to predict the impact of global warming on the Cold Tongue region. Early warnings are crucial for crisis management, especially for food, water, energy, and transportation. Location-specific outlooks are necessary to plan for events like erratic monsoons, heatwaves, and fog episodes.</description>

			<title>What is ‘prior approval’, and why is it needed before investigating public officials accused of corruption?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-prior-approval-and-why-is-it-needed-before-investigating-public-officials-accused-of-corruption-9112409/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court issued a **split verdict** on former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's plea regarding an FIR in the alleged skill development scam. Justices Aniruddha Bose and Bela M Trivedi disagreed on the necessity of 'previous approval' from the state government for the AP CID to conduct an inquiry. The debate centers around whether approval is needed for offenses committed before or after 2018, when the requirement was introduced.

The article also discusses the legal history of the 'previous approval' requirement, including its introduction in 2003, its striking down in 2014, and subsequent amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act. The NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation challenged the constitutionality of this requirement, arguing it protects corrupt officials.

The Supreme Court has previously ruled on the retrospective application of this requirement, notably in the case of CBI v R R Kishore. Additionally, the article mentions the case of former Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana, where it was opined that no prior approval was needed to lodge an FIR against him.

Lastly, the article touches on the anticipation among Congress leaders for the candidate announcements for the Nehru-Gandhi seats and mentions political activities by PM Modi and AAP's Sunita Kejriwal. However, these details seem unrelated to the main legal discussion.</description>

			<title>A passenger attacked a pilot. How are airlines expected to respond?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/passenger-attacked-pilot-indigo-airlines-response-9112072/</link>
			<description>IndiGo is in the process of adding a passenger to the no-fly list after an assault on a pilot due to a flight delay in Delhi. The passenger's behavior is being addressed according to the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) for handling such incidents. The DGCA has emphasized the importance of reporting disruptive behavior to ensure operational safety. Airlines must inform passengers about potential arrest for unruly behavior, which includes a range of actions from consuming alcohol to endangering aircraft safety.

In the recent incident at Delhi's IGI Airport, the passenger was handed over to airport security as the plane was grounded. If such behavior occurs mid-flight, the crew must assess and possibly land at the nearest airport to hand over the passenger to authorities.

Post-incident, airlines must refer the case to an internal committee, which decides on the ban duration within 30 days. The ban can be immediate for up to 30 days, pending the committee's decision. The DGCA maintains a No-Fly List, and airlines can extend bans based on the offense level, with a minimum of 2 years for the most severe cases.

Passengers can appeal bans to an Appellate Committee. The DGCA has noticed lapses in handling unruly passengers and advises training for airline staff to maintain safety and order. Airlines are also tasked with monitoring and preventing potentially unruly passengers from boarding. The rules highlight the need for early detection and courteous behavior from airline staff during such incidents.</description>

			<title>HC asks Centre to reconsider ITBP cop’s dismissal: Rules about govt jobs to those acquitted in serious cases</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/rules-about-govt-jobs-to-those-acquitted-in-serious-cases-9111984/</link>
			<description>The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Centre to reconsider the appointment of a man to the ITBP after his acquittal in a POCSO case. The court quashed a Home Ministry order that cancelled his appointment, stating there is no absolute bar on appointing individuals acquitted of moral turpitude. The case, "Deepak Kumar vs. Union of India," involved the petitioner's appointment cancellation after revealing his acquittal in a criminal case. The court highlighted the difference between honourable acquittals and those based on the benefit of doubt, emphasizing the need to examine the substance of acquittal judgments.

The law on appointing candidates with criminal cases was discussed, noting that employers must consider all relevant facts, including antecedents, before making a decision. The court ruled that the petitioner's honest disclosure of his criminal case should be considered, and his appointment should be reconsidered, as denying it would amount to indirect punishment for an offence he was acquitted of. The article also mentioned the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission due to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office. However, this part seems unrelated to the main legal discussion.</description>

			<title>Why the Tamil Nadu CM and Governor’s posts on Thiruvalluvar Day sparked a row, again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/tamil-nadu-cm-governor-thiruvalluvar-saffron-9111878/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the depiction of Thiruvalluvar, a philosopher-poet in Tamil Nadu, during the celebration of Thiruvalluvar Day. The Governor's office shared an image of Thiruvalluvar in saffron-colored clothes, which drew criticism from the ruling DMK party, accusing the governor of "saffronisation." The Chief Minister, on the other hand, shared an image of Thiruvalluvar in white robes. Thiruvalluvar is a revered figure in Tamil Nadu, and his teachings are considered essential by Tamilians, regardless of their religion. The article also mentions the historical ambiguity surrounding Thiruvalluvar's life and the various political groups that have shaped his depictions over time. The controversy is taking place in the context of recent archaeological findings that support the ancient history of Tamil Nadu.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/punganur-cows-modi-9111523/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated Pongal/Makar Sankranti by feeding Punganur cows at his residence. The Punganur, a dwarf breed from Andhra Pradesh, is the world's shortest humped cattle, making them suitable for domestic keeping. Their population, once near extinction with less than 3,000, has risen to 13,275 according to the 2019 Livestock Census. Efforts for their conservation include financial support from the Andhra Pradesh government and the establishment of Gokul Gram and the National Kamdhenu Breeding Centre for promoting indigenous breeds. The article also briefly mentions Harikishan Sharma, a Senior Assistant Editor at The Indian Express, who reports on governance and policy, and the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Is North Korea preparing for war in 2024?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/north-korea-war-kim-jong-un-analysis-9111272/</link>
			<description>In a recent policy speech, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un dismissed the possibility of peaceful reunification with South Korea, calling for an expansion of the country's nuclear arsenal and increased ballistic missile testing. He also announced plans to launch three new spy satellites and accused South Korea and the United States of preparing for invasion. The speech follows a year of record missile launches by North Korea, including a claimed nuclear-capable ICBM and a hypersonic ballistic missile.

Experts from 38 North and the Stimson Center have expressed concern that the security situation on the Korean Peninsula is the most dangerous since the Korean War, suggesting that Kim Jong Un may be considering war. They highlight a shift in North Korea's strategy, noting the regime's abandonment of its goal to normalize relations with the U.S. after the failed 2019 Hanoi summit. North Korea's current alignment with Russia and perception of U.S. global retreat are also mentioned.

However, other analysts, including those from Daito Bunka University and the University of Tokyo, view North Korea's war rhetoric with skepticism, suggesting it may be strategic posturing rather than an indication of imminent conflict. They argue that North Korea's alliances with China and Russia and the lack of internal dissent suggest that Kim Jong Un is acting rationally and may not be planning an actual attack. The article concludes with a caution against underestimating North Korea's potential for unexpected actions, while also questioning the logic behind the assumption that North Korea has no options other than war. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Why Kashmir and Ladakh are without snow this winter, its implications</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/kashmir-ladakh-without-snow-why-implications-9110841/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significant lack of snowfall in Kashmir, particularly in the tourist destination of Gulmarg, which has led to a decrease in tourist footfall and affected local businesses. The absence of snow is not only a concern for tourism but also impacts the local climate, agriculture, and water resources. The region has experienced an 80% rainfall deficit in December and no rainfall in January, with similar conditions in Ladakh.

The decline in snowfall is attributed to fewer western disturbance events and rising temperatures, both influenced by climate change. Western disturbances, which are crucial for winter precipitation in the Himalayas, have decreased in frequency and intensity, leading to reduced rainfall and snowfall. The El Niño phenomenon is also mentioned as a contributing factor to the deficit in precipitation.

The article highlights the consequences of reduced snowfall, including long-term effects like lower hydroelectricity generation, faster glacier melting, and impacts on drinking water supply due to less groundwater recharge. In the short term, it can lead to forest fires, agricultural drought, and reduced crop yields, particularly affecting winter crops and horticulture, which are vital to the local economy. The article suggests that climate change plays a significant role in these changes, as supported by various studies.</description>

			<title>What is the AP skill development scam — and how did the case reach the Supreme Court?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/ap-skill-development-scam-sc-9110727/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is set to decide on the quashing of a case against former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu related to a skill development scam. The scam involves the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC), which was accused of diverting Rs 241 crore to shell companies linked to Naidu and his son. Naidu, who was in custody for over a month, argues that the CID investigation lacked state government approval, making it procedurally unjust. He claims the case is politically motivated by the ruling party. Despite his plea being rejected by the High Court, Naidu has approached the Supreme Court. The State Government contends that the CBI's investigation, which began in 2017, predates the amendment requiring state approval. Naidu was granted bail but restricted from public commentary until November 28.

			<title>Warming up to climate change: As greenhouse gases occur naturally, why do emissions from human activities matter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/as-greenhouse-gases-occur-naturally-why-do-emissions-from-human-activities-matter-9110645/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the record-breaking global temperatures of 2023, which were the highest since records began in 1850. It explains the role of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, creating a blanket-like effect that warms the planet. The article emphasizes that while GHGs occur naturally and are essential for life, the problem lies in their increased concentration due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This rise in GHG levels has led to a spike in carbon dioxide concentration by about 48% since the pre-industrial era. The article also highlights the long-term impact of carbon emissions, with some remaining in the atmosphere for over a thousand years, causing irreversible warming. Additionally, it mentions human-made GHGs like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent GHGs contributing to the rapid warming of Earth. The increase in GHG levels is linked to the extreme weather events of 2023 and the year being the warmest on record. The article is part of a series explaining fundamental questions about climate change and its impact.</description>

			<title>Who are the shankaracharyas — and who was Adi Shankara?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/shankaracharyas-adi-shankara-ram-temple-9110633/</link>
			<description>The four shankaracharyas, who head the four Hindu mathas, have announced that they will not attend the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on January 22. While the seers from Dwarka and Sringeri have not given reasons, the shankaracharyas of the Joshimath and Puri mathas have cited their concerns. One of them expressed that there is no reason to rush the consecration before the completion of the temple. The shankaracharyas are religious teachers who belong to a line of teachers going back to Adi Shankara, an important figure in Hinduism. The mathas are believed to have been established by him, although there is little historical evidence prior to the 14th century. Adi Shankara is known for his contributions to Advaita Vedanta, a school of Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the unity of consciousness and ultimate reality. His mathas are seen as keepers of Hindu faith and traditions.</description>

			<title>Delays at Delhi airport: Apart from the fog, what else is causing the chaos</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/delhi-airport-delays-fog-what-else-is-causing-chaos-9110487/</link>
			<description>Flight operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi were heavily disrupted due to dense fog. Passengers experienced long delays, cancellations, and even physical altercations. The complex nature of airline operations, with multiple flights and crew serving different sectors, compounded the problems caused by fog. On Sunday, over 500 outbound flights were delayed and 87 were cancelled, while inbound flights faced delays and cancellations as well. The situation improved on Monday as visibility improved. The airport's runway maintenance and construction activity further worsened the situation. The cascading effect of disruptions was also seen at the Mumbai airport, despite being unaffected by fog. Airlines with dense networks and high aircraft and crew utilization levels were particularly affected. Delays and congestion led to passengers being stuck in aircraft for hours. The congestion also affected the parking availability for incoming aircraft. Flight crew exceeding their Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) due to delays and long hours of waiting can result in crew shortage for airlines.</description>

			<title>Top 10 trends of 2024: Your money, your leaders, your world</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/top-10-trends-of-2024-your-money-your-leaders-your-world-9109437/</link>
			<description>The article features a conversation between economist Prannoy Roy and investor Ruchir Sharma, discussing the top 10 economic trends for 2024. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Democracy's Big Year**: A global trend of anti-incumbency may lead to many leaders being voted out.
2. **Politicians vs. Investors**: Election years may see increased government spending, leading to higher budget deficits, which investors might oppose.
3. **Immigration Backlash**: While beneficial economically, increased immigration could fuel political backlash.
4. **Economic Slowdown**: A classical bust is unlikely, but a gradual economic slowdown is expected.
5. **Europe's Resilience**: Europe may bounce back due to high savings rates and having already absorbed interest rate shocks.
6. **China's Decline**: Capital is fleeing China amid geopolitical tensions and a shrinking population.
7. **Emerging Stars**: Countries like Mexico, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia are attracting investors as they de-risk from China.
8. **Dollar's Decline**: The U.S. dollar's decline could accelerate, continuing a historical trend.
9. **AI Hype Check**: The high expectations for AI stocks may face a reality check as monetization takes time.
10. **Movies vs. Politics**: Political agendas in movies are causing people to lose interest in cinema, contrasting with the popularity of cricket.

Sharma emphasizes that trends don't align with calendar years and that a mix of contrarian and predictable trends shapes the economic outlook. The conversation also touches on the implications of anti-incumbency, the role of immigration in developed countries, the potential for a slow economic downturn, the high valuation of India's stock market, Europe's potential for an economic surprise, China's waning economic dominance, the search for alternatives to the U.S. dollar, and the realistic expectations for AI's impact on the economy. The forecasts and analysis are credited to Sharma and his team at Breakout Capital. For more details, the full conversation can be viewed on their platform.</description>

			<title>Why Mumbai is sweltering this January: Three reasons</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-mumbai-is-sweltering-this-winter-three-reasons-9109305/</link>
			<description>Mumbai experienced its highest January day temperature in seven years at **35.7 degrees Celsius** on January 12, according to IMD data. This is close to the record of **37.3 degrees Celsius** from 2006. The Indian Express consulted meteorologists to explain this unusual heat during the winter month. The reasons include:

1. **Moist south easterly winds** replacing the typical dry northerly winds, leading to higher temperatures and discomfort.
2. The **absence of Western Disturbances**, which usually bring cooler weather.
3. The **El Niño effect**, which causes abnormal warming every two to seven years, making winters warmer and summers more severe.
4. **Warming of the north Arabian Sea**, which brings in warm winds and affects monsoon patterns due to global warming.

The maximum temperature is expected to stay between **32-33 degrees Celsius** for a few days before a slight decrease. The weather bureau predicts a gradual fall in temperatures over the Konkan-Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, and Marathwada regions, with no significant change in Vidarbha.</description>

			<title>Muizzu asks India to withdraw troops by March 15: Why are Indian soldiers in Maldives?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-are-indian-soldiers-in-maldives-9109278/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the request by Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu for India to withdraw its military personnel from the Maldives by March 15. The presence of Indian troops has been a point of contention, with a high-level core group established to negotiate the withdrawal. Despite the 'India Out' campaign suggesting a large Indian military presence, only 77 personnel are currently stationed there, primarily for training and operational support roles. The article details the specific assignments of these personnel, including helicopter and aircraft operations and maintenance.

The anti-India sentiment has been influenced by various factors, including recent presidential elections and narratives portraying the previous Maldivian Democratic Party as influenced by India. The current administration, seen as pro-China, has amplified these sentiments. Historical cooperation between India and the Maldives, particularly during a 1988 coup attempt, is acknowledged, but recent controversies have fueled suspicion. These include debates over Indian-gifted helicopters, perceived lack of transparency in bilateral dealings, reliance on India for maritime security, speculation about the size and purpose of a new police academy, and concerns over a harbour project potentially becoming an Indian naval base.

The article also briefly mentions an unrelated issue regarding the Election Commission of India's transfer of an official due to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office. This summary omits any advertisement or unrelated content from the original article.</description>

			<title>Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Lohri and more: Significance of these festivals, celebrated across India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/makar-sankranti-pongal-lohri-significance-rituals-9109065/</link>
			<description>Makar Sankranti, Pongal, and Magh Bihu are cultural celebrations held in different states of India on January 14. These festivals mark the transition from winter to warmer months and the beginning of longer days. Makar Sankranti follows the solar cycle and is celebrated almost on the same day every year. On this day, worshippers take a bath in sacred rivers, offer prayers to Lord Surya (Sun god), perform rituals, and break their fast during Punya Kaal. Regional variations exist in the way these festivals are celebrated. For example, in Tamil Nadu, the Pongal festival includes cleaning the house, making decorative kolam, and honoring the toil of bulls. In Karnataka, there is a tradition of eating a mixture of sesame seeds and jaggery and speaking good words. In northern India, sesame and jaggery ladoos or chikkis are distributed, and bonfires are organized. Kite-flying and sky lanterns are also part of the celebrations in certain regions.</description>

			<title>What December inflation data tells us, what it means for budget, monetary policy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-december-inflation-data-tell-us-9109022/</link>
			<description>India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate reached 5.7% in December, marking a significant update before the Union Budget presentation and the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee meeting. CPI inflation reflects the rate at which consumer prices change, with a current basket of 299 items. The index, with a base year of 2012, is calculated using price data from across the country.

The CPI comprises six main components, with food articles having the highest weight at 45%. The year-on-year (YoY) inflation rate has risen towards the end of 2023, while the month-on-month (MoM) data indicates deflation in December. A notable increase in food prices, especially vegetables, pulses, and spices, has driven the YoY inflation up.

Analysts predict a decrease in inflation rates in the coming months due to the Kharif harvest and government interventions. The financial year's inflation is expected to average 5.5%, with March 2024 projected at 5%. Despite the headline inflation, core inflation has been decreasing.

The recent inflation data suggests that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may delay interest rate cuts, potentially until August 2024. This is due to the impact of food price shocks on policy goals. High inflation poses challenges for fiscal policymakers, especially in an election year, adding uncertainty to budget planning and political strategies. The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission due to alleged misuse of public office. However, this information is unrelated to the main content of the article.</description>

			<title>Hydroxychloroquine: How a new study links the COVID ‘cure’ to 17,000 deaths</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hydroxychloroquine-covid-medicine-new-study-9108866/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, I can summarize that hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, was briefly promoted as a potential treatment for COVID-19. However, researchers have linked it to an increased mortality rate of up to 11%. The World Health Organization conducted trials but found no clinical improvements in patients. It is important to note that repurposing drugs in a panic, without sufficient evidence, can be hazardous. While hydroxychloroquine is generally safe, its effects need to be evaluated differently when given preventively to a large number of healthy people. The drug was hailed as a "miracle cure" by some, including former US President Donald Trump, but its use was cautioned against by the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. Small-scale studies reported side effects, but larger studies are needed to determine the precise cause. A recent systematic review linked hydroxychloroquine to 17,000 deaths, but there is no consensus yet as different studies may have used conflicting methods. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders like lupus. It is important to consult healthcare professionals for accurate and up-to-date information on the use of hydroxychloroquine.</description>

			<title>Darjeeling zoo’s success with snow leopards: Why wild cats are fussy breeders</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/snow-leopards-darjeeling-zoo-wild-cats-fussy-breeders-9108416/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges and intricacies of breeding big cats like snow leopards and cheetahs in captivity. The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling has been successful in breeding 77 snow leopards since the 1980s, a notable achievement given the difficulties associated with captive breeding. The article explains that breeding big cats is complex due to their temperaments, physiology, and genetics, which often lead to erratic breeding patterns. Tragic incidents have occurred when attempts to breed certain species, like clouded leopards and tigers, have resulted in the death of one of the animals.

To improve breeding success, zoos must reduce stress triggers and address genetic bottlenecks caused by small population sizes. Induced ovulation in cats, where ovulation occurs only during mating, presents additional challenges. Artificial insemination techniques have had mixed results, with some success in tigers and jaguars but less so in cheetahs. The article also touches on the unique social structures of big cats, particularly cheetahs, and the importance of mimicking natural conditions to encourage breeding.

Despite these efforts, breeding success remains low, especially for cheetahs, due to genetic uniformity and other reproductive issues. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of captive breeding programs as a safeguard for species with declining wild populations, like the snow leopard, which is now housed in 160 zoos worldwide. The success of the Darjeeling zoo contributes to the global effort to preserve these species.</description>

			<title>Congress and Ram Mandir: Brief history of the party’s flip-flops on Ayodhya temple</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/congress-ram-mandir-ayodhya-flip-flop-9108154/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Congress Party's decision to skip the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, citing the event's timing as politically motivated by the BJP and RSS. It traces the history of the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, highlighting the Congress's fluctuating stance aimed at appeasing both Hindu and Muslim communities, which has often resulted in gaining the support of neither.

The narrative recounts the 1980s, when the RSS and VHP declared the temple construction a matter of faith, urging the government to hand over the land to the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust. The BJP, initially outside the legal framework, later supported court resolution or mutual dialogue. The article also touches on the Congress's inability to manage the communal tensions, leading to the opening of the Babri Masjid locks and subsequent riots.

The piece further explores the political shifts in Uttar Pradesh, with the Congress losing ground to the BJP and other parties, and the eventual demolition of the Babri Masjid, which did not benefit the Congress. The article concludes with an acknowledgment of Shyamlal Yadav's investigative journalism contributions and a brief mention of filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra's reflections on his career and collaborations. The unrelated content and advertisements have been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Who is William Lai, the new president of Taiwan?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-is-william-lai-ching-te-new-president-taiwan-9108203/</link>
			<description>William Lai, also known as Lai Ching-te, from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won the presidential election despite China's warnings. Lai, the current vice president, secured around 40% of the vote share. He grew up in a poor coal-mining village and pursued medicine before entering politics. China considers him a "separatist" due to his views on Taiwan's sovereignty. Lai aims to protect Taiwan from China's interference and maintain peace while strengthening ties with the United States and other democracies. The reaction from China and potential tensions remain uncertain.</description>

			<title>How GM mustard was developed, why the question of its approval has now reached Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gm-mustard-supreme-court-9107917/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has raised questions regarding the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee's (GEAC) decision to approve the environmental release of a genetically modified (GM) mustard hybrid, DMH-11, without considering reports from the Technical Experts Committee (TEC) on biosafety. The GEAC, under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, is responsible for assessing proposals for releasing GM organisms into the environment. The court is hearing pleas for a moratorium on releasing GMOs until a thorough biosafety protocol is established and made public.

The transgenic mustard hybrid DMH-11, developed by Delhi University's Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), incorporates two genes from a soil bacterium to enable hybridization in mustard, which is naturally self-pollinating. This technology has reportedly led to a 28% yield increase over traditional varieties in field trials. The GEAC has recommended the environmental release of DMH-11 for seed production and testing, as well as its parental lines for developing new hybrids.

Concerns have been raised about GM mustard's potential impact on manual labor due to herbicide tolerance and on pollinators like honey bees. However, the GEAC references reports suggesting no adverse effects on pollinators. The approval of GM mustard may also be motivated by India's high edible oil import costs, which reached $18.99 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2022. The article also mentions an unrelated political issue regarding the transfer of a government official due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>South Korea passes Bill to ban production and sale of dog meat: Why now, what the Bill says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/south-korea-passes-bill-ban-dog-meat-9107858/</link>
			<description>The South Korean parliament has passed a bill to ban the production and sale of dog meat by 2027, marking a significant shift in a country where dog meat has been a traditional source of protein. The bill, which does not criminalize consumption, was driven by changing attitudes towards dogs, increased pet ownership, and growing concern for animal welfare. A survey showed that a majority of South Koreans are against consuming dog meat and support the ban. The bill includes fines and imprisonment for violations and requires businesses involved in the dog meat trade to submit phase-out plans. South Korea will join other Asian regions that have banned the dog meat trade. In India, the dog meat trade is legal, but some regions have attempted to impose bans, with varying success. The article also mentions an unrelated political issue in India regarding the transfer of a government official.</description>

			<title>Voluntary freezing of trading accounts: How will SEBI’s new norms safeguard investors?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/voluntary-freezing-of-trading-sebi-investors-9107735/</link>
			<description>Starting July this year, investors in India will have the ability to freeze or block their trading accounts if they suspect any suspicious activity. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has instructed stock brokerages to establish a framework for this by April 1 and implement it from July 1, 2024. Currently, investors can only voluntarily block or freeze their demat accounts (which hold financial instruments electronically), not their trading accounts (which execute trades in the stock market). SEBI has recognized the need for a facility to block trading accounts, similar to blocking ATM or credit cards, to protect investors from potential fraud. The guidelines will be developed by the Brokers' Industry Standards Forum in consultation with SEBI and stock exchanges. The guidelines will include processes for clients to request the blocking of their trading accounts and the actions trading members need to take upon receiving such requests. Stock exchanges must ensure compliance by trading members and submit a compliance report to SEBI by August 31, 2024.</description>

			<title>ICJ genocide case: What Israel argued on Day 2</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/icj-genocide-case-israel-south-africa-gaza-9107252/</link>
			<description>In the ongoing ICJ proceedings, Israel's defense against South Africa's genocide accusations is centered on the claim of self-defense in response to Hamas's attacks. Israel's legal team, including Tal Becker and Malcolm Shaw, argued that their actions in Gaza were necessary to protect Israeli citizens and did not constitute genocide. They highlighted Israel's humanitarian aid to Gaza and contended that any breaches of conflict rules would be addressed by Israel's legal system. The team also suggested that South Africa's close ties with Hamas influenced its allegations and that there was no existing dispute between the two nations. Conversely, South Africa's representatives invoked Nelson Mandela's legacy, arguing that Israel's actions exceeded self-defense and amounted to genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, calling for urgent provisional measures to protect them. The article also briefly mentions an unrelated issue regarding the Election Commission of India's actions against Sujata R Karthikeyan for alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>How China wants to sway Taiwan’s election</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-china-wants-to-sway-taiwan-election-9107294/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the heightened tensions in Taiwan due to a satellite launch by China, which was initially mistaken for a missile, causing alarm. This incident occurred shortly before Taiwan's presidential and parliamentary elections, raising concerns about Beijing's intentions. The main opposition candidate, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang (KMT), is favored by Beijing over the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) candidate, Lai Ching-te, who supports Taiwan's independence. The article suggests that China's Communist Party (CCP) is using various strategies, including military posturing and economic threats, to influence public opinion in Taiwan and prevent Lai from becoming president. The CCP and KMT share a pragmatic relationship, both opposing an independent Taiwan and advocating for "One China," albeit with different interpretations. Economic ties between China and Taiwan remain strong, despite political tensions and trade restrictions. The article also highlights the potential consequences of a war across the Taiwan Strait and the ongoing virtual war of disinformation, with Beijing's cyber army suspected of spreading fake news to influence Taiwanese voters. The situation is complex, with the CCP's ultimate goal being the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, a stance that has shaped its actions and policies towards the island. The article concludes with a mention of unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India's actions, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>What are Iowa caucuses and why are they significant?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iowa-caucuses-significance-9107183/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of the Iowa caucuses in the American presidential election process. Traditionally, both Republicans and Democrats have used these caucuses to begin selecting their presidential nominees. However, in 2024, only the Republican caucuses are being held, as the Democrats have already largely settled on President Joe Biden as their nominee and have shifted their primary votes to other states.

The article explains that caucuses and primaries are methods used by states to choose party nominees, with primaries being government-run elections and caucuses being party-held meetings where voters openly show support for candidates. The Republican caucuses in Iowa are scheduled for January 15, while the Democratic caucuses will be conducted by mail from January 12 to March 5. South Carolina and Nevada will be the first states to hold Democratic primaries.

The piece highlights that Iowa's caucuses have been the first in the nation since the 1970s, offering an early indication of candidate support. However, Iowa's influence is questioned due to its small population and the fact that recent caucus winners have not secured the Republican nomination. The article also notes a shift in the Democratic primary calendar to involve more racially diverse states earlier in the process, as advocated by President Biden.

Lastly, the article mentions that Donald Trump leads the Republican candidates in Iowa, according to polls, and touches on the criticism of the caucus system for favoring candidates with strong, active bases and being inconvenient for some voters. It concludes with a brief unrelated note about an Indian politician's travel on a diplomatic passport. The summary omits any advertisement or unrelated content as per your request.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-uk-strike-houthi-yemen-middle-east-9106645/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The United States and the United Kingdom conducted strikes against Houthi groups in Yemen on January 11. These strikes were in response to the Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea, a vital maritime trade route. The Houthis have been attacking ships in protest of the Israeli military's actions in Gaza. The strikes targeted multiple Houthi locations and were supported by several countries. The Red Sea attacks have raised concerns about the conflict involving other countries and groups. The peace negotiations in Yemen may also be affected by these recent developments.</description>

			<title>The story of Nashik’s Kalaram temple, visited by Modi — and by Ambedkar many decades ago</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/nashik-kala-ram-temple-modi-ambedkar-9106708/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Kalaram Mandir in Nashik after a roadshow, a day after Uddhav Thackeray announced he would visit the temple on the consecration day of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The Kalaram Mandir is significant for being the site of Babasaheb Ambedkar's historic agitation for Dalit temple entry rights. Panchavati, where the temple is located, is integral to the Ramayana, as Lord Ram, Sita, and Lakshman spent time there during their exile. The temple's name derives from the black statue of Lord Ram it houses. Built in 1792, the temple has architectural features symbolizing aspects of the Ramayana and Hindu beliefs. The temple also commemorates the Dalit satyagraha led by Ambedkar and Sane Guruji in 1930, demanding access for Dalits to Hindu temples, which continued until 1935. The temple remains a place of historical and religious significance, drawing thousands of devotees daily.</description>

			<title>Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi dead: Who was the 26/11 attacks conspirator and LeT leader?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hafiz-abdul-salam-bhuttavi-let-9106693/</link>
			<description>Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi, a founding member of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and a key conspirator in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, has been confirmed dead by the United Nations Security Council. He passed away due to cardiac arrest on May 29, 2023, while in the custody of the Pakistani government. Bhuttavi, who was born in 1946, played a significant role in establishing LeT's base in Lahore and served as the acting chief on multiple occasions when Hafiz Saeed, the chief and mastermind behind the Mumbai attack, was detained. He was also involved in issuing fatwas and preparing terrorists for the Mumbai attacks. Bhuttavi had been serving a 16-year sentence in a terror financing case and was in prison since 2019.</description>

			<title>What happened in Bhutan’s elections — and are the results a win for India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bhutans-elections-india-china-9106431/</link>
			<description>The People's Democratic Party (PDP) and its leader Tshering Tobgay emerged victorious in the runoff election in Bhutan, defeating the Bhutan Tendrel Party (BTP). The PDP secured 30 seats in the national legislature, with a significant voter turnout. Bhutan's elections have been relatively fair and peaceful, despite the recent transition to a parliamentary democracy. However, there are concerns about media censorship, discrimination against minorities, and lack of accountability in the political system. The election took place amidst economic challenges, including a struggling tourism industry and high youth unemployment. Tobgay focused his campaign on addressing these issues and attracting investment to boost the economy. India, Bhutan's largest donor and ally, plays an important role in Bhutan's economic recovery, while China's influence in the region remains a point of contention. Tobgay is considered pro-India, strengthening India's strategic interests in the area. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Tobgay on his victory and expressed a desire to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries.</description>

			<title>Gunmen hold journalists hostage during TV programme: What is happening in Ecuador?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-happening-in-ecuador-9105826/</link>
			<description>Ecuador is experiencing a surge in violence and lawlessness, attributed to the shifting dynamics of drug trafficking and economic challenges. Once a relatively peaceful nation, it now has the fourth-highest homicide rate in Latin America. The situation worsened after Colombia's peace accord with FARC, which led to drug networks moving into Ecuador, making it a key transit point for cocaine. The pandemic exacerbated economic difficulties, driving the youth towards involvement in drug-related violence.

The recent escape of Adolfo Macías Villamar, leader of the Los Choneros gang, from prison has sparked unrest. In response, President Daniel Noboa has launched the "Phoenix Plan," which includes establishing a new intelligence unit, arming security forces, building high-security prisons, and enhancing port and airport security, with a budget of $800 million, partially funded by the U.S. A 60-day state of emergency has been declared, allowing military patrols and a national curfew. Noboa's government, supported by a diverse coalition, also plans a referendum to propose tougher crime-fighting measures. This week, several violent incidents, including the brief capture of a TV station by masked gunmen and the kidnapping of police officers, have highlighted the escalating crisis.</description>

			<title>Genocide case against Israel: Who were the Amalek, whose mention by Netanyahu came up at the ICJ</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-were-the-amalek-netanyahu-gaza-israel-icj-9105643/</link>
			<description>The Amalekites were an ancient biblical nation mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical accounts, they were the first to attack the Jewish people after their escape from Egypt. The story of the Amalekites has been used by Israeli politicians to justify violence against Palestinians. The invocation of Amalek evokes collective memories of historical persecution and serves as a justification for brutal reprisals. For example, in 1994, an Israeli extremist named Bharuch Goldstein gunned down unarmed Palestinians, believing them to be the Amalekites. It is concerning that the identification of Palestinians with Amalekites has had deadly consequences.</description>

			<title>India-US trade policy meeting starts today: GSP, laptop import monitoring system on table</title>

			<description>India and the US will address various trade issues in their trade policy forum meeting. These include India's request for the restoration of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) revoked by former US President Donald Trump and the US's objection to India's laptop import monitoring system. The meeting is crucial as the US is India's largest trade partner, and India relies on US demand for export earnings. Closer trade ties could attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) and help resolve trade tensions. The US is concerned about India's monitoring system for laptop imports, questioning its purpose as a non-tariff measure. India also seeks a liberal visa regime and a totalisation agreement for social security benefits for Indian professionals working in the US.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mumbai-trans-harbour-link-across-the-sea-in-20-minutes-9105812/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, a 22 km bridge over the sea that connects Sewri and Chirle. The bridge, also known as Atal Setu Nhava Sheva Sea Link, will reduce travel time between the two locations to under 20 minutes. The project, which was conceptualized six decades ago, aims to improve connectivity in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and promote economic development. The bridge is expected to benefit commuters and facilitate greater integration of Navi Mumbai with other areas, including the under-construction Navi Mumbai International Airport. However, concerns remain regarding the toll fees and the lack of public transport facilities on the bridge.</description>

			<title>ICJ genocide case against Israel: What South Africa argued on Day 1</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/icj-genocide-case-israel-south-africa-9105662/</link>
			<description>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has begun hearings on South Africa's accusation that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. South Africa's case, initiated under the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, alleges that Israel's actions in Gaza violate Article 2 of the Convention, which defines genocide. The ICJ will first determine its jurisdiction and whether the acts fall under the Convention before making a ruling, which could take years.

South Africa seeks interim relief, requesting the ICJ to order Israel to halt military operations in Gaza. The court's decisions are binding but unenforceable, yet influential within the UN and international bodies.

The South African legal team, led by John Dugard, presented a detailed case, arguing that Israel's response to an attack on October 7, 2023, and its 76-year occupation of Palestinian territories, constitute genocidal acts. They claim that Israel's actions, including mass killings and causing bodily and mental harm, demonstrate a systematic pattern of conduct that infers genocide. The team also highlighted genocidal rhetoric by Israeli leaders as a violation of the Convention.

John Duggard emphasized that state parties to the Convention are obligated to prevent genocide, and South Africa is acting on behalf of the international community. The team argued for urgent provisional measures to protect Palestinians from irreparable harm due to Israel's actions.

In response to potential arguments from Israel, Vaughan Lowe clarified that South Africa cannot file a case against Hamas, as it is not a state party to the Genocide Convention. The summary focuses on the legal proceedings and arguments presented without including unrelated content.</description>

			<title>Taiwan votes on January 13: Amid tensions with China, why these polls are significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/taiwan-january-13-elections-primer-china-9105601/</link>
			<description>Taiwan is preparing for a pivotal presidential election on January 13, amidst high tensions with China and significant global attention. Initially anticipated as a straightforward win for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the race has tightened due to a surge from the Kuomintang (KMT) party. The election's central issues revolve around Taiwan's sovereignty and its relationship with China, which claims the island despite never having governed it and frequently demonstrates military presence in the Taiwan Strait.

The history of Taiwan's governance includes the establishment of the 'Republic of China' by Chinese nationalists in 1949, with initial support from the United States and the West. However, U.S. recognition shifted from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, leading to a policy of strategic ambiguity towards Taiwan, recognizing Beijing's 'one China' policy while maintaining ties with Taiwan.

Taiwan transitioned from KMT's authoritarian rule to democracy with its first direct presidential election in 1996, leading to multiple peaceful power transfers. The current President, Tsai Ing-wen, known for her firm stance on foreign policy and defense, is ineligible for re-election. The leading candidates for the presidency are Lai Ching-te from the DPP, Hou Yu-ih from the KMT, and Ko Wen-je from the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), each with distinct political backgrounds and views on Taiwan's independence and relations with China.

The election is framed differently by the parties: the DPP views it as a choice between democracy and autocracy, the KMT focuses on peace versus war, and the TPP presents it as new versus old politics. Despite China being Taiwan's largest trade partner, the Taiwanese identity is strengthening, with a growing number identifying solely as Taiwanese. The candidates agree on preserving Taiwan's de facto independence but differ in their approaches to alliances and dialogue with China.

China's influence attempts through disinformation and the recent crackdown in Hong Kong have heightened concerns in Taiwan. Additionally, the resilience of Ukraine against Russian aggression has inspired Taiwanese leaders about the potential of smaller militaries. Demographic shifts show an increasing number of Taiwanese identifying exclusively as such, with all presidential contenders being native Taiwanese, a first in the nation's history.</description>

			<title>How Indore came to be ranked India’s cleanest city, year after year</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indore-india-cleanest-city-reason-9105288/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. Indore has been ranked as the cleanest city in India for the seventh consecutive year in the Swachh Survekshan Awards 2023. The ranking is based on citizen feedback and field assessment. Indore achieved this by implementing a sustainable system of garbage collection, processing, and disposal. They made changes to the sanitation and waste collection system, popularized initiatives among citizens, and focused on segregation and disposal of waste. The city also cleared and treated legacy waste and constructed transfer stations. Efforts were made to install new toilets and dustbins, and citizens were encouraged to build better habits around cleanliness. The city also imposed fines for littering and other offenses to deter habitual offenders.</description>

			<title>Shinde faction ‘real Shiv Sena’: How the Maharashtra Speaker came to this decision</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/real-shiv-sena-how-the-maharashtra-speaker-decided-9105362/</link>
			<description>The Maharashtra Assembly Speaker declared the Eknath Shinde-led faction as the "real Shiv Sena," dismissing disqualification petitions against 54 MLAs from both factions. This decision followed the Supreme Court's directive for the Speaker to resolve the matter, considering the 1999 Shiv Sena constitution, party leadership structure, and legislative majority. The Speaker determined that the 1999 constitution was the official document, the 2018 leadership structure was not in line with it, and the Shinde faction held the legislative majority as of June 21, 2022. Discrepancies between the Speaker's findings and the Supreme Court's earlier rulings were noted, particularly regarding the appointment of the Chief Whip and the party leader. Allegations against the Shinde faction MLAs being untraceable and absent from a party meeting were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Counter petitions for disqualification of Uddhav Sena MLAs were also rejected. Uddhav Thackeray plans to challenge the Speaker's decision in the Supreme Court. The article also mentions unrelated content, which has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>How a TV show exposed Britain’s Post Office Scandal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/britain-post-office-scandal-rishi-sunak-9105139/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Horizon scandal, where over 900 British subpostmasters were wrongfully convicted of theft and fraud due to a faulty IT system implemented by the Post Office. The system, introduced in 1999, led to unexplained losses in accounts, for which the subpostmasters were held accountable. Despite early reports of flaws in the system, the Post Office denied any miscarriage of justice until a High Court ruling in 2019 acknowledged the system's defects. A TV docudrama, "Mr Bates vs the Post Office," heightened public awareness and outrage, prompting the government to act. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced legislation to overturn the convictions and a compensation package of GBP 75,000 for each affected individual, with a total of GBP 1 billion set aside. Legal experts have raised concerns about the precedent this legislation might set. Amidst public pressure, former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells has renounced her CBE title. An independent public inquiry and a police investigation are underway, with questions remaining about the missing money and accountability for those aware of the software issues.</description>

			<title>Australian Open 2024: How organisers hope adding extra day to slam will curb late night slugfests</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/australian-open-2024-dates-extra-day-explained-9104533/</link>
			<description>The Australian Open is introducing an extra day to its schedule to alleviate player fatigue and avoid late-night finishes. This change comes after weather-induced delays in previous tournaments led to a backlog of matches. The new schedule will feature two matches during the day sessions at the main courts, maintaining two for the night sessions, but reducing the likelihood of the day session running late. The tournament will now span 15 days, with 52 sessions across three arenas, and three days dedicated to first-round matches. This adjustment aims to provide a more viewer and player-friendly experience. Last year, a match between Andy Murray and Thanasi Kokkinakis ended at 4:05 am, highlighting the issue of late finishes. The Australian Open will be the second Grand Slam to extend to 15 days, following the French Open. Other Grand Slams, except Wimbledon, also have night sessions, but Wimbledon imposes an 11 pm curfew. Discussions about reducing night session matches to one were deemed unfair to ticket-holding spectators. John McEnroe criticized the extension as a "money grab," but acknowledged potential benefits for players' pensions and retirements. The Australian Open has also introduced a Courtside Bar for an enhanced fan experience. The unrelated content regarding the Election Commission of India has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Israel withdraws some troops from Gaza: Why, what it means for Hamas conflict</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-withdraws-troops-from-gaza-9103920/</link>
			<description>The article discusses Israel's military strategy in the Gaza Strip, detailing a shift from a large-scale campaign to a more targeted approach against Hamas. This transition, expected to be completed by the end of January, was confirmed as the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to arrive in Israel for discussions on postwar governance and aid in Gaza.

The withdrawal of some Israeli troops is partly to alleviate the economic strain caused by mobilizing over 350,000 reservists after the October 7 Hamas attack. The US has urged Israel to reduce the intensity of its attacks and adopt a more surgical strategy. Concurrently, tensions with Hezbollah have escalated, with frequent exchanges of fire since the conflict's onset.

The exact number of Israeli soldiers being withdrawn is not disclosed, but it includes reservists from at least two brigades. Despite the troop reduction, Israel plans to continue its operations in Gaza, focusing on southern and central regions, with a senior official indicating a six-month campaign.

The article also highlights the humanitarian impact, with nearly 22,000 casualties in Gaza, mostly women and children, and significant displacement of residents. The final part of the article, unrelated to the conflict, mentions political developments in India regarding the Nehru-Gandhi seats and campaigning activities by Indian politicians.</description>

			<title>India-Maldives ties: Amid row, why the two countries need each other and what is at stake</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-and-maldives-old-ties-new-tensions-9104123/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the strained relations between India and the Maldives due to recent political developments. The Maldives' new government under President Mohamed Muizzu has taken actions that have caused diplomatic tensions with India, such as asking for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel and scrapping a water survey pact. Additionally, undiplomatic comments by Maldivian ministers towards Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have led to their dismissal and calls in India to boycott the Maldives as a tourist destination.

The article emphasizes the historical and strategic importance of the Maldives to India, highlighting the close ties built over six decades, including India's role in Maldivian defence training, maritime security, and economic support. India has been a significant provider of everyday essentials, medicines, and infrastructure materials to the Maldives, and is a key education destination for Maldivian students.

The strategic location of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean is crucial for India's maritime security, especially in light of China's growing influence in the region. The article suggests that it is in the best interest of both nations to resolve current tensions and maintain cooperation for mutual benefit. India's assistance to the Maldives during crises, such as the 2004 tsunami and the Covid-19 pandemic, underscores the depth of their relationship.

The article concludes that despite the current diplomatic challenges, the longstanding partnership between India and the Maldives is vital and should be preserved through dialogue and mutual understanding.</description>

			<title>Maharashtra Speaker gives verdict on Shiv Sena split: what was the case before him</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/maharastra-shiv-sena-split-speaker-disqualification-9103871/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political turmoil within the Shiv Sena party in Maharashtra, India. The Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly, Rahul Narwekar, declared the Eknath Shinde faction as the legitimate Shiv Sena, holding the majority support of the party's MLAs. This verdict came after a split in the party in 2022, leading to 34 petitions filed by both factions seeking disqualification of each other's MLAs.

The conflict began when Uddhav Thackeray's faction joined the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, causing dissent within the party. On June 21, 2022, Shinde and 34 MLAs rebelled, leading to Uddhav's resignation and Shinde becoming the Chief Minister with BJP support.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Speaker should rely on the party's original constitution submitted to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and not decide based on the majority in the Assembly. The Speaker's decision to recognize the Shinde faction and dismiss disqualification petitions against both factions was seen as further legitimizing the Shinde Sena as a political party. The Uddhav faction is likely to challenge this in court, while the Shinde faction celebrates the decision. The article also mentions a separate issue involving the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department due to allegations of misuse of public office.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-south-africa-israel-international-court-of-justice-9103758/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is holding a hearing to decide whether to order "provisional measures" in a case filed by South Africa against Israel for alleged violations of the Genocide Convention in relation to Palestinians in Gaza. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and settles legal disputes between states. The Genocide Convention is an international human rights treaty that defines genocide and codifies the crime for the first time. South Africa is asking for urgent relief to protect the rights of the Palestinian people and prevent further harm. The court will make a provisional measures order within weeks, which will be binding on all states. Israel has called the case "baseless," while Palestine and several other countries have welcomed it. This is not the first case the ICJ has heard under the Genocide Convention.</description>

			<title>Centre and Opposition spar over rejection of R-Day tableaux: How tableaux are chosen for the Republic Day parade</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/centre-opposition-spar-over-rejection-of-r-day-tableaux-9103468/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the selection of tableaux for India's Republic Day parade. Several states, including Punjab, Karnataka, Delhi, and West Bengal, have expressed dissatisfaction after their tableaux were rejected by the Centre. The selection process, as detailed by the Ministry of Defence, involves a committee of experts who evaluate submissions based on various factors such as visual appeal, theme, and cultural relevance. This year's overarching themes are "Viksit Bharat" and "Bharat: Loktantra ki Matrika". The article also mentions that the tableaux must adhere to guidelines like using eco-friendly materials and incorporating modern technologies. Reasons for rejection may include non-alignment with the broader theme, as was the case with Punjab and West Bengal's proposals. Karnataka was reportedly not selected this year due to its consistent participation in the past, while Delhi's exclusion remains unexplained. Additionally, the article briefly touches on a political issue involving the Election Commission and the transfer of a BJD leader's spouse.</description>

			<title>Complete organ transplant process in 6-8 weeks, says Delhi HC. What was the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/transplant-process-6-8-weeks-delhi-hc-explained-9103516/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has set a recommended timeline of **6-8 weeks** to complete the organ transplantation process from living donors. This directive comes in response to a case where prolonged delays caused significant distress. The court emphasized that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should ensure adherence to the timelines stipulated by The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, and its 2014 Rules.

The 1994 Act regulates organ transplantation in India, allowing donations from both deceased persons and living donors, typically close relatives. It also outlines the penalties for violations, such as illegal organ trade. The Authorisation Committee is responsible for approving transplants involving non-near relatives, ensuring ethical compliance and preventing commercial transactions.

The case before the Delhi High Court involved a retired Air Force officer whose transplant application was rejected due to the absence of a near relative donor. Despite his passing, the court proceeded with the case, highlighting the lack of specific timelines for the Authorisation Committee to conduct interviews, leading to delays. The court's decision mandates that all steps, from interviews to decision-making, should be completed within fixed timelines to prevent undue suffering for patients and families. The entire process, from application submission to final decision, should not exceed 6-8 weeks. The court's ruling aims to streamline the organ donation process and reduce waiting times for transplants.</description>

			<title>ExplainSpeaking: Did your salary beat the inflation rate in Modi years?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-salary-inflation-rate-modi-years-9103297/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the anticipation of retail inflation data for December, which is crucial for India's policy decisions. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses this data to guide interest rate adjustments, impacting loan EMIs. Inflation has moderated in 2023 but is expected to exceed the 6% threshold in December, suggesting higher EMIs for longer. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) predicts a 5.5% inflation rate for the financial year 2023-24.

The article also examines the impact of inflation on personal finances, explaining that a consistent 4% inflation rate over five years would lead to a 22% increase in the general price level, while a 6% rate would result in a 34% increase. This affects individuals' economic strength in 'real' terms, as salaries need to keep pace with inflation to maintain purchasing power.

During Prime Minister Modi's tenure, the first term saw a 24% rise in prices, while the second term experienced a 32% increase. Over ten years, prices have risen by 64%. The article encourages readers to assess their financial well-being by comparing their salary growth to inflation rates.

Lastly, it mentions the Election Commission of India's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan from the Mission Shakti department due to allegations of misusing public office for electoral gains. The BJP has accused her of using the scheme to influence voters. This section seems unrelated to the main topic and is likely part of the omitted content.</description>

			<title>Why 2023 was a difficult year for Indian start-ups, and why 2024 too looks challenging</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/indian-start-ups-2023-9103043/</link>
			<description>The article provides an overview of the Indian start-up ecosystem's performance in recent years. After a significant boom in 2021, the year 2023 was more challenging, with a noticeable decline in venture capital funding. **Indian start-ups raised $8.3 billion in 2023**, the lowest since 2016, and there was a **72% decline in CAGR** of funding over the last three years. The number of new unicorns dropped significantly, with only two firms reaching the status in 2023 compared to 23 in 2022. Job losses were substantial, with over **20,000 people** laid off from start-ups.

The report by Nasscom and Zinnov highlighted that late-stage investments suffered the most, dropping to **29% of the 2022 levels**. Seed-stage funding also saw a decrease, with only **$700 million** raised in 2023. However, there was growth in specific sectors, such as automotive tech start-ups, which saw a **16% increase in funding** and a significant rise in mega-deal values involving EV manufacturers.

Despite the downturn, nearly **60% of start-up founders reported an increase in revenue and profitability**. The generative AI sector is burgeoning, with over **100 active start-ups** in India. Internationally, India ranked fourth in fundraising, behind the US, UK, and China. In 2023, **18 Indian start-ups went public**, including notable companies like Honana Consumer Limited and ideaForge.

The article concludes with a brief mention of President Joe Biden's remarks on the positive impact of immigrants on the US economy and his criticism of xenophobia in various countries.</description>

			<title>What is the Square Kilometer Array project, significance of India joining it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-the-square-kilometer-array-project-significance-of-india-joining-it-9102401/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. India has officially joined the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project, which aims to build the world's largest radio telescope. India has been contributing to the project for several years and has now become a full member by signing an international treaty and making a financial commitment. The SKA will consist of thousands of dish antennas operating as a single unit, providing a large effective area for collecting radio waves. The project is being implemented in South Africa and Australia, and once completed, it will be significantly more powerful than existing radio telescopes. Although the SKA facilities are not located in India, the country's participation as a full member offers scientific and technological benefits, including preferential access to the facilities and opportunities for research and capacity building. The project also involves advanced technologies and intellectual property that will be accessible to all member countries. Indian scientists have identified various research areas, including the evolution of the early universe, galaxy formation, neutron star physics, and solar sciences, to utilize the SKA telescopes.</description>

			<title>What is the long-running legal dispute over Aligarh Muslim University’s minority character?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-long-running-legal-dispute-over-amus-minority-character-9102400/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing legal debate over the minority status of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The Supreme Court of India is revisiting a case that has been in contention for nearly 57 years, which revolves around whether AMU can claim minority status under Article 30(1) of the Constitution. This provision allows minorities to establish and administer educational institutions without discrimination in receiving government aid.

AMU's history dates back to 1875 when it was established as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan to educate Muslims and prepare them for government jobs. It became a university in 1920, transferring all assets from the college. The dispute began in 1967 when the Supreme Court ruled that AMU was not established nor administered by the Muslim minority, despite being created through a central Act due to the efforts of the Muslim community.

The controversy intensified when, in response to the 1967 ruling, political authorities amended the AMU Act in 1981 to affirm its minority status. However, this amendment was challenged in 2005 when AMU reserved 50% of seats in postgraduate medical courses for Muslims. The Allahabad High Court overturned this reservation, citing the Supreme Court's earlier verdict.

In 2016, the central government withdrew its appeal supporting AMU's minority status, stating that it could not endorse a minority institution in a secular state. The matter was referred to a larger bench by the Supreme Court in 2019, and a seven-judge bench began hearing the case recently. The article details the complex legal history and the current proceedings that could have significant implications for the definition and rights of minority educational institutions in India.</description>

			<title>Pran pratishtha at Ayodhya Ram temple draws near: What is this ceremony, how it is performed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/pran-pratishtha-ayodhya-ram-temple-what-exactly-is-this-9102398/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the pran pratishtha ceremony at Ayodhya's Ram temple, which is a ritual to imbue an idol with life, making it a deity capable of accepting prayers and granting boons. The ceremony began with a procession called shobha yatra to transfer devotion into the idol. Various rituals follow, including adhivaas, where the idol is submerged in different materials to heal it from crafting injuries and to detect any defects. A ritual bath with 108 materials is performed before the idol is 'awakened' with mantras. The final step is the opening of the idol's eyes using anjan, symbolizing the deity's readiness to receive devotees. The process is rooted in Vedic traditions and does not apply to naturally divine objects like the Shaligram and Narmadeshwar. The article also mentions an unrelated political issue regarding the transfer of a government official due to alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Why 2023 was the warmest year ever, and what happens now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-2023-was-the-warmest-year-ever-9102355/</link>
			<description>According to the article, 2023 was the warmest year on record since 1850, surpassing the previous record set in 2016. Temperatures in 2023 likely exceeded those of any year-long period in at least the last 100,000 years. Rising temperatures in 2023 led to numerous extreme weather events worldwide, including heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires. The main driver behind this extreme warming is the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is suggested that 2024 could be even hotter than 2023, and there is a possibility of surpassing the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold for the entire calendar year.</description>

			<title>Gabriel Attal: Who is the new PM of France, what changes with his appointment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gabriel-attal-new-pm-france-what-changes-9102260/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. France's President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Gabriel Attal as the new Prime Minister, making him the youngest person to hold the post at the age of 34. This decision comes after the resignation of the previous Prime Minister, Elisabeth Borne. Macron's appointment of Attal is seen as an effort to rejuvenate his government ahead of the European Union Parliament elections, where his ratings have been trailing. Attal, who previously served as the Minister of Education, is a popular figure both within the ruling coalition and in opposition circles. He is also France's first openly gay Prime Minister. While the President holds greater powers in France's political system, Attal's personal popularity and energy may help the Macron government overcome recent challenges and move forward. It is worth noting that there are other serving gay Prime Ministers in the world, such as Ana Brnabić of Serbia, Leo Varadkar of Ireland, and Xavier Bettel, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg.</description>

			<title>Politics and piracy: How Houthi attacks in Red Sea are different from the earlier Somali hijackings</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/houthi-attacks-red-sea-somali-piracy-hijacking-comparison-9102168/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia on merchant ships in the Red Sea. These attacks have raised concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains, as shipping firms face the choice between higher insurance premiums for the risky Red Sea route or taking the longer and costlier route around the Cape of Good Hope. A US-led force has been deployed in the Red Sea to counter these attacks, but the dangers to shipping persist. The Houthis have targeted certain types of ships, particularly automobile carriers, while generally leaving oil tankers alone. The article also mentions the Houthis' support for Hamas and their links to Iran. It highlights the decline in piracy in the Gulf of Aden since 2016 due to international efforts in military cooperation and intelligence-sharing.</description>

			<title>Alaska Airlines flight’s mid-air door blowout: Other cases of ‘explosive decompression’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/alaska-airlines-flight-door-blowout-other-cases-9101827/</link>
			<description>Alaska Airlines Flight AS-1282, a Boeing 737 MAX-9, experienced an explosive decompression when a 'plugged' door blew out after departing from Portland, USA. The incident occurred at 16,000 ft, and the plane safely returned to Portland with minor injuries reported among the 171 passengers and six crew members. The NTSB is investigating the door's fastening and related failures. Prior to the incident, pilots had received alerts about air pressurization issues. The aircraft had a 'plugged' door instead of an extra emergency exit due to its seating capacity of 178 passengers, which is under the 190-passenger threshold requiring additional exits.

The article also discusses historical instances of explosive decompression, categorizing aircraft accidents into procedural, engineered, and system accidents. It recounts several past accidents involving explosive decompression, including American Airlines Flight 96, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, American Airlines Flight 191, and Aloha Airlines Flight 243, highlighting that despite advancements, such accidents have not been completely eliminated. Each case is detailed with the events and outcomes, emphasizing the ongoing risks and challenges in aviation safety. The article concludes with a separate, unrelated note about the Election Commission of India's actions regarding a complaint of alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>Why Bilkis rapists have been sent back to jail: 5 key questions the SC considered and answered</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/bilkis-bano-rapists-jail-supreme-court-remission-explained-9101311/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court invalidated the Gujarat government's decision to release 11 men convicted in the 2002 Bilkis Bano case, ruling it "illegal" as the trial occurred in Maharashtra, which is the appropriate state for remission decisions. The court addressed five key issues:

1. **Maintainability of the victim's petition under Article 32**: Affirmed, as it enforces fundamental rights.
2. **Maintainability of the PIL against remission orders**: Deemed unnecessary to address due to the maintainability of Article 32 petition.
3. **Competency of Gujarat government to pass remission orders**: Ruled incompetent, as the trial was in Maharashtra.
4. **Legality of the remission orders**: Declared illegal for four reasons, including overstepping Maharashtra's authority and ignoring the convicts' unpaid fines.
5. **Consequences of quashing the remission**: Directed the convicts to surrender within two weeks, emphasizing the rule of law over individual liberty.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/private-us-spacecraft-land-moon-9100677/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. A private US company has launched a spacecraft carrying scientific instruments from NASA with the goal of becoming the first US spacecraft to land on the Moon in over 50 years. The mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, which involves private space companies in the Artemis program for lunar exploration. The spacecraft, called Peregrine, developed technical problems after launch, but the company is working to rectify them. The mission aims to reach the Moon on February 23 and will carry out various exploratory activities, including detecting water. The payloads will remain active for ten days after landing. This mission marks a significant step in the US's return to the Moon and its plans for longer stays and establishing a permanent base camp. NASA is collaborating with the private sector through the CLPS initiative to leverage American companies for lunar exploration. This launch is the first under the CLPS initiative and is seen as a giant leap for humanity.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/bilkis-bano-case-supreme-court-verdict-gujarat-government-convicts-remission-9100819/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India overturned the Gujarat government's decision to grant remission to 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case. These convicts were serving life sentences for their involvement in the gangrape of Bilkis Bano during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The court ordered the convicts to surrender, stating that the Gujarat government was not authorized to grant remission since the trial was conducted in Maharashtra. The court highlighted that the convicts were released based on an outdated 1992 policy, which was no longer valid, and they had not met the condition of paying a fine imposed by the trial court. The case reached the Supreme Court after one of the convicts sought premature release under the 1992 policy, which the court later found had been misrepresented. The Supreme Court emphasized the balance between the rights of the victim for justice and the convict's chance for reform, particularly in cases of heinous crimes. The convicts may seek remission from the Maharashtra government in the future, subject to the state's policies. The summary also includes a brief overview of the crime, the police and judicial response, and the eventual release and re-arrest of the convicts.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the Supreme Court's order regarding the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano gangrape case, indicating that they can seek remission but must be in prison to do so. The Maharashtra government is identified as the appropriate authority to decide on their remission applications. The article details the legal journey of one convict, Radheshyam Shah, who sought early release but was opposed by the CBI and the special CBI judge, citing a government resolution that requires a minimum of 28 years' imprisonment before applying for remission. The convicts have completed 14-15 years of their sentence since their conviction in 2008. The Supreme Court's judgment implies that the convicts' eligibility for remission will depend on the state's policy at the time of their conviction and other circumstances.

			<title>Global warming, sea level rise, ageing flood defence systems: Why European countries have been flooded</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-european-countries-have-been-flooded-9100544/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe flooding in France, England, Netherlands, and Germany caused by heavy rains lasting over two weeks. The intensity of the rainfall, attributed to global warming, rising sea levels, and outdated flood defences, has led to rivers overflowing, homes being flooded, and evacuations. In France, the northern region is severely affected, with over a thousand homes damaged. Central England faced a major incident with flooding along the Trent River, and London experienced disruptions due to a landslide and floodwaters. Germany declared emergencies in flooded regions, and in the Netherlands, residents near Amsterdam used sandbags to protect their homes.

The underlying causes include increased extreme rainfall due to global warming, with a warmer atmosphere holding more moisture, leading to more intense storms. Sea level rise has also caused rivers to flood adjacent areas, and ageing flood defence systems have failed to manage the water effectively. The situation is expected to worsen with future climate warming, necessitating improved flood defences, early warning systems, and resilience measures. The article concludes with a separate note on the Election Commission of India's action against Sujata R Karthikeyan for alleged misuse of public office.</description>

			<title>The question of MSP: Is income support for farmers better than pricing that is delinked from market demand?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/msp-income-support-pricing-delinked-from-market-demand-9100476/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by farmers in a buyer's market, where they are price takers and not price makers, leading to demands for minimum support prices (MSP) for their crops. Economists generally oppose government-fixed MSPs based on cost-plus pricing without considering market demand, as it can distort production decisions. Instead, they favor direct income support schemes, which transfer a fixed sum of money to farmers annually, benefiting all farmers regardless of their crop or sales.

The article also explores the concept of price deficiency payments (PDP), where the government pays farmers the difference between the market price and MSP if the market price is lower. This approach was tried in Madhya Pradesh and is currently implemented in Haryana for certain crops. PDP avoids the pitfalls of forced MSP payments and unsustainable government procurement. The success of PDP in these states suggests that with proper infrastructure and registration systems, a nationwide PDP scheme could be feasible, potentially incentivizing other states to adopt similar measures.

			<title>How Lakshadweep’s unique cultural landscape developed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/lakshadweep-cultural-landscape-islam-9100400/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Lakshadweep has brought attention to the islands' unique cultural and historical identity. The inhabitants, primarily Muslims, have a distinct practice of Islam influenced by various ethnic and linguistic ties. Historical evidence suggests the first settlers were Malabari sailors, with Hindu immigrants arriving in the 7th century CE. The islands' caste structure and matrilineal system likely date back to this period. Islam was introduced through Arab merchants, differing from the mainland Mappila community. The 16th century saw control by the Arakkal kingdom, which managed to retain some autonomy despite European colonial ambitions and later British rule. Lakshadweep's isolation has preserved its cultural diversity, including three main languages and a unique matrilineal tradition within its Islamic society. This system, believed to be sanctioned by the Prophet's own matrilocal living arrangement, has survived due to the islands' relative isolation and lack of influence from broader Islamic reform movements. The article is an updated version of a 2021 publication by Adrija Roychowdhury, who specializes in making academic research accessible to a broader audience.</description>

			<title>Warming up to climate change: How do we know humans are causing global warming?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/are-humans-causing-global-warming-climate-change-9099898/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe impacts of climate change, highlighting 2023 as potentially the hottest year in the last 125,000 years, marked by extreme weather events. It addresses common myths and clarifies that while Earth's climate has naturally fluctuated over its 4.5 billion-year history, the rapid warming observed in recent decades cannot be attributed to these natural factors alone. Instead, the significant increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, particularly CO2, since the industrial revolution is identified as the primary driver of current global warming. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have led to unprecedented levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, the highest in over 800,000 years. The article references a 2014 UN report and subsequent studies which overwhelmingly conclude that human influence is the main cause of the ongoing global warming, with a probability of less than 1 in 100,000 that it could be due to natural factors alone.</description>

			<title>SC overturns remission given to Bilkis Bano’s rapists: What happened, and what has the court ruled?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sc-overturns-remission-bilkis-bano-rapists-9099776/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India overturned the decision of the Gujarat government to grant remission to 11 men convicted in the Bilkis Bano case from 2002. The court declared that the Gujarat government did not have the authority to grant remission, as the trial was conducted in Mumbai, making the Maharashtra government the competent authority. The case involved the gangrape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of seven of her family members during the Gujarat riots. The convicts were released in August 2022 under a remission policy, which was challenged in the Supreme Court.

The law on remission, under the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), allows the President, Governors, and state governments to pardon or reduce sentences, with certain restrictions. One convict, Radheshyam Shah, petitioned for his release after serving over 15 years, citing Gujarat's 1992 remission policy. However, the Supreme Court had previously invalidated this policy, requiring case-by-case consideration for remission.

The Gujarat government argued that the 1992 policy did not have the restrictions of the 2014 policy, which barred remission for certain categories of convicts. The release of the convicts led to public outrage and was challenged by Bilkis Bano in the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled against the remission.

			<title>First Advance Estimates of India’s GDP out: What are they, and what do the data show?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/gdp-data-advance-estimates-9099092/</link>
			<description>India's GDP is projected to grow by **7.3%** in the financial year 2023-24, according to the First Advance Estimates (FAEs). This is a slight increase from the **7.2%** growth in the previous year. The FAEs are preliminary estimates based on data from the first seven months of the year and are updated as more information becomes available. They are significant because they form the basis for the Union Budget, although this year's budget will be different due to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

The FAEs also mark the first decade of economic growth under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. By March 2024, India's GDP is expected to reach nearly **Rs 172 lakh crore**, up from **Rs 98 lakh crore** when Modi first took office. The estimated growth rate for 2023-24 has exceeded expectations, suggesting a strong economic recovery.

However, the growth rate during Modi's second term has slowed to a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of **4.1%**, compared to **7.4%** during his first term. This slowdown is attributed to less than **4%** growth in 2019-20 and a contraction of **5.6%** in 2020-21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The GDP growth is driven by four main components:
- **Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE)**: Expected to grow by **4.4%** this year, accounting for almost **60%** of GDP.
- **Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)**: Investment spending has increased by **9.3%**, indicating business optimism.
- **Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE)**: Government spending has grown by **3.9%**, the slowest among the components.
- **Net Exports**: A negative growth rate indicates more imports than exports, with a **144%** increase in the drag effect this year.

Overall, the growth rate in private consumption and government spending has been muted, with concerns about growing inequality and reliance on government investment spending. Despite these challenges, the current year's growth rate presents an optimistic outlook for India's economy. The article also mentions a transfer order by the Election Commission of India for Sujata R Karthikeyan due to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office. However, this information is unrelated to the economic data presented.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/orthodox-christmas-why-after-december-25-9098968/</link>
			<description>In Eastern Orthodox traditions, Christmas is celebrated on different dates due to the use of different calendars. While most Orthodox churches celebrate Christmas on December 25th, some follow the Julian calendar and celebrate it on January 7th. This includes the Russian Orthodox Church, Serbian Orthodox Church, Georgian Orthodox Church, and some others. In Ukraine, the observance of Christmas on January 7th has political implications, as it asserts national identity and independence from Russia. In the United States, Orthodox churches may vary in their observance, with some following the December 25th date and others following the January 7th date. The specific traditions and worship services may also vary among different Orthodox communities.</description>

			<title>Why PM Modi’s Lakshadweep visit has the Maldives’ social media and govt officials up in arms against India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-pm-modi-lakshadweep-maldives-social-media-9098823/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a social media controversy sparked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's posts promoting tourism in Lakshadweep. The posts led to offensive and derogatory comments from some Maldivian officials and social media users, including racist and xenophobic remarks. This prompted a series of responses from both Indian and Maldivian citizens, politicians, and officials.

Key points include:
- **PM Modi's posts** on Lakshadweep's beauty did not mention the Maldives, but triggered negative reactions from Maldivian social media users and officials.
- **Maldivian Deputy Minister Mariyam Shiuna** and others made derogatory comments towards India and PM Modi, which were widely criticized.
- **Maldivian social media users** claimed Lakshadweep as Maldivian territory and accused India of competing with Maldives' tourism.
- **Indian tourists** are a significant contributor to the Maldives' tourism sector, with over 200,000 travelers in 2023.
- **Indian social media users** responded with calls for a boycott of Maldivian tourism and highlighted India's assistance to the Maldives.
- **Maldives' political history** shows a pattern of anti-India sentiment, with the 'India Out' campaign targeting India-Maldives bilateral relations.
- **President Mohamed Muizzu's government** is seen as pro-China and has agreed to India's withdrawal of military presence in the Maldives.
- **Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs** issued a statement distancing the government from derogatory remarks made by officials.
- **Bollywood celebrities and Indian sportspersons** started a 'Visit Lakshadweep' campaign in response to the controversy.

The article suggests that despite the social media uproar, the bilateral relations between India and the Maldives are unlikely to be significantly affected, as the incident does not reflect the longstanding cooperation and friendship between the two nations. The Election Commission of India's action against Sujata R Karthikeyan for alleged misuse of public office is also mentioned, unrelated to the main controversy.

			<title>How the Alaska Airlines’ mid-air panel blowout adds to Boeing 737 MAX’s troubles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/max-alaska-airlines-mid-air-blowout-boeing-737-max-troubles-9098753/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent safety incident involving an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX-9 aircraft, which led to India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issuing inspection directives for Boeing 737 MAX-8 aircraft operated by Indian airlines. Despite the incident involving the MAX-9 variant, the DGCA's precautionary measures apply to the MAX-8 due to their similarities. Currently, 44 MAX-8 aircraft are in service in India, with Akasa Air being the largest operator. The directive requires inspections of emergency exits by a set deadline.

The incident in question occurred on a flight from Portland to Ontario, where a mid-air cabin panel blowout caused decompression and a door-sized hole in the fuselage. All passengers and crew landed safely without serious injuries. The aircraft was new, delivered to Alaska Airlines just months before the incident. The blowout involved a plug door, which is an optional emergency exit used by low-cost carriers to accommodate extra seating.

The article also touches on the broader implications for the aviation industry, noting that the FAA and other global regulators are closely monitoring the situation. The outcome of the inspections could have significant consequences for carriers if a systemic issue is found. The 737 MAX family has faced past safety challenges, including two fatal crashes that led to a global grounding. The recent incident adds to the scrutiny of the aircraft's safety record.

The article concludes by mentioning the potential impact on Indian carriers, particularly Akasa Air, if the MAX-8 variant comes under scrutiny. It also provides a brief history of the 737 MAX's past issues and the steps taken by aviation authorities to return the aircraft to service. The latest incident follows Boeing's request for inspections due to a separate issue with the rudder control system, highlighting ongoing concerns with the aircraft family. The summary omits unrelated content such as advertisements and other news.</description>

			<title>ED, CRPF attacked in West Bengal: What is the PDS scam they are investigating?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ed-crpf-attacked-west-bengal-pds-scam-9098098/</link>
			<description>The article discusses an ongoing investigation into a **public distribution system (PDS) corruption scandal** in West Bengal. Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials faced mob resistance while attempting to investigate a Trinamool Congress leader's home. The ED has arrested several individuals, including a former chairperson of Bongaon municipality and a state minister, in connection with the scam. The scam involved supplying less than mandated quantities of rice and wheat to fair price shop distributors, with the balance sold for profit. The ED alleges that an influential businessman, who was patronized by the arrested minister, orchestrated the scam, resulting in financial irregularities and the discovery of over 100 government seals in the businessman's apartment. The scam came to light during the Covid-19 lockdown when protests erupted over PDS grain distribution irregularities. The state government has denied the allegations, accusing the central government of insufficient supply under the PMGKAY scheme. The TMC has criticized the ED's actions as provocative. The article also briefly mentions an unrelated IPL cricket match update.</description>

			<title>How AI can help detect cancer</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/how-ai-can-help-detect-cancer-9097955/</link>
			<description>Mumbai's Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) is addressing the shortage of cancer specialists by creating a 'Bio-Imaging Bank' and using artificial intelligence (AI) for early-stage cancer detection. The project aims to build a comprehensive database of radiology and pathology images linked with clinical data to train AI algorithms. Initially focusing on head and neck cancers and lung cancers, the project involves training and testing AI algorithms for tasks like screening for lymph node metastases and predicting therapy responses.

The project is a collaboration between multiple institutions and is funded by the Department of Biotechnology. AI's role in cancer diagnosis involves analyzing images to identify tissue changes and potential malignancies, thus facilitating early detection. TMH has developed algorithms to assess treatment responses and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy for non-responders. They have also used AI to reduce radiation exposure for pediatric patients undergoing CT scans by 40%.

Furthermore, TMH is validating AI algorithms for thoracic radiology in the ICU, which has shown a 98% accuracy rate when cross-checked by doctors. The future of AI in cancer treatment looks promising, with the potential to tailor treatment approaches and enhance precision in cancer solutions. However, the use of AI in healthcare also raises debates about the potential replacement of human radiologists and faces regulatory scrutiny.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-ai-can-help-detect-cancer-9097955/</link>
			<description>Mumbai's Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) is addressing the shortage of cancer specialists by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to improve early-stage cancer detection. They've established a 'Bio-Imaging Bank' with data from 60,000 patients, aiming to create a comprehensive repository of radiology and pathology images linked with clinical data for AI algorithm training and testing. The project focuses on head, neck, and lung cancers, and is a collaborative effort with multiple institutions, funded by the Department of Biotechnology.

AI's role in cancer detection involves analyzing images to identify tissue changes and potential malignancies, thus facilitating early diagnosis. TMH's approach includes developing predictive models for tumor survival and treatment response, segmenting and annotating images, and correlating them with clinical data to create diverse algorithms. These efforts have led to a 40% reduction in radiation exposure for pediatric CT scans and the development of a thoracic radiology algorithm with a 98% accuracy rate.

The project aims to develop AI tools that can swiftly detect cancer, potentially transforming treatment, especially in rural India, and optimizing therapy outcomes based on patient profiles. Despite its promise, the use of AI in radiology has sparked debates about the potential replacement of human radiologists and faces regulatory challenges.</description>

			<title>Pakistan’s Senate passes resolution seeking to delay national elections: Here is why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistans-senate-passes-resolution-seeking-delay-national-elections-9097716/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a resolution passed by Pakistan's Senate to delay the national elections, originally scheduled for February 8, citing cold weather and security concerns. The resolution, introduced by Independent Senator Dilawar Khan, points out the difficulty of voter participation in the cold months in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the recent threats to politicians' lives. It suggests a possible delay of two to four months for better weather conditions. However, the resolution is non-binding, and the Election Commission of Pakistan has not yet commented on it.

Major political parties have criticized the resolution, stating it has no legal force in the election process. The article also highlights potential constitutional, political, and economic risks of delaying the elections. It notes that a delay could lead to political instability, a truncated Senate, and economic challenges, as Pakistan requires an elected government to negotiate with the IMF to sustain its economy. Postponing the elections could therefore be a significant risk for the country.

The article concludes with a separate issue regarding the Election Commission of India's transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to a complaint of alleged misuse of public office, highlighting political tensions in the region.</description>

			<description>Bangladesh is set to hold elections on January 7, with the expectation that the incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League will secure victory amid a boycott by most opposition parties. The unicameral legislature, Jatiya Sangsad, has 350 seats, 300 of which are elected every five years, and 50 reserved for women appointed by the ruling party or coalition. The country operates under a first-past-the-post system.

The Awami League, founded in 1949 and led by Bangladesh's independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been in power for four terms since 1991, with Sheikh Hasina, Mujib's daughter, as Prime Minister since 2009. The main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), was established in 1978 by Ziaur Rahman and is now led by his son Tarique Rahman from exile, following the imprisonment and house arrest of his mother Khaleda Zia.

The BNP is boycotting the elections, labeling them a "sham," while the third-largest party, the Jatiya Party (Ershad), is participating. The fairness of the election process is a significant concern, with a history of controversial elections under partisan governments. The caretaker government system, instituted in 1990 to oversee elections, was abolished by Hasina in 2011, leading to allegations of rigged elections by the opposition.

Economic factors, such as the cost of living and energy imports, may influence the elections. Despite autocratic tendencies, Hasina is seen as a key ally of India, having fostered strong bilateral relations and supported India's national security interests. In contrast, the BNP under Khaleda Zia allowed anti-India militant groups to operate, making Hasina the preferred leader for India.

The article also mentions the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan by the Election Commission of India due to alleged misuse of public office, with accusations of her influencing voters through the Mission Shakti scheme.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/henry-ford-1914-wages-on-this-day-history-9096927/</link>

Despite concerns about worker retention, the higher wages helped Ford retain employees and improve productivity. The decision proved to be a successful cost-cutting move, leading to increased profits for Ford Motors.</description>

			<title>Elections in Bangladesh: Why both India and China are backing Sheikh Hasina</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-elections-india-china-back-sheikh-hasina-9096924/</link>
			<description>Hmm, Bangladesh is currently at an inflection point both economically and geopolitically. Its growing economy, valued at $400 billion and with a growth rate of 7.1% in 2022, has attracted the attention of major powers. These powers, such as India, China, the United States, and Russia, see Bangladesh's growth and stability as crucial to advancing their own strategic interests in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.

The national elections in Bangladesh, which took place on January 7, have become a significant arena for various ambitions to play out. India and China, in particular, have high stakes in the outcome and credibility of the election process. Both countries have robust economic ties with Bangladesh and have wider regional rivalries. How Bangladesh manages the partnership expectations from these two Asian giants will be closely watched internationally.

India and Bangladesh have a strong trade relationship, with bilateral trade exceeding $15 billion in 2021-22. India recognizes Bangladesh as an important buffer state and provides critical support in ports and power grid access. On the other hand, Bangladesh's trade with China surpassed $25 billion in 2022. Bangladesh aligns strategically with China, which is helping transform its landscape through mega projects and has made significant investments in BRI-financed infrastructure projects.

Bangladesh follows a nuanced approach in its relations with India and China, prioritizing mutually beneficial relationships that align with its national interests. It leverages socio-economic, trade, and cultural ties with India for growth while maintaining significant military relations with China. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's handling of multiple partnerships has been adept, showcasing Bangladesh's strategic autonomy and its ability to cooperate and collaborate with major regional powers.

The intersection of geopolitics and economics is evident in Bangladesh's pursuit of developed nation status by 2041. The country strategically harnesses the economic and technological strengths of both India and China, granting them port access and fostering modernization. Bangladesh's Indo-Pacific outlook emphasizes engagement with regional and global stakeholders for human security, connectivity, and the blue economy, while avoiding geopolitical tensions.

The January 7 elections in Bangladesh hold significance for both India and China. The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the elections, raising concerns about the credibility of the election results. Both India and China, deeply invested in Bangladesh's stability, are wary of potential political and economic risks post-election. China's $38 billion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) initiatives depend on the continuity of the ruling party, while India may need to explore alternative strategies if Prime Minister Hasina were to be unseated.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like to know about Bangladesh or if you have any other questions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/oscar-pistorius-parole-9096717/</link>
			<description>Former South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has been released on parole after serving more than seven years for the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, known as the "Blade Runner" for his carbon fiber prosthetic legs, won medals in both the Paralympics and the Olympics. He claimed that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired four shots at a locked bathroom door in his home. While initially convicted of culpable homicide, the Supreme Court later found him guilty of murder and increased his sentence. Pistorius will live with his family in Pretoria and must attend rehabilitation programs while on parole.</description>

			<title>Army reviews Gen Naravane’s book: What Rules govern writing by serving and retired personnel?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/army-reviews-gen-naravane-book-rules-9096167/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Indian Army's review of the memoirs of its former Chief, General M M Naravane (retd), following the publication of excerpts by PTI. The memoir, titled "Four Stars of Destiny," includes details of India's response to the 2020 standoff with China in eastern Ladakh and the Agnipath recruitment scheme. It recounts a critical moment when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh authorized the Army to act as it saw fit during a Chinese incursion at Rechin La pass. General Naravane describes his decision to deter the PLA without initiating combat.

The article also touches on the Army Rules, 1954, which restrict service personnel from publishing political or service-related material without government sanction. However, the rules for retired officers are less clear. Officials suggest that the review process for such publications could follow the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, which require retired intelligence or security personnel to obtain permission before publishing related information. The article notes that several military officers have authored books in the past, indicating a precedent for such publications.</description>

			<title>Justice Gavai nominated as SC Legal Services Committee Chairman: What law says on free legal aid in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/justice-gavai-sc-legal-services-committee-chairman-aid-india-nalsa-9095489/</link>
			<description>Justice BR Gavai has been appointed as the Chairman of the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC), succeeding Justice Sanjiv Khanna. The SCLSC, established under the Legal Services Authorities Act of 1987, aims to provide free legal services to the weaker sections of society within the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. The committee is constituted by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) and includes a sitting Supreme Court judge as the chairman, along with members nominated by the Chief Justice of India (CJI), who also appoints the Secretary to the Committee.

The SCLSC's current composition includes Chairperson BR Gavai and nine members nominated by the CJI. The committee's structure and member qualifications are outlined in the NALSA Rules of 1995 and the Legal Services Authorities Act of 1987. The Act empowers the Centre to make rules, in consultation with the CJI, to implement its provisions.

The Indian Constitution emphasizes the importance of providing legal services to ensure justice and equality before the law. The establishment of legal aid programs dates back to the 1950s, with significant developments in 1980 and the enactment of the Legal Services Authorities Act in 1987. NALSA was formed in 1995 to oversee legal aid programs and establish policies for legal services.

A network of State Legal Services Authorities (SLSAs) and District Legal Services Authorities (DLSAs) has been set up across India to implement NALSA's policies, provide free legal services, and conduct Lok Adalats. These authorities, along with Taluk Legal Services Committees, also organize legal awareness camps and facilitate access to legal documents and services.</description>

			<title>Arvind Kejriwal, Hemant Soren refuse ED summons: What happens now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kejriwal-soren-refuse-ed-summons-9094910/</link>
			<description>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has declined to appear for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on January 3, citing reasons such as Rajya Sabha elections and Republic Day celebrations. He has previously suggested that the summons were politically motivated. The article explains that under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ED does not have to declare whether a person summoned is an accused. Summons are issued under Section 50 of the PMLA, which grants the ED powers similar to a civil court for investigation purposes.

Refusal to appear can result in penalties and potential jail terms under various sections of the PMLA and the Indian Penal Code. However, arresting someone for non-cooperation is complex and has not been historically pursued by the ED. Court judgments have clarified that the power to arrest is distinct from the power to issue summons and that the ED cannot arrest someone solely based on their refusal to respond to a summons.

The Delhi High Court has stated that the power to arrest under the PMLA is not absolute and that anticipatory bail can be sought even if the person is not named as an accused in the ED's reports. The article concludes with information about the Election Commission of India ordering the transfer of Sujata R Karthikeyan due to allegations of misuse of public office. The BJP has accused her of using the Mission Shakti scheme to influence voters on behalf of the BJD.</description>
