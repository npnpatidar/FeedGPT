			<title>What is a waterspout, which may have sunk the luxury yacht off Sicily?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/waterspout-luxury-yacht-sicily-9524129/</link>
			<description>A luxury yacht sank off the coast of Sicily after being hit by a violent storm, resulting in at least one fatality and six people missing. The storm is believed to have been a tornadic waterspout, a more intense and destructive type compared to fair-weather waterspouts. 

Experts suggest that rising ocean temperatures may be contributing to an increase in the frequency of waterspouts. Among the missing is British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, known as the “British Bill Gates,” along with his daughter Hannah. Lynch's wife Angela Bacares was rescued.</description>

			<title>Who are the Dhangars of Maharashtra and why are they asking for ‘grazing corridors’ in forests?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dhangars-maharashtra-elections-caste-9524048/</link>
			<description>The Dhangar community, a nomadic group of shepherds predominantly found in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, has been demanding the establishment of "grazing corridors" to ensure their traditional movement with their livestock.  They argue that recent forest conservation measures have restricted their access to grazing lands, impacting their livelihoods and cultural practices.  

The Dhangars face challenges accessing education and healthcare due to their nomadic life and have long fought for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, which is currently opposed by existing ST groups in Maharashtra due to concerns over reservation dilution.  The Forest Rights Act, which recognizes traditional grazing rights, has not adequately benefited the Dhangar community.

The community wields significant political influence, particularly in western Maharashtra and parts of Vidarbha.  They are seeking political attention and support for their demand for grazing corridors, hoping to secure their rights to traditional grazing lands.</description>

			<title>Before Siddaramiah, 4 alleged corruption cases where Karnataka Governor’s prosecution sanction was sought</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/siddaramiah-governor-corruption-sanction-9523838/</link>
			<description>Karnataka Governor Thawar Chand Gehlot granted prosecution sanction against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption allegations. The Congress party calls this a political conspiracy, highlighting other pending sanction requests against figures like HD Kumaraswamy, Murugesh Nirani, Gali Janardhan Reddy, and Shashikala Jolle. 

The requests against Kumaraswamy and Nirani concern alleged corruption during their tenures as CM and Industries Minister respectively, while Reddy faces charges of amassing disproportionate assets during his time as a minister.

			<title>What must NASA decide to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore home?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-sunita-williams-barry-stuck-return-9523319/</link>
			<description>NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams are facing an extended stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) due to technical issues with their Boeing Starliner spacecraft. 

The issues, involving helium lines and the propulsion system, have prevented the Starliner from returning to Earth as planned. NASA is currently evaluating options, which include repairing the Starliner or returning it to Earth uncrewed, leaving the astronauts aboard the ISS until February 2025.

While the delay presents health risks associated with prolonged space travel, astronauts are highly trained to manage these challenges. NASA is conducting a thorough review process to determine the safest course of action for the astronauts' return. The final decision is expected by the end of August.</description>

			<title>Hayflick limit: Why immortality remains out of humans’ reach</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/hayflick-limit-why-immortality-remains-out-of-humans-reach-9522701/</link>
			<description>Leonard Hayflick, a biomedical researcher who discovered the finite number of divisions normal cells can undergo (Hayflick limit), passed away at 98. His discovery revolutionized aging research, suggesting an inherent cellular clock determining lifespan, with an estimated maximum for humans around 125 years. 

Hayflick demonstrated this limit across various species, correlating it with telomere shortening, protective DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that diminish with each cell division. However, the precise relationship between telomere shortening and aging remains unclear.

The discovery of telomerase, an enzyme capable of producing new telomeres, offers potential for influencing the Hayflick limit.  Although lab experiments show telomerase can slow down telomere loss in human cells, practical applications remain distant.</description>

			<title>Scientists discover liquid water on Mars for the first time: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/liquid-water-mars-9522348/</link>
			<description>A recent study suggests the presence of vast amounts of liquid water deep within Mars' rocky outer crust. Using seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, researchers identified a layer of fractured igneous rock at depths of 10 to 20 kilometers, likely filled with liquid water. This water may have seeped from the surface billions of years ago when Mars had a warmer, wetter climate.  

The discovery, which could hold oceans’ worth of water,  raises the possibility of Martian habitats and fuels the search for past or present life.  However, extracting this water for potential colonization would be a significant technological challenge.</description>

			<title>Why the selection of 69,000 assistant teachers in Uttar Pradesh has been ordered afresh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/up-69000-assistant-teachers-exam-hc-9522223/</link>
			<description>The Allahabad High Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to prepare a new list of 69,000 assistant teachers selected in 2019.  The court's decision stems from challenges to the original recruitment process, alleging irregularities in reservation implementation. 

The court found that the previous lists did not appropriately represent reserved categories like OBC and SC candidates. 

 The government's attempts to rectify the situation with a revised list in 2022 were also deemed insufficient. The new order demands adherence to reservation laws and rules, impacting the jobs of teachers previously appointed based on the older lists.


The case holds political significance as OBC representation is a sensitive issue in Uttar Pradesh.</description>

			<title>Explained: Google’s ‘monopolist’ judgement in the US and its repercussions in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-google-monopolist-judgement-impact-india-9521974/</link>
			<description>A recent US federal court ruling declared Google a monopolist in online search, finding the company acted illegally to maintain its dominance.  This landmark judgment highlights concerns about the growing power of Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.

The ruling could have implications for regulatory efforts in other countries, including India. The Indian government is pursuing an antitrust law to address concerns over Google's billing policies, app store commissions, and alleged stifling of competition in online advertising.  

They are taking inspiration from the EU's Digital Markets Act, which aims to prevent unfair practices by large tech firms. India's proposed law, the Digital Competition Bill, 2024, seeks to curb anti-competitive behavior by requiring companies to open their services and prohibiting self-preferencing.</description>

			<title>How Starbucks’ leadership change could impact customer experience in 3 ways</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/starbucks-leadership-change-india-9521891/</link>
			<description>Starbucks' leadership change may bring operational streamlining and improvements to the customer experience.  The new CEO, Brian Niccol, is expected to focus on fixing the company's mobile app and addressing long wait times that have been reported in some markets. Niccol's experience at Chipotle suggests he could leverage his expertise in optimizing order flow.

Additionally, Starbucks may need to adjust its strategy to better compete in the growing cold brew and energy drink markets, and potentially address its price positioning compared to competitors in the quick-service restaurant category. The impact of these changes on Starbucks' Indian partnership and customer experience in India will be closely watched.</description>

			<title>Super Blue Moon to be visible tonight: What is it and how will it be different?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/super-blue-moon-raksha-bandhan-2024-9521732/</link>
			<description>Raksha Bandhan, celebrated on the full moon day (Purnima) in the month of Shravan,  will coincide with a rare "super blue moon" on August 19.  This astronomical event combines three phenomena: it's a full moon, a "super moon" (occurring near its closest point to Earth), and a "blue moon" (the second full moon in a single calendar month).  

The moon's orbit is elliptical, meaning its distance from Earth varies. When a full moon coincides with its closest point, perigee, it appears slightly larger and brighter, earning the designation "super moon." The term "blue moon" refers to the uncommon occurrence of two full moons within a calendar month due to the moon's cycle being slightly shorter than a month. 

This super blue moon will rise at 6:57 pm in Delhi on August 19.</description>

			<title>Why Elon Musk’ X announced it will shut down operations in Brazil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/elon-musk-x-brazil-shut-operations-9520939/</link>
			<description>X, formerly Twitter, has ceased operations in Brazil, claiming that Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes threatened legal representatives with arrest if they didn't comply with censorship orders.  The platform alleges that Moraes demanded they block accounts and hand over private information, which they deem illegal.  Moraes is investigating Musk for allegedly spreading disinformation and obstructing justice.  

X claims their Brazilian staff have no control over content blocking and that their appeals to the Supreme Court haven't been heard. They argue that complying with Moraes' demands would have been "shameful" and violated free speech rights.  Moraes, however, believes Musk is undermining Brazilian law and sovereignty. This situation highlights a growing tension between tech companies and governments over content moderation and free speech.</description>

			<title>Can Sheikh Hasina be extradited to Bangladesh? What are India’s options?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/india-options-sheikh-hasina-extradition-bangladesh-9520855/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's interim government has hinted at the possibility of extraditing former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who faces multiple criminal charges.  India and Bangladesh have an extradition treaty signed in 2013, which was amended in 2016 to expedite the process.  

The treaty allows for the extradition of individuals accused of offenses punishable by at least one year imprisonment in both countries, including murder, torture, and financial crimes. However, India could refuse extradition based on grounds like lack of good faith in the accusation or alleging the charges are politically motivated. 

India faces a dilemma, as it needs to balance relations with the new government in Bangladesh and its long-standing ties with Hasina. Security experts suggest that India will ultimately make a political decision based on its national interest.</description>

			<title>What the rise of 37-year-old Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra means for the country’s politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/paetongtarn-shinawatra-thailand-politics-9520889/</link>
			<description>Paetongtarn Shinawatra,  the daughter of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, has become Thailand's youngest-ever Prime Minister. Her election follows the ousting of previous leader Srettha Thavisin by a constitutional court over ethical violations.  

This marks the Shinawatra family's third stint in Thailand's top office, with both Thaksin and his sister Yingluck facing earlier military coups.  Paetongtarn, who  joined politics just three years ago,  inherits a politically complex landscape marked by the enduring influence of the military and the monarchy.  Her ascension comes amid concern that the progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most seats in the 2023 election, is being sidelined. This raises questions about the future of democratic reforms in Thailand.</description>

			<title>Why Odisha will plant 20 lakh palm trees for protection against lightning strikes</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-odisha-palm-trees-lightning-strikes-9520716/</link>
			<description>Odisha is planting 20 lakh palm trees to mitigate the risk of lightning strikes, a significant issue in the state.  Over the past 11 years, 3,790 people have died from lightning, with the highest numbers occurring during the agricultural season.  Palm trees are believed to act as natural lightning conductors due to their height and moisture content.  The initiative, approved by the state government, aims to reduce fatalities and eventually bring the number of deaths to zero.  
While there are concerns about the effectiveness and timeframe of this approach, the state is also implementing an early warning system to predict lightning strikes and educate the public on safety measures.</description>

			<title>Lessons from Wayanad, Himachal: As climate change intensifies, how to prepare for extreme weather events</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/lessons-from-wayanad-himachal-disaster-expert-explains-9520604/</link>
			<description>Recent natural disasters in India, a landslide in Kerala and cloud bursts in Himachal Pradesh, resulted in significant loss of life and property. Cloud bursts, concentrated downpours lasting minutes, are frequent in the Himalayan region and are exacerbated by climate change. The Kerala landslide, triggered by heavy rainfall, highlights the vulnerability of the Western Ghats to such events. 

Disaster impact is magnified by socio-economic factors like poverty and inadequate infrastructure.  Experts stress the need for improved disaster preparedness, including stricter environmental regulations, sustainable tourism practices, and early warning systems.  They also emphasize the urgency of prioritizing climate change mitigation and adaptation in government policy and budget allocations.</description>

			<title>Mpox declared a global health emergency: will it trigger another pandemic?</title>

			<description>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing mpox outbreaks in Congo and other African nations a global emergency. While Sweden recently reported the first case of a new mpox variant in a traveler, experts believe localized outbreaks in Europe are unlikely. 

Mpox, spread primarily through close contact, has a slower transmission rate compared to COVID-19.  With available vaccines and treatments, the WHO emphasizes the need for urgent action to curb the virus, particularly in Africa where the majority of cases and deaths are concentrated.  Increased investment in Africa is deemed crucial to effectively control and potentially eradicate the outbreak.</description>

			<title>UPSC issues ad for lateral entry into bureaucracy: What is the policy, why it has no reservation provision</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/upsc-lateral-entry-bureaucracy-reservations-9520211/</link>
			<description>The UPSC has issued an advertisement for 45 lateral recruitment positions for Joint Secretary, Director, and Deputy Secretary in 24 ministries. This has drawn criticism from opposition leaders who argue the policy lacks reservations for SC, ST, and OBC candidates. 

Lateral recruitment, initiated to bring in specialized expertise, allows individuals from outside the civil services to serve in the central secretariat. However, while reservations are mandatory for direct appointments, the DoPT maintains that they are not applicable for lateral entries, citing the single-post vacancy nature of these appointments. This approach effectively bypasses the 13-point roster system used for reservation implementation. 
The Latest advertisement, advertising 45 vacancies, would have reserved six for SC, three for ST, 12 for OBC, and four for EWS if they were considered as a single group. However, as each vacancy is advertised separately, it  avoids the application of reservations.</description>

			<title>Americans, Soviets or Israelis? Who killed Pakistan’s former President Zia ul-Haq?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistan-president-zia-ul-haq-9519589/</link>
			<description>The death of General Zia ul-Haq in a plane crash in 1988 remains shrouded in mystery.  Numerous theories have emerged, including potential involvement of Murtaza Bhutto, son of Zia's predecessor, who opposed his regime.  Zia's own son, Ijazul Haq, alleged conspiracy involving then-vice-chief General Aslam Beg, believing Zia intended to replace him.  

The Soviet Union, being an adversary of Zia's in the Afghan conflict, was also suspected.  Another theory implicated the US, citing concerns over Zia's nuclear ambitions and support for groups deemed anti-American.  John Gunther Dean, former US Ambassador to India, even suggested Israeli involvement, but this claim was dismissed by US authorities.  Despite investigations, the cause of the crash and the identity of the responsible party, if any, remain unclear.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/explained-dispute-namdhari-sect-9519265/</link>
			<description>Violence erupted between factions of the Namdhari religious sect in Rania, Haryana, leaving eight injured. The clash stems from a dispute over 11 acres of agricultural land at Jeewan Nagar village. 

Both factions, led by brothers Sadguru Uday Singh and Thakur Dalip Singh, claim ownership of the land. The dispute has its roots in a power struggle that began after the death of Jagjit Singh, the previous sect leader, in 2016.  The Dalip Singh faction alleges that a court verdict in their favor has not been implemented, while the Uday Singh faction maintains that the land belongs to their sect. Both sides accuse the other of attacking their followers.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/kesri-basanti-history-politics-colour-holy-nishan-sahib-9519057/</link>
			<description>The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has changed the color of the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag, from kesri (saffron) to basanti (a bright yellow) at the Golden Temple complex. This follows the lead of Gurudwara Ber Sahib in Sultanpur Lodhi, which restored the basanti color earlier this year. The SGPC cites historical and religious significance, including the Sikh Code of Conduct (Rehat Maryada) which prescribes xanthic or greyish blue colors.  

The shift comes after debate and a 1995 article suggesting the disagreement over kesri and basanti dates back to pre-Independence times.  Pro-Khalistan writer Sarabjit Singh Ghuman points out that kesri became more closely associated with the Hindu colour bhagwa after Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's rise in influence. The basanti color is now closer to that used by the AAP in Punjab than the SAD party flag.</description>

			<title>An Expert Explains: How James Webb Space Telescope has raised questions in cosmology</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-how-james-webb-space-telescope-has-raised-questions-in-cosmology-9518351/</link>
			<description>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided stunning images of the early Universe, but its findings have presented unexpected puzzles for astronomers. 

Contrary to expectations, early galaxies appear to be mature and large, not the smaller, developing galaxies predicted. Additionally, JWST's measurements of the Universe's expansion rate appear to contradict results obtained by other methods, furthering the existing discrepancy in this area of study. 

These findings challenge the existing "standard model" of the Universe, prompting some to question the validity of our current understanding and consider the need for a paradigm shift.</description>

			<title>Why national consumer commission directed Goibibo, not Jet Airways, to issued refund after flight cancellation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/national-consumer-commission-goibibo-jet-airways-refund-9518049/</link>
			<description>The Jaiswal family booked flights to Canada on Jet Airways through Goibibo in 2019. When Jet Airways went bankrupt, Goibibo refused to issue a refund. The family filed a complaint, arguing that Goibibo's guidelines stated they would manage refunds in case of cancellations. Goibibo claimed they were merely a facilitator and not responsible for the refund. 

The District Commission and later the National Commission ruled in favor of the family, citing Goibibo's own booking policy and a Jet Airways circular directing customers to claim refunds from their booking agent.  The National Commission upheld the State Commission's finding that Goibibo, despite being an intermediary, was liable for the refund as they received payment from the consumer and are bound by their own policy.</description>

			<title>All-night streetlights can make leaves inedible to insects: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/streetlights-leaves-inedible-insects-9518020/</link>
			<description>A new study reveals that artificial lights, especially streetlights, can negatively impact urban ecosystems. The research found that plants exposed to constant light grew tougher leaves, deterring insects from eating them. This lack of insect consumption could trigger a decline in other species further up the food chain, including birds and other predators.  

Scientists believe that constant light might be disrupting the plant's natural photosynthesis cycle, causing stress and impacting their resource allocation. The study urges further research to understand the long-term consequences of artificial light at night on urban biodiversity.</description>

			<title>How an asteroid from beyond Jupiter ended the age of dinosaurs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/asteroid-beyond-jupiter-dinosaurs-extinction-9517927/</link>
			<description>Scientists now believe the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs came from the outer Solar System.  

A study published in Science looked at ruthenium isotopes found at the Chicxulub crater, the impact site of the asteroid that caused the mass extinction 66 million years ago. The isotopes match those found in carbonaceous asteroids, which are rich in carbon and originate from the outer Solar System. This finding rules out the theory that a comet, not an asteroid, was responsible for the extinction.</description>

			<title>The Americans or the Ukrainians? Who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nord-stream-gas-pipelines-explosion-9517908/</link>
			<description>Two years after the Nord Stream pipeline bombing, questions surrounding the perpetrator remain. The Wall Street Journal offers a new account, claiming a small team of Ukrainian operatives, defying President Zelenskyy's orders, carried out the attack using explosives. 

The operation, costing $300,000, was reportedly funded by businessmen and overseen by a serving general. The team, including divers, allegedly used a rented yacht and detonated HMX explosives, causing significant damage to the pipelines.

However, this account differs from Seymour Hersh's earlier report, which implicated the CIA in a covert operation authorized by President Biden to weaken Europe's dependence on Russian gas. 
 
While German authorities have suggested Ukraine's involvement, citing evidence like a rental yacht and traces of an underwater explosive, no definitive conclusion has been reached.</description>

			<title>You’ve lost weight taking new obesity drugs. What happens if you stop?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/weight-loss-drugs-stop-effects-9517770/</link>
			<description>Obesity medication, while effective, raises questions about long-term use and weight maintenance. Studies have shown that weight regained quickly after stopping these drugs, along with a return to previous health conditions. Doctors lack definitive guidance on adjusting or stopping medications, often advising tentative measures like lowering dosage or careful dietary monitoring.  

Patients desire a finite treatment duration, mirroring the perception of obesity as a controllable condition rather than a chronic disease. Experts emphasize the lifelong nature of obesity management, similar to other chronic conditions. 

Weight loss plateaus eventually occur, leading to natural weight maintenance. Side effects, though often temporary, may return upon restarting medication after discontinuation.</description>

			<title>Egg, sperm donors have no parental right on child: What Bombay HC held</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/egg-sperm-donors-no-parental-right-bombay-hc-9517728/</link>
			<description>The Bombay High Court ruled that a sperm or egg donor has no legal right to claim parenthood of a child born through their gamete. 

The case involved a woman seeking custody of her twin daughters born through surrogacy and with her sister's egg donation. While the court acknowledged the emotional complexity, it emphasized that the intending parents, in this case, the mother and father, are legally recognized as the biological parents under the 2005 National Guidelines on ART Clinics. Though estranged, the biological mother was granted weekend visiting rights while the trial court resolves the custody issue.</description>

			<title>ISRO launches SSLV: What is the aim behind developing Small Satellite Launch Vehicles?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/isro-sslv-launch-vehicle-features-9517682/</link>
			<description>ISRO successfully launched the SSLV-D3, marking the completion of the SSLV Development Project.  This cost-effective launch vehicle, designed for smaller payloads,  is capable of carrying up to 500kg and accommodates multiple satellites. 

SSLVs address the needs of burgeoning private space industry and research institutions who require frequent and on-demand launches of smaller satellites.  Prior to SSLVs, smaller payloads had to rely on existing  launch vehicles like the PSLV, which is suited for larger payloads and has a higher cost and longer integration time.</description>

			<title>Remembering the ‘Great Calcutta Killings’: When Jinnah’s ‘direct action’ caused a bloodbath</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/remembering-great-calcutta-killings-jinnah-direct-action-9517614/</link>
			<description>The 'Great Calcutta Killings' of August 1946, a period of intense communal violence, marked a turning point in the lead-up to India's independence and partition. 

Tensions between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress had escalated, culminating in Muhammad Ali Jinnah's call for 'direct action'.  In Calcutta, a city with a predominantly Hindu population but significant Muslim presence, anti-Hindu sentiments fuelled by political machinations  and historical grievances led to widespread mob attacks. 

Chief Minister Huseyn Suhrawardy, while admired by Muslims, was reviled by Hindus for his perceived role in the Bengal famine of 1943. His rhetoric and alleged inaction during the eruptng violence contributed to the  tragedy. Estimates of the death toll range from 5,000 to 10,000, with many more wounded. The brutality and scale of the killings, including the use of sexual violence, foreshadowed the horrors to come with partition.</description>

			<title>Why the worst of food inflation may be over</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-the-worst-of-food-inflation-may-be-over-9516601/</link>
			<description>Food inflation in India has been a persistent issue, remaining above 8% for several months. While it dropped to 5.4% in July 2024, this decline is largely due to a high base effect. 

The recent monsoon, however, has brought positive developments. Abundant rainfall has led to higher acreage under various kharif crops, which could potentially ease inflationary pressure. Additionally, global food prices have been declining, making imports more feasible. This could provide further downward pressure on domestic prices.

Despite these developments, uncertainty persists as the harvesting season for kharif crops is still a few months away. The situation will become clearer in the coming months, but the good monsoon and low global food prices offer some reason for optimism.</description>

			<title>Why WHO has called the latest mpox outbreak an ‘emergency of international concern’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/why-latest-mpox-outbreak-is-emergency-of-international-concern-9516725/</link>
			<description>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to an upsurge in cases from the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries. 

Since 2022, over 99,176 cases and 208 deaths have been reported globally.  A new, more transmissible clade (Ib) of the mpox virus is spreading, raising concerns as it is primarily transmitted through sexual contact. Historically, clade Ib has been less common and spread through zoonotic events (animals to humans). The WHO is working to accelerate vaccine accessibility, particularly in lower-income countries, and is coordinating efforts to provide  therapeutics, diagnostics, and other necessary tools.</description>

			<title>The improbable 800 km journey of Stonehenge’s centre stone, and why that matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/800-km-journey-stonehenge-altar-stone-scotland-9516755/</link>
			<description>Stonehenge's Altar Stone, a six-tonne monolith at the heart of the stone circle, has been traced to the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, 800 km away. This discovery, using geochemical analysis, indicates a much wider collaborative network than previously believed, suggesting Neolithic Britain was more integrated than thought. 

The stone's origin challenges older assumptions and raises questions about its transportation, debated between overland and sea routes. Regardless of the method, the sheer effort involved points to a strong motive behind the stone's journey, highlighting the complexity and interconnectedness of Neolithic society.</description>

			<title>Why 44 and 60 could be two key ages in human aging, according to a new study</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/aging-44-and-60-new-study-9516477/</link>
			<description>A new study has identified two significant turning points in human aging: ages 44 and 60. Researchers at Stanford University analyzed data from over 108 participants, tracking changes in proteins, lipids, and microbiomes over a period of 1.7 years. 

They found distinct shifts in immune regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, cardiovascular health, and lipid processing at these ages, mirroring existing data on disease onset. Notably, caffeine metabolism also experiences notable changes at both points. 

The study's findings suggest that aging is not a linear process and sheds light on potential targets for slowing down age-related diseases. More research is needed to understand the underlying causes of these changes and develop potential interventions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/arizona-missouri-states-abortion-amendments-explained-9516155/</link>
			<description>The U.S. continues to see ongoing battles over abortion access, with several states putting the issue to a voter referendum this November.  Following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade,  states are moving to either enshrine or restrict abortion rights.  Seven states have already had these measures before voters since 2022,  with abortion-rights supporters winning in every case .  

This November, voters in Arizona, Missouri, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, South Dakota, and Montana  will be asked to weigh in on initiatives affecting abortion access.  These measures range from codifying existing protections to outright bans, reflecting the stark divide on this issue.  The outcome of these votes will have a significant impact on reproductive rights across the country.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-japan-pm-fumio-kishida-resigns-9516199/</link>
			<description>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has announced his resignation due to plummeting public trust in his government, triggered by scandals and a weak economy. His approval rating has dropped to a dismal 20%.  

Kishida's tenure was marked by controversies, including an illegal slush funds scandal and  alleged ties between the LDP and the Unification Church. He also faced economic challenges, with a weakening yen pushing up living costs despite his attempts to revitalize the economy with his "new capitalism" policies.

The LDP leadership race to replace Kishida begins soon, with potential candidates including Taro Kono, Toshimitsu Motegi, and Shigeru Ishiba. The winner will be elected prime minister by parliament.</description>

			<title>Why climate change poses an existential threat to Panama Canal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-existential-threat-panama-canal-9516055/</link>
			<description>The Panama Canal, a marvel of engineering completed in 1914, provides a crucial shortcut for ships travelling between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its operation relies on a complex system of locks and artificial lakes, requiring massive amounts of freshwater, primarily sourced from Lake Gatun.  

Recent droughts have significantly reduced lake levels, impacting canal traffic and highlighting the vulnerability of this vital waterway to climate change. While rainfall has improved temporarily, experts warn that prolonged rainfall deficits are becoming more common, posing a long-term threat. To address this, Panama plans to build a new dam on the Rio Indio to create a supplementary water source, but this proposal is controversial due to its potential to displace thousands of residents.</description>

			<title>What is the role of campaign cash in the US presidential election?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-the-role-of-campaign-cash-in-the-us-presidential-election-9514338/</link>
			<description>US presidential campaigns are increasingly reliant on massive fundraising, setting new records in recent years. The 2020 election saw a combined $5.7 billion spent by Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with this year’s race showing a similar trend. 

Vast sums are contributed by super-rich individuals and corporations, often seeking to influence policy. Super PACs, which can raise unlimited funds, have become key players, with over 2,257 active in the current election cycle. 

While donations don't necessarily swing election outcomes, they provide significant influence after elections, with donors potentially securing positions in government or access to elected officials. This raises concerns about the impact of wealth on political decision-making. Public opinion polls show strong support for campaign finance reform, but experts believe systemic changes are unlikely due to the current political landscape and the reliance on private funding for campaigns.</description>

			<title>What is the status of Hindus in Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-the-status-of-hindus-in-bangladesh-9514699/</link>
			<description>Since the fall of the Awami League government in August, Bangladesh's Hindu minority has experienced over 200 attacks, resulting in five reported fatalities.  The Hindu population in Bangladesh, which constituted around 7.96% of the country's total population in 2022, has been declining for decades.

Historical factors, including Partition and the subsequent demographic shift, have contributed to this decrease.

 While fertility rates have declined for both Hindus and Muslims, the fertility rate among Muslims historically remains higher. 

The 1971 Liberation War also saw a significant exodus of Hindus to India.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan celebrates Independence Day on August 14, and India on August 15</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/explained-pakistan-independence-day-9514028/</link>
			<description>Pakistan celebrates its Independence Day on August 14th, one day before India, due to the timing of the 1947 transfer of power from British rule. 

Lord Mountbatten, Viceroy of India, expedited the independence date to August 1947 amidst increasing communal tensions. The Indian Independence Bill set August 15th as the independence date for both India and Pakistan.  

The ceremony transferring power took place in Karachi on August 14th, 1947, before continuing in Delhi later that evening. Additionally, August 14th fell on a significant Islamic holy day.

Since 1948, Pakistan has celebrated Independence Day on August 14th, diverging from India's August 15th celebration.</description>

			<title>What were the first postage stamps of Independent India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/first-stamps-independent-india-9513918/</link>
			<description>The first postage stamps of independent India were issued on November 21, 1947, after a delay caused by the Partition. Three stamps were released, all featuring the date August 15, 1947, and "Jai Hind." One depicted the Indian flag, another the Lion Capital of Ashoka, and the third showed a Douglas DC-4 aircraft. 

Prior to independence, a formal postal system in India was established with the East India Company. The first GPO opened in Calcutta in 1774, followed by those in Madras and Bombay.  India became the first Asian country to issue its own postage stamps in 1852, with the "Scinde Dawk" introduced in the Sindh district.  Uniform postage rates were introduced across India in 1854.</description>

			<title>What is the drug Captagon, and how is it linked to Germany?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/drug-captagon-germany-link-explained-9513706/</link>
			<description>A trial commenced in Aachen, Germany, against four individuals accused of selling over €58 million worth of Captagon tablets internationally. This bust highlights a potential increase in Captagon’s presence in Europe. Initially developed as a treatment for attention deficit disorders in the 1960s and 70s, Captagon was later made illegal and its illicit production emerged in the early 2000s, mainly in eastern Europe and the Middle East.  

Prevalent among young adults in the Middle East as a party drug and used by Syrian conflict fighters, Captagon contains fenethylline, which breaks down into amphetamine and theophylline, resulting in stimulant effects. However, high fenethylline quantities and inconsistent compositions pose risks including cognitive impairment, cardiovascular issues, and addiction.   

Syria, dubbed the Middle East’s narco state, produces and exports most of the world’s Captagon, with the trade representing a significant economic lifeline for the Syrian government.  Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are actively combating Captagon smuggling from Syria and Lebanon. The European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) warns of Europe becoming a transshipment hub for Captagon, citing seizures across the continent and production in illegal EU labs.</description>

			<title>Why is the Delhi HC hearing a plea against the exclusion of Section 377 from the new criminal laws?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/delhi-high-court-exclusion-section-377-criminal-laws-9513667/</link>
			<description>The Delhi High Court has asked the Indian government to clarify its position on  non-consensual sexual offences against LGBTQIA+ individuals and men following the removal of Section 377 from the new criminal law, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). 

While Section 377 was decriminalised in 2018, concerns have been raised that the BNS lacks specific provisions protecting against non-consensual sexual acts between men. The court heard a PIL arguing that the absence of such protections puts LGBTQ+ individuals at risk.

The government argued that the court cannot direct the legislature to create a law. However, the court has instructed them to clarify their stance on the issue by August 28. 

  The BNS does have provisions for self-defense and addressing kidnapping with harmful intent, but it remains unclear if these adequately protect against sexual assault.</description>

			<title>How broiler chicken industry has become India’s most organised and vertically integrated agri-business</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/broiler-chicken-chhattisgarh-broiler-meat-poultry-farms-9512568/</link>
			<description>This article explores the rise of contract farming in the Indian broiler industry, focusing on the practices of IB Group/ABIS Exports (India) Private Limited.  

Larger broiler integrators like IB Group and Suguna Foods have completely transformed poultry farming through a vertically integrated model. They provide smallholders with chicks, feed, technical support, and a guaranteed market for their birds. This system has normalized commercial-scale broiler farming even for those with limited resources. 

IB Group stands out with its extensive network of hatcheries and feed plants, ensuring a consistent supply chain. They utilize sophisticated equipment like imported incubators and specialize in the Ross 308 AP broiler breed, sourced from Aviagen, a global poultry genetics leader. 

However, the industry faces a challenge in establishing a stronger "forward integration." While contracts exist for procuring birds, branded retail for dressed and processed chicken remains underdeveloped.</description>

			<title>Amid Hindenburg probe calls, look at JPCs on financial allegations</title>

			<description>The article discusses the Opposition's demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate allegations against Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, which the BJP has rejected. 

A JPC is a parliamentary committee formed to examine a specific issue in detail. It can access documents and interview officials.  It is up to the government to take action on a JPC's recommendations. 

JPCs have been formed in the past to investigate financial crimes like the 2G spectrum scam, the Ketan Parekh share market scam, and the Harshad Mehta securities scandal.</description>

			<title>Ex-ISI chief who went to Kabul after Taliban takeover, arrested: reasons and context</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameed-arrest-explained-9512096/</link>
			<description>Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (retd), Pakistan's former Director General of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), faces court martial proceedings. 

The court martial was ordered following Supreme Court observations regarding allegations made by a real estate company owner against Hameed.  
Hameed is accused of extortion and corruption during his service.  
He held the post of ISI chief from 2019 to 2021, a period marked by his close association with former Prime Minister Imran Khan.
  The charges against Hameed stem from a 2017 incident where he was allegedly involved in a raid on the real estate company's offices, leading to extortion accusations.


After a detailed court of inquiry, the Pakistan Army initiated disciplinary action against Hameed, leading to his arrest and confinement in an officers' mess, awaiting the court martial proceedings.</description>

			<title>Trump-Musk interview on X reportedly hit by DDoS attack: What it means</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/trump-musk-interview-ddos-attack-9511956/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk's live audio interview with Donald Trump on X was delayed by 40 minutes and plagued by glitches due to a "massive DDoS attack".  DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks overload a server with traffic from multiple sources, making the target service inaccessible. Attackers can use botnets, networks of compromised devices, to launch these attacks. 

The article explains two common DDoS attack types: the "Smurf Attack" which floods the target with ICMP packets from spoofed IP addresses, and the "SYN flood," which overwhelms the server with incomplete connection requests. Signs of a DoS attack include slow internet speed and inability to access a service.  Firewalls and security systems are crucial for detection and mitigation.</description>

			<title>What is Bangladesh’s St Martin’s Island, under spotlight after Sheikh Hasina’s resignation?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-st-martin-island-9511920/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, denied the authenticity of a statement allegedly published by a newspaper attributing a "resignation" to his mother. The fabricated statement claimed Hasina said she could have remained in power if she had ceded Saint Martin's Island and the Bay of Bengal to America.  

The statement is misconstrued from a 2023 speech by Hasina, in which she referenced the potential to lease Saint Martin's Island but stated she wouldn't do so.  She accused the opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), of seeking to sell the island.</description>

			<title>Why the withdrawal of the draft Broadcast Bill raises more questions than it answers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/withdrawal-draft-broadcast-bill-more-questions-explained-9511684/</link>
			<description>The Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting withdrew a revised draft of the Broadcast Bill, 2024, following criticism over its potential to regulate online content creators. The draft, shared privately with select stakeholders, sparked concern about government overreach into online spaces, particularly regarding independent creators on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. 

While the ministry cited ongoing consultations as a reason for the withdrawal, it has instead referred stakeholders back to a previous draft published in November 2023. This move has raised questions among those who were not privy to the 2024 draft about the future direction and scope of the bill. 

Concerns about the 2024 draft's expansive definition of "digital news broadcasters" and its potential to include even social media creators for registration and content regulation were flagged by industry professionals and tech companies.</description>

			<title>How Tungabhadra dam gate was swept away, why farmers are fearful</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/tungabhadra-dam-gate-swept-away-karnataka-flood-alert-d-k-shivakumar-dam-repair-work-9510416/</link>
			<description>A flood alert has been issued downstream of the Tungabhadra dam in Karnataka after one of its crest gates was washed away. The gate failed due to a broken chain link, succumbing to the force of water released from the dam. Repairs can only commence after a significant amount of water is drained from the reservoir, raising concerns about potential irrigation disruptions and increased downstream flooding. 

The incident occurred amidst heavy inflows into the dam, pushing water levels to capacity. The Tungabhadra Board has assured that steps are being taken to fabricate a new gate and complete repairs within a week.</description>

			<title>Once thriving, now all but gone: a history of Kerala’s Jewish communities</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/history-of-keralas-jewish-communities-who-are-paradesi-jew-indias-jewish-population-9510422/</link>
			<description>Queenie Hallegua, the last woman of Kerala’s Paradesi Jewish community, passed away recently, leaving her nephew as the sole remaining Paradesi Jew in the state.  This community, composed of Jews who migrated from the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th and 16th centuries, flourished in Kerala, particularly in Kochi. They were involved in the spice trade and adopted local customs and traditions. 

However, the Paradesi Jews gradually distanced themselves from the older Malabar Jewish community, leading to the formation of two distinct groups.  Since the 1950s,  many Kerala Jews, primarily from the Malabar community, have emigrated to Israel. Today, only a handful remain in Kerala, with remnants of their presence preserved in synagogues, historical buildings, and fading "Jew Streets."</description>

			<title>All you need to know about the Hindenburg-Adani-Buch saga</title>

			<description>Hindenburg Research has accused Sebi Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband of having stakes in offshore funds allegedly used in the Adani Group money siphoning scandal. 

The allegations stem from a January 2023 report by Hindenburg accusing the Adani Group of stock manipulation and fraud. Subsequent investigations by the Supreme Court-appointed expert committee and Sebi have been inconclusive. 

Hindenburg claims Buch invested in these funds before her Sebi appointment, while she and her husband maintain these were personal investments made based on the investor's track record, and subsequently redeemed when the CIO left.  Sebi has defended Buch, stating she made relevant disclosures and recused herself from potential conflicts of interest, while independently conducting its own investigation into the Hindenburg allegations.</description>

			<title>Why Ukraine has carried out incursion into Russia’s Kursk region</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukraine-russia-kursk-9510172/</link>
			<description>Ukraine has launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region, marking its largest advancement onto Russian soil since the war began. Ukrainian troops, numbering around 6,000 to 8,000, have advanced about 30 km, capturing settlements and tearing down Russian flags. While the attack's objectives remain unclear, experts speculate it could be aimed at strengthening Ukraine's negotiating position, seizing the Kursk nuclear power plant, or diverting Russian troops from the eastern front. 

Holding conquered territory will be challenging for Ukraine, requiring significant reinforcements.  Maintaining the momentum of this attack could prove crucial for Ukraine's overall war strategy.</description>

			<description>Hindenburg Research accused Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of India’s Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), of conflict of interest related to the Adani Group. The allegations sparked scrutiny on Buch's disclosures and recusal practices. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has strict ethical codes prohibiting employees from participating in matters where they or their close relations have a financial interest.  A Personal Trading Compliance System (PTCS) tracks employee holdings and requires pre-approval for transactions.  The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) defines conflict of interest broadly and requires employees to disclose actual or perceived conflicts on an ongoing basis. Both agencies have disciplinary actions for breaches, highlighting the seriousness with which conflicts of interest are taken.</description>

Puri Buch and her husband refuted the allegation, stating the investment predated her SEBI appointment and all necessary disclosures were made. SEBI's code on conflict of interest mandates full disclosure of holdings and prohibits board members from engaging in activities that could be perceived as benefiting them or related entities. The code emphasizes recusal from matters where a conflict of interest exists, ensuring objectivity and transparency in decision-making.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-centres-clean-plant-programme-plans-to-boost-production-of-fruits-9508509/</link>
			<description>The Union Cabinet approved the Clean Plant Programme (CPP) to boost horticulture crop yield and quality in India.  The programme will involve setting up nine Clean Plant Centers (CPCs) to provide disease diagnostics, create mother plants, and quarantine planting materials.  Additionally, it will enhance nurseries to multiply clean planting material and establish a regulatory system for traceability. 

The need for CPP arises from India's increasing horticultural production and import of fruit plants. Currently, imported plants face a two-year quarantine period. CPCs will reduce this to six months, improving farmers' access to disease-free planting material.</description>

			<description>Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are facing an extended stay on the International Space Station (ISS) due to technical issues with their spacecraft, the Boeing Starliner. They were initially scheduled to return after a week but are now expected to remain in space until February 2025.  The problems stem from multiple helium leaks detected in the Starliner's propulsion system.  While comfortable enough to house them for several months, this will be their longest unscheduled stay if they return in February. NASA and Boeing hope to resolve the issues soon, otherwise, they will return on a SpaceX spacecraft scheduled for a September launch.</description>

			<description>There are ongoing discussions surrounding Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch's investments and potential conflicts of interest. 

Questions have been raised about the completeness of her disclosures to the government regarding investments in global funds, including those linked to the Adani Group. While Buch and SEBI maintain she adhered to disclosure and recusal norms, former SEBI officials point out the lack of clarity on her actions during investigations into Adani-related entities.

They cite instances of past SEBI chairpersons recusing themselves from matters involving potential conflicts, emphasizing the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in such situations. The debate continues, with scrutiny focused on Buch's conduct as SEBI chairperson and her adherence to ethical principles.</description>

			<title>How China increased its medal haul at the Olympics and why the Games matter to it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-olympics-medals-gold-cpc-9508413/</link>
			<description>China's Olympic participation, starting in 1984, has been intertwined with its economic and political rise.  Initially driven by Deng Xiaoping's reforms, the country's success in sports was part of a larger strategy to improve its global image and demonstrate national strength.  

This strategy involved investing heavily in sports training, often from a young age, with significant pressure placed on athletes to achieve success. While China has consistently won medals, concerns have been raised about the system's focus on winning at all costs, with athletes facing immense pressure and limited opportunities beyond sports.  

Despite initial concerns, China ultimately hosted the 2008 Summer and 2022 Winter Olympics, showcasing its economic and political power. However, recent Games have been marred by criticisms of China's human rights record and a perceived tightening of control over information.</description>

			<title>After breaking free, why the world’s largest iceberg is stuck spinning in circles</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/a23a-largest-iceberg-antartica-9508012/</link>
			<description>The world's largest iceberg, A23a, is currently spinning in a vortex created by a seamount in the Southern Ocean.  After breaking off from the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, the massive iceberg  dwelled in the Weddell Sea for 34 years before finally freeing itself in 2020.  Since its release, A23a has been observed to rotate slowly, potentially for an extended period. 

The phenomenon of icebergs getting trapped in Taylor columns,  vortices formed around seamounts, is not well understood. While the iceberg poses no immediate threat to sea levels, its prolonged presence in the vortex could affect marine life. The iceberg's size and duration in the vortex remain notable phenomena for researchers studying ocean currents and iceberg behavior.</description>

			<title>How a knife attack triggered a wave of far-right protests across the UK</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-riots-asylum-immigration-protests-9507777/</link>
			<description>Following the deaths of three young girls in a knife attack at a dance workshop in Southport,  violence erupted across the UK. Anti-immigration and racist slogans were chanted by demonstrators, leading to widespread unrest and clashes with police. The attack, carried out by a 17-year-old British citizen, was followed by the spread of misinformation online, claiming the assailant was an asylum seeker.  This fueled far-right groups and resulted in attacks on mosques and asylum seeker centers in various cities while counter-protests from pro-refugee and pro-immigrant groups took place. The incident highlighted existing anti-immigration sentiments in the UK exacerbated by political rhetoric and public fears surrounding the influx of migrants. It also underscored the role of misinformation and social media in exacerbating tensions and inciting violence.</description>

			<title>Why Odisha is facing a potato crisis, with prices as high as Rs 60 per kg</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-potato-crisis-price-rise-9507693/</link>
			<description>Odisha is grappling with a severe potato shortage, causing prices to surge to Rs 55-60/kg. This shortage stems from West Bengal's decision to ban potato exports to stabilize domestic prices following a 20% drop in production due to unseasonal rains.  

Odisha, heavily reliant on West Bengal for its potato needs, has attempted to address the crisis by procuring potatoes from Uttar Pradesh through NAFED. The government aims to sell these at Rs 30/kg through designated outlets. 

Odisha's past attempts to become self-sufficient in potato production have failed due to insufficient cold storage facilities and poor market linkages, leading to distress sales post-harvest.</description>

			<title>Japan issues its first-ever ‘megaquake advisory’: What does it mean?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/japan-megaquake-advisory-9506703/</link>
			<description>Japan's meteorological agency issued its first-ever "megaquake advisory" following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake on August 8th. The advisory warns of a heightened risk of strong shaking and large tsunamis along the Nankai Trough, a subduction zone where tectonic plates collide.  

The trough has a history of producing large earthquakes roughly every 100 to 150 years, often in pairs. Experts fear the next tremor could be devastating, with a 70% probability of a magnitude 8-9 earthquake occurring within the next 30 years. 

Such an event could impact a third of Japan, home to half its population, causing up to $1.5 trillion in economic damage. The advisory, however, is not a prediction but a call for residents to prepare and review evacuation plans.</description>

			<title>What is behind Ukraine’s Kursk operation in Russia?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukraine-kursk-operation-russia-9506353/</link>
			<description>Ukrainian forces have made a surprise advance into Russia's Kursk region, reportedly reaching 35 kilometers (21 miles) inside Russian territory.  

The operation, potentially planned for months, is believed to be driven by several factors, including pressuring Moscow, establishing a buffer zone, and weakening the Russian army. 

While Ukraine has reportedly gained initial successes due to a perceived lack of Russian defenses, the long-term sustainability of the advance depends on sustained Western military support. 

The operation carries risks for Ukraine, potentially leading to higher casualties.  However, it has also achieved symbolic political wins by demonstrating Ukraine's capability to strike deep within Russian territory.</description>

			<title>Ocean temperatures in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef now hottest in 400 years: What a new study says</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ocean-temperatures-australia-great-barrier-reef-9506296/</link>
			<description>A new study reveals that water temperatures in and around Australia's Great Barrier Reef have reached their highest levels in 400 years over the past decade. This unprecedented warming, driven by human activity since 1900, has severely threatened the world's largest coral reef. 

Researchers analyzed coral cores dating back to 1618 and combined them with modern ship and satellite data.  Their findings show a steady temperature increase of 0.12 degrees Celsius per decade from 1960 to 2024, culminating in record-breaking high temperatures in 2023. These rising temperatures have led to five mass coral bleaching events since 2016, placing the reef at increased risk of death.</description>

			<title>Why are Rajasthan’s sanitation workers protesting?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-sanitation-workers-in-rajasthan-are-protesting-9506252/</link>
			<description>Sanitation workers in Rajasthan, primarily from the Valmiki community, have protested against a government recruitment drive for 24,000 sanitation worker positions. They demand preference for Valmikis, arguing that non-Valmiki workers subcontract the job, increasing their burden.  

The recruitment process, originally intended to favor Valmiki workers through restrictive experience criteria, was challenged in court by non-Valmiki communities. The High Court ruled in favor of the latter, forcing the government to adhere to inclusive recruitment rules. 

The Rajasthan government, under pressure from ongoing worker strikes, has halted the recruitment process and pledged to amend the rules to provide preference to Valmiki applicants.</description>

			<title>Explained: The US antitrust ruling against Google and its implications for India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/us-antitrust-ruling-against-google-and-its-implications-for-india-9505459/</link>
			<description>A US court ruled that Google is a monopolist and used anti-competitive practices to maintain its dominance in search and search advertising. 

The court specifically cited Google's "default" search engine status, secured through payments to companies like Apple and Samsung, as a significant advantage. This default position generates billions of queries for Google, discouraging competitors.  While the judgment focuses on the US market, it raises questions about the impact on ongoing litigation in India.

In India, Google has faced similar accusations. A recent Competition Commission of India (CCI) order penalized Google for forcing its suite of apps on Android devices.</description>

			<title>From pioneering microfinance to heading Bangladesh’s interim govt: Story of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/from-pioneering-microfinance-to-heading-bangladeshs-interim-govt-story-of-nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-9505433/</link>
			<description>Muhammad Yunus, known as the "father of microfinance",  was appointed Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government after student protests ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Yunus's  work with Grameen Bank, which provides microloans to the poor, has had a profound global impact. The model has been replicated worldwide but has faced criticism for potentially trapping borrowers in debt cycles.  

Yunus, a Nobel laureate, had previously clashed with Hasina, who accused him of  "sucking blood from the poor" and launched investigations against him and his Grameen group.  Over a decade, Yunus faced 174 legal cases, many of which he and his supporters claimed were politically motivated. Despite initial support from student protesters who orchestrated Hasina's removal, Yunus now faces significant challenges, including  mounting social and communal tensions and the need to address complex issues that sparked the protests.</description>

			<title>SC bail to Sisodia: Why Bench said trial delay, bail right must be read into PMLA Sec 45</title>

			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in a money laundering case. 

The Court emphasized that significant delays in trial and prolonged pre-trial detention,  should be considered grounds for waiving stringent bail conditions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 

While the PMLA has a high bar for bail, the Court ruled that the constitutional right to a speedy trial supersedes statutory provisions hindering bail.  It acknowledged the tendency of courts to be cautious in granting bail in PMLA cases and stated that when trials are unreasonably delayed, bail should be granted unless there are compelling reasons against it.</description>

			<description>Following weeks of violent protests that claimed over 300 lives, Bangladesh's interim government was formed with Mohammad Yunus as its Chief Advisor.  The government was established after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country. 

The selection of Yunus, a Nobel laureate economist, was reached following negotiations between the President, military leaders, and student protesters, who opposed a military-led government.  Yunus will oversee key ministries, including defense, education, and information, due to his prior conflict with the Hasina administration.  The new government also includes a diverse group of individuals with backgrounds in law, diplomacy, academia, human rights, and the military.</description>

			<title>Most tree planting campaigns fail. What has to change?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/most-tree-planting-campaigns-9504990/</link>
			<description>Many tree planting campaigns fail to deliver their intended climate benefits. A key problem is planting unsuitable trees in inappropriate locations or at the wrong time.  

Furthermore, a lack of long-term care and monitoring often leads to saplings dying, negating the initial effort. Successful initiatives prioritize planning, choose native species, and ensure ongoing support.

Involving local communities through education and job opportunities can enhance the success rate. Ultimately, focusing on healthy survival rates for a smaller number of trees is more effective than mass plantings with low success.</description>

			<title>Why silica dust could become the ‘new asbestos’ health risk</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/silica-dust-asbestos-health-risk-silicosis-9504526/</link>
			<description>Researchers advocate for stricter limits on daily silica dust exposure in various industries to prevent silicosis, a serious and potentially fatal lung disease.

The study, published in the British Medical Journal Thorax,  analysed eight existing studies and found that reducing exposure from 0.1 mg/m3 to 0.05 mg/m3 could significantly decrease silicosis cases. 

The researchers emphasize the urgency of addressing this issue, highlighting that the current global burden of silicosis remains unclear, particularly in developing countries. They stress the potential for widespread harm if appropriate safety measures are not implemented in high-risk occupations such as mining, construction, and dentistry.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in the Delhi excise policy case. The court found that Sisodia had been in jail for approximately 17 months without a trial, violating his right to a speedy trial. It also noted that while bail conditions exist under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, they can be relaxed considering the length of incarceration.  The court rejected arguments from the prosecution regarding delays in the case and Sisodia's potential flight risk, highlighting his "deep roots" in the country.  


Sisodia was released on bail with conditions including not tampering with witnesses, surrendering his passport, and reporting to the police regularly.</description>

			<title>What’s causing Antarctica’s deep-winter heatwave, what could be its fallout?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/whats-causing-antarcticas-deep-winter-heatwave-what-could-be-its-fallout-9503603/</link>
			<description>Antarctica is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave with temperatures 10 degrees Celsius higher than average for this time of year. This unusual warming is primarily attributed to a weakened polar vortex, a band of cold air that typically encircles the poles, which has allowed warmer air to enter the region. 

Other contributing factors include reduced Antarctic sea ice, which normally reflects sunlight and keeps temperatures low, and global warming, which is causing Antarctica to warm at a rate twice as fast as the global average.  

These higher temperatures threaten the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, potentially leading to significant sea level rise and disrupting the global ocean circulation system, further exacerbating climate change.</description>

			<title>Explained: The proposed changes to Waqf law</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/proposed-changes-to-waqf-law-9503596/</link>
			<description>The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, seeks to significantly alter the existing framework for Waqf governance in India.  

The Bill proposes transferring control from Waqf Boards and Tribunals to state governments. It introduces new provisions that allow the government to determine if a property deemed as Waqf is actually government land, and empowers the central government to order audits of Waqfs. 

The Bill also seeks to remove the concept of "Waqf by use," which previously allowed properties used for religious purposes to be deemed Waqf even without a formal declaration.  Finally, it proposes changes to the composition of Waqf Boards, allowing for non-Muslim CEOs and members.  

These changes have sparked controversy, with opposition parties characterizing the Bill as unconstitutional, anti-minority, and divisive.</description>

			<title>Sheikh Hasina in India amid UK asylum roadblock: What is India’s policy on refugees?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sheikh-hasina-refugee-india-policy-bangladesh-9503287/</link>
			<description>Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is currently in India after fleeing her country amid government protests. She was planning to seek asylum in the UK, but this proved difficult due to travel visa restrictions. India has chosen to accommodate her despite lacking a formal refugee policy. 

This situation highlights India's complex stance on refugees. While India has historically welcomed refugees like Tibetans and Chakmas, its treatment of Rohingya refugees has been inconsistent and often discriminatory. 

India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees and lacks a dedicated national refugee policy. This allows the government to classify refugees as illegal immigrants and deport them, although this process can be challenging. The case of Rohingya refugees demonstrates this, with India pledging deportation despite acknowledging the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits returning refugees to countries where they face persecution.</description>

			<title>An expert explains | View from China on Kamala Harris replacing Biden, the possibility of Trump 2.0</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-china-kamala-trump-us-elections-9502625/</link>
			<description>The unexpected turn of events in the US presidential race, with Biden withdrawing and Harris becoming the frontrunner, has significantly impacted China's political landscape.  

While China officially maintains neutrality, analysts express diverse opinions, with some seeing both Biden and Trump as detrimental to China's interests.  Trump is criticized for his trade war and blaming China for the pandemic, while Biden is seen as a more predictable opponent despite his stricter trade policies.

Many believe Harris's chances are weaker than Biden's and fear she might rely on more aggressive anti-China policies. A Chinese commentator argues that the US is heading towards a political crisis, regardless of the outcome, and both Trump's MAGA ideology and Harris's potential leadership will contribute to its decline.  

Chinese online discourse reflects this internal debate, showcasing both resentment towards Harris and concerns about the US's political instability.</description>

			<title>Why has the RBI policy panel kept interest rates unchanged for the 9th time in a row?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-mpc-interest-rates-unchanged-reason-9502138/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained its Repo rate at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive time, citing concerns over persistent food inflation.  The RBI kept its monetary policy stance at 'withdrawal of accommodation' and projected GDP growth for FY2025 at 7.2% and retail inflation at 4.5%.  

While the RBI acknowledged moderation in core inflation, food price volatility remains a concern, with the food component contributing significantly to overall inflation.  The decision leaves external benchmark lending rates unchanged, thus keeping EMIs on home and personal loans stable.  

Economists anticipate a potential rate cut in December 2024, contingent on favorable food inflation trends and absence of global or domestic shocks.  Global events, including potential US rate cuts and market fluctuations, are also being monitored by the RBI.</description>

			<title>How Pyrocumulonimbus clouds are formed when wildfires spit storms, lightning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/pyrocumulonimbus-cloud-when-wildfires-spit-storms-lightning-9501605/</link>
			<description>Wildfires in North America have intensified to the point of forming 'pyrocumulonimbus' clouds, capable of producing thunderstorms and sparking new fires.  These clouds form when extremely hot wildfires, reaching temperatures of 800 degrees Celsius or higher, release immense heat, causing surrounding air to rise and condense, forming  clouds. 

Typically gray or brown, these clouds can grow into towering pyrocumulonimbus clouds, reaching heights of 50,000 feet.  While they generate lightning, they produce little rain, increasing the risk of new fire ignition. These clouds also contribute to rapid and unpredictable wildfire spread due to strong winds.

The increasing frequency of these clouds may be linked to climate change, which intensifies both wildfires and atmospheric conditions favorable for their formation.</description>

			<title>What is a bailey bridge, used during Wayanad rescue ops</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-bailey-bridge-9501624/</link>
			<description>The Indian Army's Madras Engineer Group rapidly deployed a Bailey bridge in Wayanad after landslides devastated the region. This 190-foot bridge, capable of carrying 24 tonnes, has become vital for transporting essential supplies and personnel to the affected areas, including Mundakkai village. 

Originating during World War II, Bailey bridges are known for their quick assembly and transportability, consisting of modular steel panels that can be easily linked together.  Their flexibility and robustness make them ideal for disaster relief and military operations. India's armed forces have long utilized Bailey bridges, with notable deployments in the 1971 war and during the Uttarakhand floods.</description>

			<title>Who is Namal Rajapaksa, Mahinda’s son who could be Sri Lanka’s next president?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-is-namal-rajapaksa-mahindas-son-who-could-be-sri-lankas-next-president-9501142/</link>
			<description>Namal Rajapaksa, 38, son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has been chosen as the presidential candidate for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).  He will face incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the September 21 election. 

Namal's candidacy brings both hope and skepticism as Sri Lanka grapples with economic and political recovery after the 2022 uprising that ousted his uncle, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.   He seeks to follow in his father's footsteps, leveraging his family's political connections and striving for broader appeal.  However, his association with the Rajapaksa legacy, marked by both achievements and controversies, presents a significant challenge.</description>

			<title>Vinesh Olympics disqualification: What is weight cutting, and why is it controversial?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/vinesh-olympics-disqualification-what-is-weight-cutting-and-why-is-it-controversial-9500983/</link>
			<description>Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the gold medal bout due to being overweight highlights the controversial practice of weight cutting in combat sports. 

While weight classes aim for fairness, athletes often drastically reduce weight before weigh-ins to gain an advantage by quickly rehydrating and consuming carbohydrates. This practice can have severe health consequences, including dehydration, heart problems, and even death. 

Some experts advocate for a ban on weight cutting, citing its inherent risks and lack of scientific evidence supporting its safety. Organizations like ONE Championship have implemented stricter rules, including multiple weigh-ins and hydration testing, to mitigate risks. Critics argue that  "safe" weight-cutting methods may still have long-term health implications and call for further research on the topic.</description>

			<title>How India views the situation in Bangladesh: Summary of EAM Jaishankar’s address to Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-india-view-bangladesh-jaishankar-parliament-address-9500894/</link>
			<description>India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar provided a detailed explanation of India's stance on the recent crisis in Bangladesh in a Parliament address. He emphasized the long-standing close ties between the two nations and underscored India's concerns about the "tension" and "polarisation" that followed January's contested election. 

Jaishankar revealed that India had privately counselled restraint and dialogue to the Hasina government while also engaging with opposition parties. He outlined the cascading events leading to Hasina's resignation, driven by escalating violence and public agitation, culminating in her request to seek refuge in India. 

He highlighted the crucial role of the Bangladesh Army chief in the unfolding situation and urged the new establishment to ensure the safety and security of Indian citizens and diplomatic facilities. The statement also addressed the welfare of minorities in Bangladesh, expressing concern while acknowledging efforts for their protection.  Jaishankar concluded by calling for continued national consensus in navigating this complex situation regarding a crucial neighbor.</description>

			<title>Expert Explains: Making sense of the political upheaval in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-9500517/</link>
			<description>The recent student-led protests against government job quotas in Bangladesh ultimately led to the resignation and departure of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 

The protests, which began over economic inequality, gained momentum after the deaths and injuries of demonstrators at the hands of police and Awami League supporters. Hasina's insensitive comments about the protesters sparked outrage and further fueled the movement. 

A short-lived power vacuum followed, but an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was established to restore order and rebuild public trust. The Awami League, despite facing significant challenges, is expected to remain a key player in Bangladesh's future politics.</description>

			<title>Why has the draft Broadcast Services Bill 2024 raised concerns of freedom of speech?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-broadcast-draft-services-bill-freedom-speech-9500124/</link>
			<description>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has proposed a draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024, which aims to regulate independent news creators on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. The draft defines "digital news broadcasters" broadly and requires prior registration and adherence to content standards. This includes forming content evaluation committees at creators' expense and sharing their details with the government. 

The bill proposes a hefty fine of Rs 50 lakh for the first violation and Rs 2.5 crore for subsequent violations for not complying with these regulations.  The government justifies this expansion by citing the role of independent creators during the recent elections, where some content was deemed to make sensational claims about the government.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court to review PMLA verdict: what is the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-supreme-court-review-pmla-verdict-9500075/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court is set to revisit its ruling upholding key provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on August 28th. This follows a review petition filed by Congress MP Karti Chidambaram challenging aspects like the reversal of the presumption of innocence for bail and the ED's powerful investigative jurisdiction. 

The petitions argue that the stringent bail conditions under PMLA deny accused individuals the chance to present their case effectively, as they lack access to crucial information. They also contest the ED's classification as distinct from "police," highlighting the potential for abuse of power due to its ability to record statements admissible in court without providing a copy of the ECIR to the arrested individual. The court's decision will have significant implications for the balance between effective money laundering prevention and the rights of the accused.</description>

			<title>In water-starved Punjab, why plans for a new irrigation canal have raised concerns</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-water-starved-punjab-plans-for-a-new-irrigation-canal-raise-several-concerns-9499220/</link>
			<description>Punjab proposes a new 149.53-km irrigation canal, the Malwa canal,  estimated to cost Rs 2,300 crore. The canal aims to address water distribution issues in Punjab's southwest. 

Currently, high demand for irrigation water during paddy sowing season strains the existing Sirhind Feeder canal, requiring rotation of supplies. The Malwa canal is intended to alleviate this pressure and provide a reliable water source to seven districts, irrigating 2 lakh acres. 

The project faces hurdles including funding constraints and technical viability concerns raised by some experts. Environmental clearances and land acquisition processes need to be completed before construction can begin.</description>

			<title>Bill seeks to expand NDMA role, fails to strengthen its status</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/disaster-management-ndma-role-expansion-ndma-operational-efficiencies-natural-disaster-9499210/</link>
			<description>The government has introduced a Bill amending the Disaster Management Act, 2005, aiming to enhance operational efficiency in disaster response.  

The Bill proposes expanding the National Disaster Management Authority's (NDMA) role and responsibilities, making it mandatory for states to raise disaster relief forces, and establishing Urban Disaster Management Authorities for major cities.  

However, the amendment fails to strengthen NDMA's institutional status, leaving it without a vice-chairperson and limited financial and human resources. Despite acknowledging the increasing global disaster risks, the Bill neglects to empower NDMA with the necessary resources and authority to effectively handle future crises.</description>

			<title>Explained: The debate over GST on health insurance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goods-and-services-tax-gst-on-health-insurance-gst-withdrawal-life-insurance-rahul-mamata-9499214/</link>
			<description>The government's 18% GST on health and life insurance premiums, coupled with rising healthcare costs, has made insurance less affordable. Opposition leaders and insurance agents are calling for a reduction or exemption of GST, arguing that it burdens policyholders and hinders the "Insurance for All by 2047" goal.  

While insurance companies cite inflation as a cost driver, they are accused of not passing on potential GST savings to customers.  Concerns have been raised about the declining renewal rates of health insurance policies due to frequent premium hikes.  The Standing Committee on Finance has recommended rationalizing GST rates on health, term, and micro insurance policies to make them more affordable.</description>

			<title>Before Bangladesh and Sheikh Hasina, how leaders of Sri Lanka and Afghanistan fled amid turmoil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-south-asian-leaders-fled-turmoil-9498845/</link>
			<description>Days of unrest propelled by widespread protests forced Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power, leading her to flee to India, potentially seeking refuge in London.  The situation evokes memories of similar turmoil in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in recent years. In 2022, Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis prompting widespread protests known as the “Aragalaya.” This led to the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who later settled in Thailand. In 2021, the Taliban swiftly captured Afghanistan, resulting in President Ashraf Ghani’s abrupt departure.   His actions drew criticism, but he cited a fear for his safety.  These events highlight the instability plaguing South Asia as economic woes and public discontent escalate.</description>

			<description>Stock markets globally plummeted recently, driven by a "yen carry trade" reversal.  The Bank of Japan (BoJ) had kept interest rates low, encouraging investors to borrow yen and invest in higher-yield markets. However, the BoJ raised rates, weakening the yen and prompting investors to sell off their investments, causing a market sell-off.  This signifies a significant shift in global monetary policy, as the BoJ's actions have rippling effects on international markets.</description>

They criticize Google's ad-ranking system as opaque, claiming it inflates ad prices through trademark bidding practices that benefit Google. ADIF also accuses Google of self-preferencing its own services, hindering competitor access and impacting startups.

			<description>Noah Lyles won the men's 100m gold in a thrilling photo finish at the Paris Olympics.  He edged out Jamaica's Kishane Thompson by a mere 0.005 seconds, both clocking a time of 9.78 seconds.  This marked the first time in history that all eight finalists in a 100m race achieved sub-10 second times under legal wind conditions.  

The tight competition saw Lyles using his experience to dip just slightly ahead of Thompson as they crossed the finish line, with his torso breaking the line first.  

The race was incredibly close, initially appearing to be Thompson's victory based on overhead camera views that showed his foot ahead. However, the fully automated photo finish system, which takes into account the athlete's torso crossing the line, ultimately awarded Lyles the win.</description>

			<description>The relationship between India and Bangladesh has significantly improved since 2009, with Bangladesh becoming India's primary trade partner in the subcontinent. Both countries benefit from strong economic ties, with  Bangladesh being a major export market for Indian cotton and India being a significant importer of Bangladeshi garments. 

Discussions are underway for a potential free trade agreement (FTA) that could further boost trade and investment.  

India has also invested heavily in Bangladesh's infrastructure, including rail and port development, enhancing connectivity and accessibility to the Northeast region. 

Any disruption to this relationship due to political changes in Bangladesh could negatively impact trade, investment, and regional connectivity.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-the-50-year-old-relationship-between-india-and-sheikh-hasina-9497123/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's recent visit to India follows the army's takeover in Bangladesh. Hasina, daughter of slain Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, found refuge in India after the 1975   assassination, forging deep ties with the Indian leadership.  

Her Awami League regime brought stability and economic growth, benefiting from India's support in tackling terrorism and strengthening bilateral ties. Despite concerns over her  election legitimacy and crackdowns on opposition, India refrained from criticism, prioritizing strategic interests.

The military coup presents a new challenge for India. It must navigate the changing political landscape, potential fallout from past support, and the risk of renewed unrest and anti-India sentiment. Maintaining security cooperation with the Bangladeshi security establishment is crucial for India's regional stability.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/new-delhi-dhaka-challenges-9496876/</link>
			<description>The fall of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh presents a major geopolitical challenge for India. While India has a history of supporting Bangladesh, the current situation necessitates a delicate balancing act. Delhi must avoid being overly identified with Hasina, while simultaneously ensuring a peaceful transition to a new government.  

India needs to engage with Bangladeshi opposition figures, mitigate the influence of Pakistan, China, and Turkey, and navigate the complexities of Bangladesh's historical divisions. Recognizing the agency of Bangladeshi actors and transcending partition-era pathologies will be crucial for building a stable and enduring relationship. India's response will determine the future trajectory of Indo-Bangladesh relations in a rapidly changing regional landscape.</description>

			<title>Why Hasina’s fall was not a surprise — and what India must prepare for now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hasina-bangladesh-india-9496783/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh has resigned amidst widespread protests, forcing her to flee the country.  Her government faced growing dissatisfaction due to allegations of rigged elections, suppression of political dissent, and a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hasina's rule, marked by authoritarian tendencies and a crackdown on opposition, alienated many, including young people, who took to the streets demanding change. The situation escalated rapidly, culminating in her resignation and departure.  This development poses a significant challenge for India, which had enjoyed strengthened ties with Bangladesh under Hasina's leadership.  New Delhi now faces the task of navigating the unstable political landscape and mitigating potential negative impacts on the bilateral relationship.</description>

			<title>Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, Jamaat-e-Islami: What to know about 5 key figures in Bangladesh politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sheikh-hasina-jamaat-awami-bnp-bangladesh-9496706/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled to India amidst widespread protests against her government. The demonstrations, sparked by student-led agitations over expanded government job quotas for descendants of freedom fighters, reflect a broader discontent with Hasina's 15-year rule.

Opposition parties, including Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the January elections, alleging rigging.  The BNP, historically a strong force with roots in student politics, has seen its popularity decline.  

Amidst the unrest, Hasina's Awami League, which currently holds power, faces scrutiny over its handling of recent elections and alleged crackdowns on political opponents. 

Meanwhile, the army has announced the formation of an interim government.</description>

			<title>As Sheikh Hasina flees, what does it mean for India? Six preliminary takeaways from Bangladesh’s crisis</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-coup-protests-9496240/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned amid widespread protests over the job quota system. Despite leading Bangladesh through economic growth, Hasina's crackdown on opposition and media created unrest, culminating in her departure for India. This unexpected event marks the end of her 17-year tenure and presents challenges for both Bangladesh and India. India, a close ally of Hasina, faces the delicate task of balancing its support for her while navigating the complexities of the new political landscape in Bangladesh. Concerns arise about potential instability and the rise of anti-India sentiment if the new government adopts a hostile stance.  The role of the Bangladesh Army Chief, who will lead an interim government with political parties, will be crucial in determining the country's future direction.</description>

			<title>Markets are down, but there’s no need to panic. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/markets-crash-sensex-nifty-reason-9496024/</link>
			<description>The Indian Sensex fell sharply by 2.5% on Monday, attributed to global concerns. Experts believe the drop is driven by fears of a US recession, tensions in the Middle East, and  an unwinding of carry trade in Japan.  

Global markets also witnessed significant declines, with the Nikkei and Kospi Composite indices in Japan and South Korea falling over 12% and 8.8% respectively.  

While the Indian economy remains strong, the market's recent surge had pushed valuations to high levels. Experts advise investors against panic selling, recommending a cautious approach and focusing on large-cap investments. They also suggest tempering return expectations for equities in the near future.</description>

			<title>SC rules Delhi L-G can directly nominate Municipal Corporation ‘aldermen’: What was the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-mcd-delhi-lg-aldermen-9495832/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) has the authority to nominate aldermen to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) without consulting the Delhi government's Council of Ministers.  

The court's decision upheld the L-G's January 2023 nomination of 10 aldermen, stating that the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act explicitly grants this power to the L-G. 

This ruling is significant because aldermen play a crucial role in the MCD's functioning, including the selection of the Standing Committee, which is responsible for key administrative functions.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification: How CJI underlined substantive equality</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-cji-substantive-equality-9495522/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently ruled on sub-classification of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) quotas, emphasizing the principle of “substantive equality”.  This means the law should account for historical injustices and different backgrounds, ensuring benefits reach those most in need.

The Court's interpretation evolved over time. It initially viewed reservations as exceptions to equal opportunity, leading to limitations.  However, subsequent rulings, like State of Kerala v. N M Thomas (1975), broadened the scope of reservations, seeing them as a part of ensuring equality of opportunity.

Despite concerns about efficiency, the Court ultimately  recognized that reservation is not antithetical to efficient administration.  The recent judgment emphasizes that achieving substantive equality  requires expanding the scope of reservations, acknowledging that mere merit does not always equate to efficiency.</description>

			<title>RBI policy: Why Monetary Policy Committee is likely to keep repo rate steady</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rbi-policy-monetary-policy-committee-repo-rate-steady-9495243/</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee is likely to maintain the repo rate at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive policy meeting.  Experts predict a 4:2 vote in favor of keeping the rate unchanged, with the MPC continuing its withdrawal of accommodation stance. 

Concerns over elevated food inflation, which increased to 8.4% in June, are cited as a key reason for the anticipated decision. While headline inflation edged up to 5.1% in June, the RBI projects it to fall towards 4% in the third quarter, but with potential upside risks due to an uneven monsoon.  
Experts anticipate maintaining the FY25 real GDP growth forecast at 7.2% and foresee the possibility of a repo rate cut in December 2024 or later, contingent upon favorable inflation trends and economic data.</description>

			<title>What is a Bailey bridge, constructed in Wayanad after landslides?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/bailey-bridge-wayanad-landslides-9494949/</link>
			<description>Deadly landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district resulted in over 219 deaths and hundreds missing.  The Indian Army, facing difficulties due to constant rain, erected a 190-foot Bailey bridge to access the hard-hit area of Mundakkai village.  

Bailey bridges, invented during World War II, are pre-fabricated structures made of light steel panels linked by pins. The modular design allows for quick assembly and dismantlement, making it ideal for disaster relief and wartime use. The bridge's weight-carrying capacity allows for the movement of heavy machinery and personnel, proving crucial in rescue efforts.</description>

			<title>Are deep-sea metals a vital resource or an environmental disaster in the making?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/deep-sea-metals-vital-resource-environmental-disaster-9494429/</link>
			<description>Negotiations in Jamaica regarding the potential for deep-sea mining have highlighted deep divisions.  While countries like China and Norway push for swift agreement to commence mining operations, others, including Germany, Brazil, and Palau, demand thorough environmental impact assessments before any approval. 

Growing international concern has led to 32 countries favoring a suspension or ban on deep-sea mining, a position supported by environmental groups and scientists who warn about the potential for irreversible damage to vulnerable marine ecosystems. 

Despite these concerns, The Metals Company, a Canadian startup, plans to apply for a mining license in the coming months. The primary target is manganese nodules, rich in metals crucial for electric vehicle batteries, found in areas of the ocean floor classified as the "common heritage of mankind." 

Critics argue that the environmental risks outweigh potential benefits, and that the resources are not necessary for the energy transition.  Major companies like SAP, BMW, and Volkswagen have already pledged to avoid using deep-sea mined materials. Norway and Japan are also pushing forward with their own mining plans, facing legal challenges and scientific warnings.</description>

			<title>What is the impact of Ukrainian sanctions on Russian oil flows into the EU?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukraine-sanctions-russian-oil-eu-9494144/</link>
			<description>Ukraine's decision to sanction Russian oil company Lukoil has disrupted pipeline crude oil supplies to Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.  While the EU has prohibited seaborne Russian oil imports, these countries have been permitted to continue receiving oil through pipelines due to their geographical dependence.  However, Ukraine's move threatens Hungary's energy security, leading to decreased imports but potential electricity price hikes and power cuts if a solution isn't found. 

Despite EU efforts to encourage member states to reduce their reliance on Russian gas, Hungary, Slovakia, and Austria remain heavily dependent on Russian gas via pipelines. This dependence could further escalate as Ukraine's transit contract for Russian gas expires in December 2024, potentially cutting off Russian pipeline gas to Europe via Ukraine starting January 2025.</description>

			<title>From Trump rally shooting to Kamala Harris as new candidate, what July meant for the US elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-july-2024-in-us-elections-9494017/</link>
			<description>The US political landscape experienced significant shifts in July.  Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt and chose Senator J D Vance as his Vice Presidential running mate.  President Biden withdrew from the race, paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. Harris's nomination has energized the Democratic party and positioned her as a strong contender against Trump.  

As she selects her own Vice Presidential candidate, Harris faces a choice between balancing the ticket with a candidate who contrasts her demographics and political views, or "doubling down" with a like-minded individual.  Recent polls indicate a close race between Harris and Trump, with Harris gaining momentum following her nomination.
Key decisions in the coming months will shape the US election, including Harris's VP pick and the political messaging employed by both campaigns.</description>

			<title>How a new tech promises to kill weeds in rice and wheat fields, remove need for stubble-burning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/kill-weeds-rice-wheat-fields-stubble-burning-9493286/</link>
			<description>Agricultural scientists are making strides towards more sustainable rice and wheat farming practices.  New rice varieties and wheat hybrids, developed by both public and private sectors, are engineered to tolerate the herbicide Imazethapyr. This allows farmers to effectively control weeds without the need for extensive water usage, field flooding, or plowing, reducing the ecological footprint of these crops.  

These "imazethapyr-tolerant" crops represent a significant advancement in sustainable agriculture. Direct-seeded rice and zero-tillage wheat technologies, combined with Imazethapyr, promise water savings, reduced labor costs, and lessened environmental impact. 



What's more, these technologies utilize a mutation in the plant's existing ALS gene, eliminating concerns related to genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  This approach is expected to encourage wider adoption, leading to more climate-smart and environmentally friendly agricultural practices.</description>

			<title>From pigeon shooting to tug-of-war, 5 sports that are no longer part of the Olympics</title>

			<description>This article explores five Olympic events that are no longer included in the Games.  

Live pigeon shooting, held at the 1900 Paris Olympics, involved competitors killing as many live pigeons as possible. It was later replaced by clay pigeon shooting. Hot air ballooning, a demonstration sport at the 1900 Games, featured various contests over several months. Tug-of-war, contested between 1900 and 1920, was a physical battle of strength. Underwater swimming, also known as "static swimming," required athletes to remain motionless underwater for the greatest distance. Finally, running deer shooting involved hitting a moving target shaped like a deer.</description>

			<title>Russia-US prisoner exchange: How prisoners become pawns in international power politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/prisoners-international-power-politics-swaps-9493235/</link>
			<description>A recent prisoner swap between Russia and the West saw Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, both American citizens convicted of espionage, freed in exchange for eight individuals held in European and US prisons. This exchange highlights the complex dynamics of prisoner negotiations, where the price of freedom is often influenced by factors like political pressure, the detainee's profile, and the potential for reciprocal concessions. 

Historical examples, from ancient Greece to modern-day, illustrate how prisoners have been used as bargaining chips in international relations.  Past swaps, like the Powers-Abel exchange during the Cold War, demonstrate the role of intelligence and strategic motivations in determining prisoner releases.  

Critics argue that paying high prices for prisoner releases, as seen in the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case, encourages hostile regimes to engage in similar tactics.  The recent swap has also drawn scrutiny for the perceived imbalance in the profiles of those released from each side. Ultimately, the negotiations surrounding prisoner releases involve difficult choices and ethical considerations, with no simple solutions.</description>

			<title>What is the story of Abhimanyu and the chakravyuh, invoked by Rahul Gandhi in Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-story-of-abhimanyu-and-the-chakravyuh-invoked-by-rahul-gandhi-9491836/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi's recent criticism of the Indian budget, likening it to a  "lotus-shaped chakravyuh", drew comparisons to the Mahabharata battle strategy.  The chakravyuh, a difficult military formation, trapped Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, who knew only how to enter it, not exit.  Despite his bravery and skill, Abhimanyu was overwhelmed and killed by six Kaurava warriors, highlighting the ethical complexities of war.  Gandhi's use of this analogy suggests a critique of a powerful, controlling force that traps and limits individuals, drawing parallels to the historical struggle.</description>

			<title>Paris Olympics: In Imane Khelif vs Angela Carini boxing controversy, why issue of gender took centre stage</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/explained-the-gender-issue-in-the-imane-khelif-vs-angela-carini-boxing-match-controversy-9491846/</link>
			<description>Imane Khelif, an Algerian boxer, won her Round of 16 match at the Paris Olympics after her opponent, Angela Carini from Italy, withdrew early. Khelif's win sparked controversy and abuse due to speculation about her gender identity and potential biological advantages. 

The International Boxing Association (IBA) had previously banned Khelif and another boxer from competing in their World Championship, citing "gender eligibility" issues. However, Khelif and the other athlete are competing at the Olympics because the IBA was derecognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC's eligibility rules for Paris rely solely on an athlete's passport-stated gender.

This case highlights the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes' participation in women's sports, particularly concerning testosterone levels and potential competitive advantages. Different sports federations have implemented varying regulations, adding complexity to the issue.</description>

			<title>What is the potential fallout of Israel’s killing of senior Hamas, Hezbollah leaders?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-senior-hamas-hezbollah-leaders-9491777/</link>
			<description>A series of targeted assassinations has drastically escalated the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel killed top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, and purported Hamas attack planner Mohammed Deif. This was seen as a victory for Israel, aimed at neutralizing Hamas and demonstrating its resolve after the October 7th attacks.

However, these killings have inflamed tensions in the region, raising the risk of all-out war. Iran, which sponsors both Hezbollah and Hamas, has vowed retaliation. Possible Iranian responses include aerial strikes against Israel, coordinating attacks with its allies, or targeting Israeli officials abroad.  These scenarios pose significant security risks for India, including its citizens living in the region and its energy security, as a major portion of its crude oil and natural gas imports come from the West Asian region.</description>

			<title>Paris Olympics boxing gender debate: Why was Imane Khelif allowed to compete against Angela Carini?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/olympics-boxing-imane-khalif-ban-9491555/</link>
			<description>The Paris Olympics saw controversy after two boxers, Imane Khelif (Algeria) and Lin Yu-ting (Chinese Taipei), were allowed to compete despite failing gender eligibility tests.  The International Boxing Association (IBA) had banned them, citing a 'separate and recognized test' which they did not disclose. However, the IOC, which deregistered the IBA due to management and financial disputes, overruled the decision, stating the boxers' passports declared them female. 

The IOC allows sports federations to set their own eligibility criteria, as long as they adhere to principles of fairness, inclusion, and no presumption of advantage. Other sports, like athletics and swimming, have implemented specific testosterone limits for transgender athletes. The situation highlights the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes' participation in sports.</description>

			<title>Apex court rules states can sub-classify SCs and STs for quota: Tribal and Dalit communities that may be affected</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sub-classify-sc-st-quota-9491254/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruling allows states to sub-classify Scheduled Castes for reservation purposes based on varying degrees of social backwardness.  

The article examines significant SC and tribal communities in ten Indian states. 

In Maharashtra, the Mahar and Matang communities are prominent among SCs, while Gond and Bhil are significant tribal groups. Rajasthan sees Meghwal as the largest SC community, while Meena tribals hold political influence. Odisha has a large Khond tribal population and a diverse SC population dominated by the Pan community. Chhattisgarh's Gond population is substantial, as are its SC communities, with a large group known by various names. Madhya Pradesh sees the larger SC group traditionally engaged in leather work, while Bhil and Gond communities are prominent tribals.  

West Bengal has Rajbanshi and Matua communities as the dominant SC groups, while Gujarat's Vankar SC community stands out for its educational and job achievements. Assam's Bodo tribe is politically influential, while Tripura has a significant Tripuri population, and Uttarakhand has Harijan and Balmiki communities as prominent among SCs.</description>

			<title>Explained: Legal challenges to the Great Nicobar infrastructure project</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/legal-cases-greater-nicobar-infra-project-9490929/</link>
			<description>The Great Nicobar Island (GNI) infrastructure project, a 
Rs 72,000 crore undertaking involving an airport, 
transshipment terminal, and township, has faced legal 
challenges due to concerns about its environmental and social 
impact.  Legal challenges centre on the project's potential 
damage to biodiversity, inadequate environmental impact 
studies, and lack of transparency in the clearance process. 
Organizations and activists argue that the project threatens 
the island's fragile ecosystem and the rights of indigenous 
communities.  Although a National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed 
high-powered committee found the project's port location 
outside a prohibited zone,  concerns remain about coral 
conservation and limited data collection.  The project also 
faces scrutiny over its strategic implications, given 
India's increasing focus on maritime security in the region.</description>

			<title>Why the Odisha government will plant palm trees to combat lightning strikes</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/lightning-strikes-palm-trees-odisha-9490868/</link>
			<description>Odisha faces a significant problem with lightning strikes, which have killed over 3,000 people in the last decade. To address this, the government has approved a plan to plant 19 lakh palm trees, aiming to act as lightning conductors. However, experts have raised concerns about the effectiveness of this strategy, highlighting the long time it takes for palm trees to mature and the risk of fire after lightning strikes. They advocate for data-driven solutions and a comprehensive approach that includes public awareness campaigns about lightning safety.</description>

			<title>Sub-classification of SCs, STs: Could OBC model for ‘creamy layer’ be a blueprint?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/identifying-the-creamy-layer-model-of-obc-reservation-9489999/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has permitted the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes  to create separate quotas for the most backward within these communities. This decision follows a similar practice for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), where a "creamy layer" exclusion is implemented. 

The court acknowledged the need for a specific criteria for identifying the creamy layer within SC and ST communities, though no exact framework was proposed. Justice Pankaj Mithal suggested differentiating between those studying in urban and rural educational institutions as a potential factor. 


Implementing this sub-classification will require states to establish committees, similar to the one formed for OBCs, to define the criteria for excluding the creamy layer from reservation benefits.</description>

			<title>Explained: Supreme Court’s verdict on sub-classification of SCs and STs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-sub-classification-of-sc-st-9489996/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can sub-classify Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) communities to provide wider protections to more backward groups within these categories. This overturns a 2004 decision that deemed SCs and STs as a homogenous group. 

The court recognized that there are internal differences within SCs and STs and that states have the power to identify levels of social backwardness.  States will need to provide empirical evidence and a reasonable rationale for sub-classifying communities.  

Justice Gavai also suggested introducing a 'creamy layer' exception for SCs and STs, similar to the one for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), to ensure that reservations benefit those most in need. However, this opinion was not shared by the majority.</description>

			<title>Use data, reason, don’t split to keep out: How Supreme Court lays down red lines in sub-classification verdict</title>

			<description>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing sub-classification within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes quotas, but set strict guidelines. States cannot micro-classify in a way that undermines equality or replaces it with excessive categorization. They must provide "reasonable" grounds based on empirical data and subject to judicial scrutiny.

The ruling uses the example of farm loan waivers to illustrate that states must prove the rationality of any distinctions they make. Justice BR Gavai, in a concurring opinion, advocates for a "creamy layer" framework even for SC/ST quotas to ensure that affirmative action benefits those most in need.</description>

			<description>Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia since March 2023 on espionage charges, was released in a large prisoner swap between the US and Russia. Gershkovich, who had reported from Moscow before for other news agencies, denied the accusations and his trial was widely criticized as a sham. The swap is part of ongoing negotiations between the two countries, and involves the release of other Americans held in Russia, including former marine Paul Whelan.  In exchange, Russia is expected to see the release of its citizens imprisoned in the West.</description>

			<title>SUV driver gets bail in Delhi UPSC aspirants’ death case: What is the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/driver-upsc-aspirants-death-culpable-homicide-murder-9489509/</link>
			<description>A Delhi court granted bail to businessman Manoj Kathuria, accused in the drowning deaths of three UPSC aspirants at Rau's IAS Study Circle. Kathuria was driving his SUV on a waterlogged road, causing a wave that flooded the basement where the aspirants were trapped.  

While initially charged under Section 105 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the Delhi police dropped the charge during his bail hearing. The charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder is invoked in cases where deaths occur due to negligence or inaction, even without premeditation. 


 Courts have often grappled with this charge, considering whether the accused had knowledge that their actions could lead to death.  Previous cases involving building collapses, train accidents, and drunken driving have seen this charge applied, with varying degrees of success in securing convictions.</description>

			<title>Why Madhya Pradesh will begin disposal of toxic waste nearly 40 years after the Bhopal Gas Tragedy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-mp-to-begin-toxic-waste-disposal-bhopal-gas-tragedy-9488668/</link>
			<description>Nearly 40 years after the Bhopal gas tragedy, the Madhya Pradesh state government is finally proceeding with the incineration of 337 Metric Tons of toxic waste from the Union Carbide facility. The decision comes after years of delays and opposition, spurred by the need to address environmental pollution and alleviate the suffering of survivors. 

The process involves transporting the waste to a disposal site, blending it with reagents, and ultimately incinerating it. The project is estimated to cost Rs 126 crore and take 180 days to complete. While authorities claim the incineration process will be safe and adhere to environmental standards, there are concerns raised by residents and environmental groups regarding potential health risks associated with dioxins and furans released during incineration.</description>

			<title>With Nguyen Phu Trong gone, are EU-Vietnam ties at risk?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-evaluating-eu-vietnam-ties-9488582/</link>
			<description>Vietnam’s new leadership, led by President To Lam, is expected to maintain the country's long-standing policy of balancing relations with major powers.  Despite economic growth and strengthened ties with the EU, concerns remain regarding Hanoi's human rights record. 

To Lam, a former police chief, lacks extensive foreign policy experience and is associated with a controversial kidnapping incident in Germany. This, coupled with an anticipated increase in human rights violations under his leadership, could lead to increased scrutiny and pressure from the EU. 

Analysts suggest the European Union needs to adopt a more critical stance towards Vietnam's human rights abuses, potentially employing targeted sanctions and trade pressure to address the escalating situation.</description>

			<title>Why do landslides occur, and what triggered the tragedy in Wayanad?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-landslides-causes-wayanad-tragedy-9488385/</link>
			<description>Landslides are increasingly frequent due to climate change, causing significant casualties and affecting livelihoods globally. India accounts for 8% of global landslide-related deaths.

A new high-resolution landslide susceptibility map developed by IIT-Madras reveals 13.17% of India is vulnerable, with Sikkim and Kerala being the most at-risk. ISRO's "Landslide Atlas of India" also identifies Himalayan and Western Ghats regions as hotspots. 

Landslides are triggered by factors like heavy rainfall and human activities, such as deforestation and unsustainable land-use practices. Research suggests that monocropping in Kerala, replacing deep-rooted native trees with shallow-rooted crops, is contributing to landslide vulnerability.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court allows sub-categorisation in Scheduled Caste reservation: What is the case?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-sub-categorisation-reservation-9488211/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of sub-categorizing Scheduled Castes for reservation purposes, acknowledging the historical and empirical evidence of inequality within this group. 

A seven-judge bench overturned a 2004 judgment that classified Scheduled Castes as a homogenous entity, allowing states to provide wider protection to underrepresented castes.  

The court acknowledged that the concept of a "creamy layer" within SCs, which limits reservation benefits to those below a certain income threshold, also applies to sub-categorization. 

The ruling will significantly impact reservations for marginalized communities in various states, particularly for castes like Balmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs in Punjab, and Madigas in Andhra Pradesh.</description>

			<title>Was the recent Kathmandu plane crash caused by a ‘wing stall’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/was-the-recent-kathmandu-plane-crash-caused-by-a-wing-stall-9487656/</link>
			<description>On July 24th, a Bombardier CRJ200 crashed shortly after takeoff from Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, killing all but one passenger. 

Analysis of video footage suggests the plane suffered an "unusual attitude," possibly due to a wing stall, leading to a steep right bank. This situation is characterized by excessive tilt beyond normal banking limits, potentially due to a high angle of attack on the wings causing a loss of lift. 

Recovery from a stall requires lowering the nose to reduce the angle of attack and regain lift. However, at the low altitude the plane was flying, Captain Shakya likely had insufficient time to recover effectively.</description>

			<description>Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, was killed in an airstrike in Tehran.  Israel, while not officially taking responsibility, is the suspected culprit. Hamas and Iran have accused Israel and vowed retaliation. 

Experts predict increased attacks by Israel’s adversaries, who make up the ‘axis of resistance’. This coalition, comprising groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, was formed to counter US and Israeli influence in the region. 
  
The 'axis of resistance’ emerged after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, driven by Iran’s desire to expand its political and military power and deter threats from Israel and the US.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-chief-assassinated-why-this-will-rattle-the-region-and-worry-delhi-9487667/</link>
			<description>Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, was assassinated in Tehran, marking a significant escalation in the Israel-Hamas war.  Israel views this as a victory in its effort to neutralize Hamas, while Hamas considers it a major provocation and a grave escalation. 

The assassination took place on Iranian soil, signaling that Israel sees Hamas leaders as targets even outside of Gaza. This act is expected to provoke Iran and potentially lead to further conflict.  

The assassination also benefits Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by potentially delaying a hostage deal and prolonging his grip on power. The US elections are further complicated by the incident, with Vice President Kamala Harris facing pressure to respond to the escalating situation.   


The assassination raises concerns for regional stability, with Qatar, Turkey, and Yemen condemning the act.  India is carefully considering its response, mindful of the sensitivities involved while prioritizing peace and stability in the region.</description>

These include increasing the minimum contract size, requiring upfront collection of option premiums, implementing intraday monitoring of position limits, and rationalizing weekly index products.  SEBI also suggests removing certain margin benefits, standardizing options strike prices, and increasing margins near contract expiry. These proposals aim to enhance investor protection and promote market stability by addressing concerns about excessive trading volume and potential losses.</description>

			<title>Da Vinci’s Last Supper or a depiction of Greek god Dionysus? Why LGBTQ tableau in Paris has created a storm</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-9486927/</link>
			<description>The Paris Olympics opening ceremony sparked controversy over a tableau featuring drag queens, a transgender model, and a blue-painted singer, which some critics deemed a mockery of Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper." The Catholic church and far-right groups condemned the act as an insult to Christianity.  

Organizers denied intending to portray da Vinci's mural,  instead claiming inspiration from Dionysus, the Greek god of festivities, and a pagan feast. They asserted the scene conveyed values of love, freedom, and belief.  However, others interpreted it as a representation of the Athenian Festival of Dionysus or a reference to Dutch artist Jan van Bijlert's "The Feast of the Gods."</description>

			<description>Udham Singh, who assassinated the former lieutenant governor of Punjab, Michael O’Dwyer, as revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, is an icon in Punjab. 

A memorial was established in his hometown, Sunam, and his remains were repatriated to India in 1974. Though several statues and institutions bear his name, incomplete promises remain. A dedicated space within the memorial for the urns containing his ashes remains unused, and historians advocate for displaying his personal belongings and letters within the memorial.  Promises have been made to bring these objects back from London, including his pistol, but tangible action is yet to be taken.</description>

			<title>8 key takeaways from Hamas chief’s assassination</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/8-hamas-chiefs-assassination-israel-9486625/</link>
			<description>Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, was assassinated in Tehran, marking a significant escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict.  Hamas views the killing as a major provocation, especially as it occurred on Iranian soil. 

This event is expected to pressure Iran, potentially leading to further hostilities with Israel. Internally, Hamas and Iran may call for revenge, posing a challenge to Iranian President Pezeshkian's efforts for dialogue with the West.  

For Israel, the assassination strengthens Prime Minister Netanyahu's position, potentially prolonging the war in Gaza. 

The United States faces a complicated situation, with Democratic Vice President Harris needing to respond to the escalating situation and its potential impact on US foreign policy. 


The assassination raises regional concerns, as Qatar, Turkey, and the Houthis have condemned the killing, and other key players like Saudi Arabia and the UAE watch developments closely. The incident could draw the Middle East into a larger conflict.</description>

			<title>Israeli strikes: What is Hezbollah and why are fears over a new regional conflict being raised?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-strikes-hezbollah-hamas-9486423/</link>
			<description>Hezbollah mourns the death of Fuad Shukr, its senior military commander, killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Israel claims Shukr was responsible for recent attacks, including a rocket strike on the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers. 

Hezbollah's role in the recent escalation is significant, as the group has a history of retaliation against Israel and possesses a large arsenal of rockets.  Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanese politics adds another layer of complexity, as it is part of the ruling government. Despite concerns over potential wider conflict, there are hopes for de-escalation, with both sides seemingly hesitant to trigger a full-scale war.</description>

			<description>The swimming leg of the men's triathlon in the Paris Olympics faced postponement due to concerns over water quality in the River Seine. Despite significant investments by Paris to improve the Seine's condition, heavy rains continue to overwhelm the city's aging sewage system, leading to untreated wastewater and high levels of E. coli bacteria in the river.  This situation jeopardizes the safety of athletes and violates pollution standards set by the European Union and the World Triathlon Federation.  The swimming events, initially scheduled for July 30 and 31, and August 5, are subject to water quality tests and have reserve days planned. If necessary, the events may be canceled or moved to an alternative venue.</description>

			<title>Why investors did not pick up Jammu and Kashmir lithium block in auction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-investors-did-not-pick-up-jk-lithium-block-in-auction-9485682/</link>
			<description>The auction for a lithium block in Jammu and Kashmir's Reasi district has been cancelled for the second time due to a lack of investor interest. Despite initially being hailed as one of the world's largest lithium deposits, the block has failed to attract bidders due to concerns surrounding extraction costs, processing complexities, and unclear economic viability. Experts suggest that India's reliance on outdated mineral reporting standards combined with global lithium price fluctuations are deterrents for potential investors. 


The government is now considering further exploration of the block or allocating it to a state-owned company. The unsuccessful auction highlights the challenges India faces in attracting private investment in its critical mineral sector.</description>

			<title>Why Nicolas Maduro’s re-election has triggered protests in Venezuela, criticism abroad</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/venezuela-election-president-nicolas-maduro-re-elected-national-electoral-council-9485615/</link>
			<description>Venezuela has erupted in protests following President Nicolas Maduro's re-election.  
The National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner with 51% of the vote, but the opposition alleges fraud, citing discrepancies and lack of transparent counting.  Maduro, who has held power since 2013, amended the constitution in 2009 to eliminate presidential term limits.  

The election comes after years of economic crisis, hyperinflation, and social unrest exacerbated by US sanctions.  International reactions have been mixed, with Maduro's allies celebrating the result while other nations, including the US, EU, and several Latin American countries, have expressed concerns about the election's legitimacy and called for investigations.</description>

			<title>Behind Leh flight cancellations: high temperatures, low air density</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/behind-leh-flight-cancellations-high-temperatures-low-air-9485614/</link>
			<description>Flight cancellations in Leh, Ladakh, were caused by unusually high temperatures.  

Aircraft need specific air density for lift and engine thrust.  Higher temperatures make air thinner, reducing lift and engine performance. This requires longer runways and more powerful engines for takeoff.

Leh's high altitude exacerbates this issue, as air is already thinner. Global warming contributes to these extreme temperatures,  disrupting air travel and increasing runway requirements. Studies show that warmer temperatures reduce take-off weight capacity and necessitate longer take-off distances.

While aircraft manufacturers strive for improvement, the most effective solution is to mitigate global warming by reducing fossil fuel consumption.</description>

			<title>UP govt proposes strengthening anti-conversion law: why, what are the key changes?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/up-govt-proposes-strengthening-anti-conversion-law-9485220/</link>
			<description>Uttar Pradesh has amended its law prohibiting unlawful religious conversion, making it stricter and broader in its application.

The amendment, introduced by the BJP government, aims to protect vulnerable groups like minors, people with disabilities, women, and SC/ST communities. It addresses concerns raised by the Allahabad High Court regarding rampant conversion activities. 

The key changes include removing restrictions on who can file an FIR, introducing stringent bail conditions similar to those in terrorism and money laundering cases, and increasing punishments for unlawful conversion.  

The amendment broadens the definition of unlawful conversion and includes offences related to forced marriage. It also imposes harsher penalties for conversion financed by foreign or illegal institutions, and for acts involving coercion, force, or threats.</description>

			<title>Why are Russian athletes ‘banned’ from the 2024 Paris Olympics?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/russia-athletes-banned-paris-olympics-9484765/</link>
			<description>The decision to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing under their national flags at the Paris Olympics stems from the IOC's stance that Russia's invasion of Ukraine violated the Olympic Truce. Belarus was implicated for allegedly facilitating Russia's military operations. 

The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee due to its claims over Ukrainian sports organizations and its involvement with the  "International Friendship Association," deemed a political body violating Olympic neutrality.

Although Russian and Belarusian athletes can participate as "Neutral Athletes,"  the move sparked debate about the concept of "political neutrality" in sports, particularly as athletes from countries with conflict histories are allowed to compete unhindered.</description>

			<title>Explained: The recommendations for equivalence across India’s 69 school boards</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/equivalence-recommendations-indian-school-boards-explained-9484157/</link>
			<description>PARAKH, a  standards body under the NCERT, has submitted a report to the Ministry of Education on achieving equivalence between different school boards in India, as mandated by the NEP 2020. The report recommends standards across five categories: administration, curriculum, assessment, inclusiveness, and infrastructure. 

Key recommendations include a cumulative Class 12 assessment based on marks from Class 9-12, a credit-based system for grades, and standardized question papers developed by a cadre of professional paper setters. Boards are also advised to incorporate digital literacy, periodic school reviews, and ensure basic infrastructure. PARAKH analyzed 32 boards and will monitor the implementation of its recommendations. Implementation is expected to be a slow process, requiring boards to agree to significant changes.</description>

			<title>Why Israel-Hezbollah conflict is heating up</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hezbollah-conflict-israel-rocket-strike-golan-heights-israel-palestine-war-9483552/</link>
			<description>Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah escalated significantly following a rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children and teenagers.  Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, vowed retaliation, and labelled the group as the biggest threat at its borders. Hezbollah denied responsibility but has continued its attacks on Israel, stating it will halt them only if a ceasefire in Gaza is established.  The current conflict has seen both sides  exchange fire, with Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah areas in Lebanon and Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel.  

Although both sides have indicated a desire to avoid a full-scale war, the situation remains volatile.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of a harsh response, while Hezbollah has vowed to defend itself against any Israeli aggression. The outcome of the conflict in Gaza could be a key factor in determining the future trajectory of the situation in Lebanon.</description>

			<title>New paper claims 11.9 lakh excess deaths in India in 2020: What is the debate over Covid deaths?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/debate-over-covid-deaths-9483539/</link>
			<description>A study published in Science Advances estimated 11.9 lakh excess deaths in India during 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Indian government vehemently refuted these findings, calling them "grossly misleading" and "methodologically flawed."  The government maintains official figures of 1.49 lakh deaths in 2020, a number significantly lower than estimates from various studies, including a WHO global study that indicated 47 lakh excess deaths in India during the pandemic period.  

The discrepancy arises partly due to the reliance on estimated data from the Sample Registration Survey (SRS) as opposed to actual counts from the Civil Registration System (CRS). Additionally, the government claims 99% registration of deaths in 2020, leading to a figure lower than previous years, which is disputed by experts. 


The Science Advances study used data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), facing criticism for its methodology. The issue of accurately quantifying Covid-19 deaths is crucial for health policy and economic planning, but the government has not initiated a comprehensive independent assessment.  The upcoming 2026 Census presents an opportunity to collect more reliable data on the pandemic's impact.</description>

			<title>Referring to ED case against Kejriwal, why a Mumbai trial court released an accused in a PMLA case</title>

			<description>The Mumbai Special Court recently released an accused in a money laundering case, citing the Supreme Court's decision to grant bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The court ruled that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) lacked sufficient "reasons to believe" to justify the arrest. This echoes the SC's stance on Kejriwal's case, where it emphasized the need for judicial review in arrests and the mandatory disclosure of arrest grounds to the accused. The SC's ruling highlights the need for the ED to adhere to due process and provide justifiable reasons for arrests under the stringent PMLA. This development marks a significant legal victory for accused individuals facing stringent laws and sets a precedent for challenging arbitrary arrests.</description>

			<title>Why some 5-star hotels in New Delhi may have to pay crores to the govt</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/5-star-hotels-new-delhi-ground-rent-hike-9483154/</link>
			<description>Several five-star hotels in New Delhi, including The Imperial and The Claridges, are challenging the Centre's significant increase in their annual ground rent.  

These hotels were originally granted perpetual leases in the early 20th century on a nominal ground rent, with revisions to be calculated based on the land's letting value. The Centre argues that previous rent hikes were ad-hoc and the current increase, based on a formula of 5% of the land value, reflects the actual worth. 

The hotels dispute the retrospective application of the new rent, arguing that the next revision was due in 2046. They also criticize the lack of prior warning or explanation for the substantial increase. The Delhi High Court has ordered the Land and Development Office (L&amp;DO) to provide hearings to the hotels before revising the ground rent.</description>

			<description>The design of India's Olympic uniform sparked debate, with criticism focusing on its perceived lack of connection to Indian traditions and aesthetics. The uniform, created by designer Tarun Tahiliani for Tasva, was chosen through a bidding process that considered both financial and creative aspects.  

Tahiliani defended his choices, citing logistical constraints, the need for practical attire suitable for the Paris climate, and a balance of tradition and modernity. He also addressed concerns about the use of digital prints instead of traditional weaves and the absence of visible branding, explaining the time limitations and guidelines imposed by the Indian Olympic Committee (IOC).</description>

			<title>Death in Brazil: What is Oropouche fever?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/brazil-oropouche-fever-symptoms-9483084/</link>
			<description>Brazil has reported its first two deaths from Oropouche fever, a viral disease transmitted by midges and mosquitos. The two women, both under 30, had no underlying health conditions.  

While Oropouche fever is common in Latin America and the Caribbean, this is the first recorded instance of death from the disease.  Cases  have also been reported in Italy and Cuba recently, marking the first detections in continental Europe and Cuba, respectively. 

Symptoms resemble dengue fever and include fever, headaches, pain, chills, and joint stiffness. The disease typically resolves within a week, with severe cases being rare.

There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment available for Oropouche fever.</description>

			<title>Why passing Class 9 is a major hurdle for Delhi government school students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-govt-school-class-9-fail-9482970/</link>
			<description>The Delhi government school system faces a persistent challenge: high failure rates in Class 9. This year, around 36% of students failed, and many subsequently drop out.  

Several factors contribute to this situation.  The implementation of the Right to Education Act's no-detention policy until Class 8, coupled with increased academic pressure leading up to board exams, creates a stressful transition for students.  The shift to more Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) also emphasizes rote learning over conceptual understanding.  

To address this, the government has implemented remedial classes, teacher training, and Mission Buniyaad to strengthen foundational skills. They also aim to trace and provide vocational training to dropouts. Despite these efforts,  concerns remain about the quality of education offered through the National Institute of Open School (NIOS), which many struggling students are encouraged to join.</description>

			<title>How educated mothers of young kids can help strengthen their learning journey</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/nipun-bharat-mission-nep-2020-implementation-aser-surveys-9481617/</link>
			<description>The National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat Mission aims to ensure foundational literacy and numeracy skills by Grade 3.  This is supported by a rise in educational attainment among mothers of young children (ages 4-8). Between 2010 and 2022, the proportion of these mothers with education beyond Grade 5 nearly doubled, with some states, like Kerala, seeing over 70% achieving high school education. This presents a unique opportunity to leverage mothers' education for supporting their children's learning journey. The pandemic, by forcing parental involvement in education, has paved the way for this heightened engagement, with mothers becoming key partners in achieving NIPUN's goals.</description>

			<title>SC to examine acquitted man’s ‘right to be forgotten’: What is the right, and how have courts ruled earlier?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/european-information-privacy-regulation-supreme-court-fundamental-rights-constitution-of-india-cji-d-y-chandrachud-9481662/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is set to examine the "right to be forgotten" in a case challenging a Madras High Court ruling. The Madras High Court ordered the removal of a 2014 rape and cheating case judgment from the legal portal Indian Kanoon, as the acquitted man claimed it hindered his Australian citizenship application.  

The concept stems from the European Union's right to erasure, enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which allows individuals to request removal of their personal data deemed inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive. While India lacks a specific statutory framework outlining the right to be forgotten, the  Supreme Court's 2017 Puttaswamy judgment recognized the right to privacy as fundamental, potentially encompassing the right to be forgotten.  Justice S.K. Kaul, in a concurring opinion, stated that this right doesn't necessitate obliteration of past information but allows individuals to remove data no longer necessary, relevant, or accurate.

Indian courts have issued conflicting rulings on the matter,  highlighting the ongoing debate and lack of clear legal precedent.  The Supreme Court's decision will likely clarify the scope of the right to be forgotten in India's legal landscape.</description>

			<description>The Perseverance rover has identified a Martian rock named Cheyava Falls that holds potential signs of ancient microbial life. 

The rock contains organic compounds, veins of calcium sulfate, and unique mineral formations that resemble features found in Earth rocks associated with past microbial life. While definitive proof of life is lacking, scientists are excited about the possibility that Cheyava Falls could provide valuable insights into Mars' ancient habitability. The rock sample has been stored by the rover for a future mission to return it to Earth for further analysis. However, delays and cost overruns have pushed back the Mars sample return mission, leaving the scientific community in a holding pattern.</description>

			<title>President Droupadi Murmu appoints new Governors for nine states: All about the post and its procedures</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/new-governors-appointment-procedure-9480630/</link>
			<description>The President of India appoints Governors, who represent the Centre in each state.  Though envisioned as apolitical figures acting on the advice of state Councils of Ministers, Governors possess significant powers, including assent to bills and determining majority proof in assemblies.  

Over time, Governors have come under scrutiny for potentially acting on behalf of the central government, leading to friction with state governments, especially those in opposition.  

This tension stems from the lack of a mechanism for holding Governors accountable and the perception of their political appointment.  Constitutional experts argue this imbalance creates a potential for abuse of power, undermining the separation of powers between the Centre and states.</description>

			<title>14 Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, sign China-brokered deal: Why it matters</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-fatah-china-deal-9480445/</link>
			<description>The political factions Hamas and Fatah, key players in the Palestinian territories, have signed a China-brokered declaration committing to end their division and work towards Palestinian unity.  The declaration also calls for an international conference to support this goal and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.  

The agreement, witnessed by representatives of 12 other Palestinian groups, signifies a potential shift in the Palestinian political landscape. Historically, Hamas and Fatah have differed in their approaches to peace negotiations and Israel. For instance, Hamas initially advocated for armed resistance against Israel, while Fatah, through the PLO, pursued a path of diplomacy culminating in the Oslo Accords.  China's involvement highlights its growing influence in the Middle East and its intention to mediate in the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Whether this declaration leads to lasting unity and progress remains to be seen, considering past attempts at reconciliation have faltered.</description>

			<title>What is indexation in calculating LTCG tax? Does the removal of indexation benefit in the Budget mean you will pay more tax?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/indexation-capital-gains-tax-9479405/</link>
			<description>The Union Budget for 2024-25 introduced changes to long-term capital gains (LTCG) taxation, eliminating the indexation benefit for assets like property and gold.  

Indexation adjusts the purchase price of an asset for inflation, resulting in a more realistic calculation of capital gains. Removing this benefit, coupled with the reduction of the LTCG tax rate to 12.5%, raised concerns about increased tax liability for long-term investors. 

The government has defended the changes, arguing that the net effect would be beneficial for most taxpayers, especially given the higher nominal returns on real estate often exceeding inflation.  They also emphasized that rollover benefits remain unchanged, allowing for tax exemption on capital gains reinvested in certain assets.

However, industry players and analysts have expressed concerns about potential consequences such as increased short-term selling in the real estate market and the rise of cash transactions to evade taxes.  The absence of grandfathering provisions for past purchases has also been criticized.</description>

			<title>Why Australia has banned mining in one of the world’s largest uranium deposits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australia-banned-mining-uranium-deposits-9479330/</link>
			<description>The Australian government has taken steps to permanently ban uranium mining at the Jabiluka site, a heritage-listed area within Kakadu National Park. 

The decision, prompted by the wishes of the Mirarr people, who are the traditional custodians of the land, comes after the discovery of ancient stone tools dating back tens of thousands of years at the site. 

The move follows  international condemnation of Rio Tinto's destruction of ancient Aboriginal rock shelters in 2020, highlighting the importance of protecting Indigenous heritage sites in Australia.  The government will extend Kakadu National Park to encompass Jabiluka, ensuring the area remains free from mining activity.</description>

			<title>How is the rainfall performance during the ongoing monsoon season?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/rainfall-performance-monsoon-9479264/</link>
			<description>The monsoon season in India is currently experiencing uneven rainfall distribution. While central and peninsular regions have received normal or excess rainfall, at least 10 states/UTs continue to face below-normal precipitation. 

Although June ended with below-average rainfall, July saw an improvement due to a low pressure system in the Bay of Bengal. This system brought significant surplus rainfall to central and southern peninsular India, but other regions, including northwest, extreme north, east, and northeast India, remain dry.  

This uneven pattern poses a threat to Kharif crops, as some regions experience excess rainfall while others face deficits.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gaza-tell-umm-amer-hilarion-world-heritage-site-list-matters-9479170/</link>
			<description>Tell Umm Amer, an ancient Christian monastery in the Gaza Strip, has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger.  

Founded in the 4th century, the site boasts a rich history with archaeological remnants spanning over four centuries.  Recognized as the first monastic community in the Holy Land, it is renowned for its five churches, mosaics, and crypt. However,  it has suffered damage due to Israel's ongoing conflict with Gaza. 

This UNESCO recognition imposes responsibilities on states, including Israel, to protect the site. The listing also opens avenues for international aid to ensure its protection and potential rehabilitation.</description>

			<description>India's Budget 2024-25 announced customs duty exemptions on three targeted cancer drugs: trastuzumab deruxtecan, osimertinib, and durvalumab. These drugs, previously subject to a 10% duty, will now be more accessible and affordable for Indian patients.  Trastuzumab deruxtecan, marketed as Enhertu, treats HER-2 receptor-positive cancers. Osimertinib, sold as Tagrisso, is used for lung cancers with epidermal growth factor receptors, while durvalumab, known as Imfinzi, is an immunotherapy treatment for various cancers like lung and bladder.  

The decision is expected to significantly reduce financial strain on patients and families, as these drugs, previously costing up to lakhs each, will become more affordable.</description>

			<title>What are puberty blockers and why are they prescribed for transgender and gender-diverse teens?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-and-when-are-puberty-blockers-prescribed-9478061/</link>
			<description>Elon Musk's transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, publicly refuted her father's claims that she was influenced into using puberty blockers, describing him as an emotionally distant and narcissistic parent. 

Vivian's legal transition in 2022 followed her  birth as Xavier in 2004. Puberty blockers, medically prescribed to delay the physical changes of puberty, are a common treatment for transgender and gender-diverse teens experiencing gender dysphoria.  

The drugs can help alleviate anxiety and stress associated with physical changes that don't align with their gender identity, providing a space for them to explore their feelings and make informed decisions about their future medical care.  Prescribed under medical supervision, these medications are administered through injections or implants and come with potential side effects that require careful monitoring.</description>

			<title>Ship carrying 1.4 million litres of oil sinks near Philippines: How oil spills impact the environment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/oil-spill-philippines-impact-9477308/</link>
			<description>Typhoon Gaemi caused significant damage across Taiwan, the Philippines and China, including sinking the oil tanker MT Terra Nova in Manila Bay.  The spill, threatening to become the largest in Philippine history, poses a serious risk to marine life and ecosystems.  

Authorities are deploying containment booms and skimmers to mitigate the damage. Oil spills have devastating consequences: they disrupt photosynthesis, poison marine animals, and harm sensitive habitats like coral reefs and mangroves.  

The cleanup process is challenging and expensive, with long-term impacts on wildlife populations and local economies. Historical oil spills like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon highlight the enduring environmental and ecological damage caused by these incidents.</description>

			<title>What are Assam’s Charaideo Moidams, India’s UNESCO’s World Heritage Site?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/assam-charaideo-moidams-unesco-9477194/</link>
			<description>Charaideo Moidams, the royal burial sites of the Ahom dynasty in Assam, have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage Sites list. These tumuli, or earthen mounds, represent a unique funerary practice of the Ahoms, a Tai people who ruled Assam from 1228 to 1826.

Each moidam houses one or more chambers containing the remains of Ahom kings and queens, buried with items for their afterlife, along with servants, livestock, and sometimes even their wives.  The height of the mound indicates the person's power and stature.

Charaideo holds particular significance as the Ahoms' first capital city and a sacred site. Its history, burial practices, and architecture distinguish it as a unique cultural and historical treasure.  The moidams, often referred to as the "Pyramids of Assam," stand as a testament to the Ahom dynasty's cultural legacy.</description>

			<description>Google's latest environment report reveals a 13% increase in emissions, primarily driven by higher electricity consumption in its data centers and supply chains. This trend is expected to worsen as AI adoption increases, with AI queries using significantly more energy than traditional searches.  

The energy demands of AI stem from its complex processing, requiring more data sifting, signal generation, and cooling. Data centers, already consuming 1-1.3% of global electricity, are projected to double their share by 2026.  

While AI faces criticism for its environmental impact, studies also suggest its potential to reduce emissions through optimizing industrial processes and predicting emissions.</description>

			<description>The Kargil War, ending on July 26, 1999, was a conflict triggered by Pakistani infiltrators occupying high positions in Kargil, Ladakh. The Indian Army, facing heavy casualties, recaptured the territory after a grueling battle.

The extreme conditions of Kargil, including the extreme cold, thin air, and rugged terrain, posed significant challenges for the Indian forces.  Soldiers suffered from altitude sickness, equipment malfunctioned, and mobility was hampered. The Indian Army adapted by implementing acclimatization programs, procuring better equipment, and refining assault tactics, including coordinated artillery strikes.  India's victory highlighted the deadly nature of high-altitude combat and the crucial role of adapting to the environment's harsh realities.</description>

			<title>Why is there a move to split the Bengaluru municipal corporation into smaller bodies with a 3-tier structure?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/move-to-split-the-bengaluru-municipal-corporation-explained-9475593/</link>
			<description>A proposal to restructure the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP),  splitting it into smaller city corporations, is being debated in Karnataka. The Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill, 2024, aims to establish a three-tier governance structure with the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) at the top, followed by city corporations and ward committees.  

The bill specifies criteria for city corporations based on population, revenue, and employment, aiming for a maximum of ten corporations. The BBMP will likely be divided into five units.  The proposal has faced opposition from the BJP, who argue it is unscientific and will harm the city's linguistic identity. The Congress, led by Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, contends the restructuring is necessary due to the city's rapid and uncontrolled growth.  The bill will be discussed further by lawmakers on July 27.</description>

The Durbar Hall, constructed in 1929,  hosts key events like the conferring of honors and swearing-in ceremonies. Its design, influenced by both Western and Indian architectural styles, features high walls, a grand dome, and intricate marble jaalis. 

Originally a ballroom, the Ashok Hall, is now used for presenting credentials and formal introductions before state banquets.  It features Belgian chandeliers, paintings, hunting scenes, and inscriptions in Persian, reflecting a blend of architectural influences.</description>

			<title>How the modern Olympics came to be</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/modern-olympics-history-9475330/</link>
			<description>The idea to revive the ancient Olympic Games predates Pierre de Coubertin.  In the 1830s, Greek poet Panagiotis Soutsos invoked the glory of ancient Greece through his poetry, urging for a revival of the Games. Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek benefactor, took up Soutsos' call and funded the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1859.  

Athens hosted subsequent Games in 1870, 1875, and 1888, with the last held in the newly built Panathenaic Stadium.  Meanwhile, in England, W.P Brookes organized the "Annual Wenlock Olympic Games," later the "National Olympic Games" with the aim of promoting international sporting competition. Brookes' vision inspired Coubertin, who in 1894 established the International Olympic Committee. Following Coubertin's initiative, the first International Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896, marking the beginning of the modern Olympic era.</description>

			<title>‘Royalty is not a tax’: How Supreme Court recognised states’ powers to tax mining activities</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/royalty-not-tax-supreme-court-mining-ruling-9475001/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that states can collect royalties from mining leaseholders separately from, and in addition to, taxes on mining activities. This resolves a long-standing dispute triggered by a 1989 decision that deemed royalties as a tax, limiting state revenue. 

The nine-judge bench held that royalties are distinct from taxes, based on contractual agreements instead of public purpose funding. This, along with the power granted to states under the Constitution's Seventh Schedule, allows states to levy taxes on land used for mining activities, independent of royalties.</description>

			<description>Two recent outbreaks of listeria, a foodborne bacteria, have been reported in the United States and Canada. The US outbreak, linked to deli meats, has resulted in two deaths and 28 hospitalizations. Listeria infection can cause vomiting, fever, and in severe cases, be fatal, especially for pregnant women, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.     

In Canada, the outbreak is associated with plant-based refrigerated beverages, prompting recalls of several brands. Symptoms of listeriosis may not appear for up to two months, making it difficult to trace the source of infection.  

Both countries are investigating the outbreaks. Health officials advise avoiding unheated deli meats and thoroughly heating any consumed to kill bacteria. Prompt medical attention is recommended for anyone experiencing symptoms.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-sc-couldnt-agree-on-environmental-release-of-gm-mustard-9474010/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court split on whether to allow the "environmental release" of genetically modified (GM) mustard. Justice Nagarathna ruled against the approval, stating that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)  did not sufficiently consider public trust and the precautionary principle. She pointed to a lack of long-term studies and a sudden shift in GEAC's stance.

Justice Karol, in contrast, supported the approval, arguing that field trials were necessary to assess environmental safety and performance. He highlighted the GEAC's independent and reasoned process, including expert committee findings on honeybee impact and recommendations from relevant government departments. 

Both judges directed the government to establish a national policy on GM crops, involving experts, farmers, and state governments.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-economic-survey-argues-for-climate-adaptation-not-mitigation-9474009/</link>
			<description>The Indian Economic Survey challenges the current international framework for tackling climate change, arguing that its focus on the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature target is unrealistic and unfairly burdens developing nations. 

The Survey highlights the inequities in the system, noting that developed countries, despite having the largest historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, have not fulfilled their commitments to reduce emissions and provide financial and technological assistance to developing nations. 

It proposes a shift in emphasis towards adaptation measures, arguing that climate change impacts are already being felt and that rapid development and resilience-building are crucial for vulnerable communities.  The Survey also criticizes the scientific community for perpetuating a narrative that ignores the historical context and unequal impacts of climate change.</description>

			<title>Why end of indexation benefit on property sale has ignited a debate</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-end-of-indexation-benefit-on-property-sale-has-ignited-a-debate-9473934/</link>
			<description>The government defended its proposed capital gains tax changes, stating that the new regime without indexation would be beneficial for most individuals due to higher real estate appreciation rates.  They acknowledged that the change may impact those with lower returns, less than 9-11% annually, but argued that this scenario is rare. 

However, industry experts expressed concerns. They predicted a rise in secondary market real estate sales as individuals seek to avoid holding assets beyond 3-5 years under the new regime. They also suggested a potential increase in cash transactions due to the tax implications. 

Real estate experts noted that while the new rate might be advantageous for short-term holdings (3-5 years), it could increase tax burdens for long-term investments with annual appreciation of 10-12%. They also highlighted the disparity in taxation between real estate and equities, advocating for broader tax reform to achieve parity.</description>

			<title>Kathmandu plane crash kills 18: What we know so far, why Nepal has a poor aviation safety record</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kathmandu-plane-crash-kills-18-what-we-know-so-far-why-nepal-has-a-poor-aviation-safety-record-9473402/</link>
			<description>A Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft operated by Saurya Airlines crashed during takeoff at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal on July 24th, killing 18 people. The pilot, Manish Shankya, was the sole survivor and is currently hospitalized.  The aircraft was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians bound for Pokhara for maintenance checks.  Eyewitness accounts and videos suggest the plane flipped shortly after takeoff, hitting the ground with its wing-tip before catching fire and plunging into a gorge.  A climb failure, potentially caused by engine failure, faulty pre-flight planning, technical issues, or pilot error, is suspected to be the cause. This accident highlights Nepal's ongoing challenges with aviation safety, including its mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, aging aircraft fleet, and inadequate regulation.</description>

			<title>Why July 21 was the warmest day on record, and what may happen in the next few days</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/july-21-warmest-day-9473438/</link>
			<description>On July 21st, 2023,  the Earth recorded its warmest day ever, reaching an average global temperature of 17.09 degrees Celsius. This surpasses the previous record set just two weeks prior. 

The primary cause of this extreme warming is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, largely due to human activities like burning fossil fuels. Elevated temperatures in Antarctica and reduced sea ice extent are also contributing factors.  Scientists predict a further rise in global temperatures with a peak anticipated around July 2024.</description>

			<title>Why Big Tech is facing scrutiny over investments in AI research, products</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/big-tech-scrutiny-ai-research-9472581/</link>
			<description>Microsoft and Apple have recently stepped back from observer roles on the OpenAI board, amidst increasing scrutiny over Big Tech's involvement in AI. Microsoft, which had invested $10 billion in OpenAI,  claimed its observer role was no longer necessary. Apple, while not an investor, was to join the board as part of a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into its operating systems. This decision comes as regulatory bodies like the  US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and European Union (EU) are investigating the competitive landscape of AI, particularly concerning partnerships and investments between Big Tech and AI research companies.   



Concerns arise from Big Tech's influence on AI development, as they provide crucial resources like data, computing power, and funding. Critics argue this concentration of power could stifle innovation and lead to monopolies, hindering the potential of open and diverse AI research.</description>

			<title>Explained: Panchamasali Lingayats, and politics surrounding their quota demands</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/explained-panchamasali-lingayats-quota-demands-9471377/</link>
			<description>The Panchamasali Lingayats, a significant sub-caste within Karnataka's dominant Lingayat community, are demanding inclusion in Category 2A of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation system. This would provide them with access to a 15% quota in government jobs and college admissions, unlike the current 5% quota they receive under Category 3B.

Their agitation stems from a perceived lack of political representation and economic disadvantage despite their large population. Previous attempts to address their concerns, including the allocation of a larger quota to Lingayats as a whole, have failed to satisfy the Panchamasalis. 

The issue has become politically sensitive, influencing the outcome of the 2023 Karnataka elections. The Congress party, which won the elections, is now tasked with finding a solution that balances the interests of various OBC groups and placates the Panchamasalis.</description>

			<title>Explained: Making sense of the 2024-25 Union Budget</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/making-sense-of-the-budget-9471965/</link>
			<description>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2024-25 Budget marks a significant departure from previous budgets.  It acknowledges the current economic distress in India, despite relatively encouraging GDP growth numbers. 

The budget prioritizes agriculture, focusing on boosting farm research, pulses, and oilseed production, and natural farming. To address job creation and skill gaps, the government is shifting from Production-linked Incentives (PLI) towards Employment-linked Incentives (ELI). The focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which have been struggling, is another key element.

Recognizing the need for collaborative governance, the budget emphasizes working with states to implement reforms and develop industrial parks. The government aims to create a new economic policy framework that facilitates employment and sustains high growth.</description>

			<description>US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Harris, who would become the first woman and the first person of South Asian and Black heritage to be nominated for president by a major party, has inherent advantages due to her position, age, and diverse background. While her potential nomination is historic and reflects the changing demographics of the US,  Harris faces challenges, including criticism for her past handling of certain legal issues and the need to demonstrate effectiveness in addressing issues like immigration. 


Recent polls indicate a tight race against the Republican candidate, highlighting the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the upcoming election.</description>

			<title>Why has SC stayed police notice asking dhaba owners on Kanwar Yatra route to disclose their names?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-stay-police-order-kanwar-yatra-explained-9471323/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has blocked police orders in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Madhya Pradesh requiring businesses along the Kanwar Yatra route to display the names of their owners and employees. The court found these directions lacked legal foundation and could be issued under existing food safety or street vendor laws. 

While the court didn't address the petitioners' arguments that the orders discriminated against Muslim-owned businesses, it highlighted concerns about the violation of privacy rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.  The  judgement also noted potential violations of the right to practice any profession, as claimed by petitioners who argued the orders could lead to economic boycotts targeting specific religious or caste groups.</description>

			<title>What is a climate finance taxonomy, announced by FM Sitharaman?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/climate-finance-taxonomy-9470655/</link>
			<description>India will develop a 'climate finance taxonomy' to boost capital for climate adaptation and mitigation. Taxonomies classify economic activities as sustainable investments, guiding capital towards climate action and reducing greenwashing. 

India's green finance flows are insufficient, accounting for only 3% of total FDI. A taxonomy will clarify sustainable investments, potentially attracting more international climate funds. With a $3.1 trillion climate-smart investment potential, India aims to electrify vehicles and achieve 50% non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030.</description>

			<title>New Tax Regime tweaked: How taxpayers can save up to Rs 17,500 a year in income tax</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/new-tax-regime-income-tax-budget-2024-sitharaman-9470483/</link>
			<description>The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, announced an increase in the standard deduction to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000, and made minor adjustments to the tax slabs under the New Tax Regime (NTR).  This results in a maximum tax benefit of Rs 17,500 per year for individual taxpayers under the NTR.

The highest tax bracket, those with taxable income of Rs 15 lakh or more, will see the most significant benefit, saving Rs 7,500 due to the increased standard deduction and an additional Rs 10,000 from rate rationalization.

The government has widened the tax base and aims for a simple income tax regime by potentially encouraging more taxpayers to adopt the NTR.  Survey data suggests this effort is working, with 70% of taxpayers opting for the NTR. 

Changes made to the NTR bring the tax outgo closer to the Old Tax Regime after accounting for all deductions, making it more attractive to potential users.</description>
