            <title>Jharkhand launches drive to grant land titles under FRA: Why now, challenges</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-land-titles-fra-9017751/</link>
            <description>The Jharkhand government has launched a special drive called Abua Bir Dishom Abhiyan to provide land title certificates to individuals and communities under the Forests Rights Act. The act grants self-cultivation and habitation rights to Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers. The drive has been initiated after nine years and aims to address the low number of land title distributions in the state compared to Chhattisgarh. The government is setting up a dedicated website and mobile application to streamline the claims generation and distribution process. However, there are challenges such as the need for policy-level implementation and a hierarchical problem in the verification process. The government is working with knowledge and technology partners to overcome these challenges.</description>

            <title>Trump ahead of Biden in key US states, finds survey: What it means, why it matters</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/doanld-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-support-explained-9017695/</link>
            <description>A recent survey conducted by Siena College and The New York Times shows that former US President Donald Trump is leading current President Joe Biden in five out of six crucial swing states for the 2024 US Presidential elections. These swing states include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The survey, which polled more than 3,662 voters, found that 48% of respondents would vote for Trump in the next election, while 44% supported Biden's reelection bid. Additionally, 59% of respondents disapproved of Biden's handling of his job as president, while 38% approved. The survey also revealed that 67% of respondents believed the country was headed in the wrong direction. However, despite Trump's unfavorable reputation, voters believed he could do a better job than Biden in areas such as the economy, immigration, national security, and the Israel-Palestine issue. The survey also highlighted that the traditional support base for the Democratic Party, including women, younger people, and people of color, seemed less supportive of Biden in these swing states. The article also clarifies the significance of swing states in the US election process and notes that pre-election polls have been known to be inaccurate in the past. It also mentions that Biden's approval rating has declined from 53% in January 2021 to around 38%.</description>

            <title>10 things Delhi-NCR needs to do to tackle air pollution: What an IIT Kanpur study said</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ten-things-delhi-ncr-needs-tackle-air-pollution-9017406/</link>
            <description>The Supreme Court has reprimanded the governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan for allowing farmers to burn stubble, contributing to the poor air quality in the Delhi-NCR region. The court also directed the Delhi government to ensure that municipal solid waste is not burned in the city. These comments come after the Delhi government announced the implementation of the odd-even scheme for cars to reduce vehicular emissions.

While these measures may temporarily reduce pollution levels, a comprehensive study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur suggests that more preventive steps need to be taken to significantly improve air quality in Delhi and its surrounding areas. The study recommends ten measures to control air pollution, including stopping the use of coal in hotels and restaurants, providing access to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for cooking, and eliminating the burning of municipal solid waste.

Other measures include covering construction materials at construction sites, using windbreakers and telescopic chutes during concrete batching, promoting the use of electric and BS-VI vehicles, installing De-SOx-ing and De-NOx-ing systems at power plants, and implementing vapour recovery systems at petrol pumps. The study also emphasizes the need to limit biomass burning and tackle fly ash, which is a major contributor to PM10 pollution during summers.

Implementing these measures is expected to bring down PM2.5 and PM10 levels to acceptable standards. It is crucial for all stakeholders to work together to address the air pollution crisis and protect the health and well-being of the residents of Delhi and its neighboring regions.</description>
