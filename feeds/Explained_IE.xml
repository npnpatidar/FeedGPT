            <title>Jharkhand launches drive to grant land titles under FRA: Why now, challenges</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-land-titles-fra-9017751/</link>
            <description>The Jharkhand government has initiated a special drive called Abua Bir Dishom Abhiyan to provide land title certificates to individuals and communities under the Forests Rights Act. The drive aims to grant self-cultivation and habitation rights, known as Individual Forest Rights (IFR) and Community Forest Rights (CFR), to Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers. These rights cover various aspects such as grazing, fishing, access to water bodies, resource access, and recognition of customary rights.

The drive comes after a nine-year gap and is motivated by the need to catch up with the neighboring state of Chhattisgarh, which has made significant progress in granting land titles. Jharkhand has received 98,308 IFR and 2,695 CFR applications since its formation in 2000, with only 60,021 IFR titles and 2,013 CFR titles granted so far. In comparison, Chhattisgarh has processed 9.28 lakh title claims and distributed 5.28 lakh titles as of June 30, 2023.

To streamline the claims generation and title distribution process, the Jharkhand government is establishing a dedicated website and mobile application. These platforms will allow multiple stakeholders to track the application process and verify geotagged land parcels. Additionally, Secretary of the Department of Scheduled Tribe, Scheduled Caste, Minority, and Backward Class Welfare, Rajiv Arun Ekka, has issued instructions to form or reconstitute Forest Rights Committees at the village level, as well as monitoring committees at the sub-divisional and district levels.

The government has also organized Gram Sabhas in all villages of the districts, where Forest Rights Committees are being formed in the presence of observers. In the upcoming phase, special Gram Sabhas will be held from November 1 to 15, during which both new claims and old pending or rejected claims will be considered. The responsibility of organizing the special Gram Sabhas lies with the Panchayat Secretaries and Heads of each Panchayat.

To ensure successful implementation, the government is seeking knowledge and technology partners who have experience in states like Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The Foundation of Ecological Security (IES) and its partner organization Phia Foundation, along with the Indian School of Business (ISB), are collaborating with the Jharkhand government in this effort.

However, there are challenges to overcome. Some forest officials still view forest dwellers as encroachers, which hinders the implementation of the Act. The hierarchical structure within the government poses difficulties, as circle officers and forest rangers responsible for verifying claims are reluctant to report to district welfare officers who grant the titles. Furthermore, the state faces a shortage of forest rangers. These challenges, along with the approaching 2024 elections, make the process demanding.

Overall, the Abua Bir Dishom Abhiyan drive is a significant step by the Jharkhand government to ensure the rightful recognition and distribution of land title certificates to individuals and communities under the Forests Rights Act.</description>

            <title>Trump ahead of Biden in key US states, finds survey: What it means, why it matters</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/doanld-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-support-explained-9017695/</link>
            <description>A recent survey conducted by Siena College and The New York Times reveals that former US President Donald Trump is leading current President Joe Biden in five out of six "swing" states, which are crucial for securing a victory in the 2024 US presidential elections. The survey interviewed over 3,662 voters from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to the survey, 48% of respondents said they would vote for Trump, while 44% supported Biden's re-election bid. Moreover, 59% disapproved of Biden's job as president, and 67% believed the country is headed in the wrong direction. However, 56% of voters had an unfavorable view of Trump. Economic issues, such as jobs and taxes, were considered more important than societal issues like abortion and gun control by a majority of participants. Furthermore, 52% of voters described the current US economy as "poor," despite its attempts to recover from the pandemic. Biden's policies, such as government subsidies, have faced criticism. Despite concerns about Trump's impact on democracy, voters believe he would do a better job than Biden in areas like the economy, immigration, national security, and the Israel-Palestine issue. While some believed both candidates were too old to be effective presidents, Biden faced higher skepticism in this regard. The article also notes that Biden's traditional voting base, including women, younger people, and people of color, seemed to be less supportive in these six states. The swing states play a crucial role in determining the outcome as each state's electoral college members vote for the candidate chosen by voters in the state. Pre-election polling has been known to be unreliable, but Biden's declining approval rating is a concern for Democrats. Despite low approval levels, Democrats performed better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections, retaining the US Senate and allowing Republicans a slim majority in the House of Representatives.</description>

            <title>10 things Delhi-NCR needs to do to tackle air pollution: What an IIT Kanpur study said</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ten-things-delhi-ncr-needs-tackle-air-pollution-9017406/</link>
            <description>The Supreme Court has criticized the governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan for failing to stop farmers from burning stubble, which contributes to poor air quality in the Delhi-NCR region. The court also called on the Delhi government to prevent the burning of municipal solid waste. However, these measures alone will not be sufficient to significantly improve air quality in the area. A 2016 report by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur identified ten steps that need to be taken to control air pollution in Delhi, including stopping the use of coal in hotels and restaurants, providing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to households, and preventing the burning of municipal solid waste. The report also recommends covering construction materials at construction sites, using windbreakers and telescopic chutes during concrete batching, promoting the use of electric and BS-VI vehicles, installing de-sox-ing and de-nox-ing systems at power plants, and implementing vapour recovery systems at petrol pumps. Additionally, the report suggests limiting biomass burning and tackling fly ash by spraying water, using windbreakers, and planting trees.</description>

            <title>A daily glass of goat milk? Here’s what you need to know.</title>
            <link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goat-milk-gujarat-9017201/</link>
            <description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Agriculture Minister of Gujarat, Raghavji Patel, has called for a proposal on branding and marketing goat milk, which is currently sold informally. A meeting was held with representatives from various organizations to discuss the potential for goat milk in the state. According to a survey, Gujarat has a goat population of 50.55 lakh and produces 3.39 lakh tonnes of goat milk, which accounts for around 2% of the state's total milk production. Amul, the Gujarat State Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, expressed interest in supporting the collection, processing, and marketing of goat milk. The procurement of goat milk by large dairy federations like Amul could benefit goat and sheep herders by spurring the establishment of organized goat farms and increasing their earnings. However, it is unlikely that goats will become primarily milch animals due to their lower milk production compared to cows and buffaloes. In addition, some goats will still be sent to slaughterhouses to maintain the viability of the herd. Goat milk has health benefits, including being similar in fat content to breast milk and having low solids-not-fat content, making it easy for humans to digest.</description>

    <item><title>PM 2.5, Sulphur Dioxide, and more: What are the pollutants in our air, and how they impact health</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/air-pollution-aqi-source-health-impact-explained-9016879/</link><description>#### Summary:

The article discusses the rising pollution levels in north India and the focus on the Air Quality Index (AQI) score as a measure of air pollution. Delhi recently recorded a severe AQI score of more than 400, indicating high pollution levels. The AQI combines data on various pollutants such as PM 10, PM 2.5, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone, Carbon, etc., into a single number for ease of understanding. The article explains the sources of these pollutants and their impact on human health. PM 2.5 particles, which are smaller in size, can easily enter the circulatory system and lead to chronic diseases such as asthma, heart attack, and bronchitis. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fuel and can aggravate respiratory diseases. Ozone, although beneficial in the upper atmosphere, becomes a significant air pollutant at the surface and can increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is emitted by power plants and industrial facilities and can harm the cardiovascular system and plant life. Ammonia (NH3) from fertilizer use and livestock waste contributes to aerosol pollution and harms air and water quality. Lead (Pb) is a toxic metal that can cause intellectual disability and other health problems, especially in children. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas emitted during the burning of carbon-containing fuels and can be fatal at high levels. Long-term exposure to CO is linked to an increased risk of heart disease.

#### Air Quality Index (AQI):
The AQI is a measure of air pollution that combines data on various pollutants into a single number for ease of understanding. It helps assess the quality of the air and the potential health risks associated with it. The AQI score is categorized into different levels, ranging from good to severe, with higher scores indicating higher pollution levels. Delhi recently recorded an AQI score of more than 400, which falls under the severe category [[SOURCE 1]].

#### Pollutants and their Impact on Health:
1. **PM 10 and PM 2.5**: These are fine particulate matter particles with diameters smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively. Due to their small size, PM 2.5 particles can easily bypass the nose and throat and enter the circulatory system. They can lead to chronic diseases such as asthma, heart attack, bronchitis, and other respiratory problems. Sources of these particles include emissions from factories, vehicular pollution, construction activities, and road dust [[SOURCE 2]].

2. **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)**: NO2 is produced from the burning of fuel, with sources including vehicle emissions and power plants. Short-term exposure to high levels of NO2 can aggravate respiratory diseases like asthma and cause coughing or difficulty in breathing. Long-term exposure may contribute to the development of asthma and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections [[SOURCE 2]].

3. **Ozone**: Ozone is a gas present in the upper layers of the atmosphere, protecting human health from the Sun's UV rays. However, at the surface level, ozone becomes a significant air pollutant. It is formed by the reaction of atmospheric pollutants in the presence of sunlight. Increased surface ozone levels can lead to an increased risk of hospital admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and the number of cardiovascular and respiratory deaths [[SOURCE 2]].

4. **Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)**: The largest source of SO2 in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and industrial facilities. SO2 exposure is harmful to the cardiovascular system and can lead to the development of respiratory illnesses. It can also react with other compounds to form particulate matter and harm trees and plants [[SOURCE 2]].

5. **Ammonia (NH3)**: Excess ammonia in the atmosphere, resulting from increased fertilizer use and contributions from livestock waste, can harm plants and reduce air and water quality. Ammonia gas reacts with nitric and sulfuric acids to form nitrate-containing particles, contributing to aerosol pollution that is damaging to human health. It can also contribute to harmful algal blooms and "dead zones" with low oxygen levels in lakes, streams, and oceans [[SOURCE 2]].

6. **Lead (Pb)**: Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth's crust. Increased exposure to lead can be extremely dangerous to health, especially in children. Lead contamination can come from mining, smelting, manufacturing, and recycling activities. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can cause intellectual disability, behavioral disorders, and injury to multiple body systems [[SOURCE 2]].

7. **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: CO is a toxic, colorless, and odorless gas released when carbon-containing fuels are burned. High levels of CO can cause unconsciousness and death. Long-term exposure to CO is linked to an increased risk of heart disease [[SOURCE 2]].

It is important to address and reduce the levels of these pollutants to protect human health and improve air quality.

Here’s what experts, studies say</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/delhi-odd-even-policy-health-impact-pollution-explained-9016616/</link><description>Summary: 
Experts have expressed their skepticism about the effectiveness of the odd-even vehicle policy in reducing pollution levels. While some evidence suggests a decrease in pollutant concentrations, the available data lacks consistency, and the reduction achieved may not be sufficient to address the health-related impacts of pollution. Dr. Sagnik Dey, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, states that the odd-even policy is not a long-term solution as it does not significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the road and the reduction in emissions does not always lead to a decrease in pollutant concentration due to meteorological factors. Furthermore, there is no study to show whether the small reduction in air pollution levels impacts people's health. Long-term exposure to pollution is associated with various health risks, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, cancers, lower immunity, and depression. Studies have shown a decrease in particulate matter levels during the implementation of the odd-even scheme, ranging from 2 to 10%. The reduction in PM levels can be attributed to fewer cars on the road, faster traffic flow, and reduced engine idling. However, the studies also note that the sharpest drop in PM levels occurs during midday, not early morning when cold temperatures keep pollutants close to the ground. One potential benefit of the odd-even scheme is the reduction of gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide. This is important as recent research has shown that increased levels of nitrogen dioxide lead to an increase in emergency room visits. To address pollution in the long term, experts recommend measures such as phasing out BS-IV vehicles, promoting electric vehicles, implementing regional odd-even policies, and using air purifiers in schools.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 03:17:09 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><ns0:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Odd-even scheme back in Delhi: Has it helped bring down air pollution in the past?</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odd-even-scheme-delhi-pollution-impact-explained-9016587/</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi government has announced the return of the odd-even road apportioning scheme for a week starting after Diwali due to the expected worsening of air pollution. The average air quality index (AQI) reading in Delhi has consistently been above 450, indicating severe pollution. The odd-even scheme, implemented for the fourth time in the last seven years, allows cars to ply on alternate days based on their registration number. The aim is to reduce the number of cars on the road by roughly half, thereby improving air quality. Taxis, cars driven by women, electric and hybrid vehicles, and two-wheelers are exempt from the scheme. The exact details of the new scheme have not been announced yet.

Delhi has been facing a severe air pollution crisis due to various factors. The city's geographical location, with its shallow atmospheric "bowl," traps pollutants easily. Combined with falling temperatures and slow wind speeds, the pollutants linger in the air, causing smog. Additionally, the smoke from fires burning in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers burn stubble after the harvest, adds to the pollution. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment found that farm fires contribute to 40% of the PM 2.5 concentration in the air during peak times. However, their overall contribution to Delhi's air pollution throughout the year is only around 3%. Local sources, including vehicles, contribute up to 30% of the city's annual PM 2.5 concentration. Vehicles also emit other pollutants like NO2, with levels significantly higher this year compared to the previous year.

The efficacy of the odd-even scheme in reducing air pollution has been debated. An analysis by The Indian Express found that the average AQI decreased significantly in Delhi during the implementation of the scheme in 2019 compared to neighboring cities where it was not implemented. However, experts caution that determining the exact impact of individual measures on air pollution is challenging due to various factors at play.</description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 02:49:56 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><ns0:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Delhi odd-even scheme: Its impact on vehicular pollution levels, and why it is not a silver bullet</title><link>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-pollution-odd-even-scheme-no-silver-bullet-given-the-exemptions-but-cuts-toxic-emissions-9016425/</link><description>The article discusses the impact of reducing the number of vehicles on the road as a measure to reduce pollution levels. While this action can help decrease pollution, its effectiveness is limited because two-wheelers and taxis, which contribute significantly to emissions, are exempted from the restrictions. Transport is identified as the top contributor to pollutants, and it cannot be ignored when air quality is severely compromised. However, experts argue that the odd-even scheme, which restricts vehicle usage based on license plate numbers, may not have a significant impact on pollution reduction. A study on the previous implementation of the odd-even scheme in Delhi indicated that it failed to mitigate air pollution effectively. The scheme resulted in a small decrease in PM2.5 levels in certain areas of Delhi, but the overall impact was limited. Additionally, the scheme only applies to a subset of vehicles and includes exemptions, further reducing its effectiveness. The article emphasizes that emergency actions like the odd-even scheme are not a silver bullet for improving air quality and should be considered as part of a comprehensive approach that includes other measures such as stopping construction activities. The transport sector is identified as a major contributor to pollutants, accounting for around 40% of emissions in Delhi. However, the odd-even scheme alone may not be sufficient to control PM2.5 concentration in the city, considering the presence of multiple pollution sources. The article suggests that the odd-even scheme may be more effective as an emergency measure during winter months when car emissions play a more prominent role in affecting air quality.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 23:10:18 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><media:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><media:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item></channel>
