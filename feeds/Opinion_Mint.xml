			<title>Don't just upgrade products, invent new use cases for technology</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/emerging-technology-ai-innovation-business-models-fintech-grubhub-cross-border-payments-product-development-11724575272788.html</link>
			<description>Focusing solely on upgrading existing products and processes limits the full potential of technology adoption. Businesses should strive for a "native" approach that reimagines how things are done, eliminating existing friction points and leveraging the unique power of the technology.

A skeuomorphic mindset, which simply replicates old ways using new technology, misses opportunities for disruptive innovation.  Amazon's Whole Foods innovations, like palm-scanning checkout and cashierless stores, illustrate the  difference between simply speeding up existing processes and rethinking the entire concept.

Successful technological integration requires identifying and challenging assumptions. For example, the ease of instant, global messaging should extend to cross-border money transfers, reducing the prevalent fees and delays. AI's true strength lies in pattern recognition, not truth-telling, opening possibilities beyond search engine enhancement, such as early disease detection through wearable health monitoring.  


Businesses aiming for lasting success need to go beyond incremental improvements and embrace a native mindset that drives groundbreaking change.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: Lessons from Donald Trump’s ‘Hillbilly’ running mate</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-donald-trump-s-running-mate-jd-vance-poor-people-obama-democrats-working-class-college-education-11724575098843.html</link>
			<description>Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir by J.D. Vance, explores the plight of White, working-class Americans in Appalachia, whom Vance calls "hillbillies." He argues that these communities are trapped in a cycle of poverty due to a combination of cultural, psychological, and socio-economic factors. Vance describes a community plagued by despair, addiction, and lack of opportunity, where the  American dream seems out of reach.  

Vance credits his grandparents for saving him from this fate through their strong values and insistence on hard work and education.  He acknowledges the historical and economic forces that have contributed to the decline of these communities, but also criticizes the perceived lack of personal responsibility and victim mentality prevalent among "hillbillies." 

The book sparked controversy for its blunt portrayal of the White working class and its suggestion that their struggles are partly self-inflicted. While some argue that Vance provides valuable insights into their world, others accuse him of offering a simplistic and judgmental perspective.   Regardless of its reception, Hillbilly Elegy has become a significant cultural touchstone, provoking discussion about the challenges faced by working-class Americans and the role of individual agency in overcoming poverty.</description>

			<title>Political thinking has become an unattractive career choice in free India</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/political-thinking-free-speech-politics-gandhian-ideas-political-ideology-education-system-career-growth-nehru-11724574971442.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the dearth of political thinkers in independent India. Several factors contribute to this, including the lack of financial incentive in pursuing political studies compared to fields like technology or business.  

India's education system, which prioritizes rote memorization and discourages critical thinking, further stifles intellectual growth in the political realm. Additionally, the prevailing political climate is hostile to dissenting voices, with criticism often met with violence or imprisonment. 

The author argues that Indian political thought remains heavily influenced by Western paradigms and the legacies of prominent figures like Gandhi, Ambedkar, and Nehru. He suggests that instead of clinging to these grand narratives, Indian intellectuals should focus on addressing contemporary challenges, particularly the country's vast diversity and its implications for the digital age.</description>

			<title>The unravelling of a financial titan: Ravi Parthasarathy and the IL&amp;amp;FS scandal</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ravi-parthasarathy-il-fs-vijay-mallya-jet-airways-naresh-goyal-satyam-computers-adia-11724316384473.html</link>
			<description>Ravi Parthasarathy rose to prominence in the Indian financial sector during the 1980s and 1990s through his leadership at IL&amp;FS. The company, initially a public-private partnership model for infrastructure projects, grew under Parthasarathy's guidance, becoming a significant force in sectors like roads, ports, and power.  

However, IL&amp;FS's rapid expansion was fueled by short-term loans against long-term infrastructure projects, leading to a significant debt burden. Despite his reputation as a shrewd businessman, Parthasarathy's gamble on government support for his projects failed. His resignation in 2018 preceded the company's collapse, exposing a ₹91,000 crore debt pile accumulated through complex subsidiaries and questionable financial practices. His arrest in 2021 on charges of embezzlement and money laundering highlighted the depth of the scandal, ultimately resulting in the closure of the case after his death in 2022.</description>

			<description>This article outlines India's vision for achieving a "Viksit Bharat" (developed nation) by 2047.  

The goal is to achieve 10 times growth in GDP, from $3.6 trillion to $30 trillion.  This will be fueled by three pillars: technology, infrastructure, and employment.

India is focused on leveraging advancements in 5G, AI, and other cutting-edge technologies to transform various sectors. Massive investments in infrastructure, outlined in the National Infrastructure Pipeline, are crucial to support industrial growth and create jobs. 

The article emphasizes the need to create ample employment opportunities for India's large youth population. It highlights the potential of sectors like manufacturing, services, and tourism.  

Unlocking domestic capital, improving the ease of doing business, and fostering sustainable development are seen as key to achieving this ambitious vision.</description>

			<title>Just outrage is useless to ensure women’s safety</title>

			<description>The Justice Hema Committee report, investigating the abduction and sexual assault of a leading actress in the Malayalam film industry, highlights the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and exploitation in the industry.  It reveals issues ranging from lack of safe work conditions to a powerful coterie of men who control opportunities.  

The report emphasizes that these issues are not unique to the film industry, but reflect broader societal issues of inequality and the lack of equal rights for women. It argues that while harsh punishments may seem like a solution, they are ineffective without addressing the root causes of violence against women, which include the persistence of patriarchal structures and cultural norms that condone and protect perpetrators. True change requires a fundamental shift in attitudes and a commitment to achieving genuine equality.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Sovereign gold bonds on the way out? Savers would be dismayed.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-sovereign-gold-bonds-gold-prices-investment-options-bond-market-government-exchequer-11724345007231.html</link>
			<description>There are rumors that the government might discontinue the issuance of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs) due to their high cost.  The government pays a fixed interest of 2.5% annually on these bonds, and their value is linked to gold prices, which have risen significantly since their introduction in 2015. This has resulted in a substantial financial burden for the government. 

Switching to regular bond markets, where interest rates are lower, could potentially reduce the government's interest burden, especially if gold prices continue to climb. With India's current account in a healthy position, the need for import-curbing measures like SGBs has lessened.  However, discontinuing SGBs would limit investment options for small savers seeking safe investments with market-level returns.</description>

			<description>This article reflects on India's 78th anniversary of independence, focusing on the state of the nation's education system.  It highlights disparities in educational access and quality, emphasizing the struggles faced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  

The author draws upon their own experiences to illustrate these challenges and underscores the need for urgent reform.  The article points to the Kothari Commission's 1966 recommendations for a Common School System and examines the limitations of current systems despite significant institutional growth.

It acknowledges the National Education Policy 2020's promising initiatives but cautions about potential obstacles such as a shortage of qualified educators. The article concludes by calling for collective action and emphasizing the crucial role of education in shaping India's future.</description>

			<title>China's industrial overcapacity problem will be harder to address this time</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-overcapacity-evs-industrial-production-lithium-batteries-byd-consumer-demand-private-businesses-11724274907625.html</link>
			<description>China is facing a new wave of industrial overcapacity, particularly in sectors like solar panels, electric vehicles, and lithium batteries. Plunging prices both domestically and internationally are hurting corporate profits, a phenomenon reminiscent of a similar situation in 2012-2016 when steel and coal industries were affected.  This time, however, the private sector dominates these booming industries, making government intervention more difficult. Some industry leaders view overcapacity as beneficial, seeing it as a way to eliminate weaker competitors.  

Further complicating the issue is the significant portion of  production that is exported. Stimulating demand domestically is challenging, especially given  geopolitical tensions with the West.  Unlike the previous instance where government investments  in redevelopment programs helped boost demand, a similar approach seems less feasible currently.  This suggests that China's overcapacity problem may persist until industry leaders themselves decide to scale back production.</description>

			<title>We need reduced government litigation to unclog the judicial system</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/judicial-reform-government-litigation-national-litigation-policy-justice-delivery-dispute-resolution-bureaucracy-11724274647370.html</link>
			<description>The author argues that excessive litigation by the Indian government is a major problem, hindering judicial efficiency and stifling business operations.  Government litigation accounts for a significant portion of cases in the Indian court system, often involving small amounts of money. This issue stems from bureaucratic risk aversion and an ingrained preference for following rules meticulously, even when it leads to unnecessary legal battles. 

Previous attempts at curbing government litigation through policies like NLP 2010 have been ineffective due to lack of clear thresholds and enforcement mechanisms. The author urges for a comprehensive national-level portal to track litigation across all government entities, coupled with a robust NLP 2024 with strict implementation, measurable targets, and penalties for noncompliance  to effectively address this longstanding challenge.</description>

			<title>Will increasing minimum wages ease the employment problem and help the economy?</title>

			<description>The article discusses the issue of stagnant wages for a significant portion of the Indian workforce, despite widespread unemployment.  

It contrasts this with the increasing minimum wages in developed countries and highlights studies showing that minimum wage increases do not negatively impact employment. The article argues that raising minimum wages, even at the MGNREGA level, would stimulate demand in the rural economy and benefit the overall economy by boosting wages for all workers. 

It emphasizes that raising minimum wages is not just economically beneficial but also a moral obligation of the government, especially when it is the largest employer.</description>

			<title>US Treasury's debt-issuances are keeping inflation above the Fed target</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-treasury-debt-issuances-inflation-federal-reserve-policy-rate-interest-rate-hikes-politics-us-elections-11724274084423.html</link>
			<description>The US Treasury's strategy of issuing more short-term debt than usual has been likened to "Activist Treasury Issuance" (ATI). This approach,  which has reduced coupon issuance by over $800 billion, operates similarly to Quantitative Easing (QE) by lowering interest rates and boosting asset prices. 

Essentially, ATI replaces  longer-term bonds with short-term bills, providing investors with more "money-like" assets. This has effectively counteracted the Federal Reserve's attempts to control inflation by raising interest rates. Consequently, inflation and growth have remained consistently above target. This tactic has raised concerns about a politicized business cycle, where policies are dictated by electoral cycles. 

To correct the situation, the Treasury needs to decrease excess bills, a move that would temporarily raise long-term yields but ultimately lead to a cooling effect on the economy, akin to a two-point interest rate hike.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the significance of deposit insurance in the current banking landscape. It highlights the importance of deposit insurance in maintaining public trust in the banking system, especially in light of recent bank failures globally.  

While full deposit insurance is desirable, the article acknowledges the associated moral hazards. It explores potential solutions such as risk-based premiums for banks and selective coverage for vulnerable populations.  

The article emphasizes the need for India to be prepared for potential banking crises in the future, given the increasing reliance on technology and the digitalization of financial services. It suggests that regulators must address various challenges, including coverage for digital deposit-like products and mitigating risks posed by climate change to credit quality.</description>

			<description>Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has expressed concern over e-commerce platforms using predatory pricing strategies, which he believes harm traditional retailers. Goyal stated that the significant investments made by these platforms in India are intended to cover losses incurred through such practices. He acknowledged the potential for this growth to disrupt the market and cause job losses in the retail sector. While recognizing the benefits of e-commerce, such as expanded choice and opportunities for small businesses, Goyal emphasized the need for a level playing field to ensure fair competition.</description>

			<title>KYC exists to prevent fraud and not to make people miserable</title>

			<description>This article discusses the evolution of KYC (Know Your Customer) norms in India and the challenges posed by fraudsters.  It highlights the shift from a reputation-based system to a technology-driven approach, spurred by digital advancements and government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojana. While KYC has significantly improved financial inclusion, it has also created vulnerabilities exploited by fraudsters using stolen IDs and mule accounts. 

The article emphasizes the need for robust KYC measures to prevent identity theft and financial crimes. It suggests focusing on verification through technology, including liveness detection and fraud databases, and addressing discrepancies in regulations across different sectors. The core message is that while KYC might seem inconvenient, it is essential for protecting individuals and the financial system from fraud.</description>

			<description>Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is highly anticipated due to the current economic uncertainties and volatility. The speech comes at a time when market confidence in the Fed's guidance has been shaken. 

Powell has the opportunity to restore confidence by clearly outlining the Fed's policy stance, its objectives, and the path to achieving them. Key areas of focus should include the new equilibrium policy rate, the path towards that rate, and a realistic definition of a "sustainable" 2% inflation target. Lack of clarity could lead to renewed market volatility and further damage the Fed's credibility.</description>

			<title>India's inflation targeting: Base it on reality and not perceptions</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/retail-inflation-indian-economy-food-inflation-inflation-targeting-consumer-price-index-rbi-hces-11724182127298.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the debate surrounding India's inflation targeting regime.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor emphasizes the importance of headline inflation, which includes both food and non-food items, in influencing inflationary expectations. However, the article argues that this measure may be outdated, as the share of food expenditure in the overall consumption basket has declined since 2011-12.  

The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data reveals a significant disparity in the experienced inflation rates between different income groups, with the poorest segment facing significantly higher food inflation than the richest. The author suggests that the RBI could re-weight the existing Consumer Price Index (CPI) items to reflect these changes in consumption patterns and that the inflation target should be more directly related to the action of monetary policy. 

They also point out that monetary policy has limited impact on supply-side inflation of food and that focusing on controlling it through monetary instruments could be counterproductive.  The article ultimately calls for a re-evaluation of the inflation targeting mandate to align it with real-world economic realities rather than perceptions influenced by social media.</description>

			<title>Sovereign gold bond dilemma: How a well-intentioned scheme is draining government coffers</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sovereign-gold-bond-government-borrowing-scheme-t-bills-forex-budget-11724216545061.html</link>
			<description>The sovereign gold bond (SGB) scheme, intended to satisfy investor demand for gold and fund government borrowing, has proven more expensive than traditional Treasury instruments. Although interest rates on SGBs are lower, their price is linked to gold, exposing the government to forex risk due to the US dollar connection.  

The  recent rise in gold prices, compounded by the rupee's depreciation, has resulted in the government effectively paying 13.5-14% on redeemed SGBs. This compares to  around half the cost for T-Bills and gilts.  To attract investors, capital gains tax on SGBs is exempt, further increasing the government's cost.  

The government has recognized the financial burden and reduced its proposed SGB issuance for FY25. Recognizing the inflationary hedge benefits of gold, the government is likely to phase out the SGB scheme despite its appeal to investors.</description>

			<title>Djokovic's Olympic win has a lesson for India</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/novak-djokovic-paris-olympic-indian-economy-development-manufacturing-milk-revolution-11724181831919.html</link>
			<description>The article explores Novak Djokovic's unwavering dedication to winning an Olympic gold medal, even after already achieving numerous grand slam victories.  This relentless pursuit of a higher goal, the article argues, is a lesson for India as it strives for continued growth. 

Comparing Djokovic's drive to India's past successes, the article highlights how entrepreneurial endeavors arose from a need for survival, fueled by a strong sense of national ambition.

It acknowledges the shift in mindset among younger generations, who may not face the same immediate survival needs, and warns against complacency setting in. 

Ultimately, the article posits that India needs to identify compelling "higher order goals" that will inspire the same level of dedication and hard work seen in Djokovic, thus propelling the nation towards future triumphs in fields like technology and public digital infrastructure.</description>

			<title>India’s deposit insurer is overcharging commercial banks</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bank-deposits-rbi-cooperative-banks-insurance-premiums-digcg-insurance-companies-risk-commercial-banks-11724181520659.html</link>
			<description>The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), responsible for insuring bank deposits in India, has faced criticism for its high insurance premiums, particularly for commercial banks. Despite having significantly lower risk profiles than cooperative banks, commercial banks contribute most of the DICGC's premium revenue while experiencing a negligible share of claims.  

The article argues that this disproportionate burden unfairly penalizes well-managed commercial banks. It suggests that the DICGC should re-evaluate its premium structure, lowering the rate for commercial banks and increasing it for cooperative banks to ensure a more risk-based pricing system. The article estimates that this would save commercial banks approximately ₹20,000 crore in 2025-26 while still leaving the DICGC with a substantial surplus.  

The authors contend that this reform would benefit the economy by reducing compliance costs for banks, which often get passed on to depositors and borrowers, ultimately hindering growth. They also highlight the effectiveness of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in managing bank failures, reinforcing the argument that high insurance premiums are unnecessary.</description>

			<title>India has reason to be wary of China's economic slowdown</title>

			<description>A slowing Chinese economy is raising concerns globally, with its growth projected to fall to 3.3% by 2029. Problems within China's domestic economy, such as a real estate downturn and declining consumption, have led to a slump in its steel industry. This has resulted in a decrease in steel prices globally, impacting Indian steel manufacturers who have been experiencing strong growth. 

The slowdown also threatens to increase imports of subsidized Chinese goods, hurting Indian manufacturing and widening the already significant trade deficit with China.  While the economic survey suggests welcoming more Chinese FDI, India must carefully navigate the situation, balancing economic interests with geopolitical and security concerns.</description>

			<title>The eastern states have a big role in India's development aim</title>

			<description>The economic development of India's eastern region is crucial for the nation's goal of becoming a developed economy by 2047. Despite possessing mineral wealth and strategic advantages, these states lag behind in GDP, social progress, and skilled workforce participation. 

While the region's GDP has grown, its contribution to national GDP remains stagnant. To achieve a $30 trillion economy by 2047, the eastern region needs to grow at 9% annually, a rate significantly higher than its current average of 5.5%.  

Several challenges hinder this progress, including low social progress rankings, a high proportion of unskilled labor, and persistent socioeconomic disparities.  Addressing these issues requires focused development strategies and state government intervention, particularly in Bihar and Jharkhand.  Achieving beta convergence, where economically weaker regions grow faster than richer ones, is essential for the eastern region to contribute its full potential to India's economic future.</description>

			<description>Pro-Palestinian organizers plan to protest at the Democratic National Convention, hoping to pressure Vice President Kamala Harris on her stance toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Harris has adopted a firmer stance than President Biden, demanding Israel target Hamas rather than civilians and skipping Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to Congress.

 Despite this toughened rhetoric, the Biden administration has approved a $20 billion arms sale to Israel, a move that has alienated some pro-Palestinian supporters. Harris faces a difficult balancing act, needing to appease both allies within her own party and those who advocate for Palestinian rights. 

Organizers believe Harris's potential presidency offers a chance for positive change, while acknowledging the need to build a broader coalition to achieve their goals.  The situation remains tense, with a heavy humanitarian cost in Gaza and growing public pressure for a cease-fire.</description>

			<title>Subsidies and MSP:It makes most sense for farmers to keep growing rice and wheat</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/subsidies-msp-agriculture-rice-wheat-cultivation-oilseeds-pulses-tur-dal-crop-diversification-11724096959023.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that India's agricultural landscape is stuck in a rut, with farmers predominantly cultivating rice and wheat due to subsidies and guaranteed minimum support prices (MSP). While these policies ensure a return on investment for rice and wheat, they disincentivize the cultivation of other crops like pulses, oilseeds, and millets.   

The author contends that a purely economic standpoint suggests that farmers would benefit from diversifying their crops. Pulses like tur and urad offer higher profit margins per kilogram but have lower yields compared to rice and wheat.  Similarly, oilseeds like groundnut can be profitable but still lag behind wheat in total income.  

The article highlights the need to revamp existing agricultural policies to promote crop diversification. The current MSP system, which features open-ended procurement, is deemed inefficient and outdated. The author suggests targeting smaller farmers through a revised MSP mechanism and encouraging states to rationalize their power and water subsidies to incentivize farmers to explore alternative crops.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the rise of cash transfer schemes in India, particularly in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Haryana. 

These programs, often introduced ahead of state elections, provide financial assistance to women or cap cooking gas prices for the poor.  While they aim to address economic distress faced by these populations and may prove effective in boosting consumer spending, the article raises concerns about their sustainability. 

It questions the source of funding for these schemes, the potential for political manipulation, and the long-term impact on public service delivery.  The article concludes by speculating if these schemes are a disguised form of universal basic income and poses fundamental questions about their efficacy and the broader implications for India's welfare system.</description>

			<description>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) emphasizes the importance of increasing women's participation in the labor force for economic growth. 

India's female labor force participation rate (LFPR) is significantly lower than that of men and other countries, lagging behind even Bangladesh and the global average.  

This gap hinders economic potential, as closing it could boost GDP significantly.  

Beyond safety concerns, societal prejudices and traditional norms restrict women's opportunities.  

Addressing these issues requires a multi-pronged approach, including promoting urbanization, reforming attitudes, and sharing household responsibilities more equitably.</description>

			<description>Economists are revising recession predictions frequently due to global economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs recently reduced the US recession odds to 20% from 25%, citing positive retail sales data.  

However, debate continues over the potential impact of economic troubles on the US and the global economy. Investor sentiment has been volatile, with stock markets experiencing fluctuations worldwide, including India. 

While India's economy is domestically focused, its increasing global integration leaves it vulnerable to external shocks, which could affect exports and capital inflows.</description>

			<description>Quantum cryptography utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communications, offering protection against decryption even by powerful quantum computers. 

Two main methods are Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). QKD, considered more secure, involves sharing a secret key between parties using quantum particles in a way that any eavesdropping attempt alters their state, alerting the parties to the intrusion. PQC, relies on complex mathematical algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks.  

Major players like the US, China, and the EU are investing heavily in quantum cryptography research and development.  While challenges like cost and scalability of hardware remain, the field holds immense promise for revolutionizing global cybersecurity in the digital age.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/brian-niccol-new-starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-micromanagement-decision-making-chipotle-laxman-narasimhan-11724012414765.html</link>
			<description>Starbucks has hired Brian Niccol, former CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, to lead the company. This appointment comes amidst ongoing concerns about the influence of Howard Schultz, Starbucks' long-time CEO and now chairman emeritus. Schultz, who remains a significant shareholder and has various ongoing ties to the company, is known to have  had a say in key decisions, even undermining his previous successors. 

Niccol, who has experience dealing with both activist investors and founders, likely demanded the chairman title, mirroring his position at Chipotle. This move further complicates Starbucks' governance structure, as dual CEO-chairman roles are increasingly uncommon in corporate America. Despite the immense success Schultz built, his prolonged presence raises questions about his potential to hinder Starbucks' future growth and succession planning.</description>

			<title>Improving students' reading and numeracy: It takes a village and more</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/teaching-learning-outcomes-education-parent-engagement-numeracy-literacy-parent-teacher-association-technology-11724012245856.html</link>
			<description>India lags significantly behind China in education, with students scoring 20 points lower on average in math, science, and reading.  This gap is reflected in lower enrollment rates in higher education and a 44% lower labor productivity in India compared to China.  A lack of foundational literacy skills, coupled with low parental engagement and teacher dissatisfaction, creates a vicious cycle that hinders learning.  Addressing this requires heightened involvement from parents, teachers, and communities through structured training, recognition programs, and clear communication about student progress.  Strategies like personalized learning, technology integration, and streamlined administrative tasks can empower teachers and improve learning outcomes.  Creating a supportive educational environment where everyone plays an active role is crucial for India to achieve its educational goals.</description>

			<title>Small businesses still outside the formal structure? There exist challenges.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/msme-formalization-gst-taxation-input-tax-credit-value-addition-profit-margin-organised-sector-employment-tax-policies-11724012024861.html</link>
			<description>Recent surveys on unincorporated businesses in India reveal that while the number of enterprises and employment have increased since 2021, the majority of these businesses remain unregistered. Only 2% of  micro businesses are registered for GST, highlighting a significant gap in formalization despite government initiatives. While many benefits are linked to registration, such as access to formal credit and government schemes, a lack of financial literacy and compliance complexities act as barriers. 

The data also shows a stark difference in turnover and GVA between registered and unregistered businesses, suggesting that formalization can significantly improve the economic viability of small enterprises.  The article proposes solutions such as more accessible GST helpdesks and user-friendly super-apps to address compliance challenges and promote financial inclusion, ultimately driving the formalization of India's micro-business sector.</description>

			<title>We must focus on semiconductor chip manufacturing to get ahead in the GenAI race</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/semiconductors-chip-manufacturing-genai-tsmc-nvidia-samsung-silicon-valley-tech-innovation-11724011827217.html</link>
			<description>The global tech landscape is shifting with hardware, particularly semiconductors, becoming the new engine of innovation. Companies like TSMC, MediaTek, Samsung, and SK Hynix are experiencing remarkable growth in chip revenues, demonstrating this trend. Despite this, some in Silicon Valley and India cling to the belief that software will remain dominant.  

This perspective risks overlooking the crucial role of hardware in shaping the future of technology. In this new era, strategic investments in hardware companies, particularly semiconductor manufacturers, are becoming increasingly important. India, with its strong engineering talent, should leverage this opportunity by investing in hardware capabilities, forging strategic partnerships with East Asian firms, and encouraging regulatory frameworks that support hardware development. As chips are becoming the "new oil," India needs to act decisively to secure its position in this evolving technological landscape.</description>

			<title>From El Niño to La Niña: Is respite finally in sight?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/el-ni-o-la-ni-a-enso-pacific-ocean-climate-change-indian-ocean-dipole-imd-rain-forecast-rabi-crop-food-inflation-rbi-11724011498447.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the recent shift in the Pacific Ocean's climate patterns, moving from El Niño to La Niña.  This shift, while significant for global weather systems, has had a particularly noticeable impact on India's monsoon.  After a dry spell earlier in the year, India experienced a resurgence of rains attributed to the end of El Niño and the potential onset of La Niña. 

This transition has relieved concerns about rain deficits and is expected to benefit the upcoming rabi crop. However, the article also highlights the increasing frequency and unpredictability of these climate shifts, raising concerns about their potential impact on agricultural practices and food security. The potential for climate change to exacerbate these weather patterns is also discussed, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and adaptation strategies.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Jammu and Kashmir elections: A return of people’s rule</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-jamu-and-kashmir-assembly-elections-election-commission-election-schedule-democracy-article-370-11724011397442.html</link>
			<description>After being under central rule since 2018, Jammu and Kashmir is set to hold elections to restore power to its people. The Election Commission announced a three-phase schedule, spanning from September 18th to October 1st. This move is welcomed as it will re-establish democratic processes in the region after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. 

While central rule has brought stability and accelerated development, it has also raised concerns about the erosion of democratic rights. The upcoming elections are expected to address these concerns and demonstrate the people's desire for self-governance.</description>

			<title>Examination coaching crisis: It’s a monster of our own creation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/examinations-coaching-centres-exams-education-indian-colleges-tutions-anxiety-stress-11723975679834.html</link>
			<description>India's booming coaching industry, driven by societal pressure to succeed in high-stakes exams like those for engineering and medicine, has created a system where students are pushed into relentless academic pressure. This emphasis on rote learning over genuine understanding has led to a flawed education system that fails to equip graduates with the skills they need for the job market.  

The article criticizes the focus on coaching, arguing that it perpetuates a cycle of pressure and anxiety, stifling students' natural curiosity and well-being. It blames societal values that prioritize academic achievement over other forms of learning and suggests that the role of government regulation is counterproductive, as evidenced by the failings of existing regulations in the education sector. The author calls for a fundamental shift in how we value education, moving away from the pursuit of high-stakes exams and towards a system that fosters genuine learning and personal growth.</description>

			<title>China should consider setting a formal inflation target</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-central-bank-inflation-targetting-deflation-price-stability-consumer-price-increase-bond-market-rally-us-fed-11723973087978.html</link>
			<description>China is facing the challenge of low inflation, a situation prompting calls for policy intervention.  An influential advisor to the central bank has suggested adopting a 2%-3% inflation target, similar to targets set by other countries in the past.

This approach aims to provide predictability and guide policy decisions.  Advocates argue that it encourages businesses and households to adjust their behavior in anticipation of price trends.

However, implementing such a target in China presents political hurdles.  Central bank independence, often linked to inflation targets in other countries, is limited in China, where power is highly centralized.  Despite these challenges, the idea of an inflation target resonates as a potential solution to China's economic slowdown, which could also have global implications.</description>

			<title>The US elections will have a big impact on the climate change fight</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-us-elections-will-have-a-big-impact-on-the-climate-change-fight-11723971721687.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 US presidential election will have significant implications for global climate change efforts.  

Donald Trump's stance, if re-elected, would likely see the US withdraw from both the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, jeopardizing international cooperation. This could also endanger agreements with other countries like the EU and China.

In contrast, Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee,  supports ambitious climate action, including the Green New Deal. She could potentially strengthen US commitments and negotiate with other nations to address climate change.

However, Harris faces a dilemma as US tariffs on Chinese solar panels and EVs hinder the adoption of clean energy technologies. Balancing economic interests with climate goals will be a key challenge for the next president.</description>
