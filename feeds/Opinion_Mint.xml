			<title>Parity pricing in agriculture: Rework the MSP regime</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/parity-pricing-in-agriculture-rework-the-msp-regime-11717741311945.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of parity pricing in India's agricultural sector, which was introduced in 1922 to ensure a fair exchange value for agricultural products. In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system was introduced in 1966-67 to encourage farmers to adopt new varieties of wheat. However, the current MSP system mainly targets four water-intensive crops, contributing only 22% of India's agricultural output. The article highlights that small and marginal farmers, who comprise 89.4% of all agricultural households, are largely excluded from the MSP system due to low marketable surplus.

The article also notes that the MSP system has promoted monoculture, leading to unsustainable use of natural resources, such as water depletion in Punjab. Furthermore, the demand for non-cereal food items is rising, and India's agricultural imports are increasing, with the country being the world's largest importer of vegetable oils.

The author suggests that India's agricultural sector needs a balanced interplay of food security, farmer welfare, and environmental stewardship. To achieve this, the author proposes a customized MSP approach for each category of farmers, a regional rotational MSP, incentivizing soil health through farmer earnings, agricultural R&amp;D for crops like cotton and soybean, and a gradual shift from rotational MSP to market processes.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for a rethink of the current cropping systems and MSP framework to ensure sustainable agriculture, food security, and farmer welfare in India.</description>

			<title>Menstrual leave can lift women’s labour participation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/menstrual-leave-can-lift-women-s-labour-participation-11717610100251.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the debate on menstrual leave in India's Upper House of Parliament on 13 December 2023. It highlights the importance of menstrual leave for empowering women in the workforce, where they make up 40% of the service sector staff and have a 37% labor force participation rate. The discussion emphasizes that menstrual leave is essential for the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of employees, which in turn aids retention. Menstrual discomfort can lead to decreased performance and productivity, and menstrual leave policies are seen as a way to address workplace inequalities and support gender equity.

The article mentions that several countries have paid menstrual leave policies, and in India, states like Bihar, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh, as well as Kerala for university students, have introduced such policies. Private companies also offer menstrual leave. The IMF suggests that equal female workforce participation could increase India's GDP by 27%, or $700 billion, highlighting the economic benefits of gender equality.

To address concerns about menstrual leave being potentially discriminatory, the article suggests conducting research, running pilot programs, collecting feedback, reviewing policies, considering inclusive alternatives like flexible or wellness leave, and promoting education and awareness about menstruation. The goal is to create a supportive and inclusive work environment for all employees.</description>

			<title>The post-pandemic revenge travel boom seems to be waning</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-post-pandemic-revenge-travel-boom-seems-to-be-waning-11717609973509.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the changing trends in travel post-pandemic. The concept of 'revenge travel' is waning as higher costs, protests, airport fatigue, and inflation impact consumer behavior. While travel demand remains strong, there's a shift towards more normal patterns. Airlines and tour operators face a critical period; they may have to offer discounts if demand weakens, which hasn't been necessary for three years.

In Europe, early bookings were strong, but budget-conscious families are now waiting due to financial uncertainties. TUI has sold 60% of its summer vacations, similar to last year, but still faces challenges in an uncertain market. Travelers are also comparing destinations, with some areas like Turkey, mainland Spain, and Egypt seeing increased bookings due to better value compared to places like the Balearic and Canary Islands, where protests and costs have affected tourism.

Pricing for package holidays remains high, but budget airlines are reaching a price ceiling, with Ryanair cutting fares to fill seats. In the US, travel recovery signs are maturing, with flat growth in some sectors, but overall, the outlook remains positive with expectations of a summer bounce.

The article also notes that climate concerns and unusual booking behaviors, such as long-haul flights to stable climates, are emerging. Travel is becoming polarized, with the wealthy opting for luxury trips and others sticking to a budget. The industry is now eyeing the return of Chinese tourists to Europe.

Short-term factors like UK elections and weather will influence travel in the coming weeks. Despite changes, the desire to travel remains strong, though behaviors may adjust, like forgoing additional trips to preserve main vacations. The upcoming peak summer season will be telling for the industry, providing insights into post-pandemic travel trends.</description>

			<title>Elections done, India must unite for climate action</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/elections-done-india-must-unite-for-climate-action-11717609885967.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges and actions related to climate change in India. It highlights the recent general elections as a testament to India's democratic strength but notes the tragic loss of 43 staff due to a heatwave. The piece emphasizes the urgent need for climate action, criticizing the lack of focus on this existential threat during election campaigns. It suggests redefining 'community' to include shared geographical or occupational interests, rather than just religious groups, to better address climate catastrophes.

The article also points out the economic growth of India, juxtaposed with the environmental challenges faced by technology hubs like Bangalore, which suffer from water scarcity due to the destruction of traditional water bodies. It calls for community-level climate action beyond international emission reduction commitments and questions where such action should begin.

The piece compares India's situation with the US's National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), which conducts climate-related activities and research dissemination. It laments India's lack of a similar platform to prioritize climate action and influence policy, despite having notable climate activists and research on traditional water preservation methods.

In conclusion, the article advocates for a collaborative platform among India's autonomous science academies and national academies of engineering and medical sciences to address climate threats and provide objective analysis and advice, akin to NASEM's role in the US. This, it argues, would strengthen India's grip on its future in the face of climate challenges.</description>

			<title>Unemployment and inflation call for revising budget priorities</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/unemployment-and-inflation-call-for-revising-budget-priorities-11717645123019.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the economic challenges and growth prospects of India, focusing on the government's budgetary decisions in the face of unemployment, high food inflation, and rural distress. It highlights the robust tax revenue and RBI dividend, suggesting a re-examination of expenditure cuts from the interim budget. The government may need to balance between maintaining capital expenditure growth, which is essential for a 7%+ real GDP growth, and reducing the fiscal deficit to improve credit ratings. The fiscal deficit improved to 5.6% of GDP in 2023-24 and may be targeted to reduce to close to 5% in the final budget of 2024-25.

The article also addresses the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) success in keeping CPI inflation within the target range, despite high food inflation causing household dissatisfaction. It suggests that increasing MGNREGA allocations could support rural incomes, but broader policy attention is needed for employment.

Regarding GDP growth, the new government has a strong starting point with an 8.2% growth in 2023-24, but there are concerns about the sustainability of this growth due to a reduction in subsidies and low inflation rates. A more sustainable growth profile would target a real GDP growth of 7% and a nominal GDP growth of 10 to 11%. The article also emphasizes the need for lower interest rates and increased consumption expenditure growth to induce private investment and sustain a 7%+ real GDP growth in the medium term.

The views in the article are attributed to D.K. Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India, and are expressed as personal opinions.</description>

			<title>India's trade deficit: A comprehensive strategy could boost exports</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-trade-deficit-a-comprehensive-strategy-could-boost-exports-11717609722559.html</link>
			<description>India's trade figures for 2023-24 have drawn significant attention due to the country's trade deficits with nine of its top ten trading partners, with the exception of the United States, where India has a trade surplus. These top ten countries account for about 52% of India's total trade. The article emphasizes the need for a deeper analysis of India's trade issues, looking beyond just the trade balance figures. It suggests that trade deficits can result from various factors, including increased imports of raw materials, domestic income growth, or the availability of cheaper foreign products.

The article argues that focusing solely on trade balances is insufficient and that understanding the broader trade ecosystem is crucial. It highlights the importance of identifying products that can be efficiently produced domestically and traded globally, as well as the importance of boosting India's manufacturing capabilities through initiatives like the Production-Linked Incentive scheme and strategic mapping of manufacturing capacities.

Furthermore, the article notes a shift in India's export basket from traditional commodities to engineering and electronic goods, reflecting a move up the value chain and increased competitiveness. However, it also points out that there is still much work to be done for India to become a high-value commodity exporter. The article concludes that enhancing domestic manufacturing, leveraging competitive advantages, and investing in technology and innovation are essential for India to thrive as an export powerhouse in international markets. Thriving in international markets as an export powerhouse requires a comprehensive approach.</description>

			<title>Take heart: Coalition governments have led India’s reforms story so far</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/take-heart-coalition-governments-have-led-india-s-reforms-story-so-far-11717609447909.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of coalition governments on India's governance and economic reforms. It argues against the notion that coalitions hinder governance, stating that India's history shows coalitions can lead to effective policymaking. Since 1989, India has seen coalition governments, with the last decade being an exception where the BJP held a majority. Notable economic reforms were initiated under minority and coalition governments, including the liberalization of trade, industrial licensing, and exchange rates, as well as joining the WTO and overhauling the securities market under the Narasimha Rao government. The United Front government continued reforms by dematerializing shares, allowing foreign investment in debt, and setting up regulatory bodies. Subsequent NDA and UPA coalitions furthered reforms in taxation, infrastructure, telecom, and digital services, including the introduction of Aadhaar and UPI. The article concludes that political skill, rather than a majority, is crucial for implementing reforms, as evidenced by the GST rollout which required consensus across parties. The article suggests that concerns over coalition governments are overstated, as they have historically contributed to significant economic growth and policy advancements in India.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Did PMI readings get heat struck?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-did-pmi-readings-get-heat-struck-11717609356404.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the economic impact of the recent heatwave in India, noting a slowdown in both manufacturing and service sectors. The HSBC India services PMI, as reported by S&amp;P Global, decreased slightly from 60.8 in April to 60.2 in May. Similarly, the manufacturing PMI also fell from 58.8 to 57.5. The hot weather is cited as the cause for reduced working hours and a dip in demand. Despite the possibility of further disruptions due to high temperatures in June, the PMI indices remain above 50, indicating continued expansion. The article also highlights the potential for improved overseas demand and stresses the importance for India's manufacturing and service sectors to seek new export opportunities to enhance the economy's performance in the future.</description>

			<title>Monetary policy: Things to watch out for in the coming months</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/monetary-policy-things-to-watch-out-for-in-the-coming-months-11717496575060.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy and its implications. The RBI is expected to maintain a status quo in its June policy, with a focus on the 4% inflation target amidst steady growth. Key events such as the Union Budget, monsoon outcomes, and decisions by other major central banks are anticipated to influence future policies.

Global monetary policies are becoming asynchronous, with the European Central Bank likely to start rate cuts and the Bank of Japan considering rate hikes. The US Federal Reserve's rate cuts are expected later in the year. Despite better-than-expected global growth, concerns about its sustainability and the effect on commodity prices persist.

Domestic inflation in India is below 5%, aligning with the RBI's expectations, and core inflation is around 3%. The monsoon forecast is above normal, which may clarify the food inflation trajectory and help move inflation towards the 4% target. However, inflation is estimated to average around 4.5%, with a more significant move towards 4% possible only by FY2026.

India's GDP growth is strong, around 7.5-8%, but Gross Value Added (GVA) growth presents a more subdued outlook. The RBI will monitor the output gap, with some members believing it has closed. Investments are expected to drive GDP growth, averaging around 7% in FY2025, supported by an above-normal monsoon and rural demand.

The RBI's stance is to balance between inflation and growth, with the current strong growth providing leeway to focus on inflation targets. The RBI's repo rate is expected to remain at 6.5% until at least Q3FY25, with a shallow rate cut cycle unless growth concerns outweigh inflation concerns. The June policy will likely see the RBI continue its wait-and-watch approach.

			<title>Women-led philanthropy will improve the act of giving</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/womenled-philanthropy-will-improve-the-act-of-giving-11717528590833.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving landscape of philanthropy in India, highlighting the significant role played by women. It notes that philanthropy in India has a long history, but recently, women have been taking on more independent and impactful roles. The article mentions several prominent women, including Melinda French Gates, who is focusing on gender development after her divorce from Bill Gates; MacKenzie Scott, who has given away billions to NGOs with no strings attached; and Rohini Nilekani, who has been recognized for her contributions to causes like the environment and climate change.

The shift towards women-led philanthropy is attributed to several factors. Equity shares in new-age firms are often held by couples, not just men, allowing women to have their own wealth to redistribute. Studies suggest that women show greater accountability and focus on societal challenges, with one study indicating that women give away a larger proportion of their net worth than men.

The government and industry associations are also playing a role by nudging companies to channel CSR funds, often through units led by women with expertise in philanthropy. The article concludes by noting the rise of women billionaires in India who are using their inherited wealth for philanthropic purposes, signaling a positive change in the field. The article's narrative underscores the transformative power of women-led altruism in philanthropy.</description>

			<title>Inflation would feel bad even if it’s redefined to be less harsh</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/inflation-would-feel-bad-even-if-it-s-redefined-to-be-less-harsh-11717528524083.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the differing perceptions of inflation between the general American public and economists. While many Americans continue to view inflation as a major issue, economists do not share this sentiment. The debate has shifted to whether the definition of 'inflation' has changed from 'rising prices' to 'high prices.' The author argues against this redefinition, emphasizing that inflation is a continuous rise in the general price level, and the discrepancy arises from different time frames used for comparison.

The article suggests that instead of redefining inflation, better communication is needed to clarify these differences. It also points out that despite the gloom caused by a 16% increase in prices since January 2021, other economic indicators like low unemployment, rising median wages, and increased consumer spending suggest a more nuanced picture.

The author notes a puzzling trend where people rate their personal finances positively but have a negative view of the national economy. This divergence, which became pronounced in 2020, may be due to factors beyond economics, such as the psychological impact of COVID-19, negative news amplification through social media, and geopolitical events.

In conclusion, the article proposes that economists should focus less on semantics and more on understanding the non-economic factors contributing to the public's gloom. The author hopes for a shift towards discussions that encompass these broader reasons for discontent.©bloomberg</description>

			<title>Disparities in schooling quality need to end for better outcomes</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/disparities-in-schooling-quality-need-to-end-for-better-outcomes-11717528442304.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the disparities in educational quality across India, despite the Right to Education Act's success in improving access. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 reveals that states like Punjab, Rajasthan, and Haryana excel in Mathematics and Science for Class 10, while others like Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Chhattisgarh fall behind. The survey also shows a decline in student performance since NAS 2017, with notable drops in scores across all subjects as students progress from Class 3 to Class 10, suggesting that foundational skills are not being adequately developed.

The article emphasizes the importance of foundational learning and numeracy as outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which aims to ensure all children achieve literacy and numeracy by Grade 3 through holistic and experiential learning approaches. It also highlights the need for continuous teacher development, competency-based education, and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education 2023, which aligns educational objectives with measurable outcomes.

To address these disparities, the article suggests states should use NAS data for targeted interventions, prioritize teacher training, engage parents and communities, and align with NEP 2020. These steps are crucial for closing educational gaps and improving the quality of education across all states. The article underscores the urgency of these actions to create a more equitable and effective education system.</description>

			<title>Modi 3.0 could establish Indian leadership in climate resilience</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/modi-3-0-could-establish-indian-leadership-in-climate-resilience-11717528254044.html</link>
			<description>India is on the brink of a significant climate leadership role with the anticipated third term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Central to this leadership is the 'Panchamrit' strategy, which aims to achieve ambitious climate targets by 2030, including a 500GW non-fossil energy capacity and a 50% renewable energy share in the country's total energy mix. The strategy also seeks to reduce carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes and cut the carbon intensity of the economy by 45% from 2005 levels, with a long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2070.

India's climate actions are informed by science and evidence, balancing environmental sustainability with economic growth. Initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure demonstrate India's commitment to rallying global support for climate action. The Global Biofuels Alliance, launched at the 2023 G20 summit, aims to enhance biofuel trade and promote sustainable practices, potentially turning farmers into energy providers.

The concept of 'green GDP' has been highlighted by Prime Minister Modi as a measure of economic progress that accounts for environmental impact, aligning economic development with sustainability. India's renewable energy sector has seen substantial growth, with solar capacity increasing 26-fold and wind capacity doubling in the last decade, achieving 40% power-generation capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of schedule.

Despite these successes, India faces challenges, particularly its reliance on coal. To address this, the government plans to establish an Indian Carbon Market to decarbonize the economy, aiming to reduce the emission intensity of India's GDP by 45% by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. This initiative, along with others like the Green Credit Programme, positions India to lead by example in the global climate effort. The country's journey towards climate leadership is marked by a commitment to inclusive growth, poverty eradication, and environmental sustainability, fostering innovation and international cooperation.</description>

			<title>Poll woes: BJP’s vaulting ambition runs into coalition reality</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/poll-woes-bjp-s-vaulting-ambition-runs-into-coalition-reality-11717527885968.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the outcomes of India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aimed for a two-thirds majority, targeting 370 seats to assert dominance and symbolize the integration of Kashmir by scrapping Article 370. However, the BJP won around 240 seats, falling short of even a simple majority and marking a significant drop from its 303-seat win in 2019. This result has made the BJP reliant on coalition partners to govern, a shift that was unexpected by many and led to a stock market crash.

Despite retaining approximately 37% of the vote share from 2019, the BJP's losses, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, and only modest gains elsewhere, have introduced the party to the challenges of coalition politics. The Congress party, BJP's main rival, improved its position from the previous election, securing about 21% of the votes and around 100 seats, signaling its continued relevance as an opposition force. Other regional parties like the Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam also achieved significant victories.

The article suggests that the BJP's aggressive pursuit of a large majority may have alienated voters concerned about constitutional rights, such as affirmative action benefits. The current political scenario implies that the BJP's allies, like the Janata Dal-United and Telugu Desam Party, may now have greater leverage in the National Democratic Alliance coalition, potentially leading to a political dynamic reminiscent of the Vajpayee era, where controversial aspects of the BJP's agenda were set aside to maintain coalition harmony and focus on economic reforms. The article concludes by implying that the Constitution has emerged as an unacknowledged victor, symbolizing the bond of citizenship in India.</description>

			<title>It’s the economy! Rural voters send out a strong message on economic distress</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/its-the-economy-rural-voters-send-out-a-strong-message-on-economic-distress-11717514809001.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of unaddressed rural economic distress on the BJP's performance in the Lok Sabha election. It highlights the party's loss in key constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, including Ayodhya and Amethi, and a significant reduction in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's victory margin in Varanasi. The state's poor economic status is emphasized, with a large voter base dependent on farming. Despite India's rapid GDP growth, the agricultural sector and rural wages have grown minimally, affecting 45% of the working population employed in agriculture. The article points out the government's focus on headline GDP growth while neglecting the struggles of the rural, agricultural population. It also mentions the ILO's report on declining real earnings for salaried and self-employed individuals, and only a slight increase for casual workers, indicating poor employment quality. The BJP's oversight of rural distress and prioritization of infrastructure over rural welfare is criticized, suggesting that welfare measures have not compensated for low incomes, as reflected in the election results.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit: Stock market jitters: Over-bearish on a coalition government?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-stock-market-jitters-over-bearish-on-a-coalition-government-11717526701874.html</link>
			<description>India's stock market experienced a significant drop as the Lok Sabha election results came in, indicating that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), did not perform as well as exit polls had predicted. The S&amp;P BSE Sensex closed down by 5.7%, after a sharp intraday fall of up to 8.2%.

Initial reactions suggested a fear that the BJP's reduced hold on power might affect economic policy stability. However, as more results were announced post-trading hours, it appeared that the market's initial fears were exaggerated. Expectations are now set on a coalition government led by the BJP, likely with Narendra Modi serving a third term as Prime Minister.

Despite concerns about the wavering loyalty of allies like the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal-United, the article suggests that the economy does not necessarily have to suffer under a potentially unstable coalition. A common minimum programme could be beneficial for economic reforms, given the clear benefits of rapid growth. If the new coalition prioritizes the resurgence of the economy, the current bearish market sentiment could shift to a bullish one. The article advises against overreacting to the current political scenario.</description>

			<title>INDIA was a good idea that needed better execution</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/india-was-a-good-idea-that-needed-better-execution-11717513542424.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political landscape in India during the Lok Sabha elections. It highlights that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is poised to form the next government, albeit a weaker one compared to previous administrations. The opposition has been fragmented over the past decade, criticizing the government for deviating from India's pluralistic values. In response, there was an effort to form the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a coalition of various parties, to challenge the BJP's rising popularity. However, INDIA struggled with internal divisions and failed to present a united front or a common minimum program, leading to its inability to secure enough support to form a government.

The BJP, sensing the public mood, aimed for a high seat count and pragmatically formed alliances with several parties, including those of lesser significance. Despite these efforts, the BJP's estimated vote share remained around 38%, indicating that a majority of the electorate did not extend its mandate to the ruling party. The article concludes by reflecting on the nature of electoral outcomes and the choices of the electorate, quoting Abraham Lincoln on the ownership of elections by the people. The author, Arvind Kumar, is affiliated with Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.</description>

			<title>Failure has many mothers: The Indian voter gets it right again</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/failure-has-many-mothers-the-indian-voter-gets-it-right-again-11717513368205.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the unexpected loss of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It highlights the BJP's failure to secure a majority on its own and points to the rise of the Congress, the survival of Janata Dal-United's Nitish Kumar, and the resurgence of Telugu Desam Party's Chandrababu Naidu. The author reflects on the incorrect predictions made by pollsters, including their own forecast of a comfortable victory for Modi, which was based on the assumption that voters prioritize individual economic welfare.

The article also draws parallels with the United States, where despite a successful economy under Joe Biden, the Democrats are expected to lose the upcoming elections. It notes the failure of exit polls to accurately predict the results, with the best performing exit poll by Dainik Bhaskar only getting the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tally approximately right at the low end.

The author suggests that the BJP's indulgence in anti-Muslim rhetoric and polarization, particularly in states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Maharashtra, was counterproductive and may have contributed to their loss. The article calls for introspection within the BJP, criticizing the party's arrogance and open-door policy that led to increased corruption and a mistaken belief in the effectiveness of polarization.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the role of the Indian voter in setting checks and balances to policy, drawing an analogy with economic monopolies where success leads to complacency and arrogance, ultimately resulting in failure. The author anticipates significant policy changes within the BJP, including less misuse of Enforcement Directorate powers, more tolerance towards sexual offenders, less imprisonment of opposition leaders, and more freedom of expression. The article ends by reiterating that the election belongs to the Indian voter, who has the power to effect change.</description>

			<title>Poll result debacle: The stock market’s love for the BJP cost it dearly</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/poll-result-debacle-the-stock-market-s-love-for-the-bjp-cost-it-dearly-11717512153065.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the recent Lok Sabha election results on the Indian stock market. Despite expectations of a comprehensive victory for the BJP-led NDA, the actual seat count was lower than predicted, leading to a 5.7% drop in the S&amp;P BSE Sensex. The article analyzes factors that have previously driven stock prices up, such as increased sales and profits of listed companies, formalization of the economy, low interest rates, corporate tax cuts, and protective tariffs. It also notes the significant investments by foreign institutional investors and domestic investors, including a rise in demat accounts and investments by domestic institutional investors.

However, the article suggests that the rapid increase in retail investors may not continue, and with interest rates no longer low, the future of stock prices is uncertain. Sales growth is slowing, reflecting a slowdown in private consumption, which has been financed by household borrowing. This trend could eventually affect profit growth. Stock valuations are high, with the price-to-book ratio at its peak since 2007-08. The article concludes by questioning whether retail investors will maintain their investment levels and recalls the market's reaction to the 2004 election results, suggesting that while there are no guarantees, diversification remains a prudent investment strategy. The BJP-led NDA is expected to return to power, albeit with a reduced majority.</description>

			<title>Margin calls by brokers heightened volatility</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/position-portfolio-for-the-long-term-11717510288716.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the Lok Sabha election results on the Indian stock market, particularly the Sensex and Nifty indices. It highlights that the market volatility and correction were due to the election results not meeting the expectations built up by market players and exit polls. The Futures and Options (F&amp;O) market's large outstanding positions, nearly ten times the daily trading volume, contributed to this volatility, especially as positions were unwound and margin calls forced sales.

Despite the current volatility, the article remains optimistic about India's economic growth, citing the country's strong economy, political will, and consistent growth outperforming other global economies. It notes that India's policy framework and government-owned enterprises' market capitalization have supported this growth. The author, the MD &amp; chief executive of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, advises investors to stay confident in India's long-term growth story, suggesting that the current market conditions offer an opportunity to rebalance portfolios and commit to long-term investments. The article encourages continued investment in mutual funds and highlights the potential for India's economic reforms, like Make in India and Startup India, to further drive growth. The views expressed are personal to the author.</description>

			<title>Modi 3.0: It's time to write a guidebook for tax reforms</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/fiscal-management-of-the-new-government-11717501950893.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's economic reforms and tax policy in light of recent global events and the country's fiscal future. It highlights the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as a significant policy shift, leading to increased revenue collections and suggesting a formalization of the economy. The article notes the impressive growth in direct tax collections despite the pandemic, with a substantial increase in the number of income tax payers and returns filed.

It also touches on the stabilization of income tax rates and the need for further corporate tax reforms to minimize disputes and encourage investment. The piece raises questions about the adequacy of reforms in achieving a higher tax to GDP ratio and the future of taxes in India, considering public debates on capital gains, inheritance, wealth tax, and tax increases.

The author suggests that a guidebook for future tax reforms, informed by macroeconomic priorities like private investment for employment, is necessary. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of a medium-term fiscal strategy that includes taxes to set India on a higher growth path amidst global uncertainties such as war, inflation, and oil politics. The author of the article is Suranjali Tandon, an Associate Professor at NIPFP.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/putting-wind-beneath-the-economy-s-sails-11717498862532.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the need for India's economic reform to benefit its entire population rather than a select few. It highlights the country's early focus on building a modern industrial economy through public sector investment in heavy industries and research institutions, while neglecting the Gandhian vision of strengthening village economies. The author argues that sustainable economic growth requires a strong base of producers and consumers in villages and small towns, and that policy makers should focus on creating employment for the masses rather than wealth for the few. The piece reflects on India's past economic policies, which led to a reliance on imports and a shift away from domestic production, and calls for nurturing domestic industries, promoting high employment sectors, and expanding the social safety net. It criticizes the privatization of public services and suggests that the government should strengthen its delivery capabilities to build a more sustainable economic base. The author, Arun Maira, emphasizes that economic growth should aim to improve citizens' lives and that human development is essential for sustainable growth.</description>

			<title>Job creation, alleviating rural distress likely to top new government's agenda</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/job-creation-alleviating-rural-distress-likely-to-top-new-governments-agenda-11717496513784.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the outcomes of the general elections in India, highlighting the surprise results that contradicted the exit polls' prediction of a decisive victory for the BJP-led alliance. Despite reported economic growth, the electorate expressed concerns over the economy, particularly the plight of informal-sector workers earning low incomes. The article suggests that the real GDP growth has not translated into widespread prosperity, with rural wages contracting and inequality influencing election results in some states.

The author, a former Union agriculture secretary, argues that the new government must prioritize creating employment opportunities and work collaboratively with states to strengthen federal polity. The article emphasizes the need for meaningful reforms in the agriculture sector, where a significant portion of the workforce is engaged but remains underpaid. It also points out the potential for employment generation in sectors like textiles, leather, construction, and food processing, which have been affected by poor policies and neglect.

Furthermore, the article touches on the role of NGOs in social development and the impact of GST on small businesses. It concludes with a call for the new government to fill vacancies transparently and address the unemployment crisis among the educated youth. The overarching theme is the necessity for the new government to consider the masses' struggles and to implement policies that foster employment and economic growth across various sectors.</description>

			<title>AI can empower India’s digital public infrastructure by enabling diverse apps</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ai-can-empower-india-s-digital-public-infrastructure-by-enabling-diverse-apps-11717440206006.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing India's digital public infrastructure (DPI). It highlights insights from an event in Bangalore where the future of AI was showcased, emphasizing the need for a decentralized computing approach and a self-regulated AI industry. The core idea is that AI can significantly improve the reach and responsiveness of DPI by adapting to individual preferences and contexts, thus making public services more user-centric.

A key example provided is Setu's AI-enhanced personal financial management app, which operates within WhatsApp and uses the Account Aggregator system to offer personalized financial advice. This app exemplifies how AI can navigate the complexity of financial management through a conversational interface, making it accessible to a broader audience.

The article suggests that while DPI has been successful in reaching scale, it has struggled with diversity. AI can address this by bringing variety to standardized solutions, allowing them to adjust dynamically to individual needs while remaining scalable. The integration of AI into DPI solutions is seen as a crucial step towards making these services truly beneficial for every citizen. The article concludes that AI's ability to enhance DPI will be instrumental in creating a trusted tech ecosystem that is inclusive and diverse.</description>

			<title>The best business books tend to be about music and sports</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-best-business-books-tend-to-be-about-music-and-sports-11717440059919.html</link>
			<description>The article presents a critique of traditional business and self-help books, suggesting they often lack originality and context. Instead, the author proposes that readers should focus on books about specific businesses or industries they are familiar with, or delve into books about sports and music groups to gain insights into management and group dynamics. The author shares personal experiences of learning from books about the Beatles, the Byrds, and XTC, emphasizing the value of understanding failures and successes. Highlighted is the autobiography of Alex Ferguson, which offers lessons on talent management, and Jerry Kramer's memoir for insights into team loyalty. The article concludes by suggesting that the best business books are those not written explicitly for business purposes, and the author expresses a preference for history and biography sections in bookstores over repetitive economic literature.</description>

			<title>Double trouble: Road mobility in India is both unsustainable and unjust</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/double-trouble-road-mobility-in-india-is-both-unsustainable-and-unjust-11717439929999.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's road infrastructure expansion, highlighting both its achievements and challenges. India has increased its road length significantly, yet it still lags behind countries like the US in terms of road length per capita. The budget for road transport has seen a substantial increase, with a shift towards capital expenditure for new roads rather than maintenance.

However, this focus on expansion has led to deteriorating road quality, causing more accidents, lower fuel efficiency, and higher pollution. Traffic speeds in Indian cities are among the lowest globally, leading to increased emissions. The transport sector contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, with road transport accounting for a large portion.

The article also points out the mental stress and health impacts due to pollution, with many Indian cities ranking high in pollution levels. Despite commitments to reduce emissions and road accidents, the current strategy of road expansion is criticized for not addressing the root causes of congestion and pollution. The design and planning of road projects are seen as inadequate, often resulting in temporary fixes that shift congestion rather than solve it.

The article suggests that a focus on mobility demand management, including promoting public and rail transport and implementing effective de-bottlenecking strategies, would be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than the current approach, which disproportionately affects poorer commuters. The National Capital Region's road projects are cited as examples of poor planning leading to traffic jams and accidents. The article concludes that without a change in strategy, road expansion alone will not improve the situation.</description>

			<title>India's Census needs an urgent update: Vital data mustn't be delayed</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-census-needs-an-urgent-update-vital-data-mustnt-be-delayed-11717439760201.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the absence of an updated census in India, which has not been conducted since 2011 due to the pandemic. This has left India with outdated demographic data, even as it has reportedly surpassed China to become the world's most populous country. The lack of current data affects various aspects of governance and policy-making, including strategic planning for India's youth population and the allocation of welfare benefits. The article also touches on the political implications of a new census, particularly the potential shift in power from southern to northern states, and the need for a fair and trustworthy census before the delimitation exercise in 2026. The article underscores the importance of the census for accurate representation in the Lok Sabha and for informed policy decisions.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick edit | Can elections be scheduled to beat the heat?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-can-elections-be-scheduled-to-beat-the-heat-11717439439534.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent Indian elections, highlighting the record-breaking voter turnout of 642 million, including 312 million women. Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar referred to the event as a "miracle," noting the turnout was 1.5 times that of all G7 countries combined and 2.5 times that of the 27 European Union countries.

However, the elections faced challenges due to high temperatures, prompting the Election Commission to consider completing future polling before the onset of summer. The heat reportedly caused fatalities among those involved in the polling process, underscoring the need for schedule changes to ensure voter and official safety. The article suggests that the government may need to shorten its term to accommodate these changes, especially as global warming is expected to intensify heat conditions in the coming years. The proposal appears to have broad political support.</description>

			<title>Golden Goose shoes: What’s it worth for investors?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/golden-goose-shoes-what-s-it-worth-for-investors-11717354610843.html</link>
			<description>Golden Goose Group, known for its $500 distressed sneakers, is planning an IPO in Milan, aiming for a valuation of around €3 billion. Acquired by Permira in 2020, the company is positioning itself as a luxury brand, akin to Dr Martens, but with a higher price point and less reliance on third-party US retailers. With a customization option in its 190 stores, Golden Goose has seen significant growth, with a 2023 sales increase of 18% to €587 million and a 19% rise in Ebitda to €200 million. Despite this, the brand's reliance on its signature 'lived-in' sneakers, which account for 90% of its business, poses a risk due to the volatile nature of fashion trends. The company is diversifying with a new bag range, aiming to reduce footwear reliance to 70%. However, challenges remain, such as standing out in a crowded market and potential impacts from economic slowdowns, particularly in the US, which makes up 41% of sales. The valuation should reflect these risks, with comparisons to Dr Martens suggesting a more conservative Ebitda multiple. Permira will retain a significant stake post-IPO, hoping to avoid the pitfalls that have affected Dr Martens' performance post-listing.</description>

			<description>The article discusses significant advancements in science and exploration over the past few years, highlighting space and deep-sea exploration, vaccine development, and brain research. 

Space exploration has seen renewed interest with China's Chang'e 4 and Chang'e 6 moon landings, India's Chandrayaan-3 mission, and NASA's upcoming Artemis III mission. ISRO plans to send humans into low-earth orbit and eventually to the moon, while NASA, in partnership with private firms like SpaceX, is working on rocket reusability for missions to Earth's orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

Deep-sea exploration has also progressed, with crewed and unmanned submersibles reaching depths over 10,000 meters, and an international project aims to map the entire ocean floor, with 20% completed so far.

In the medical field, the Nobel Prize for Physiology in 2023 recognized the use of mRNA in vaccines, a method that is more efficient than traditional vaccines and has wide applicability. Research continues on new mRNA vaccines.

Brain research has advanced significantly, with initiatives like the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies and the Global Brain Initiative. Elon Musk's Neuralink has developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) that was implanted in a quadriplegic patient, allowing thought-controlled computer interaction. However, challenges remain in compressing 'thought data' for transmission from the chip to a computer.

The article also mentions the Centre for Brain Research at the Indian Institute of Science and the National Brain Research Centre in India, which focus on neuro-generative disease prevention, early diagnosis, and interventions. Discoveries related to the Indian gene pool could help mitigate neuro-generative diseases in India's aging population. The article concludes with a quote from the Dalai Lama, emphasizing the importance of our own brain and heart.</description>

			<title>Raghuram Rajan: Focus on the export of services to drive India’s economic growth</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/raghuram-rajan-focus-on-the-export-of-services-to-drive-india-s-economic-growth-11717354536531.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's potential growth strategy by leveraging its skilled workforce to boost service exports. It highlights the success of India-based global capability centres (GCCs) in attracting multinational firms and contributing significantly to global services. The shift to remote services post-pandemic, such as consulting and telemedicine, is emphasized, showcasing the cost-effectiveness and global reach of Indian professionals.

However, the article also points out the challenges faced by India, including a shortage of highly-skilled workers due to educational deficiencies. It suggests that India must create jobs that match the current skill levels while improving education and vocational training to prepare for future jobs. The article proposes reforms like employing part-time workers in government-run daycares to improve children's learning and public funding for vocational programs to increase employability.

The article concludes by discussing the implications of India's growth strategy on the global stage, arguing that high-value service exports are difficult to restrict and can benefit ageing industrialized nations. It also suggests that India's growth can have a positive impact on the climate and global economy, provided there is a visionary change at the top, which was a central issue in India's general election. The article underscores the importance of India's people as its greatest asset and the need for long-term investment in education and healthcare to harness this potential.</description>

			<title>Four action points for the new government’s first 100 days</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/four-action-points-for-the-new-government-s-first-100-days-11717353175392.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of the first 100 days of a new government, a period often used to signal priorities and implement manifesto items. It references Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal as an example of bold decisions made during this time. For India's government in 2024, amidst positive economic conditions, the article suggests four economic priorities for the first 100 days:

1. **Addressing Employment**: Launch a national apprenticeship program with more robust legal backing to address youth unemployment and skill deficits. Extend the Agniveer scheme to improve army intake and address exit year concerns.

2. **Supporting Agriculture**: Legally guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism for farmers, which would only be necessary if market prices fall below a set floor. The government should also avoid frequent bans on agricultural exports.

3. **Improving Credit Access**: Develop a national policy to provide formal credit to tenant farmers and small entrepreneurs, who often lack collateral. Innovations like account aggregators could help arrange loans based on cash flows.

4. **Wealth Tax for Education**: Impose a 1% tax on financial wealth exceeding ₹100 crore to fund rural schools and primary education, with funds going directly to local governing bodies.

The article emphasizes the need for these measures to stimulate economic recovery, build trust, and address challenges such as unemployment, skill gaps, and wealth inequality. It suggests that these steps could help leverage the government's electoral win and maintain political capital.</description>

			<title>Green tape: Delhi’s policy for EV adoption by gig platforms is too prescriptive</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/green-tape-delhi-s-policy-for-ev-adoption-by-gig-platforms-is-too-prescriptive-11717353098849.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by platform businesses in Delhi due to a new policy mandating a transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The policy aims to reduce vehicular pollution by increasing the number of commercial EVs. However, it faces practical difficulties, such as low EV penetration, with only around 9% of two-wheelers and 1.5% to 3% of four-wheelers being EVs since 2022. The policy requires platforms to update their fleet fortnightly and meet EV targets, which is challenging due to the insufficient number of charging points and battery swapping stations in Delhi.

Additionally, the policy does not count low-speed electric vehicles (LSEVs), which are popular among gig workers for hyper-local deliveries. The insistence on high-speed EVs, which are expensive, makes compliance difficult for businesses and gig workers who typically own the vehicles they use. The policy also requires that only EVs registered in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi are counted, which complicates matters for vehicles that transit across state borders.

The article suggests that the policy's stringent requirements and short deadlines could harm businesses and gig workers, as it raises the entry barrier for gig work and forces workers to buy expensive high-speed EVs. It argues that while the intent to go green is commendable, the means to achieve it should not impose a specific technology or configuration on businesses, and practical challenges should be considered when designing policies. The article concludes that the policy might be another example of a well-intended initiative failing at the implementation stage.</description>

			<title>The secret to career success may well be off to the side</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-secret-to-career-success-may-well-be-off-to-the-side-11716381238649.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the value of lateral career moves, which are job changes that do not necessarily involve a promotion or pay rise but can lead to significant benefits for both employees and organizations. Research by Donald Sull and others in 2021 showed that the opportunity for such moves greatly increases employee retention, being more important than salary. Further studies by Xin Jin and Michael Waldman found that employees who made lateral moves were more likely to be promoted and receive higher wage growth later on.

Good management is linked to facilitating lateral moves, with better bosses enabling more internal transfers that suit employees' skills, leading to higher pay and profits. Lateral moves are also beneficial for learning new skills, expanding internal networks, and avoiding job boredom. They provide a variety of challenges and opportunities for growth, which can be more motivating than waiting for promotions.

The article suggests that embracing lateral moves requires a shift in mindset from both managers and employees, valuing horizontal growth as much as vertical advancement. It concludes that a change in the language of career success could help in recognizing the value of sideways moves.

			<title>Biden's industrial policy made America’s EV tariffs necessary</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bidens-industrial-policy-made-america-s-ev-tariffs-necessary-11716312019775.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the tension in US economic policy, particularly concerning the electric vehicle (EV) industry. It highlights President Joe Biden's implementation of punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs as a response to the significant investment in expanding the US's own EV production capacity. Despite subsidies, US EV makers are struggling with slow growth and an underdeveloped charging infrastructure. The high cost of US-made EVs is attributed to Biden's dual goals of reducing carbon emissions and creating high-wage manufacturing jobs, which are seen as incompatible due to global competitiveness issues.

The article argues that sustaining uncompetitive industries, like the EV industry in the US, can be defensible if costs are not too high. However, the surprise at China's ability to produce cheap EVs has led to the US needing tariffs of at least 100% to protect its nascent industry and support union jobs. These tariffs may slow down the adoption of EVs in the US, contradicting climate change goals. New EPA rules are being considered to control the sale of EVs and gas-powered vehicles, which may lead to higher prices for fossil-fuel vehicles to offset EV losses.

The article also critiques the inconsistency in US trade policies, which are seen as market-correcting when domestic but market-distorting when applied by China. It suggests that America's industrial policies harm its trading partners and questions whether disputes can be resolved cooperatively. The piece concludes by expressing skepticism about the protectionist approach and anticipates a continued cycle of policy errors.</description>

			<title>Electoral bonds case: Do not nullify past transactions</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/electoral-bonds-case-do-not-nullify-past-transactions-11716312184910.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Supreme Court of India's decision to strike down the electoral bond scheme as unconstitutional. The scheme, which allowed corporate houses to donate to political parties anonymously, was found to violate the Indian Constitution's Articles 14 and 19, concerning the rights to equality and information. The ruling has significant implications for past transactions under the scheme, as it is retrospective, meaning that actions taken under the scheme could be voided. This raises complex legal challenges for companies and political parties, especially regarding donations made beyond the previously established cap of 7.5% of a company's net profits. The doctrine of prospective overruling, which can save past transactions from being invalidated, was not fully applied by the Supreme Court, leading to ambiguity and potential legal difficulties for India Inc. The authors suggest that the only recourse is to approach the Supreme Court for directions to safeguard past transactions, thereby setting a precedent and reducing complications. The article concludes with a note that these are the personal views of the authors.</description>

			<title>What does an emerging Squad in the Indo-Pacific mean for India?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/what-does-an-emerging-squad-in-the-indo-pacific-mean-for-india-11716311850448.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the formation of a new security arrangement called the 'Squad' among the US, Australia, the Philippines, and Japan to address security concerns in the Indo-Pacific region. This arrangement aims to deepen integration among these democracies and counter China's militarization of the South China Sea. The Squad is part of a broader trend of informal strategic alliances, or 'mini-laterals,' which include the Quad and Aukus.

The Philippines has expanded its alliance with the US and is negotiating agreements with Japan and Australia to enhance military cooperation. The first multilateral maritime exercise among the Squad members took place in the Philippines' EEZ in April 2024. The creation of the Squad reflects a convergence of political will and shared interests among the member countries, which began to intensify in 2023.

Historically, the US, Philippines, Japan, and Australia lacked a unified strategic vision for the region. However, recent developments have led to a shift in strategy. The US has recognized China as a major power challenging the established order, Japan has adopted a more assertive defense role, and the Philippines, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has taken a proactive stance against Chinese expansionism.

The article suggests that the future of Indo-Pacific security will likely involve flexible, practical cooperation rather than traditional alliances. The Squad and other mini-laterals must work together to build collective capacity and coordinate actions to maintain regional stability in the face of potential challenges from China. The nature of security threats in the region necessitates close coordination among these informal groupings.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/banks-with-politically-exposed-persons-as-customers-must-stay-alert-11716311437712.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the issue of **Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)**, highlighting their association with corruption and financial crimes. It mentions the discovery of large sums of unaccounted money in India and instances of corruption involving PEPs globally. The article emphasizes the role of banks in monitoring PEPs to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, especially during election years when the risk of illicit financial activity is higher. It underscores the need for banks to invest in systems to identify and report PEP relationships and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations. The article also notes the role of digital technologies in aiding banks to manage compliance and reporting, and the continuous efforts of regulators like the RBI and the US Federal Reserve to enhance policies and procedures to combat political corruption and ensure the integrity of financial institutions. The global scale of money laundering is estimated to be 2%-5% of global GDP, amounting to over $2 trillion annually, with a significant portion believed to involve PEPs. The article concludes by urging banks to remain vigilant to maintain their reputation and the health of their balance sheets.</description>

			<title>Spare a thought for people who live amid heaps of urban garbage</title>

			<description>The article describes the harsh realities of waste workers in India, who are often referred to as ragpickers. These workers collect waste from the city and bring it to a site where they sort and sell any valuable materials to recycling chains. They live in makeshift homes on the site, which is divided among 12 contractors. Entire families, including children, work in this trade, earning a meager income based on the amount of waste they can collect. They face daily hazards such as exposure to dangerous materials and lack of basic amenities like water and toilets.

The land they live on is subject to disputes among various claimants, including the state government and a religious institution. Control over the land is more important than legal titles, leading to conflicts and sometimes violence. The workers are marginalized, often not benefiting from government schemes, and their children face barriers to education due to discrimination.

The article contrasts the workers' living conditions with the nearby affluent areas where people spend large sums on leisure, contributing to the waste the workers must handle. It calls for societal change and collective action to address these issues but acknowledges that such change is unlikely. It suggests small acts of kindness and consideration towards the workers, such as not using derogatory terms, ensuring they receive government benefits, tolerating their presence in schools, and being mindful of hazardous waste disposal. The article ends with a reflection on the broader societal indifference to the plight of these workers and the need for a moral awakening to initiate change.</description>

			<title>The India-Iran Chabahar port project will test our diplomacy</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-india-iran-chabahar-port-project-will-test-our-diplomacy-11716301285321.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the geopolitical implications of the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, particularly concerning India's involvement with Iran's Chabahar port. The port is strategically located and is significant for India's trade routes and geopolitical ambitions. India recently renewed a 10-year deal to jointly develop and operate the port, committing $370 million to its upgrade. This move strengthens ties between India and Iran despite US sanctions.

However, Raisi's death introduces uncertainty regarding the future of India-Iran relations and the Chabahar project. The upcoming election in Iran may result in a hardliner president, potentially affecting the project's progress. The article also highlights the challenges posed by the US's stance on sanctions and the geopolitical situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover, which impacts the original trade plans involving Chabahar.

Furthermore, the article touches on India's strategic autonomy, its relationship with Israel, and the potential impact of the Chabahar port on India's trade routes, including the India-Middle-East-Europe Economic Corridor. It also mentions the competition from Pakistan's Gwadar port, developed with China, which could test India's geopolitical skills and strategies. The article concludes by emphasizing Chabahar's critical role in India's strategic interests and the challenges that lie ahead.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Kashmir's Lok Sabha poll turnout is a good sign</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-kashmirs-lok-sabha-poll-turnout-is-a-good-sign-11716301386868.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significant voter turnout in the recent Parliamentary elections in Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K), nearly five years after the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. This high participation rate is seen as a positive sign for the re-establishment of democratic processes in the region. The turnout was notably higher than in previous elections, with some constituencies witnessing the highest levels in decades.

The article suggests that the increased turnout may indicate an electorate that felt secure enough to vote, as the region experienced relative calm and a decreased fear of terror attacks. Women's participation at polling stations was particularly highlighted.

Overall, the turnout figures are viewed as indicative of an improved security situation in J&amp;K, aligning with the long-term goal of peace in the area. However, the article notes that the process of restoring full popular representation is not complete, with the last assembly elections having taken place a decade ago. The Supreme Court has set a deadline for September, anticipating that assembly elections will follow shortly thereafter. The article concludes by hinting at the possibility of assembly polls in J&amp;K soon after the Lok Sabha Election 2024, as suggested by the Chief Election Commissioner after a record turnout in Baramulla.</description>

			<title>Rishi Sunak’s visa politics has implications for Indian students</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/rishi-sunak-s-visa-politics-has-implications-for-indian-students-11716287452794.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by Rishi Sunak, Britain's Prime Minister, as he navigates the political landscape marked by the Conservative Party's declining popularity and the rise of the Labour Party. The Tories' long tenure, Boris Johnson's COVID-19 controversies, Liz Truss's budgetary blunders, and Brexit repercussions have all contributed to voter disenchantment.

A significant issue highlighted is the proposed changes to the Graduate Route Visa (GRV) scheme, which could limit opportunities for Indian students in the UK. The GRV scheme currently allows graduates to stay in the UK for two years (three for Ph.D. holders) to find employment. The proposed amendment aims to restrict this to only the "best and brightest," potentially affecting the 42% of GRV visas held by Indian students, many of whom rely on earnings in the UK to repay educational loans.

The National Indian Students and Alumni Union, UK, and Universities UK have expressed concerns about the proposed changes, emphasizing the lack of visa misuse and the economic contributions of foreign students. The article suggests that Sunak faces a choice between short-term political gains through stringent immigration policies and long-term economic benefits by welcoming skilled immigrants. The hope is that Sunak will prioritize long-term benefits over short-term political pressures.</description>

			<title>Thailand's cannabis legalization policy needs reform and not a reversal</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/thailands-cannabis-legalization-policy-needs-reform-and-not-a-reversal-11716211430529.html</link>
			<description>Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin is considering a reversal of the country's cannabis policy, which would reclassify the plant as a narcotic, limiting its use to medical and health purposes only. This comes after the previous administration decriminalized cannabis to attract tourists, stimulate a medical marijuana industry, and provide farmers with a new cash crop. However, the policy has not yielded the intended benefits for farmers and has raised concerns about its impact on Thai youth and social harmony.

Despite the potential benefits of decriminalization, such as reducing pressure on the legal system and disrupting the illegal drug trade, Thailand's conservative culture and regional drug laws pose challenges. The country, which was the first in Southeast Asia to allow medical marijuana use, has seen a boom in dispensaries and consumer-agro firms. However, concerns over the social and health impacts on young people have prompted reconsideration. Recent research indicates a significant increase in cannabis use among 18-to-65-year-olds since decriminalization.

The government's potential reclassification of cannabis as a category-five drug could lead to severe penalties for possession. While an outright ban could harm farmers, businesses, tourists, and consumers, a middle-ground approach focusing on medical use and taxation could regulate the sector more effectively and benefit locals. The article suggests that Thailand should seek a balanced and rational policy adjustment after the initial economic high from the cannabis industry.</description>

			<title>Placing policy restrictions on open-source AI models will not help anyone</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/placing-policy-restrictions-on-open-source-ai-models-will-not-help-anyone-11716211498831.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution and challenges of encryption technology, focusing on Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and its legal battles due to government concerns over national security. It draws parallels between past encryption debates and current discussions on open-source AI models. The author argues that fears over AI safety and geopolitical advantages are exaggerated, noting that large language models (LLMs) are easily portable and that open-source models allow for community-driven improvements. The article highlights the potential impact of US export restrictions on AI, particularly on India's AI strategy, which relies on open-source models for developing diverse solutions. The author expresses concern that such restrictions could hinder India's ambition to become a global AI use-case leader. The article concludes by suggesting that the US's stance on AI model export controls may be counterproductive, similar to its past approach to encryption technology.</description>

			<title>America’s strong dollar: Would a Trump presidency weaken it?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/americas-strong-dollar-would-a-trump-presidency-weaken-it-11716211374192.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent strengthening of the US dollar, particularly against Asian currencies, and explores whether anything should be done to mitigate this trend. It highlights the significant depreciation of the Japanese yen and other Asian currencies, attributing the dollar's strength to better economic performance in the US compared to other regions. This has led to expectations of continued high interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, contrasting with potential rate cuts by other central banks due to weaker growth.

The article argues that the strong dollar is not a cause for concern regarding Japanese financial institutions, as Japan's inflation remains under control. It also dismisses the likelihood of a confidence collapse leading to uncontrollable inflation in Japan, considering its history of deflation.

Possible responses to the dollar's strength include market intervention, which the Bank of Japan is suspected of having done recently. However, such interventions are only effective if they signal an impending change in monetary policy, which is not currently the case for Japan. The article also mentions the unlikelihood of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates in response to the dollar's rise, as well as the impracticality of concerted intervention by multiple central banks, given the Fed's focus on combating inflation.

Finally, the article speculates on the impact of a potential second presidential term for Donald Trump, suggesting that his preference for low interest rates and a weaker dollar could lead to a decrease in the dollar's value but might also negatively affect American financial markets. The article concludes with a cautionary note on the potential consequences of such a policy shift.©2024/project syndicate</description>

			<title>The Godrej split holds valuable lessons for family businesses</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-godrej-split-holds-valuable-lessons-for-family-businesses-11716211200840.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the strategic split of the 127-year-old Indian conglomerate Godrej, led by the Godrej family's decision to realign ownership for smooth succession. The Godrej group, founded in 1897, is now led by the fourth generation and has been divided into Godrej Enterprises and Godrej Industries, with one faction controlling unlisted companies and a land bank, and the other overseeing five listed firms.

The piece outlines the typical ownership stages of family businesses: from a single controlling owner, to sibling partnership, and finally to a cousin consortium, which adds complexity to family and business dynamics. The Godrej group, which started as a lock-maker, has been in the cousin consortium stage for nearly six decades, facing challenges like wealth sharing, family mission alignment, and maintaining unity.

After the split, the ownership structure may revert to the sibling partnership stage within each new entity, which often involves issues like power distribution, fairness perceptions, and professional management. The article emphasizes the importance of clear governance mechanisms and ownership structures to avoid conflicts and align family interests with business goals. It also highlights the unique challenges family groups face in balancing business, ownership, and family objectives.

The Godrej family's split, concluded respectfully with a "no-compete" clause for six years, aims to ensure family harmony and brand reputation. The article suggests that family enterprises should focus on keeping families in business, considering rapid business changes, family evolution, and varying aspirations. A split can be a strategy to unlock entrepreneurial potential and re-imagine legacy, rather than a decline suggested by the adage "Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations."

These insights are presented as the author's personal views on the lessons from the Godrej family's strategic decisions. The summary omits unrelated content and advertisements for clarity.</description>

			<title>Auditors need be paid a reasonable fee for the sake of audit quality</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/auditors-need-be-paid-a-reasonable-fee-for-the-sake-of-audit-quality-11716211125450.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concerns over low audit fees in India, which have seen only a modest increase over the years, not keeping pace with the general rise in employee salaries. This has led to a lack of resources for audit firms to invest in technology and expertise, resulting in a talent drain as chartered accountants leave for better-paying jobs. The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) has noted issues with audit firms' capacity and independence, with low fees potentially compromising audit quality.

The article highlights the importance of reasonable audit fees to maintain independence and quality. It contrasts the situation in India with the U.S., where audit fees have increased significantly following regulatory changes. The article suggests that audit firms should not accept unsustainable fees and that companies should ensure remuneration allows for quality standards. It also emphasizes the need for audit firms to invest in technology and personnel, and for the NFRA to check the reasonableness of audit fees to prevent quality issues. The overall message is that audit fees should be fair and support high-quality audits, which are crucial for public interest.</description>

			<title>Soaring profits are no reason to go slow on banking reform</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/soaring-profits-are-no-reason-to-go-slow-on-banking-reform-11716210932044.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the financial performance of public sector banks (PSBs) in India and the ongoing debate about bank privatization. Despite PSBs reporting a record net profit of ₹1.4 trillion in 2023-24, which is a 34% increase from the previous year, and a reduction in bad loans to under 4%, the article argues that this should not deter the government from continuing with the privatization of banks. It suggests that privatization would subject banks to market discipline and improve operational efficiency, which is essential for a competitive credit market. The article also notes that private banks have been outperforming PSBs, with a 42% increase in net profits to ₹1.7 trillion.

The government's reluctance to reduce its equity control over PSBs, despite the successful mergers that reduced their number from 27 to 12, is seen as a hindrance to the privatization process. The failure to privatize IDBI Bank has raised questions about the future of PSB privatization. The article advocates for the privatization of PSBs, except for the State Bank of India, which could continue to serve welfare objectives. It proposes public offerings of equity or direct transfers of shares to citizens as means to achieve privatization and enhance market discipline. The central argument is that a profit surge should not obstruct the privatization agenda, which has merits of its own in creating an efficient and globally competitive banking system.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Post-Raisi Iran: A hard state unlikely to soften</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-post-raisi-iran-a-hard-state-unlikely-to-soften-11716211046898.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significant impact of the sudden deaths of Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash. This event occurs at a critical juncture, with potential domestic power struggles and international consequences. Raisi, known for his hardline stance, was considered a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khameini and responded to calls for democratic reforms and women's rights with severe measures, including executions and imprisonments.

Geopolitically, Raisi's administration increased the use of proxy militias and recently escalated tensions with Israel by launching drones in retaliation for the killing of an Iranian general by Israeli forces. The article suggests that the appointment of a new president is unlikely to change Iran's rigid state policies, with slim chances for moderates to gain influence. The ongoing tension in West Asia and the 2022 knife attack on Salman Rushdie are cited as indicators of the enduring extremist challenges within the region.</description>

			<title>Geo-neutrality: India is lukewarm to Nato’s invitation for good reason</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/geoneutrality-india-is-lukewarm-to-nato-s-invitation-for-good-reason-11716141172701.html</link>
			<description>The article provides a historical overview and contemporary analysis of NATO's evolution and its strategic implications. It begins by recounting the post-WWII events that led to NATO's formation, including the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the Greek civil war, and the Berlin blockade by Stalin. These events prompted Western European nations to seek US assistance, leading to the Marshall Plan and the creation of NATO in 1949.

Initially, NATO aimed to protect Western countries from Germany and the Soviet Union, but its role expanded with the Cold War. NATO now includes 32 countries, with Finland and Sweden being the latest additions. The article highlights NATO's operational changes catalyzed by the Korean War and the invocation of Article 5 only once, after the 9/11 attacks.

The article discusses the challenges NATO faces today, such as internal disagreements among member states and the shift in focus from Russia to China as the major strategic adversary. It also explores the potential expansion of NATO to include countries like Australia, New Zealand, Israel, India, and Japan, which could lead to a more unwieldy organization with a broader geographical focus.

Furthermore, the article examines alternative strategic coalitions like the Quad and Aukus, formed in response to China's rise. It suggests that the future may require more nuanced forms of collaboration rather than traditional military alignments.

The article concludes by pondering the future of NATO in light of Russia's recent actions, suggesting that while NATO has been revitalized, it may need to adapt to remain relevant. It ends with a reflection on the longevity of alliances, quoting Victor Hugo on the challenge of sustaining ideas past their prime. The article implies that narrower, more flexible relationships might better serve countries like India in the future.</description>

			<title>Will Toyota’s hybrid bridge to electric vehicles work according to plan?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/will-toyota-s-hybrid-bridge-to-electric-vehicles-work-according-to-plan-11716141100044.html</link>
			<description>Toyota Motor Corporation's approach to electric vehicles (EVs) is distinct from other EV makers, who prioritize battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). Toyota includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids, BEVs, and fuel-cell models in its electrified category. While Tesla and BYD focus solely on BEVs, Toyota's sales of electrified vehicles were 37% of its total last fiscal year, with only 1.1% being BEVs. This is due to Toyota's broader definition of "electric-powered" vehicles, which includes gasoline-powered EVs.

Toyota argues that hybrids, which generate electricity from a combustion engine, have significantly reduced CO2 emissions, equivalent to the impact of 3 million BEVs. The company's chairman, Akio Toyoda, suggests that given Japan's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity, a direct switch to electric charging might not be cleaner. Toyota's strategy reflects market forces and consumer readiness, as many global consumers face range anxiety and a lack of charging infrastructure compared to gasoline stations.

The article suggests that Toyota's cautious approach to fully electric models, favoring hybrids, may be wise. It allows consumers to transition to greener options without the pressure of fully committing to EVs. Toyota's methodical development and efficient manufacturing have led to its industry dominance, and its gradual move into EVs may help it avoid the pitfalls that have affected early EV pioneers. However, there is a risk that this patient strategy could cause Toyota to miss out on the growing EV market, potentially leaving it behind like Nokia in the smartphone era. The company aims to avoid becoming the MySpace of cars, balancing innovation with caution.</description>

			<title>Greater social diversity in higher education is serving India well</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/greater-social-diversity-in-higher-education-is-serving-india-well-11716184499072.html</link>
			<description>The article provides an overview of the growth and current state of higher education in India. It highlights that the Indian higher education system is one of the largest globally, with a significant increase in enrolment over the past nine years. The enrolment of students from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), and minority communities, particularly Muslims, has seen a notable rise, indicating the effectiveness of the country's reservation policy towards inclusive education.

Enrolment rates for SC, ST, and OBC communities are now closer to their respective population compositions, suggesting progress towards educational equity. However, minority groups, especially Muslims, are still underrepresented in higher education compared to their population percentage.

The article also discusses gender parity, noting that women's enrolment in higher education has reached almost equal levels with men, and in some cases, women's enrolment growth outpaces that of men. This trend is seen across all social groups and is particularly strong among women from disadvantaged communities.

To further improve enrolment and take advantage of the aspirations of various social groups, the article suggests expanding the capacity of existing educational institutions and establishing new ones in regions with low institutional capacity. Emphasizing distance education as a tool to increase enrolment, the article concludes that broadening educational opportunities is crucial for allowing more individuals to benefit from higher education, rather than limiting the prospects to a select few.</description>

			<title>Welfarism: We’re not just beneficiaries but citizens and voters too</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/welfarism-we-re-not-just-beneficiaries-but-citizens-and-voters-too-11716140922217.html</link>
			<description>The article reflects on India's journey from a newly independent nation to its current democratic state, questioning whether the idea that "the people are supreme" has truly been internalized after 75 years. It discusses the legacy of subjecthood and the politics of patronage, where citizens are seen more as beneficiaries of state largesse rather than active participants in governance. The rise of welfarism over the past two decades is highlighted, with provisions like free foodgrain, electricity, and health insurance expanding in scope. The current election campaign has turned this into competitive welfarism, potentially undermining mature political discourse.

The debate on freebies, once vigorous, seems forgotten, with the extension of the free foodgrain scheme and promises of doubling free grain entitlements going largely unquestioned. The article suggests that while such schemes may have achieved objectives like food security and inflation protection, they blur the lines between freebies, welfare benefits, and subsidies, leading to an inevitable move towards a larger welfare state. However, it calls for a more meaningful journey towards this state by emphasizing the role of citizens, voters, and taxpayers, rather than beneficiaries, and recognizing that welfare benefits come from the government treasury, funded by taxes. The article concludes by stressing the need for an adult dialogue between the people and their elected officials, acknowledging the massive redistribution exercise involved in election promises and welfare benefits.</description>

			<title>There’s a reason why the Indian stock market seems to love the BJP</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/theres-a-reason-why-the-indian-stock-market-seems-to-love-the-bjp-11716140848610.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Indian stock market's anticipation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Despite some volatility, the market has remained relatively stable. Investors are categorized into foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs), with FIIs selling off stocks and DIIs purchasing them, indicating confidence in the BJP-led government's continuation post-elections.

The stock market favors the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) due to policies that have formalized the economy, such as demonetization, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and corporate tax cuts. These measures have benefited listed companies with increased sales, lower taxes, and higher profits. Data shows significant growth in net sales and profits for over 5,000 listed companies since 2016.

There is concern among FIIs that if the BJP-led NDA does not win, the opposition may increase government spending, financed either by a higher fiscal deficit leading to increased interest rates or by raising corporate taxes, which could negatively impact stock prices. The article suggests that retail investors may not have fully considered these implications, but institutional investors likely have, reflecting the stock market's role as a forward-looking entity influenced by its own incentives.</description>

			<title>Can Vijay Shekhar Sharma reinvent Paytm once again? He must.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/can-vijay-shekhar-sharma-reinvent-paytm-once-again-he-must-11716115637460.html</link>
			<description>Paytm's stock has plummeted to an all-time low, with a significant drop in value since the Reserve Bank of India's directive to halt new deposits at Paytm Payments Bank. The company's share price has fallen 85% from its initial public offering (IPO) price, reflecting long-term underperformance. Concerns are growing about Paytm's sustainability amidst a declining market share in UPI transactions and intensifying competition from larger firms. The impact of the payments bank closure on revenue and margins, particularly in lending, is expected to be substantial. The recent resignations of senior leaders have further fueled speculation about the company's stability. Despite these challenges, there is no indication of a leadership change at Paytm. Founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who led the company's transformation into a digital financial services pioneer, faces the task of reinventing Paytm to maintain relevance in a market that has shifted towards UPI, dominated by rivals like PhonePe and Google Pay. Paytm's market capitalization has drastically reduced from its peak valuation, casting the company as a cautionary tale of potential fundamental weaknesses overshadowed by the founder's charisma.</description>

			<title>Liquidity coverage: Don’t add to the regulatory burden on banks</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/liquidity-coverage-don-t-add-to-the-regulatory-burden-on-banks-11716119998172.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) proactive measures to review and possibly revise the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) framework. This comes in response to the challenges posed by digital banking, where customers can quickly transfer funds, potentially leading to liquidity crises. The RBI aims to ensure banks can always meet cash outflows, especially during acute stress. The article suggests that instead of waiting for a crisis to occur, the system should be fool-proofed to minimize such events.

It also explores the idea of modifying the rules for online transfers, such as limiting real-time gross settlement (RTGS) transactions to business hours, to manage liquidity more effectively. This could help prevent unexpected large outflows that cause liquidity crises. The traditional banking model in India, which relies on current and savings accounts rather than bulk deposits, provides some comfort against bank runs. However, the article proposes that tweaking online transfer rules could further reduce the low probability of acute-stress events and enhance the stability of the financial system. The article concludes by reiterating the need for banks to manage their liquidity efficiently in the face of increasing online transfers and compliance burdens.</description>

			<title>Finance in India has a new bogey called private credit</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/finance-in-india-has-a-new-bogey-called-private-credit-11716111823350.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rise of private credit in India and the associated regulatory challenges. Private credit, often managed by professional managers and funded by institutional investors, provides non-publicly traded debt to startups and early-stage companies, serving as an alternative source of capital. It has grown significantly, with $7.8 billion in deals in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2022. Notably, private credit has been used for refinancing stressed real estate loans, including significant deals for the Shapoorji Pallonji and Vedanta Groups.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened when it was discovered that private credit was being used to 'evergreen' loans, where banks and NBFCs invested in funds that provided new loans to companies on the verge of defaulting on existing loans from the same banks or NBFCs. This practice helped avoid loans being tagged as non-performing assets (NPAs) and bankruptcy proceedings, while also avoiding loan impairment recognition for lenders.

The article highlights the opaque nature of private credit operations and the need for stronger regulation. The International Monetary Fund's Global Financial Stability report dedicated a chapter to the risks of private credit, emphasizing its light regulation compared to banks and NBFCs, lack of standardized contracts, and potential for causing financial contagion due to its opacity. The article calls for regulatory intervention to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, noting the uneven competition due to uneven regulation and the capability gaps in private credit compared to established banks and NBFCs. The need for regulatory equity is stressed to ensure financial stability and deter excessive risk-taking.</description>

			<title>Climate change is real: The world is hotter than it’s been for two millennia</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/climate-change-is-real-the-world-is-hotter-than-it-s-been-for-two-millennia-11716110599144.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses a recent study published in Nature that used tree ring analysis to determine that the summer of 2023 was the hottest in the northern hemisphere in the last 2,000 years. This finding is significant because it challenges the skepticism around global warming by providing evidence that recent temperature increases are not just part of Earth's natural temperature fluctuations but are indeed exceptional.

The study's analysis of tree rings, ice cores, and sediment layers shows that while the Earth has experienced temperature changes in the past, the current warming trend is unprecedented in the last two millennia. The paper also references the 'hockey stick graph' from 1998, which illustrated a dramatic rise in global temperatures since the mid-20th century.

Historical events like the volcanic eruption in 536 CE, which led to a significant drop in temperature, are contrasted with the summer of 2023, which was 3.9° Celsius warmer. The article also touches on the medieval warm period and its impact on human civilization.

The research, led by Jan Esper of Johannes Gutenberg University, aims to better understand Earth's pre-industrial temperatures and suggests that the pre-industrial era was cooler than previously thought. This implies that current temperatures are even more abnormal, with the potential to exceed the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global warming within 1.5° C of pre-industrial levels.

Climatologist Ray Bradley emphasizes the uniqueness of the current warming trend and counters claims that dismiss the seriousness of greenhouse gas emissions. The article concludes on a hopeful note, stating that it's not too late to manage global warming if we heed nature's warnings.</description>

			<title>India must raise productivity for sustainable and inclusive growth</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/india-must-raise-productivity-for-sustainable-and-inclusive-growth-11716109533064.html</link>
			<description>India's productivity has been on the rise, averaging a 5.6% increase annually since 1997, outpacing the global average. This growth is largely attributed to capital investment per worker, which has nearly quadrupled during this period. However, India's capital stock per worker remains significantly lower than that of China and Central and Eastern Europe.

A McKinsey analysis reveals that only 56% of India's largest public companies achieved a return on invested capital (ROIC) greater than their weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in 2023. This is an improvement from 43% in 2014, but it also indicates that a substantial number of companies are not creating lasting value. Moreover, ROIC has recently declined, with the top 1,000 companies barely meeting shareholder return expectations.

The performance across sectors varies, with software, pharmaceuticals, and automotive industries faring better than apparel and energy. These top companies are crucial to the Indian economy, representing a significant portion of market capitalization and corporate revenue.

To sustain productivity growth, India must improve capital deployment, especially as most infrastructure and factories are yet to be built. Manufacturing, despite its high productivity growth, offers low returns and accounts for a small employment percentage compared to other countries with similar growth rates.

McKinsey suggests that manufacturing could contribute over $1 trillion to GDP by 2030 and provide many well-paid jobs. Strategies like building manufacturing clusters near ports, enhancing processes, and deploying capital expenditures more effectively could significantly boost productivity.

Digitization of supply chains and operations, along with investments in digital capabilities, can lead to greater efficiency and reduced operational costs. Additionally, focusing on higher-value goods, better packaging, and stronger branding in sectors like food processing and steel could increase profits without substantial investments.

Overall, India's productivity has improved markedly since 1997, but there is ample opportunity for further growth to achieve sustainable and inclusive development.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: Alice Munro reported from inside the heads of women</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-alice-munro-reported-from-inside-the-heads-of-women-11716105810751.html</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the literary significance and personal philosophy of Alice Munro, a renowned short story writer. It discusses the elevated status of the short story genre and Munro's unique position as a Nobel laureate recognized exclusively for her short stories. Munro, who passed away at 92, is remembered for her insightful portrayal of women's lives and experiences, often challenging societal expectations. The article also touches on gender dynamics in literature, noting that while male writers may claim a universal perspective, their readership is predominantly female. Munro's success is attributed not only to her talent but also to the literary establishment's tendency to celebrate certain artists later in their careers. The piece suggests that Munro's greatness was acknowledged when she was older, reflecting a broader pattern where the establishment often chooses to honor those who are no longer contemporaries. The article concludes with musings on Munro's humility and her detached view of her own literary status, suggesting that she did not regard literature as the most important aspect of her life.</description>

			<title>The carbon emissions of war put humanity’s right to exist at risk</title>

			<description>The article discusses the overshadowing of war's immediate existential threat by the long-term existential threat of climate change. It highlights the significant carbon emissions from recent wars, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine, which have contributed to global emissions on a scale comparable to entire countries. The author criticizes the climate change movement for not adequately addressing the environmental impact of war, despite the UN's adoption of the PERAC resolution and the Geneva Convention protocol against environmental damage during conflicts. The article calls for holding polluters accountable by making them pay into a global fund to compensate victims of climate change and suggests that UN reform is necessary to address the vested power of permanent members of the UN Security Council, who are ironically seen as significant threats to human security. The author argues that geopolitics and international security are critical issues that the climate change movement cannot afford to ignore.</description>

			<title>Jagmohan Dalmiya, the man who set cricket on its path to current riches</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/jagmohan-dalmiya-t20-world-cup-cricket-on-its-path-to-current-riches-11715862029105.html</link>
			<description>The article celebrates the legacy of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who revolutionized cricket administration and played a pivotal role in expanding the game's global reach. Dalmiya's journey began with his involvement in the Cricket Association of Bengal, leading to a significant position in the BCCI by 1983. He challenged the dominance of England over world cricket by successfully bidding to host the 1987 World Cup in the Indian subcontinent, which marked the beginning of a rotation system for future tournaments.

Dalmiya's vision saw the re-admittance of South Africa to international cricket and the transformation of cricket's financial model. He fought for the BCCI's right to sell television rights, leading to a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1995. His business acumen shone during the 1996 World Cup, generating substantial revenue and strengthening the Asian bloc's influence in cricket.

Elected as the first Asian ICC president in 1997, Dalmiya continued to innovate, introducing the ICC KnockOut Trophy and securing Test status for Bangladesh. His tenure as BCCI president saw the introduction of player contracts and pensions for former cricketers and umpires.

Despite facing allegations of misappropriation of funds and expulsion from the BCCI, Dalmiya was exonerated after legal challenges. He was re-elected as BCCI president in 2015 but passed away later that year. The article underscores Dalmiya's indelible impact on cricket, making the sport richer through his contributions.</description>

			<title>India’s rural awakening: An economic growth engine</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-rural-awakening-an-economic-growth-engine-11715929430586.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's economic shift from urban to rural areas, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Over the past decade, rural India has seen a growth rate of 7.3% compared to urban areas' 5.4%, driven by the manufacturing sector's move from cities to rural districts. This shift has the potential to propel rural India to double-digit growth rates, provided there is an acceleration in structural transformation and increased investment in infrastructure.

Despite the growth, rural India still faces significant infrastructure deficiencies, with urban areas receiving a 600% increase in investment over the last decade. The manufacturing sector's growth in rural areas is not uniform; it is concentrated in districts that have improved their infrastructure. The spatial spread of manufacturing in India is slower compared to trends in China and the US.

The article suggests that India's future in manufacturing lies in rural areas, which require scaling up investments. It highlights the need to address land market distortions, as inefficient enterprises often monopolize land resources, hindering productivity. The author calls for comprehensive reforms to transform rural India, expand the manufacturing sector, and create jobs, which will lead to higher productivity, food security, and self-advancement for rural populations. Technological advancements in AI, biotechnology, and GIS are seen as enablers for inclusive agriculture and diversified rural livelihoods.

Initiatives like the Andhra Pradesh Integrated Irrigation and Agriculture Transformation Project are promising, aiming to increase agricultural productivity and climate resilience. The article concludes with the expectation of a shift from farm to non-farm jobs in rural India, facilitated by government support and continuous economic transformation towards higher value-added sectors. The author is a senior fellow at the Pune International Development Center.</description>

			<title>Biden's Chinese EV tariffs could spark trouble for Tata Motors and opportunity for power industry players</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bidens-chinese-ev-tariffs-could-spark-trouble-for-tata-motors-and-opportunity-for-power-industry-players-11715933334921.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the potential global economic impact of US President Biden's imposition of 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and other goods. The tariffs, which also affect solar cells, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum, EV batteries, and some critical minerals, are expected to significantly reduce the $18 billion worth of imports from China. In response, China may impose higher tariffs on US imports, with Boeing's aircraft being a symbolic target.

The US justified the trade restrictions under Section 301 of its Trade Act of 1974, which allows for trade restrictions or negotiations when foreign practices violate labor rights, are anticompetitive, deny fair trading opportunities, or aim to penetrate export markets. With no objective criteria for such determinations and the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Mechanism weakened, a bilateral trade war is likely.

Mexico could benefit as Chinese EV makers might relocate production there to export to the US under the free trade agreement. Indian producers, particularly in the EV sector, may face increased competition as Chinese manufacturers look to other markets. India's EV import policy, which reduced duties on completely built-up units (CBUs) to 15% given certain investment conditions, could prompt large-scale manufacturing in India to avoid high tariffs.

Tata Motors, with a 72% share of the Indian EV market in 2023, could face price competition from Chinese EV makers establishing production in India. The shift in Chinese exports could lead to an increase in climate-friendly EVs in smaller countries, creating additional demand for power generation equipment, grid management software, and energy pricing models. Indian providers are advised to prepare for this demand, which could include solar cell production and software services.</description>

			<title>The Reserve Bank of India should defy the curve and cut rates</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-reserve-bank-of-india-should-defy-the-curve-and-cut-rates-11715929562446.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the global inflation surge in 2022 and the subsequent monetary policy responses, particularly focusing on the US and India. It highlights the US's success in reducing inflation from 8% to under 3% while maintaining GDP growth above 2%, albeit at the cost of high public debt. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which was initially slow to respond, managed to stabilize the Indian currency and attract foreign funds despite global economic pressures. The RBI's unexpected pause in rate hikes led to market speculation of future cuts, but rising vegetable prices and international conflicts prompted a cautious stance. The article suggests that the RBI should adopt an accommodative policy, considering geopolitical risks as temporary and unlikely steep rises in oil prices. It argues that rate hikes have little effect on food prices, which are more influenced by logistical issues and global warming. The piece concludes by advocating for a policy rate cut by the RBI to stimulate private investment and economic growth, especially for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other vulnerable segments, as public investments are expected to decrease in line with fiscal consolidation goals. The author is identified as the chief economist of the Piramal Group. The article was published on 17 May 2024.</description>

			<title>Seinfeld’s spoof on Kellogg: Brand theft or celebrity endorsement?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/seinfelds-spoof-on-kellogg-brand-theft-or-celebrity-endorsement-11715873643825.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving trend of brand parodies in entertainment, particularly focusing on Jerry Seinfeld's Netflix release "Unfrosted," a spoof on the breakfast cereal rivalry in America. It humorously distorts the success story of Kellogg's Pop-Tarts, using the company's brands and mascots. The film represents a shift in American filmmaking, where companies are increasingly seen to embrace humor, even when it involves their brands. This is contrasted with the Indian film industry's cautious approach, as seen in Rajesh Krishnan's "Crew," which uses fictional stand-ins for real companies.

"Unfrosted" is noted for its creative liberty, with Seinfeld joking about the potential for a lawsuit from Kellogg for brand infringement. The article highlights the split of Kellogg into Kellanova and W.K. Kellogg Company, with Kellanova calling the film a "farce not fact" and a fictional account meant for entertainment. Interestingly, Kellanova joined the humor by releasing a spoofy video and a limited-pack product, Tart-Pops, playing along with the movie's narrative.

The article raises questions about whether brands are developing a sense of humor and whether they are being advised to laugh along with jokes made at their expense. It suggests that brand parodies might be becoming more acceptable and even beneficial for companies, as seen by the positive reception to "Unfrosted" and its engagement with the brand it parodies. The piece concludes by pondering the implications of this trend and whether it signifies a deeper change in corporate image management.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | US elections: Brace for Biden vs Trump debates</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-us-elections-brace-for-biden-vs-trump-debates-11715873194288.html</link>
			<description>As the US presidential elections approach, excitement builds with the announcement of two televised debates between incumbent Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, scheduled for June and September. This marks their first debate since 2020, when Trump frequently interrupted Biden. Both candidates are setting their terms for the debates: Biden seeks to establish ground rules, while Trump favors a grand venue with a large audience. Although Trump leads slightly despite legal issues, the debates could be pivotal if the race tightens. Trump has avoided debates with other Republican candidates and has taken to social media to challenge Biden, while also attacking Biden's age, despite the small age difference between them. The age requirement for presidential candidates is a minimum of 35 years, a criterion rarely questioned.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the evolving relationship between humans and machines, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). It traces the history of machines designed to mimic human behavior, from early mechanical attempts to the latest AI chatbots. The focus is on how these interactions change us, our perceptions, emotions, and even our neural wiring.

The concept of 'artificial intimacy' is introduced, highlighting how people form emotional bonds with AI tools, which may have significant societal and evolutionary implications. The ease of interacting with machines over humans is noted, as it lacks the friction of human relationships, potentially leading to emotional fragility.

The article also touches on the idea that AI, built from collective expert intelligence, could surpass individual expertise and reduce the need for human conversation. However, it questions the impact on our sensitivity to the emotional nuances of human interaction.

In summary, the article raises critical questions about the definition of being human in an age of advanced AI and how our interactions with technology might be reshaping our very nature. It concludes with more questions than answers, inviting reflection on the future of human-machine relationships.</description>

			<description>OpenAI has introduced a new version of ChatGPT, dubbed GPT-4o, which boasts real-time visual interpretation capabilities and an engaging, human-like interaction style. The AI's ability to infer emotions and respond to audio quickly is part of a broader shift towards 'ambient computing,' aiming to create more natural user experiences. However, this approach has raised concerns about the social and psychological impacts of interacting with AI that exhibits personality traits, such as flirtatiousness. Critics question the potential for unhealthy attachments to develop, especially among emotionally vulnerable individuals, and the broader effects on mental health. OpenAI's focus on consumer engagement with GPT-4o comes amidst stagnating user growth and increasing competition from other AI developers. The tech industry's pursuit of digital assistants with more personality could lead to unintended consequences, echoing the issues faced by social media platforms that prioritized engagement over user well-being.</description>

			<title>Aim high: Industry-academia ties could catapult India’s biopharma industry</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/aim-high-industry-academia-ties-could-catapult-india-s-biopharma-industry-11715782887841.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution and current state of the biopharmaceutical industry, emphasizing its rapid growth, particularly in India. It highlights the industry's expansion from 2019 to 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on biopharmaceuticals derived from living organisms, including vaccines and gene therapies. The Indian biopharma sector has seen significant growth, surpassing $92 billion in 2023, driven by chronic diseases, higher incomes, and the demand for effective treatments.

The article stresses the importance of collaboration between industry and academia for continued innovation and development of bio-therapeutic products. It notes that while large pharmaceutical companies have been the traditional drivers of drug discovery, academic institutions have also contributed significantly and should play a more direct role in drug development.

Examples of successful industry-academia collaborations include the development of India's first home-grown gene therapy for cancer and various innovation programs that have led to healthcare innovations and intellectual property filings. The article also mentions the establishment of global capability centers in India, employing professionals across the R&amp;D value chain.

The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and National Biopharma Mission (NBM) are highlighted as initiatives that enhance India's biopharmaceutical capabilities. The article calls for increased funding for innovation schemes, recruitment of overseas talent, and specialized training in biotech legal and regulatory frameworks to prepare students for the industry's future. It concludes by advocating for the empowerment of academic institutions through technology transfer offices and increased innovation to expedite drug development.</description>

			<title>Maldives matters: India’s moving to foil Chinese designs</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/maldives-matters-india-s-moving-to-foil-chinese-designs-11715795429334.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the geopolitical dynamics between India, the Maldives, and China in the context of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It highlights India's strategic concerns regarding the Maldives' growing proximity to China, especially under President Mohamed Muizzu's pro-China stance. India's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, emphasized the importance of reciprocal sensitivity in developing bilateral ties with the Maldives.

The Maldives' decision to replace Indian military personnel with civilians and not renew a hydrography agreement with India, coupled with a defense pact with China, has strained relations with New Delhi. The article also notes India's efforts to maintain influence in the IOR through strategic partnerships and investments, such as developing the Kankesanthurai port in Sri Lanka and operating the Mattala airport.

India's approach contrasts with China's, as it aims to avoid debt traps for beneficiary nations, a concern highlighted by the Maldives' significant debt to China. The article concludes by mentioning India's increased naval deployments and the establishment of strategic outposts, like the naval base INS Jatayu and the upgraded facilities on the Agaléga islands of Mauritius, to counter China's influence in the IOR. These moves are part of India's broader strategy to secure its interests in the region amidst China's expanding naval presence.</description>

			<title>Fix food inflation: Quit erratic intervention, adopt a rulebook</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/fix-food-inflation-quit-erratic-intervention-adopt-a-rulebook-11715782778442.html</link>
			<description>India's economy is currently facing persistent inflation, particularly in the food sector, which has kept overall inflation above 4% for over two years, with a recent figure of 4.83% in April 2024. The inflation rate for cereals stood at 8.63% in April, with rice and wheat experiencing significant increases. Despite global cereal prices dropping by 18%, domestic food inflation remains high due to factors such as unseasonal weather affecting production and government policies that have created artificial scarcity.

Government decisions on stock holding limits and trade restrictions, along with the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), have led to market uncertainty and failed to stabilize prices. Measures like export bans on wheat and rice, and stock disclosure requirements have not reduced prices but have instead caused fear among traders and speculative price increases.

These policies have also negatively impacted farmers, reducing their financial incentives and leading to a decline in pulse production. The article suggests that while controlling inflation is important, it should not come at the expense of farmers' livelihoods. A balanced price policy that protects both farmers and consumers is needed, replacing ad-hoc decisions with a rule-based framework to stabilize agricultural prices.</description>

			<title>Globalization at threat: US import tariffs have dealt free trade a heavy blow</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/globalization-at-threat-us-import-tariffs-have-dealt-free-trade-a-heavy-blow-11715783768867.html</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the United States' recent trade policies, particularly the increase in tariffs on clean-tech imports from China, which marks a significant shift from America's traditional role as a proponent of free trade. The Biden administration has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and other goods, citing national security and unfair subsidies by Beijing. This move is seen as protectionist and potentially harmful to economic and climate goals, as it could lead to trade wars similar to those that occurred a century ago.

The article suggests that while free trade theoretically leads to global efficiency and benefits all trading partners, the reality is marred by geopolitical tensions and policy myopia. For India, the article advises caution and consideration of economic logic, despite the temptation to push back against Chinese imports and the potential to benefit from the US's anti-China stance. It warns against allowing geopolitics to override economic sense, especially as the US's actions could prompt China to dump subsidized goods into the Indian market, complicating trade relations.

			<title>Mint Quick edit | Should India’s mixed trade bag prompt a rupee rethink?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-should-india-s-mixed-trade-bag-prompt-a-rupee-rethink-11715784568552.html</link>
			<description>In April 2024, India's trade scenario presented a mixed outcome. **Exports saw a slight increase of 1.1%** to nearly **$35 billion**, maintaining stability despite global geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions. However, **imports surged by 10.3%** to **$54.1 billion**, resulting in a **trade deficit of $19.1 billion**, the highest in four months. The deficit expansion is largely due to significant rises in gold and petroleum imports, with gold imports alone more than tripling from the previous year, likely influenced by inflation.

The article suggests that while India's economy requires robust external demand for sustained growth, the persistent trade deficit could pose concerns. The increased attraction to gold as a safe-haven asset is noted, with investment inflows appearing stable and potentially increasing, which helps maintain the rupee's value. Nonetheless, the central bank's interventions to support the rupee are advised to be carefully considered, as a weaker rupee could potentially enhance export competitiveness.</description>

			<title>America’s 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs: bad policy, worse leadership</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/americas-100-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-bad-policy-worse-leadership-11715822001559.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent decision by President Joe Biden to impose a 100% tariff on electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, which marks a significant shift from the past half-century's trend of decreasing global tariffs. This move is seen as a response to political pressures and concerns over China's unfair trade practices, such as heavy subsidies to its manufacturers and security risks associated with Chinese EVs. However, the article criticizes the tariffs as a blunt instrument that could harm the American economy and the global trading system.

It reflects on the principles of free trade, as outlined by David Ricardo, emphasizing that tariffs protect inefficient firms at the expense of consumers. The article recounts the lessons learned from America's trade history with Japanese carmakers and expresses concern that current policies will lead to inefficient outcomes, such as overpriced American cars and reduced incentives for consumers to adopt greener vehicles.

The Biden administration's approach to imposing tariffs is also criticized for lacking a rigorous justification, which could have been provided through mechanisms within the rules-based trading system. The article warns that America's disregard for making a solid case for tariffs encourages protectionism both domestically and internationally, with other countries potentially following suit, thus undermining the trading system that America once advocated.

The article concludes that America's current trade policy direction, marked by increasing tariffs and protectionism, is a departure from its historical role as a champion of global trade.</description>

			<title>Wake-up call for AI makers: They should take the iPad ad’s backlash seriously</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/wakeup-call-for-ai-makers-they-should-take-the-ipad-ad-s-backlash-seriously-11715706895290.html</link>
			<description>Apple's recent iPad commercial, which depicted everyday items being crushed, sparked fear and backlash, contrasting with the company's historically iconic advertising. The ad, intended to showcase the iPad's creative potential, was perceived as a symbol of technology's destructive power. This reaction highlights a growing public anxiety about AI and technology's role in society.

The article suggests that the AI industry faces significant challenges, including privacy concerns, data ownership, environmental impact, and job displacement. It emphasizes the need for AI to complement rather than replace human roles, advocating for positioning AI as a solution to unmet needs, particularly in underserved areas.

The backlash against the iPad ad serves as a cautionary tale for the AI industry to communicate carefully and consider public sentiment. The industry is advised to focus on innovation that addresses genuine human needs and to avoid positioning AI as superior to human professionals. The article concludes by warning that if AI is perceived as a threat, resistance will only increase.  The author urges the AI industry to learn from this and adapt its approach to avoid public pushback.</description>

			<title>US Democrats are going wrong in their campaign for abortion rights</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-democrats-are-going-wrong-in-their-campaign-for-abortion-rights-11715706771913.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of the Democratic Party's stance on abortion, highlighting the shift from Bill Clinton's "safe, legal, and rare" approach to a narrative focused on privileged Caucasian women needing medical abortions. It critiques this narrow focus for stigmatizing certain women and abortions, suggesting that a more inclusive storytelling approach could destigmatize abortion and be politically beneficial.

Key points include:
- **One in four** U.S. women will have an abortion by age 40.
- The majority of women who have abortions are low-income, and **60%** are already mothers.
- African-American women account for **40%** of abortions, Hispanic women **21%**, and Caucasian women **30%**.

The article also touches on personal stories used in political ads and suggests that including a broader range of abortion stories could strengthen economic arguments for reproductive rights. It emphasizes that reproductive freedom is tied to economic freedom, especially for low-income women lacking maternity leave and daycare options.

The piece concludes by urging Democrats to adopt a "big-tent" approach to abortion politics, giving a voice to all who support reproductive choice, and forming a diverse coalition of voters. It warns that excluding certain women from the abortion conversation implies selective trust and could undermine the party's message. The article is from Bloomberg.</description>

			<title>India’s poverty debate needs to move on: Let’s adopt new norms</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-poverty-debate-needs-to-move-on-let-s-adopt-new-norms-11715704815771.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving nature of poverty in India and the need to update the poverty measurement methodologies. The National Sample Survey Office's Household Consumer Expenditure Survey sparked debate about poverty levels, with estimates ranging from 6.3% to 10% using different methodologies. Critics argue that changes in survey methods make old poverty lines based on consumption data outdated. 

The original poverty line was based on calorie intake, but recent changes in India's demographics and expenditures, especially regarding health and education, suggest that these measures are no longer adequate. The article highlights the increased life expectancy, the higher proportion of elderly people, and the rise in education enrolment, leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses for families. 

It suggests that while households may not be in extreme poverty, they still lack resources for a decent standard of living. The article concludes that India should recognize its progress in reducing poverty since the 1970s and redefine poverty norms to address the current socio-economic landscape.</description>

			<title>Chabahar port seems closer to realization than ever despite challenges</title>

			<description>The article discusses the strategic developments and challenges surrounding the Chabahar port in Iran, which India has been involved in developing. The main points include:

- **India's Investment Acceleration**: After 21 years since Iran offered India the chance to develop Chabahar port, recent developments suggest an acceleration of investments.
  
- **Contract Signing**: A long-term contract for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal in Chabahar was signed between India Port Global Ltd and Iran's Ports and Maritime Organization.

- **Geo-Political Pressure**: The India-Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEC) involvement by India put pressure on Iran to decide on Chabahar's fate, as IMEC could isolate Iran from key trade routes.

- **Strategic Significance**: Chabahar's development is crucial for India's geo-strategic interests in the Indian Ocean, offering an alternative route to the Suez Canal and facilitating trade with Russia and Central Asia.

- **US Sanctions and Waivers**: US sanctions pose a challenge to the port's expansion, although a 2018 policy exempted India for Chabahar's development. The US warns that the long-term India-Iran deal must contend with the sanctions regime.

- **Economic Potential and Challenges**: The port offers economic potential with alternative freight routes, but its viability is challenged by low trade volumes between India and Central Asia.

- **Geo-Strategic Interests**: India's commitment to Chabahar is seen as a test case for understanding and promoting its geo-strategic interests, with naval coordination to protect vessels in the Indian Ocean.

The article emphasizes the importance of Chabahar for India's strategic objectives and the complexities of investing in the port due to geopolitical tensions and economic considerations.</description>

			<title>India’s labour-intensive manufacturing slump is no small worry</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-labour-intensive-manufacturing-slump-is-no-small-worry-11715703554738.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of 'premature de-industrialization' in India, a term coined by economist Dani Rodrik. Despite new incentive schemes, India's manufacturing sector has not grown significantly as a share of GDP. Recent data indicates a rapid de-industrialization in labor-intensive sectors, with a decline in global market share for products like apparel and jewelry. Exports in these sectors grew only 1-2%, and some categories saw a 9% decline in 2023-24.

The decline is attributed to various factors, including small firms' struggles with India's GST regime and global trade slowdowns. Countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh are preferred by buyers due to their free trade agreements. India's garment exports have grown only 4.6% from 2013 to 2023, compared to 69.6% for Bangladesh and 81.6% for Vietnam.

While India's service exports have seen growth, from $167 billion in 2013-14 to $340 billion in 2023-24, there are concerns that policies like data localization might hinder further growth. The article also highlights the K-shaped economic recovery in India, with disparities in human development indicators compared to neighbors like Bangladesh and Nepal.

The author points out the contrast in sanitation and education between India and its neighbors, noting the impact on women and children's health and life expectancy. The article concludes by reflecting on the different realities experienced by a garment worker in Bangladesh compared to the macroeconomic view of India's foreign reserves. The article suggests that while India's economic indicators may look strong, the on-the-ground experience for many is quite different.</description>

			<title>Why stock markets are jittery and what could happen next</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/why-stock-markets-are-jittery-and-what-could-happen-next-11715750118574.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the Indian elections on the market, with a focus on the potential outcomes of the BJP's performance and its implications for investors. It highlights India's strong economic fundamentals, suggesting that regardless of political outcomes, the country is poised for solid growth due to its land, labor, capital, and improving policy framework. The article also notes that while the Indian stock market has risen sharply, it is not in a bubble, as evidenced by the BSE Sensex's historical price-to-earnings ratio.

The author outlines possible scenarios post-election: a BJP win with over 400 seats would be a positive surprise, a win without 400 seats is expected, and a loss would be a shock but likely absorbed by the market quickly. The article also mentions the strong US economy as a factor causing market volatility, leading to significant net sales by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in India.

Despite short-term uncertainties due to the elections and US interest rates, the author advises long-term investors to view any dips as investment opportunities and to maintain a sensible asset allocation plan for wealth creation. The article concludes with a reminder to consult personal investment advisors before making decisions. The author is identified as Rahul Goel, former CEO of Equitymaster.</description>

			<title>How safe is safe enough? Heed RBI on cyber security and risk reduction.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/how-safe-is-safe-enough-heed-rbi-on-cyber-security-and-risk-reduction-11715701822190.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses a series of technology-related incidents and regulatory actions within the Indian banking sector. It begins with the disappearance of data from UniSuper, an Australian retirement fund, stored on Google Cloud, drawing parallels to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) supervisory action against Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (KMB) for technological inadequacies. The RBI's actions are compared to similar measures taken against other banks, highlighting the significant costs of digital banking but also its failure to acknowledge the benefits of reduced transaction costs and financial inclusion.

The RBI's directive to KMB to halt new customer onboarding and credit card issuance is due to uncovered deficiencies in various IT management areas. The article mentions frequent service outages at KMB, including a recent disruption, and the lack of communication about these outages on KMB's social media.

The piece recalls significant IT-related incidents at other Indian banks, such as a massive IMPS fraud at UCO Bank and international fund transfer hacks through the SWIFT system, which affected several Indian banks. These events underscore the importance of cyber security and resilience in the banking sector.

The RBI has been proactive in addressing cyber risks, establishing regulations, and auditing banks' IT systems. The article also references the International Monetary Fund's financial stability report, which emphasizes the increased cyber attacks since the pandemic and the need for strengthened cyber resilience.

In conclusion, the author supports RBI's stringent regulatory measures, viewing them as a path towards improved IT capabilities and safer banking. The article ends by stressing the importance of risk management in banking and the responsibility of bank boards and managers to be well-informed and execute effectively.</description>

			<title>ICICI Securities case: Is shareholder activism maturing in India?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/icici-securities-case-is-shareholder-activism-maturing-in-india-11715697240898.html</link>
			<description>The National Company Law Tribunal has postponed a class-action lawsuit by some ICICI Securities (I-Sec) shareholders who are contesting the company's decision to delist and merge with ICICI Bank. This plan, approved on March 28, offered investors a share-swap ratio of 67 ICICI Bank shares for every 100 I-Sec shares. Minority shareholders argue that this ratio undervalues I-Sec compared to its listing price six years ago. Despite ICICI Bank's claim that the merger is beneficial and valuations are fair, dissenters feel shortchanged.

The majority of I-Sec's shareholders have voted in favor of the merger, but concerns have been raised about the voting process, including allegations that ICICI Bank solicited votes from retail shareholders through calls. Questions have been raised about potential privacy breaches and the use of personal data. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has strict rules against misleading information and coercion in such corporate decisions.

Allegations also suggest that ICICI Bank may have influenced the vote through its asset-management unit and by offering stock options to I-Sec employee shareholders. Quantum Mutual Fund, an I-Sec shareholder, has raised concerns with Sebi about the valuation, claiming a loss for minority shareholders.

A Sebi investigation is underway, and the tribunal's decision is pending. The case highlights the growing shareholder activism in India, which is seen as a positive development for the economy and shareholder democracy. The outcome will reflect the importance of considering the voices of all investors, including retail shareholders.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Does India’s Chabahar deal risk US sanctions?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-does-india-s-chabahar-deal-risk-us-sanctions-11715698391747.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the progress of the **Chabahar port project** in Iran, where India has signed a deal to operate the port for a decade. The US State Department has indicated that entities engaging with Iran may face sanctions, but historically, the Chabahar project received a US waiver in 2018 due to its trade benefits for Afghanistan. The port provides India with strategic access to Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. The article suggests that if the US aims to support Indian trade interests against China's regional influence, which includes the rival port of Gwadar in Pakistan, it should not penalize India for using Chabahar as a new Asia-Europe trade link, implying that this would serve the interests of the free world.</description>

			<title>Board diversity can catalyse business success</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/board-diversity-can-catalyse-business-success-11715621735081.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significant impact of board diversity on enterprise performance, emphasizing the importance of having a mix of genders, castes, ages, and professional expertise in company leadership. It highlights the board's role in corporate governance and the positive correlation between gender diversity and financial performance metrics like return on assets and equity. The article notes that while the Global 500 has seen an increase in women CEOs, the percentage remains low compared to the Fortune 500.

Research indicates that companies with more women on their boards experience better business success, with many Fortune 500 companies having over 40% non-male directors. Benefits of board diversity extend beyond finances, contributing to improved decision-making, risk management, corporate governance, and reputation. A Credit Suisse study found higher average RoE and RoA in businesses with gender-diverse boards, suggesting diverse boards are more effective in various aspects of business operations.

The article also addresses the challenges faced by women in achieving board positions in India, such as systemic biases, work-life balance issues, self-promotion difficulties, unclear promotion criteria, and workplace hostility. It calls for eliminating biases against women and shifting from male-dominated management mindsets to realize the full potential of gender diversity in business. Despite some Indian companies exceeding regulatory requirements for female board members, there is still a notable lack of women directors in many firms listed on the National Stock Exchange. The article concludes that gender diversity will thrive once biases are removed, allowing for fair opportunities and a shift in management perspectives.</description>

			<title>Beware: Artificial intelligence can hurt democracy in subtle ways too</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/beware-artificial-intelligence-can-hurt-democracy-in-subtle-ways-too-11715621657275.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the underestimated impact of AI on elections. Despite initial concerns, AI has not caused visible disruptions in recent polls in Indonesia and Pakistan. However, experts warn that AI's influence may be subtle and hard to detect, unlike previous blatant disinformation campaigns. AI can generate varied messages that are difficult to trace, making it a potent tool for spreading disinformation. Meta's WhatsApp, with its Channels feature, could be exploited to broadcast AI-generated texts to influence voters. The widespread use of AI tools by ordinary people for creating content, including disinformation, is also a concern. Meta is attempting to mitigate these risks by labeling AI-generated content and could further strengthen its policies on WhatsApp to prevent election interference. The article suggests that the effects of AI are nuanced and widespread, urging tech companies and officials to remain vigilant against AI's potential to subtly influence elections. The piece concludes that the lack of obvious 'mass impact' does not mean AI is not affecting elections; rather, its effects are more dispersed and challenging to identify.</description>

			<title>China’s clean-tech subsidies are good for the planet we inhabit</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinas-clean-tech-subsidies-are-good-for-the-planet-we-inhabit-11715621588145.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the emerging trade tensions over clean technologies between major global economies. The US and EU are concerned about Chinese subsidies to its green industries, fearing they threaten their own industries and may respond with import restrictions. China has countered by filing a complaint with the WTO, citing discriminatory provisions in the US's Inflation Reduction Act.

US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, on a visit to China, expressed the US's stance against China's significant government support for industries like solar power, EVs, and batteries, emphasizing that the US will protect its green industries from suffering as the steel industry did due to Chinese subsidies.

China's rapid expansion in green industries has led it to produce a majority of the world's solar PV modules, wind turbines, and EVs and batteries. This growth is attributed to various government policies, which have allowed Chinese firms to dominate the market.

The article argues that green technologies are essential in combating climate change and should be considered a global public good. It suggests that subsidizing green industries, as China has done, is justified due to the positive externalities and the need to accelerate the green transition to combat climate change.

It also presents the view that green industrial policies serve a dual purpose: fostering technological advancement and acting as a substitute for carbon pricing. The article criticizes Western fears of "subsidy wars" and "excess capacity," stating that an abundance of renewables and green products is what is needed for the climate.

China's green policies have significantly reduced the costs of renewable energy, fostering optimism that global warming can be kept within reasonable limits. The US's Inflation Reduction Act is seen as a similar policy, providing subsidies for the transition to green industries, despite some domestic favoritism.

The article concludes that while countries may have legitimate concerns about the impact of others' green policies on their economies, they should not view these policies as violations of norms. Historical trade arrangements are cited as examples of how countries have managed import surges without harming the global economy. The overarching message is that subsidizing green industries is morally, environmentally, and economically favorable. ©2024/project syndicate</description>

			<title>How India can spice up global palette, in a better way</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/how-india-can-spice-up-global-palette-in-a-better-way-11715670627560.html</link>
			<description>India, the world's largest producer of spices, is facing a regulatory challenge as Hong Kong has suspended the sale of spice blends from two major Indian brands, MDH and Everest, due to high levels of the pesticide ethylene oxide. This incident highlights the complex regulatory environment for spice exports from India, which has multiple standards and testing boards. In FY23, India exported $3.73 billion worth of spices, with turmeric, chilli, garlic, and cumin seeds making up 75% of the total.

The establishment of the National Turmeric Board in 2023 aims to streamline the regulatory process, but it also adds to the complexity, as there are already two bodies regulating turmeric. The differing pesticide levels prescribed by these bodies, necessary due to the humid climate and pest control, complicate traceability and accountability.

The article suggests that the solution lies in integrating the numerous laboratory networks, improving standards, and addressing the potential financial impact on farmers due to stricter quality controls. This could lead to higher prices for spices, but it is essential for meeting the growing global demand and ensuring the quality of Indian spice exports. The case of India and Bhutan's dispute over chilli exports further underscores the need for consistent and high-quality standards. The goal is to enhance India's spice export potential while ensuring safety and quality for consumers worldwide.</description>

			<title>Too many cooks? Indian spice products hurt by too many, not too few, standards</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/how-india-can-spice-up-global-palate-in-a-better-way-11715670627560.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by India, the world's largest producer of spices, in maintaining quality standards for exports. Hong Kong has suspended sales of spice blends from two major Indian brands due to high levels of ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing pesticide. The issue is attributed not to a lack of checks but to the existence of too many conflicting standards and regulatory bodies. For instance, the National Turmeric Board was established to streamline turmeric exports, but it adds to the complexity with the Spices Board and APEDA already in place, each prescribing different pesticide levels. This multiplicity makes traceability difficult and hinders establishing which standards may have been exceeded.

The article suggests that the solution lies in integrating the numerous laboratory networks, improving them, and addressing potential losses for farmers due to high rejection rates. This could lead to higher prices for spices, but it is necessary to ensure quality and meet the rising global demand post-COVID. The article also references a past dispute between India and Bhutan over chili exports, highlighting the need for standardized regulations that align with international standards. The overarching message is that too many standards can be detrimental to the quality and reputation of Indian spice products on the global market. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for India and the world to "spice up their plate" with better-regulated spice products.</description>

			<title>Curb deepfake velocity, vulnerability and viciousness</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/curb-deepfake-velocity-vulnerability-and-viciousness-11715621492557.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges posed by deepfakes, particularly in the context of India. It highlights the erosion of trust due to the rapid spread of deepfakes, facilitated by social media and the human tendency to believe visual content. The article points out the psychological harm to women and children, the legal challenges in cases like Anil Kapoor vs Simply Life India, and the threats to user-verification methods and democratic processes.

The lack of specific laws in India to combat deepfakes is noted, with existing IT Act sections being insufficient. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act is mentioned, suggesting it could be more effective with amendments. The ongoing case between WhatsApp and the Indian government illustrates the complexities of traceability and privacy.

The article suggests that regulation is necessary to maintain trust in technology. It recommends holding social media platforms accountable, mandating tech developers to label artificial content, and establishing clear legal recourse for victims of deepfakes. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive legislation, media literacy, and responsible digital citizenship to counter the negative impacts of deepfakes. The author calls for collaboration among tech developers, platforms, civil society organizations, and the government to reaffirm trust in the digital sphere. These views are presented as the author's personal opinions.</description>

			<title>We should mobilize resources to reduce road fatalities in India</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-should-mobilize-resources-to-reduce-road-fatalities-in-india-11715621419883.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the disparity in India's response to the Himalayan tunnel rescue operation and the ongoing road fatality crisis. Despite the successful rescue operation showcasing India's commitment to saving lives, road fatalities continue to rise, with 168,000 deaths in 2022, a significant increase from the previous year. The article highlights that India accounts for a disproportionate number of global road fatalities, considering it has only 1% of the world's vehicles. It criticizes the misconception that bad roads cause accidents, noting that improved roads can lead to higher speeds and recklessness.

The government's efforts, including harsh penalties and the establishment of a road safety committee, have not sufficiently addressed the issue. The article suggests that India should adopt emergency medical services similar to those in the US, where helicopters with trained paramedics respond to accidents, significantly improving survival rates. It calls for systemic, coordinated emergency services across India, funded through innovative insurance products and welfare schemes. The article concludes by urging the government to allocate funds in the upcoming Union budget to address the high cost of road fatalities, emphasizing it as a national imperative.</description>

			<title>Defence rejig: India must move faster on theatre-focused armed forces</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/defence-rejig-india-must-move-faster-on-theatre-focused-armed-forces-11715611513678.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's strategic shift towards integrated theatre commands (ITCs) for its defense forces. It highlights the need for efficiency and better preparedness for potential warfronts by aligning the armed forces to focus on specific theatres of war—western, northern, or maritime. The slow progress in this direction is noted, despite the appointment of the first chief of defence staff (CDS) nearly five years ago to oversee the transition to ITCs.

The proposed plan includes the appointment of a vice-CDS for strategic planning, capability development, and procurement, and a deputy CDS for operations, intelligence, and asset allocations. The chain of command is crucial for the effectiveness of this new joint format, which will see forces assigned to specific theatres under designated command headquarters in Jaipur, Lucknow, and Coimbatore.

While the existing service chiefs will continue to lead their respective forces, combat operations will be directed by officers with a comprehensive strategic view of their theatre. The article emphasizes the importance of careful implementation to avoid vulnerabilities and the need to keep pace with global military command debates and evolving doctrines. It also touches on the challenges and ethical considerations of tech-enabled warfare, particularly the use of AI and autonomous weapons, calling for consensus on the tolerance of AI-led strike inaccuracies and the aim for precision in firepower use.</description>

			<title>The China challenge: Fix India’s lopsided bilateral trade</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/the-china-challenge-fix-india-s-lopsided-bilateral-trade-11715612637283.html</link>
			<description>In fiscal year 2023-24, **China regained its position as India's largest trading partner**, with bilateral trade reaching **$118.4 billion**. This figure includes **$101.7 billion** in imports to India, marking a **3.2% increase**, and **$16.7 billion** in exports from India, which is an **8.7% increase**. The significant trade imbalance highlights India's dependence on Chinese imports despite efforts to reduce it.

While **production-linked incentives** have boosted domestic manufacturing in certain sectors, significantly reducing reliance on Chinese products would require a massive scale-up of India's manufacturing capabilities. Given the cost-effectiveness of Chinese production, complete economic decoupling seems unlikely. Advocates for free trade suggest that importing from China can be beneficial when it concerns goods that China produces more efficiently.

However, there is a need to **increase Indian exports to China** to balance the heavily skewed trade. Although India's economy requires only a general external balance, the current geopolitical climate has raised concerns about supply chain risks among various nations. Thus, reducing dependency on China could be a wise move in light of these risks.</description>

			<title>Clickbait clutter: AI is generating too much digital junk</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/clickbait-clutter-ai-is-generating-too-much-digital-junk-11715535171898.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on internet content. It highlights the shift from human-created content to AI-generated material, which has led to an increase in quantity but a decrease in quality. The internet is becoming saturated with "digital junk," such as clickbait and misleading videos, which prioritize engagement over substance. This trend is eroding consumer trust and raising ethical concerns, as AI lacks human moral judgment and can be used to spread falsehoods. However, GenAI also has the potential to improve content quality by assisting creators with research and ideas. The article suggests that platform operators should develop algorithms that reward quality content and that regulatory frameworks need to evolve to ensure responsible use of content creation tools. The current trajectory of GenAI points towards a future filled with low-quality content, and the article calls for government intervention to prevent this.</description>

			<title>How to set right your SIP portfolio</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/how-to-set-right-your-sip-portfolio-11715582602397.html</link>
			<description>The article from Contramoney focuses on optimizing Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) as a means to build long-term wealth, emphasizing the importance of asset allocation. The key points include:

- **Simplifying Mutual Fund Investments**: Investors should consolidate their SIPs into one or two well-chosen equity fund schemes, avoiding the complexity of multiple schemes which dilute returns to market averages.

- **Resisting New Additions**: The temptation to continually add new mutual fund schemes should be resisted. Instead, focus on the selected schemes which are likely being managed to capitalize on new opportunities.

- **Market Sell-Offs**: Investors should take advantage of market sell-offs, which may require a more hands-on approach than what monthly SIPs offer.

- **Fund Selection**: It's crucial to stay invested in the right funds over time, considering the potential of the funds to meet their objectives, even during periods of underperformance.

- **Long-Term Strategy**: While SIPs are an effective way to invest savings into the market, the ultimate goal should be proper asset allocation for long-term wealth creation.

The article concludes with a reminder to consult a personal investment advisor for tailored advice and mentions the need for international exposure in investments. It's authored by Rahul Goel, former CEO of Equitymaster. Remember, this summary is for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial advice.</description>

			<title>Howard Schultz should give Starbucks' CEO the time and space he needs to deliver</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/howard-schultz-should-give-starbucks-ceo-the-time-and-space-he-needs-to-deliver-11715534976275.html</link>
			<description>Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, criticized his successor on LinkedIn for the company's poor quarterly performance, suggesting the need for contrition and accountability without excuses. The quarter saw a significant drop in sales and earnings, leading to a 16% share price fall post-earnings report. Schultz's public critique is part of a pattern of interference that may have hindered the search for a strong leader after him. He left the CEO position over a year ago and the board only in September, making it unlikely for the decline to have occurred so rapidly under the new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan.

Schultz's own actions, such as setting high expectations and introducing an aggressive growth plan shortly before Narasimhan took over, have contributed to the company's challenges. Narasimhan, previously CEO of Reckitt, was brought on as 'incoming CEO' to work with Schultz before fully assuming the role, which may indicate he wasn't the board's first choice.

The article suggests that Schultz's history of returning to the CEO role and undermining successors has made the position less attractive and could be a factor in the company's struggle to find strong leadership. It concludes that if Narasimhan is ousted, Schultz should refrain from public commentary to allow for a capable replacement to turn the company around.</description>

			<title>India should raise minimum wages or adopt a living wage approach</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/india-should-raise-minimum-wages-or-adopt-a-living-wage-approach-11715534891904.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's plan to replace the minimum wage with a living wage by 2025, guided by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The current National Floor Level Minimum Wage (NFLMW) is ₹176 per day, which is low compared to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The article suggests that India's minimum wage should be aligned with the cost of living and inflation, considering expenses such as food, transport, housing, education, and healthcare.

It highlights the discrepancies in minimum wages across Indian states and the inadequacy of current wages to maintain a decent standard of living, especially with inflation rates of 5-6%. The low female workforce participation and the impact of minimum wages on the majority of India's workforce, particularly single-earner households, are also discussed.

The article argues for the social and economic benefits of increasing the minimum wage or transitioning to a living-wage policy, which could alleviate poverty, reduce inequality, improve living standards, and stimulate the economy. However, concerns about the potential negative impact on hiring, especially for smaller enterprises, are also mentioned.

Studies from Indonesia and South Africa are cited to show varied impacts of wage hikes on employment. The article emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of wage regulations and government support for smaller businesses during the transition. It also suggests reducing salary deductions for social-security benefits and adjusting the minimum or living wage to inflation every two years to support formal employment and economic growth. The article concludes by advocating for a scientifically established living wage and its strict implementation.</description>

			<title>Why has official Indian data on informal enterprises been kept under wraps?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/why-has-official-indian-data-on-informal-enterprises-been-kept-under-wraps-11715534794207.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing debate among economists and statisticians regarding India's economic growth figures. The main issues are the use of a new, untested corporate database (MCA-21), the method of adjusting nominal growth rates for inflation to calculate real growth rates, and the assumptions made to estimate growth in the informal sector. Bibek Debroy acknowledges the challenges posed by MCA-21 compared to the older ASI database. Former chief statistician Pronab Sen suggests that the old GDP series may have been more accurate and that recent figures likely overestimate growth due to the way informal sector growth is accounted for. In contrast, another former chief statistician, TCA Anant, believes that informal sector growth may be underestimated, citing wage data from the PLFS.

However, two ex-officials of the statistics ministry argue that once adjusted for inflation, wage data indicates stagnation, not buoyancy. The article also highlights the lack of an annual survey of informal firms in India until recently, with estimates relying on proxies or past trends. Mospi initiated the Annual Survey on Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) in 2019, but data from its rounds have not been released, raising concerns about transparency and the utility of such surveys. The release of ASUSE data could provide crucial insights into the informal sector's performance post-pandemic and inform the next GDP base-year revision. The article concludes by expressing hope that future releases of ASUSE data will better reflect the dynamism of India's economy.</description>

			<title>Rethink the marshmallow test and earn trust to win employee commitment</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/rethink-the-marshmallow-test-and-earn-trust-to-win-employee-commitment-11715534068043.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the famous **marshmallow test** by Stanford professor Walter Mischel and its implications on the understanding of success and self-control. Initially, the test was seen as a measure of the ability to delay gratification, with children who waited for a second marshmallow seemingly destined for greater success in life. This concept was adopted in corporate environments, where deferred gratification was valued.

However, the article critiques this simplistic view, highlighting that it ignores socioeconomic and psychological factors that affect decision-making. It points out that children from unstable backgrounds may not trust that rewards will be delivered, making their choice for immediate gratification a rational response to their lived experiences. Trust, shaped by consistent experiences, plays a crucial role in the ability to delay gratification.

The article extends these findings to the workplace, suggesting that employees' preferences for immediate rewards over promised long-term benefits reflect their trust in their employer. It argues that organizations should focus on building a culture of trust, as employees' lived experiences with broken promises can influence their perceptions and behaviors.

In conclusion, the article suggests that leaders should ensure their work environments are consistent and reliable to make promises credible, as the preference for immediate rewards over future ones is a reflection of the organization's trust index. The marshmallow test, therefore, is not just about self-discipline but also about the importance of trust in shaping behavior and success.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bulls-and-bears-stock-market-shudders-are-not-hard-to-understand-11715502554848.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the unexpected downturn in the Indian stock market on 9 May, where the S&amp;P BSE Sensex lost 1,062 points and the NSE Nifty dropped by 370 points. This decline was surprising against the backdrop of strong economic growth narratives and policy stability. Analysts suggest two main reasons for the market's volatility: concerns about the impact of election results on policy and lackluster corporate earnings indicating stagnation in consumer markets and reduced pricing power among leading companies.

The article also highlights the low voter turnout in the initial phases of India's general elections as a potential cause for market nervousness, which may have led to impulsive equity selling. The analysis of 378 company results showed only a modest increase in profits compared to revenue growth, adding to the bearish sentiment.

Furthermore, the article notes the record-high inflows into systematic investment plans (SIPs) in mutual funds, contrasting with a decrease in net household financial savings and an increase in borrowings and physical asset investments. This discrepancy, along with political uncertainty and corporate performance, is expected to influence market behavior and investment decisions in the lead-up to the final election results on 4 June. The article suggests that these factors, combined with the anticipation of remaining corporate results, could contribute to continued market volatility.</description>

			<title>A solar storm and our exposure to the Sun</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/a-solar-storm-and-our-exposure-to-the-sun-11715502819049.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses a remarkable display of the **northern lights** seen across the northern hemisphere, an event not witnessed for nearly two decades. This was caused by a significant increase in solar activity, specifically a solar storm that resulted in geomagnetic effects on Earth. The phenomenon was not related to climate change or human activities.

It further explains that the **aurora borealis** was intensified by clouds of ionized gas and magnetic fields emanating from sunspots. The article reflects on the Sun's age, approximately **4.6 billion years**, and its expected lifespan of another 5 billion years, contrasting it with the Earth's future, which is uncertain due to human-induced global warming. The piece concludes with a call to action for humanity to address the challenges of global warming, emphasizing the difference between merely surviving and thriving. It notes that while the Sun remains stable, the same cannot be said for our planet's future.</description>

			<title>Election results are not tethered to voter turnout</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/election-results-are-not-tethered-to-voter-turnout-11715518567628.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the low voter turnout in the recent general elections in India, particularly in the Hindi heartland states and Maharashtra. It highlights Noida's low participation rate of 53.63% despite high literacy and self-reliance among women. The article suggests that excessive heat is not the sole reason for low turnout, as vote percentage has increased in previous elections. It questions whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal has waned, despite surveys showing him as the top choice for 52% of people. The article also notes lower turnout in Kerala, where the BJP is not a primary contender.

The piece explores possible reasons for voter apathy, including party members' carelessness, caste factors, coalition dynamics, and external leadership preferences affecting party morale. It mentions the opposition's failure to form alliances and defections to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Rahul Gandhi's efforts are described as insufficient to generate enthusiasm for the Congress party.

The article addresses leadership issues, citing allegations against H. D. Revanna and Prajwal Revanna in a sex scandal, and the impact of politicians' misconduct and language on public trust. It concludes by questioning whether low turnout indicates a shift in voter trust, noting that turnout does not necessarily predict election outcomes, as seen in historical examples.

The author, Shashi Shekhar, editor-in-chief of Hindustan, expresses personal views and emphasizes the need for political parties to address these concerns seriously. The article also touches on the silence around climate issues in the election. The repeated content and advertisements have been omitted from this summary.

			<title>Rethink prompt: Why did the Iran-Israel conflict barely shake oil prices?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/rethink-prompt-why-did-the-iran-israel-conflict-barely-shake-oil-prices-11715498855876.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of geopolitical events on oil prices, focusing on the recent Iran-Israel conflict. Contrary to expectations of a price spike, oil prices actually fell to a three-month low. This unexpected trend is attributed to the diversification of oil supply chains by the world's major oil consumers, making them less vulnerable to such shocks compared to the past.

**The United States**, as the largest oil consumer, has significantly reduced its reliance on OPEC oil, with imports from the organization dropping from 29% in 1973 to 11% today. The U.S. has achieved energy security through advances in fracking technology and strategic alliances with non-OPEC producers.

**China**, the second-largest consumer, is upgrading its refining capacities and building strategic reserves to diversify its oil shipments. The Russia-Ukraine war has also led to a stronger oil supply nexus between China and Russia, with China emerging as the fifth-largest oil producer.

**India**, the third-largest oil consumer, has been importing discounted Russian oil, which has remained free of geopolitical threats. India's refining capabilities and neutrality provide it with an advantage in the global oil market.

Overall, the article suggests that the top three oil-consuming markets are unlikely to be disrupted by West Asian conflicts unless dramatic changes occur. It calls for a broad rethink of oil price movements and emphasizes the importance of monitoring global changes that affect commodity prices and inflation.</description>

			<title>'Crush!': Apple’s iPad ad triggered our darkest fears of an AI takeover</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/crush-apple-s-ipad-ad-triggered-our-darkest-fears-of-an-ai-takeover-11715498460219.html</link>
			<description>Apple's recent iPad advertisement, titled "Crush!", has sparked significant backlash due to its depiction of creative tools being destroyed by a crushing machine. The ad intended to show that the iPad could replicate these tools, but it was perceived as a grim visual metaphor for AI's impact on human creativity. This has been Apple's most controversial marketing move since the U2 incident, reflecting a broader public skepticism towards technology's potential harms and the growing power of tech giants.

The company's advertising history, once celebrated for its optimism and individualism, has now faced criticism for becoming mundane. The latest ad campaign, meant to rejuvenate the iPad's image amidst declining sales, inadvertently highlighted fears about AI, such as those following the ChatGPT breakthrough in 2022. Concerns about AI's effect on music and the arts, including originality and job security for human artists, have been rising.

Apple, investing heavily in AI, is preparing to showcase its advancements at its upcoming developers' conference, amidst legal challenges faced by AI creators for using others' work to train AI. The article suggests that Apple needs to demonstrate a better understanding of creative professionals to regain their trust after this advertising misstep.</description>

			<title>India’s inclusive innovation can shape the world’s digital future</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-inclusive-innovation-can-shape-the-world-s-digital-future-11715498199324.html</link>
			<description>India is undergoing a significant transformation, marked by strong demand, resilient supply chains, relentless innovation, and rapid digitization. This has led to a global optimism about India's role in strategic partnerships and alliances. Predictions by Goldman Sachs and EY suggest that India could become the world's second-largest economy by 2075, with a GDP of $52.5 trillion, and grow sixfold to $26 trillion by 2047, respectively.

The transformation is not just in numbers but also in the qualitative and inclusive digital change affecting the social, economic, and cultural aspects of the country. With a massive internet user base, a thriving startup ecosystem, and a substantial technology industry, India is becoming a young, vibrant, and tech-savvy digital economy.

India's innovation strategy differs from the West, focusing on bottom-up solutions that address the complexities of its diverse and populous nation. The country has built the world's largest Digital Public Good (DPI) infrastructure, which serves as a model for inclusive technology development, especially in the age of AI.

The India AI Mission reflects these principles, emphasizing the democratization of AI and the development of local capacities. The true measure of India's technological strength lies in its ability to harness technology to meet the needs of its diverse population and drive innovation to solve last-mile challenges.

As AI becomes more integrated into society, India's focus will be on solving significant problems with AI and prioritizing governance and security. India's experience with DPI and technology deployment for inclusive growth positions it to influence global AI strategies that emphasize inclusion and public impact.

Looking ahead, India aims to be a tech superpower and a beacon of hope for technology resilience, innovation, and determination, shaping AI roadmaps that tackle global challenges like climate change and healthcare. India's approach to technology is not about the technology itself but about the impact it can create at scale. This lesson is crucial for the world as it moves towards harnessing AI's capabilities.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: The fabled charms of heritage red-light areas are bogus</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-the-fabled-charms-of-heritage-red-light-areas-are-bogus-11715497863557.html</link>
			<description>The article recounts the author's visit to Heera Mandi, the historical red-light district of Lahore, during a trip to Pakistan in 2004. The author reflects on the changes in Heera Mandi, noting its gentrification and the lingering presence of its past. Despite being a place of historical significance, the author finds that much of its storied past seems to have faded, replaced by modernity and a lack of connection to its heritage.

The author describes the bustling life in Heera Mandi, with its narrow lanes, music, and old houses where people watch Indian cable TV. The author's experience in a room with musicians and a dancing woman leads to musings on cultural practices and the authenticity of the performances. The article also touches on the locals' claims of descent from historical visitors to Heera Mandi and the author's skepticism about these assertions.

Overall, the author suggests that the romanticized past of places like Heera Mandi may be overrated, with the present reality falling short of historical narratives. The piece concludes with a critique of the tendency to idealize the past, as exemplified by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's works, and the irony of people's fascination with the history of red-light districts while disdaining their contemporary counterparts. The author implies that this fascination is more about borrowing "safe notoriety" than a genuine appreciation of the district's history.</description>

			<title>Stock market indices say little about economic growth</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/stock-market-indices-say-little-about-economic-growth-11715497445480.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the relationship between stock market indices like the S&amp;P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty, and the overall economy. It challenges the common assumption that a rising stock index is indicative of a healthy economy. The Nifty, which includes 50 companies, and even broader indices, do not represent the entire economy's commerce. The 'efficient markets hypothesis' suggests that stock prices reflect all economic information, but the article presents data showing mixed correlations between GDP growth, the Nifty, and net profits of Nifty companies. For instance, in 2015-16, despite a strong economy, the Nifty fell by 9%, while in 2020-21, during the pandemic-induced GDP contraction, the Nifty saw its highest increase in a decade.

The article highlights that while there is a strong correlation between the Nifty and the net profits of its constituent companies, suggesting that stock prices reflect company health, this does not extend to the economy's growth prospects. It advises caution in interpreting stock index movements as indicators of economic performance, noting that such movements often revert to mean levels after responding to news. The author concludes that while market indices can provide insight into the health of listed companies, their role in projecting the economy's course is often overstated by analysts and the media. The views expressed are the author's own.</description>

			<title>Vande Bharat Metro: Will these trains get their routes right?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/vande-bharat-metro-will-these-trains-get-their-routes-right-11715333596241.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the introduction of **Vande Bharat Metro trains** in India, which are expected to significantly reduce travel time between major cities and nearby towns. These trains, operating on dedicated standard gauge tracks, can reach speeds of up to **180km/h** with an average speed of **90km/h**, making them a promising option for quick and safe travel. However, the Indian Railways faces challenges in terms of infrastructure readiness and congestion on tracks, which affects the operation of high-speed trains.

The Vande Bharat Metro, capable of faster acceleration and deceleration, could potentially reduce travel time on routes like Chennai to Tirupati from **3 hours and 35 minutes** to less than **2 hours**. Each train can accommodate **100 seated passengers** and **200 standees**, catering well to second-class passengers' distance requirements.

A significant concern is the fare structure, as the average fare for second-class travel is much lower than the cost of operating Vande Bharat trains. This poses a legacy issue, with passengers accustomed to low fares for existing services. The manufacturing cost of a Vande Bharat Metro coach is about **₹8 crore**, which is substantially higher than that of other train types.

The article suggests that Indian Railways should conduct systematic demand forecasts for various Origin-Destination pairs to ensure optimal patronage and revenue outcomes before introducing these premium services. The author, a railway expert, emphasizes the importance of strategic planning in the deployment of Vande Bharat Metro services to avoid the low occupancy issues faced by some Vande Bharat trains and to improve the financial viability of the new service.</description>

			<title>PM Surya Ghar scheme: Balance consumer equity with discom stability</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/pm-surya-ghar-scheme-balance-consumer-equity-with-discom-stability-11715333432427.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the **Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana (Surya Ghar Yojana)**, a scheme launched by India to generate **40 gigawatts (GW) of rooftop solar energy** by 2026-27, offering up to **300 units of free electricity** monthly to one crore households. It examines the scheme's viability for beneficiaries and distribution companies (discoms), considering the current **11 GW** of rooftop solar installations.

The scheme provides an increased capital subsidy for smaller capacities, aiming to address energy equity and boost household incomes. However, challenges such as limited rooftop space and existing subsidies may deter the intended beneficiaries. The article highlights disparities in the payback period for consumers based on their rooftop solar size and electricity consumption, with wealthier consumers seeing a quicker return on investment.

For discoms, the adoption of rooftop solar has financial implications due to progressive consumer tariffs and the current metering and billing system. The article also addresses the issue of energy accounting and the impact of rooftop solar on discom revenues and fixed cost recovery.

In conclusion, the success of the Surya Ghar Yojana depends on factors like price signalling, grid management, and curtailment policies. The authors suggest that neglecting these aspects could hinder the initiative's management and scaling, emphasizing the need for a balance between consumer financial equity and discom financial stability. The views expressed are personal opinions of the authors from the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP).</description>

			<title>Climate catastrophe: Bleached coral should rattle the world into action</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/climate-catastrophe-bleached-coral-should-rattle-the-world-into-action-11715267419350.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe coral bleaching in the Lakshadweep islands, attributed to marine heatwaves since October 2023. This is the fourth and most severe instance of coral bleaching recorded, signaling a significant threat to marine life and the natural beauty of the islands. The bleaching occurs when excessive heat disrupts the symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and algae, leading to the corals turning skeletal and white. While coral reefs can recover from bleaching under favorable conditions, the rising temperatures suggest an increased risk of large-scale damage. The article compares this situation to the Great Barrier Reef, which has experienced similar events, and emphasizes the urgent need for global action on climate change to prevent further ecological disasters. It highlights humanity's role in this crisis and the failure to reduce carbon emissions as pledged, with a call for more immediate and effective measures.</description>

			<title>Movies on a leash: Pre-poll censorship?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/movies-on-a-leash-pre-poll-censorship-11715268828178.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent trend of politically charged films in India, drawing from real events and offering significant commentary. It highlights the surprise move by India's film certification board to delay approvals for certain films until after the Lok Sabha elections, citing examples like "Sabarmati Report," "Jahangir National University," and "Pratinidhi 2." The article questions the reasons behind this censorship, its implications for artistic freedom, and the potential influence of cinema on public beliefs and behaviors. The hold-back of these films has sparked discussions in entertainment circles, reflecting the subjective nature of censorship decisions and their impact on society.</description>

			<title>Consumerism rules: It’s visible in creams, dreams and vanity mirrors</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/consumerism-rules-it-s-visible-in-creams-dreams-and-vanity-mirrors-11715189081680.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of India's growing consumption economy on parenting and the attitudes of the younger generation. It highlights the contrast between the frugal, contented upbringing of parents born in the 1970s and 1980s and the affluent, consumerist lifestyle they now provide for their children. This shift challenges the inculcation of values like moderation and gratitude in youth.

Anita, a parent from Delhi, reflects on her modest upbringing and her desire to give her children more opportunities, yet she notices a lack of gratitude and a disconnect with life's realities. Similarly, creams and lotions, once simple utilities, now symbolize prestige, and dreams of resilience have turned into aspirations for luxury.

The article also touches on the pressures faced by today's youth to conform to trends and lifestyles promoted by peers and social media, often leading to impulsive spending. Priya, a young professional, represents the struggle between parental values of frugality and the temptation to adopt lavish lifestyles, which resulted in her debt.

The piece concludes by emphasizing the importance of effective parenting in teaching children to differentiate between needs and wants, appreciate what they have, and practice financial moderation. It suggests that parents should impart wisdom, accountability, empathy, and humility, while the youth should recognize the sacrifices made for their comfort and become financially savvy. The article calls for equipping the next generation with financial management skills and a strong moral compass, asserting that values and legacies will endure beyond material possessions.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/republicans-are-trying-a-new-way-to-control-women-s-bodies-11715188936848.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) rule that requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees, including time off for abortions. Republican attorneys general from 17 states have filed a lawsuit against this rule, arguing it exceeds the law's intended scope and infringes on state laws. The article criticizes this move, highlighting the need for workplace protections and the right of pregnant workers to seek care without employer interference. It also notes the historical context of discrimination against pregnant workers and emphasizes the role of federal laws in ensuring basic freedoms across states. The coalition of attorneys general is accused of trying to impose their conservative values on the entire country under the pretext of federalism and employer protection. The article is critical of these actions and underscores the importance of upholding the rights of pregnant workers.</description>

			<title>IBC tale of delay: Speed up insolvency resolution for this reform to shine</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ibc-tale-of-delay-speed-up-insolvency-resolution-for-this-reform-to-shine-11715188874893.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the economic and social impact of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) of 2016 in India. It highlights the IBC's role in improving India's Ease of Doing Business ranking and increasing the recovery rate for creditors. However, it also points out recent challenges, such as a drop in the recovery rate and increased resolution time. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of respecting the commercial decisions of the Committee of Creditors (CoC), but delays in case admissions and resolutions persist due to various factors, including frivolous appeals and the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) capacity constraints. The article suggests that these delays can lead to asset value erosion and affect all stakeholders, emphasizing the need to streamline the insolvency resolution process to prevent it from becoming ineffective like the Sick Industrial Companies Act.</description>

			<title>Freshworks takes a calculated risk. Will it work?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/freshworks-takes-a-calculated-risk-will-it-work-11715229421312.html</link>
			<description>Freshworks Inc., a Nasdaq-listed SaaS company, experienced a leadership transition that initially unsettled investors, with the stock price dropping from $18.25 to below $14. Founder-CEO Girish Mathrubootham stepped into the role of executive chairman, focusing on long-term product vision and AI, while Dennis Woodside took over as CEO to handle day-to-day business execution.

Despite challenging macro-economic conditions and the advent of AI technology, Freshworks has shown resilience. The company, which began as Freshdesk in Chennai and is now headquartered in San Mateo, raised $1.03 billion in its 2021 IPO. It has a current market cap of about $4.26 billion, with a reported revenue of $596 million for 2023 and a net loss of $137 million, an improvement over the previous year.

Freshworks' recent quarter results indicated a 3% sequential revenue increase and a narrowed loss of $23 million. The company projects 2024 revenue between $695 million and $705 million, with a non-GAAP operating profit of $21.8 million for the March quarter. It aims to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2026 and has acquired Device42, an IT-management firm, for $230 million to bolster growth.

The company's customer base primarily consists of over 51,000 small and medium-sized businesses, which are increasingly targeted by off-the-shelf AI-based tools. Freshworks is developing its own AI-based product portfolio, a task for which Mathrubootham, regarded as a visionary leader, is well-suited. The leadership change is seen as a strategic move to focus on AI innovation while maintaining operational efficiency under Woodside. Despite the risks, this transition is considered a calculated step towards future growth and adaptation to AI advancements.</description>

			<title>Watch out, AI and GenAI are transforming e-commerce from the ground up</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/watch-out-ai-and-genai-are-transforming-e-commerce-from-the-ground-up-11715188543634.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on e-commerce. It highlights AI's role as a general-purpose technology, akin to electricity, that powers various aspects of society and business, including logistics, social networks, and smartphones. AI's integration into e-commerce began with Amazon in 1994 and has since made operations more efficient through applications in recommendations, logistics, warehousing, and stock merchandising.

The piece emphasizes the potential for AI to revolutionize e-commerce through advancements in Generative AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. These technologies enable hyper-personalization, allowing retailers to offer tailored product selections to consumers. AI algorithms can predict consumer behavior, craft marketing messages with individual appeal, and enhance the digital shopping experience with personalized chatbots and AI-generated reviews.

Operational efficiency is another area where AI contributes significantly, automating back-end processes such as inventory management, product shipment, and delivery route optimization. This automation not only reduces errors but also lowers costs, leading to more attractive retail prices.

Furthermore, AI has the potential to break language barriers and expand market reach. In multilingual countries like India, GenAI can facilitate real-time translation and use voice and video enablers to make e-commerce more inclusive and accessible.

In summary, AI and GenAI are poised to reshape e-commerce by providing personalized experiences, operational efficiency, and expanded market access, ultimately aiming to deliver the best products at attractive prices to every individual. The future of e-commerce, underpinned by AI, promises a global marketplace that is more inclusive and technologically advanced.</description>

			<title>Our post-pandemic slump in household savings should disappoint but not alarm us</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/our-post-pandemic-slump-in-household-savings-should-disappoint-but-not-alarm-us-11715188314362.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the decline in net household savings in India, which have fallen to a five-year low of ₹14.2 trillion in 2022-23 from ₹23.3 trillion in 2020-21. This drop is significant as household savings constitute over half of India's gross savings and are a crucial source of funds for the economy. The decrease in savings is attributed to the economic impact of COVID-19, followed by increased credit uptake and home purchases as the economy recovered. Although liabilities have increased, the rise in savings in physical assets like real estate suggests that the credit was largely used for asset accumulation, which is not a cause for concern unless there is asset deflation.

Additionally, there has been a notable shift towards equity investments, with household mutual fund investments almost tripling and investments in debentures nearly doubling. This move towards capital markets is positive for the economy, although it requires regulatory vigilance due to the influx of new investors unfamiliar with market downturns. The article suggests that while bank balances have been slow to recover, the economy benefits from the diversification of savings into various assets.</description>

			<title>Volatility index spike: Do election bets need to be hedged?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/volatility-index-spike-do-election-bets-need-to-be-hedged-11715188228737.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent tension in the Indian stock markets, particularly the volatility index (VIX), which has seen a significant increase since the beginning of the Lok Sabha elections on April 19. Despite the S&amp;P BSE Sensex remaining relatively stable, the VIX surged by 70% from a three-quarter low on April 23 to May 7. The rise in volatility is attributed to market expectations and uncertainty regarding the election results, especially with a lower voter turnout compared to 2019, which could indicate a less predictable outcome and possibly not in favor of the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This uncertainty has led investors to hedge their bets, with strategies like "straddle" being employed to manage risk amidst the election results. The article also notes that actions by India's bank regulator may have contributed to the VIX movement. Overall, the article highlights the cautious approach of market participants in the face of electoral uncertainty.</description>

			<title>Trash it right: We must transform waste management</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/trash-it-right-we-must-transform-waste-management-11715099767446.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the innovative and creative solutions being implemented to tackle environmental issues, particularly waste management. It highlights the Trash Isles campaign, which symbolically created a 'country' in the Pacific Ocean to draw attention to the unmanaged waste problem. The article emphasizes a paradigm shift in waste management policies and perspectives, advocating for zero-waste economies and viewing waste as a resource rather than something to discard.

India's current policy framework aims to reduce landfill usage to less than 10% of waste, focusing on segregation, sorting, and recycling to maximize resource recovery. Despite generating over 62 million tonnes of waste annually, India faces challenges in waste collection, treatment, and disposal, with a significant portion ending up in waste yards.

The article calls for a sustainable waste management system that includes proper infrastructure, detailed processes, and technology for tracking and recycling waste. It suggests adopting a business model that balances environmental and social impacts, integrating informal waste workers, and relying on dual revenue streams from service fees and waste sales to cover operational costs.

In conclusion, the article stresses the need for collective efforts to create sustainable and impactful waste management processes, supporting individuals and businesses in the sector, and reflecting on how waste management practices reveal societal values.</description>

			<title>Value chain risk: Will Vietnam end up like another Chinese province?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/value-chain-risk-will-vietnam-end-up-like-another-chinese-province-11715099704051.html</link>
			<description>Vietnam's aggressive anti-corruption campaign has led to significant political upheaval, with high-profile figures and business tycoons facing charges and, in some cases, severe sentences. The campaign has raised concerns about political stability and the potential impact on foreign investment, especially as Vietnam is poised to benefit from US-China tensions. The drive against corruption has inadvertently shifted economic prosperity towards the north, particularly around Hanoi and Haiphong, leaving the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City behind.

Foreign investments are increasingly flowing into the northern region, with significant infrastructure developments such as new factories and expressways. However, the anti-corruption efforts have also caused a slowdown in public procurement and infrastructure projects, with officials hesitant to make decisions. This has resulted in delays, like the incomplete metro line in Ho Chi Minh City.

The northern province of Quang Ninh has become particularly attractive to investors due to its improved infrastructure and geographical advantages. Despite soaring power demands and infrastructure needs, decision-making has stalled since the anti-corruption campaign began. Vietnam has even resorted to importing electricity from China to meet immediate needs.

The death sentence of Truong My Lan, a prominent real estate figure, has unsettled the business community, highlighting the government's willingness to target private businesses. This has influenced Chinese entrepreneurs to align with the political elite, who currently favor the north.

The article suggests that while anti-corruption efforts are essential, they can also hinder economic progress. Vietnam's internal politics may be inadvertently aligning the northern region more closely with China, raising questions about the country's future direction and independence.</description>

			<title>What TikTok failed to understand about America: Democracy</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/what-tiktok-failed-to-understand-about-america-democracy-11715099632361.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding TikTok in the United States. **President Joe Biden** signed a law that could ban TikTok in nine months unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it to a non-Chinese entity. The law reflects bipartisan concerns over China, but TikTok has dismissed it as "political theatre."

US lawmakers, typically hesitant to regulate business, are concerned about data privacy and the potential for Chinese government access to American user data due to China's intelligence laws. TikTok's promise to store American data on non-Chinese servers did not alleviate these concerns, which were similar to those leading to a ban on Huawei telecom equipment.

TikTok had an opportunity to collaborate with US regulators and set a positive example in data privacy. Instead, it took an aggressive approach, hiring lobbyists and urging its young American user base to protest against the legislation. This strategy backfired, highlighting fears of foreign influence on American democracy and exacerbating concerns about social media's impact on beliefs and behaviors.

The article suggests that TikTok's actions, perceived as an attack on American democracy, ensured the passage of the forced-sale bill. With its future in the US uncertain, TikTok is advised to reconsider its approach and respect American concerns about data privacy and democratic integrity. Other non-US companies are warned to learn from TikTok's mistakes. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of respecting legitimate concerns about data privacy and threats to democracy.</description>

			<title>Do hybrid bonds actually offer bank depositors any protection?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/do-hybrid-bonds-actually-offer-bank-depositors-any-protection-11715099516882.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent instances of debt capital instruments being written down in the Indian banking sector, with specific reference to the Tier 1 bonds of Yes Bank and Tier 2 bonds of Lakshmi Vilas Bank. It highlights the challenges faced by bondholders, including legal battles and the implications of the judiciary's decisions on the banking system's regulatory framework.

The write-downs are part of a global trend following the 2008 financial crisis, where new debt capital instruments were introduced to prevent government bailouts of failed banks. These instruments, known as Basel 3 Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds, or 'hybrid bonds', have features of both debt and equity and are designed to absorb losses in times of bank stress.

The article notes that in India, these instruments have grown to a significant size, with Tier 1 bonds comprising a substantial portion of the banking system's net worth. It also discusses the changes in the covenants for coupon payments on these bonds over the last decade, the government's role in bailing out banks, and the implications for investors and the banking system's stability.

The Supreme Court's upcoming judgement on Yes Bank's Tier 1 bonds is highlighted as a crucial event that will set a precedent for the treatment of such instruments in future bank resolutions. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for consensus among stakeholders on the risks and regulatory treatment of hybrid bonds to maintain confidence in the Indian banking system.</description>

			<title>Leadership determines whether institutions flout or value norms</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/leadership-determines-whether-institutions-flout-or-value-norms-11715099450125.html</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the author's personal experiences with educational institutions run by religious trusts, highlighting the impact of foundational norms and beliefs on their functioning. The author contrasts two institutions: one focused solely on education, where everything from teacher behavior to the physical environment aligned with this purpose, and another where education was secondary to serving God, affecting teacher-student relationships and the institution's priorities.

The author extends this observation to hospitals run by religious institutions, noting that while patient care is less affected by such norms, the impact on students in educational settings can be significant. The article suggests that these foundational norms are often unspoken but deeply influence institutional behavior and the experiences of those within.

A particular case is discussed where an educational institution was found to be corrupt, with the principal and faculty involved in malpractices, including financial misconduct and caste-based discrimination. This institution's closure and the lack of accountability are cited as examples of gross violations of educational norms.

The author argues that leadership is crucial in maintaining or subverting these foundational norms, with the potential for either subtle differences or complete hijacking of an institution's purpose. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of public vigilance to safeguard against such subversion in the reality of the country's institutional landscape.</description>

			<title>CBI vs banks on fraud: It’s not too late to set the record straight</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/cbi-vs-banks-on-fraud-it-s-not-too-late-to-set-the-record-straight-11715091067759.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complexities surrounding the classification of 'fraud accounts' in Indian banking, in light of a Supreme Court ruling that requires borrowers to be given a hearing before their accounts are labeled as fraud. Banks are seeking a review of this ruling due to the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) interpretation that it should apply retrospectively, which banks disagree with. The article argues that banks already follow due process in dealing with defaulting borrowers, often engaging extensively to recover dues before labeling an account as fraud. It suggests that the Supreme Court should clarify that its ruling is meant for prospective application to prevent the reopening of past cases and potential legal disputes over what constitutes a hearing. The author warns against the negative impact on credit discipline and the broader economy if legal challenges by borrowers lead to reduced lending to riskier ventures. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of maintaining progress in credit discipline for the health of the banking sector and the economy at large.</description>

			<title>E-rupee: Maximize its appeal</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/erupee-maximize-its-appeal-11715091749858.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of India's central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-rupee, which has been in test mode since 2022. The e-rupee is expected to become accessible offline, enhancing user convenience. It may also be made programmable for more flexibility compared to UPI transfers. However, for it to truly replace cash, it requires anonymity.

The RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das, mentioned that transactions could be technologically erased from records, but legislative support would strengthen the promise of anonymity. With the e-rupee still under development, it's an opportune moment for national debate on its design.

The article suggests that for the RBI's CBDC to achieve global success, it should integrate technological innovations with the best aspects of traditional currency, including purchasing power and assured privacy.</description>

			<title>Hindujas get a 360-degree makeover but need to smoothen rough edges</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/hindujas-bofors-scandal-ashok-leyland-gocl-corp-nxt-digital-hinduja-global-indusind-bank-11715073078718.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the transformation of the Hinduja Group over the past three decades, particularly since the Bofors scandal. The family business, originally founded in 1919 and once known for its secrecy and political connections, has reinvented itself into a transparent, diversified conglomerate operating in around 40 countries across various sectors, with a significant presence in India.

The group, which was led by S.P. Hinduja during the 1990s, now has at least six publicly traded companies in India, including Ashok Leyland and IndusInd Bank, all run by professionals with independent boards. The current third generation of the Hinduja family is well-educated and actively involved in the business.

Despite the progress, the family has faced internal disputes, notably a feud over the control of Hinduja Bank, which highlighted issues of cohesiveness and gender equality within the family. With the family business now in its third generation and the fourth generation set to take over, the article suggests that the Hindujas must be cautious, as most family businesses do not survive beyond the third generation.

The Hinduja brothers, once the richest Indians in the world, have shifted focus from reputation to creating a more stable and sustainable business model, aiming to triple the valuation of IndusInd International Holdings to about $50 billion by 2030 and planning new product launches through Ashok Leyland. The article implies that this strategic shift is crucial for the longevity and success of the family business.</description>

			<title>Yes, releasing the EVM source code could improve our polling system’s security</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/yes-releasing-the-evm-source-code-could-improve-our-polling-system-s-security-11715020084947.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the debate surrounding the release of electronic voting machine (EVM) source code for open-source use. The Supreme Court has upheld the use of EVMs but rejected the idea of making their source code public, citing potential misuse. The author argues against the belief that access to source code inherently compromises digital systems, using the open-source messaging app Signal as an example of secure software despite its publicly available source code.

The article suggests that open-source software tends to be more secure because it allows a broader community to identify and fix vulnerabilities quickly. It highlights the importance of administrative access over mere knowledge of source code in terms of security risks. The author advocates for the open-source model, noting that many everyday systems rely on it, such as Apache Web Servers and the Linux operating system.

The piece also references the Heartbleed bug to illustrate the open-source community's ability to respond swiftly to security threats. It concludes by urging the adoption of open-source practices in government systems to enhance security and public trust, mentioning India's National Open Standards Policy as a step in this direction, but notes the lack of significant progress since its introduction. The author expresses surprise at the Supreme Court's stance given the government's previous support for open source. The article ends with unrelated content and advertisements which have been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>The neutrality of ‘Civil War’ is what makes this film powerful</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-neutrality-of-civil-war-is-what-makes-this-film-powerful-11715020009507.html</link>
			<description>Alex Garland's film "Civil War" has sparked debate for its depiction of a future America in conflict without explaining the cause. Critics argue it fails to realistically portray the divisions in America, but this misses the film's potential to impact US politics. The film prompts viewers to question how such a conflict could arise, with possibilities like war, pandemics, AI, or climate disasters. Surprisingly, the film and some commentators overlook the role of Christian nationalism, a topic explored in the documentary "Bad Faith" and Katherine Stewart's book "The Power Worshippers."

The film's critics are correct that discussing an American civil war without addressing Christian nationalism's goals and tendencies is challenging. However, the film's political neutrality may be its strength, allowing it to engage a wider audience in the conversation about political violence. Garland's approach invites Republicans and independents into a crucial dialogue, a feat Democrats have struggled to achieve.

The article suggests that for "Civil War" to foster bipartisan discussions, Democrats must also engage in good faith and consider threats to democracy from all sides. The film leaves important questions about democracy and peace open, which the author plans to address in a future column. The film's ability to raise these questions without bias is seen as a positive contribution to the political discourse.©bloomberg</description>

			<title>The Godrej family saga: Business succession should be led by a common vision</title>

			<description>The article discusses the recent division within the Godrej family business group, a significant player in India's industrial landscape for over a century. It highlights how family disputes over succession and strategic vision have led to the split of their business portfolio. The piece emphasizes the complexities of managing multigenerational family enterprises, stressing the importance of proactive preparation for potential splits and effective succession planning. Drawing from the example of the Merck family, who successfully navigated such challenges, it underscores the need for transparent communication and consensus-building to preserve the family's legacy and business success.</description>

			<title>Could a few swing states determine who governs India?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/could-a-few-swing-states-determine-who-governs-india-11715019836004.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the dynamics of India's 18th Lok Sabha elections, highlighting the historical context of majority margins in past elections and the shift to coalition governments when no single party won a clear majority. It notes that in recent elections, the BJP has managed to secure a majority, raising questions about whether this trend will continue in 2024. The article points out that only the BJP and Congress are contesting enough seats to potentially win a majority on their own.

It also explains India's first-past-the-post electoral system and analyzes the BJP's performance in the 2019 elections, where it won a significant number of constituencies with more than 50% voter share. The analysis challenges the notion that BJP's wins were concentrated in its strongholds, showing a broader distribution across various states.

The article suggests a method to predict election outcomes by considering certain seats as 'safe' for the BJP or non-BJP parties and analyzing the rest as 'swing seats.' However, it cautions that this method could be flawed due to changes in political alliances and the unpredictable nature of elections.

Finally, it identifies six states as potential swing states that could influence the overall election result, emphasizing that the outcome in these states will likely be determined by narrow margins and local factors. The article concludes with a quote from Malcolm Gladwell, implying that small influences can have significant impacts on the election results.</description>

			<title>In Europe, China faces headwinds but can India gain?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/in-europe-china-faces-headwinds-but-can-india-gain-11715002113967.html</link>
			<description>Chinese President Xi Jinping's European tour is set to address trade tensions and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. European concerns over China's trade practices and political strategies, including 'wolf warrior' diplomacy and support for non-democratic regimes, are high on the agenda. The EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation has led to targeted actions against Chinese companies, exemplified by recent raids in Warsaw and Rotterdam. These moves reflect a shift in EU policy towards a more assertive stance against Chinese economic influence.

Xi's visits to Belgrade and Budapest are symbolic, with the former marking the anniversary of NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy and the latter showing support for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's politics. These visits underscore China's rivalry with the US and its disdain for liberal democracy.

For India, the EU-China dynamics have economic and political implications. The EU's stringent actions raise compliance costs for Indian companies, which may not directly benefit from the exit of Chinese companies. Politically, India's democratic credentials and adherence to international law contrast with China, but Europe's rightward shift and the regional conflict may limit India's acceptance. Concerns about India's democratic backsliding and 'wolf warrior' diplomacy could erode European goodwill, potentially aligning India with China as a challenger to European interests. India risks overestimating its global position as an alternative to China without the necessary market capacity or political influence.</description>

			<title>Equitable survival: Climate action needs to be gender just</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/equitable-survival-climate-action-needs-to-be-gender-just-11715019764732.html</link>
			<description>The European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of KlimaSeniorinnen, a group of Swiss women over 64, against the Swiss government for not reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which increases their risk of heatwave-related deaths. This ruling sets a precedent for the 46 countries in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Swiss government contends that climate policy decisions should be made by elected officials, not courts.

Studies show Europe is warming faster than the global average, with older women particularly vulnerable to heat-related deaths. Research predicts significant future fatalities among women due to heat in India, Nigeria, and the US. Physiological differences, such as lower sweating capacity in women, contribute to this vulnerability, alongside social factors like isolation and limited access to resources.

Economic impacts are also severe, with heat expected to reduce work hours globally. Women, especially in heat-exposed unpaid work, face extended work times and income disparities due to heat stress. By 2030, heat-related job losses could reach 34 million in India alone. South Asian countries, particularly India, face substantial GDP losses due to reduced working hours for women.

The article emphasizes the need for gender-inclusive climate adaptation strategies and action plans to address the disproportionate impact of heat on women's lives, livelihoods, and economic contributions.</description>

			<title>Sure, insure people, but public healthcare for all is a must for Viksit Bharat</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sure-insure-people-but-public-healthcare-for-all-is-a-must-for-viksit-bharat-11715019703870.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses a new government initiative in India to address the high number of road accidents by providing cashless emergency care to victims. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is reported to be working on a scheme that offers up to ₹1.5 lakh for cashless treatment to every traffic accident victim, regardless of their insurance status. This would be applicable at all hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat plan for up to a week from the date of the accident.

The scheme aims to reduce treatment refusals and delays, with costs being reimbursed through the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, initially established to aid hit-and-run victims. The government is exploring ways to keep the fiscal cost low, including discussions with insurers about using a portion of vehicle owners' third-party coverage premiums.

The article suggests that while expanded insurance is beneficial for immediate welfare, the ultimate goal should be a robust public health system that provides efficient and affordable care to all, similar to the systems in the world's happiest countries. It argues that direct healthcare services are preferable to insurance-based models, which can be bogged down by bureaucratic processes. The piece concludes by advocating for subsidized state provisions and fiscal planning for a significant upgrade in public health services as the economy grows.</description>

			<title>India’s economy: Off to a flying start</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/indias-economy-off-to-a-flying-start-11715019334360.html</link>
			<description>India's economy has shown a strong start in the fiscal year 2024-25, according to high-frequency indicators. The services sector PMI stood at **60.8 in April**, slightly down from **61.2 in March**, but still indicating one of the strongest performances in 14 years. The manufacturing PMI was also robust at **58.8**, marking the second-highest level since early 2021.

The PMI readings, which are well above the 50 threshold that demarcates expansion from contraction, suggest economic growth. Additionally, India's GST collections reached a record high of **₹2.1 trillion in April**, further fueling optimism for the economic outlook of the year.

Despite these positive signs, the economy is not operating at full capacity, with private investment and consumption lagging behind expectations. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept interest rates from falling due to inflation concerns. The situation could have been more complex if the US Federal Reserve had started lowering rates, but its decision to maintain a 'higher-for-longer' stance has alleviated some pressure. Nevertheless, monitoring domestic economic variables remains a complex task.</description>

			<title>Artificial intelligence holds the key to urban resilience</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/artificial-intelligence-holds-the-key-to-urban-resilience-11714930800164.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the increasing risk of climate-driven events in cities, where 4.4 billion people live. It highlights the threats of rising sea levels, flooding, and extreme heat waves, particularly in coastal megacities and regions like South Asia and the Middle East. Urban areas, which are significant contributors to global carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption, are expected to house 68% of the population by 2050.

The piece emphasizes the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to support cities in building resilience against climate change. AI could accelerate urban climate solutions, enable sustainable development, and innovate at a rapid pace. It could also assist in disaster response, make city operations more sustainable, and optimize public transportation and traffic planning.

However, the article notes that while many cities are exploring AI, few have implemented it due to challenges in technology access and skill requirements. It calls for greater access to AI tools and training, especially for vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by climate threats. The author urges all stakeholders, including governments, companies, and communities, to embrace AI to make cities safer and more adaptable to climate change. The private sector is encouraged to partner with public agencies and support marginalized urban populations. The article concludes that the technology to combat climate-driven events exists, but collective action is needed to utilize it effectively. ©2024/project syndicate</description>

			<title>Pushback power: GenAI can’t beat us on a key aspect of human creativity</title>

			<description>The article discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the creative industry, particularly animation. Yael Biran, an animator with 25 years of experience, has seen a significant decline in her work due to clients and agencies using AI tools for animation, which they previously outsourced to professionals like her. The AI-generated content can rival human-created work, saving time and money, as evidenced by its use in high-profile projects for Madonna and Stephen Colbert's show.

However, there is concern that reliance on AI will lead to a lack of originality and meaningful impact, as AI often replicates existing art styles. Biran warns that without the critical input of visual thinkers, companies may produce ineffective visual communications, such as animations that misrepresent intended messages. The article highlights the importance of human creativity and understanding in visual storytelling, suggesting that businesses should not fully replace human creatives with AI. Despite the advancements in AI, the need for human judgment and skill in challenging ideas and creating impactful visuals remains crucial.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/startups-have-a-lot-to-learn-from-long-established-organizations-11714930645490.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the lessons startups can learn from established companies. Here's a summary:

**1. Seek Trusted Advisors:** Startups should have advisors or challengers to provide balance and prevent blind spots that could lead to failure.

**2. Build a Team of Owners:** As startups grow, it's crucial to have a senior team with complementary skills to scale the business effectively.

**3. Focus on Reality Metrics:** Startups should concentrate on operating and financial metrics that matter in the long term, rather than vanity metrics.

**4. Develop 'Good Bureaucracy':** Implementing fit-for-purpose systems and processes can help startups manage growth without losing agility.

**5. Prioritize Governance:** Good governance should be part of a startup's DNA from the beginning to avoid future disputes and ensure long-term success.

The article concludes by emphasizing that while startups can teach large companies about innovation and agility, they can also learn about sustainability and governance from the experience of established firms. These insights are presented as the authors' personal views.</description>

			<title>University campus dissent: The kids are (not) alright</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/university-campus-dissent-the-kids-are-not-alright-11714930571660.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of youth movements on social and political issues, drawing parallels between the past and present. It references the song "The Kids are Alright" by The Who as a symbol of youth resilience. The focus is on recent student protests in America against Israeli actions in Gaza, calling for divestment from companies doing business with Israel and ending partnerships with Israeli universities. The movement has spread internationally and is compared to historical student movements against the Vietnam War and apartheid. The article contrasts the informed activism in America with a lack of awareness among some protestors in Delhi. It praises American universities as free speech havens and urges Indian universities to foster similar environments for debate and dissent to prepare future generations. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of free expression within educational institutions for the growth of knowledge and creativity.</description>

			<title>Our approach to the regulation of cryptocurrency needs clarity</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/our-approach-to-the-regulation-of-cryptocurrency-needs-clarity-11714930485239.html</link>
			<description>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy. The FTX scandal resulted in significant financial losses, with conservative estimates at $8 billion for customers, $1.7 billion for investors, and $1.3 billion for Alameda lenders. The collapse of FTX contributed to a sharp decline in the overall crypto market value and led to increased regulatory scrutiny.

In India, the response to crypto regulation has been inconsistent, with conflicting views among the RBI, Sebi, and the government. A cryptocurrency bill has been pending since 2021, and in the meantime, heavy taxes have been imposed on crypto trades, including a 1% TDS and a 30% capital gains tax, with no provision to offset losses. Despite these measures, Indian users have been moving to offshore platforms, leading to a significant outflow of trading volume and tax revenue.

The Indian government's approach to crypto regulation has been unclear, and the industry is awaiting decisive policy direction. Comparatively, countries like the US, UK, EU, Singapore, Japan, and Australia have developed more comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. For India, the challenge remains to establish clear regulatory authority and purpose for overseeing the crypto industry.</description>

			<title>Elections 2024: Historic for the Constitution that unites us all?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/elections-2024-historic-for-the-constitution-that-unites-us-all-11714920005036.html</link>
			<description>The Indian Constitution has unexpectedly become a focal point in the current national elections, with both major parties, the BJP and Congress, accusing each other of manipulating it for political gain. The main issue revolves around affirmative action, particularly regarding proportional quotas for jobs and education. This election seems likely to hinge on the votes of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), who make up a significant portion of the electorate. While identity politics are at play, there's a silver lining in both sides affirming the Constitution in their rhetoric. However, doubts remain about whether this signals genuine stability or is merely superficial. The BJP's historical stance on the Constitution contrasts with its recent rhetoric, suggesting a political evolution. Nonetheless, there's acknowledgment that the Constitution isn't perfect and should be open to debate. Despite political tensions, there's consensus on upholding key principles like equality and liberty. The article emphasizes the importance of these principles as the foundation of Indian unity, urging a focus on what unites rather than divides.</description>

			<title>Peeled to the core: Onion export bans distort markets</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/peeled-to-the-core-onion-export-bans-distort-markets-11714920091006.html</link>
			<description>The government has lifted its ban on onion exports but with conditions: a minimum export price of $550 per tonne and a 40% tariff. This move, just before elections in Maharashtra, aims to appease farmers affected by the ban. While the decision is welcomed, it highlights the issue of frequent government interventions in agricultural markets. Such bans disrupt market dynamics and discourage farmers from cultivating certain crops. Moreover, they harm India's reputation as a reliable global supplier. The government must establish a clear framework to ensure stability and predictability in agricultural policies.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/first-person/seeking-wisdom-at-the-woodstock-of-capitalism-11714901797899.html</link>
			<description>The article describes the author's experience at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Omaha, which is transformed once a year from a modest city into a bustling hub of activity. The AGM, hosted by Warren Buffett, is not only a chance to hear from the legendary investor but also a gathering that fosters a sense of community among attendees. The author highlights the camaraderie and shared passion for learning and growth that unite both seasoned investors and newcomers. The true charm of the event, as per the author, lies in the connections and friendships made, bound by mutual respect and a desire to grow.

Jason Zweig's passage from 2004 is quoted, emphasizing the comfort of being part of a community and not facing the uncertainties of investing alone. The author reflects on the ethos of Buffett and Munger, which goes beyond wealth creation to building relationships, trust, and a nurturing community. Attending the AGM is likened to a pilgrimage, valuing deep investing principles, long-term thinking, and shared wisdom. It's an experience that affirms we are not alone in our endeavors, and while there will always be intelligent people, there will never be another Buffett or Munger. The author, Vishal Khandelwal, views the AGM as a joyous and growth-oriented journey, a true pilgrimage to the mecca of wisdom.</description>

			<title>Industrial policy is back with a vengeance everywhere</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/industrial-policy-is-back-with-a-vengeance-everywhere-11714893099611.html</link>
			<description>Governments worldwide are re-engaging with industrial policies to enhance industrial competitiveness and shield domestic industries. Various factors like the 2008 financial crisis, skepticism towards free markets, China's ascent, the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, climate change, and geopolitical tensions have prompted this revival. While both developed and developing nations are involved, advanced economies are more active. The resurgence includes traditional measures like subsidies alongside newer priorities like climate action. In the US, recent legislation targets climate change mitigation and semiconductor supply chain security. India's response involves production-linked incentives (PLI) to bolster domestic manufacturing. However, despite efforts, the PLI scheme faces challenges, including private sector reluctance to invest. Addressing this issue is crucial for the success of industrial policies.</description>

			<title>A winner-takes-all economy is bad for innovation and art</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/a-winner-takes-all-economy-is-bad-for-innovation-and-art-11714893014931.html</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the Whitney Biennial, expressing disappointment in its predictability and risk-averse nature, which mirrors a broader societal trend where elite institutions stifle innovation. The exhibition aimed to explore themes of AI, gender, and authenticity, but faced criticism for not being groundbreaking. The author argues that the art world, like other industries, is dominated by a few stars due to a winner-take-all economy, making it difficult for others to succeed without institutional support. This has led to a homogenous intellectual environment and a lack of true creativity at the highest levels. The article suggests that while it's easier than ever to gain attention online, breaking into the economic upper echelon remains challenging and tends to reward conformity. The author questions the sustainability of this bifurcated system and whether establishments like the Whitney Biennial will maintain their importance if they continue to lack innovation. The erosion of establishment authority could democratize success and lead to a more productive economy if it allows for unconventional paths to success.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: How do noble proposals like an inheritance tax arise?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-how-do-noble-proposals-like-an-inheritance-tax-arise-11714892883466.html</link>
			<description>Sam Pitroda, once a prominent figure in Indian telecom, recently suggested the adoption of an inheritance tax and wealth redistribution in India. Although his statement should have been insignificant, it garnered attention due to ongoing elections. Despite being potentially beneficial for the poor, Pitroda's proposal was controversial, with the BJP misrepresenting it as part of the Congress manifesto. This incident sheds light on how societal reforms often stem from conflicts between different layers of power, with the second tier challenging the first, often in the name of morality or the underprivileged. Pitroda's suggestion can be seen as a move to challenge the new elite, reminiscent of historical struggles between different social classes for reform. The article also highlights a less obvious form of inequality perpetuated by the upper middle class, who, unlike billionaires, compete directly with other societal classes in various fields, leveraging not just wealth but social connections for advantage.</description>

			<title>America is not yet declining but appears willing to let itself down</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/america-is-not-yet-declining-but-appears-willing-to-let-itself-down-11714892823009.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of Indian foreign policy and the United States' global position. It reflects on the mid-2000s debate in India about aligning more closely with the US, despite historical hesitations due to past US support for Pakistan and concerns over losing strategic autonomy. The author was among the few advocating for this realignment, seeing it as beneficial for India.

The piece also critiques the notion of American decline, a popular topic during the end of George W. Bush's presidency and Barack Obama's campaign. The author argues against this declinism, citing America's political resilience, educational ecosystem, and ability to attract global talent as reasons for its sustained dominance.

However, the author expresses concern over the damage the US has done to these strengths in the past 15 years, particularly due to extreme partisanship, challenges in the higher education system, and the handling of immigration. Despite these issues, the author believes the US still has the potential for self-correction.

The article concludes by referencing Paul Kennedy's analysis of the rise and fall of great powers, suggesting that the US may risk decline if it does not address its current challenges, especially in the context of international conflicts and the need for hard power. The author implies that the US must remember its historical strengths and avoid the pitfalls of military overstretch to maintain its global position.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/europe-hopes-barbed-wire-will-keep-migrants-out-it-wont-11714825773948.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the proliferation of border fences in the European Union, particularly in response to migrant crises and security concerns. It highlights the significant rise in the length of border fences since the 1990s, with a sharp increase during the Syria-driven migrant crisis of 2015-16 and resurgence amid pandemic-era restrictions easing. Despite the high costs and questionable effectiveness of fences, countries like Poland and Finland are investing in them to manage illegal migration and confront Russian influence. However, critics argue that fences symbolize policy failures and shift migration patterns rather than solve underlying issues. The article also mentions the EU's tougher stance on migration, increased funding for border security, and the legal and moral dilemmas posed by migration policies and the new migration pact.</description>

			<description>The article explores the evolving concept of leadership, emphasizing a shift towards "leading from the back" rather than traditional front-facing leadership styles. It highlights factors such as changing psychological contracts between companies and employees, the rise of hybrid work arrangements, and the democratization of innovation. Unvanguard leaders prioritize purpose-driven cultures, autonomy, and collaboration to foster innovation and drive transformative change within organizations. They prioritize a "people-first" approach, empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully while valuing diversity and collective genius. The article suggests that nurturing leaders who can harness the collective talent of their teams is crucial in today's dynamic landscape.</description>

			<title>The elegant Godrej split: A blueprint for India Inc?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-elegant-godrej-split-a-blueprint-for-india-inc-11714739073514.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Godrej family's elegant and thoughtful family settlement, which took four years to finalize and is seen as a model for succession planning in Indian promoter-driven companies. It contrasts this with cases of value destruction due to poor succession planning, as seen in the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Thapar Group. The author suggests that for Indian companies to become globally competitive, they should focus on creating large MNCs rather than redistributing control through asset carve-ups.

The article cites examples from the US, Germany, and Sweden, where family-owned businesses have successfully combined family ownership with professional management, often backed by large institutions. This governance model has allowed families to retain wealth while delegating management responsibilities, acknowledging their limitations in expertise.

In Japan, family-owned businesses often involve meticulous grooming of family members for leadership, with professional managers sometimes brought in from outside the family. Japanese family businesses typically blend traditional values with modern management to prioritize long-term sustainability.

The author notes that most Indian companies are small by global standards and that splitting assets into smaller entities could hinder achieving global scale. The article suggests that India will need to forge its own path, balancing Eastern and Western models of family business governance. It highlights the importance of careful succession planning, as seen in the Reliance group, Wipro, and HCL, to prevent value destruction and protect the interests of minority shareholders. The author, Prabal Basu Roy, emphasizes the significance of these issues for India Inc and its stakeholders.</description>

			<title>Biden’s take on India’s economy is both bizarre and bothersome</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bidens-take-on-india-s-economy-is-both-bizarre-and-bothersome-11714661045849.html</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden recently made remarks attributing the economic challenges of Japan, China, and India to "xenophobia," particularly in relation to immigration policies. These comments, made at a fundraising event, have sparked surprise and criticism, especially in India. While India emphasizes inclusivity, Biden's categorization of its economic growth as "stalling" alongside China and Japan is contentious. India's growth trajectory, supported by projections from institutions like the World Bank and IMF, contradicts Biden's characterization. Biden's focus on immigration policies, suggesting that welcoming immigrants fuels economic strength, contrasts with India's more restrictive visa policies, which prioritize reciprocity and can hinder foreign investment. However, India's visa regulations hardly constitute xenophobia, and its immigration challenges differ from those of other countries. Biden's comments risk inflaming tensions, particularly in light of India's advocacy for labor mobility versus US and EU emphasis on capital movement in international negotiations. These remarks could impede progress in ongoing negotiations, such as free trade agreements with the UK and US.</description>

			<title>The Go First case: India's insolvency court needs an understanding of aviation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/go-first-insolvency-nclt-understanding-of-aviation-11714662596004.html</link>
			<description>The article highlights the mishandling of Go First's insolvency case, emphasizing the lack of urgency and expertise within regulatory authorities. It criticizes the delay in hearings by the National Company Law Tribunal and the failure of aviation bodies to aid the struggling airline. The decision to declare insolvency is questioned, with accusations of deliberate misleading actions by the airline's promoters. Despite gaining a moratorium on payments, Go First remains grounded, echoing past failures in the aviation industry. The prolonged delay in resolving the case is deemed detrimental to India's ease of doing business campaign.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the split of assets within the Godrej family, dividing businesses into two groups: Godrej Industries Group (GIG) and Godrej Enterprises Group (GEG). GIG will focus on sectors like fast-moving consumer goods, financial services, and pharma, while GEG will handle areas like consumer durables, construction materials, and security products. Both groups have exclusive rights to certain sectors under the Godrej brand to prevent conflicts. The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining the brand's integrity as it is split between the two groups, highlighting the need for them to remain invested in its integrity for continued success.</description>

			<description>The article critiques President Joe Biden's recent statement where he lumped India with other countries as "xenophobic." It argues that Biden's statement lacks credibility and understanding of India's economic situation and immigration dynamics. While praising the US for its relatively open immigration policy, the article suggests that Biden's credibility on immigration issues is undermined by his unfounded remarks. It also points out India's long tradition of openness to diversity, contrasting it with ongoing debates and crackdowns on dissent in the US.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/is-hiring-just-to-meet-diversity-quotas-an-unfair-approach-11714583280140.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses how many companies in India are prioritizing hiring women at junior levels to meet gender diversity targets, but this approach might lead to biased hiring and hinder long-term diversity goals. It highlights biases in recruitment processes, including reliance on demographics like gender and location. Despite the use of AI tools, human oversight is necessary to eliminate biases. The article also addresses subtle biases based on social status and accents, particularly in the IT sector. It suggests that companies should focus on retaining women and invest in training managers to overcome biases. Additionally, it calls for internal studies to understand why women drop out at mid or senior levels and recommends examining recruitment parameters for biases. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for strategic attention to diversity throughout the hierarchy.</description>

			<title>Self-driving Teslas can’t sneak around the US-China ‘silicon curtain’</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/selfdriving-teslas-can-t-sneak-around-the-us-china-silicon-curtain-11714583074179.html</link>
			<description>Tesla's stock surged by 15% after news broke of tentative approval for its driver-support technology in China, following a meeting with Premier Li Qiang. Despite Elon Musk's enigmatic statements, the visit signals commitment to Tesla, alleviating concerns. However, Tesla's driver-assistance system, labeled 'Full Self-Driving' (FSD), lags behind competitors like Mercedes-Benz and BMW, who are already offering more advanced autonomous driving features. Reports of a potential Tesla-Baidu collaboration highlight the necessity for Tesla to catch up on autonomous driving by partnering with rivals. Yet, the $82 billion share price increase seems unjustified given China's competitive EV market and geopolitical challenges. Concerns over data privacy and national security may hinder Tesla's ability to apply lessons learned in China globally. Moreover, the risk of accidents involving Tesla's autonomous tech raises questions about public perception and regulatory scrutiny, potentially jeopardizing Tesla's reputation.</description>

			<description>The Lokniti pre-poll voter survey highlighted that while headlines focused on party preferences, the more valuable insights revolved around voters' concerns, such as employment and inflation. The survey emphasized the importance of understanding the nuanced language of issues, like differentiating between "rozgaari" and "naukri" for employment. The article also advocates for reforms, particularly regarding the Reverse Charge Mechanism in GST, to facilitate small enterprises and job creation. It criticizes the survey's lack of accessibility and failure to adequately represent the views of new, younger voters. Additionally, it discusses the role of electronic voting machines (EVMs), the Anti-Defection Law, and the diminishing importance of individual candidates in elections compared to party affiliations. Overall, it raises questions about voters' choices amidst the dominance of party politics and the influence of electoral trends.</description>

			<title>Many lives could be saved by making organ donation our default option</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/many-lives-could-be-saved-by-making-organ-donation-our-default-option-11714582319093.html</link>
			<description>The organ donation gap in India is alarming, with a significant shortage of donors compared to demand. Despite strides, the country still faces low donation rates, resulting in numerous deaths of individuals awaiting transplants. There's a call for a national debate on establishing organ donation as an opt-in by default, with an opt-out provision, aiming to save lives and align with humanitarian principles. Recent increases in cadaver donors offer hope, facilitated by legal recognition of brain-stem death. Prime Minister Modi has emphasized the importance of cadaveric donation, supported by a digital registry. Integrating organ donation preferences into Aadhaar cards could streamline the process. Making organ donation the default option would not only be humanitarian but also economically beneficial, reducing healthcare costs, enhancing productivity, and fostering a healthier society.</description>

			<description>The article discusses India's political debate over inheritance and wealth taxes, highlighting fears of "tax terrorism" and the opposition's stance. It emphasizes the growing income and wealth inequality in India, supported by data from various sources.

			<title>The KYC disruption: Investors deserve better than this</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-kyc-disruption-investors-deserve-better-than-this-11714581776573.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the implementation of new Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations in India, effective from 1 April. These regulations require investors to verify their email IDs, in addition to phone numbers and Aadhaar-PAN linkage, causing disruption for many. Approximately 12% of investor accounts under Sebi's oversight have been put on hold due to gaps in their KYC data. While KYC rules are necessary to prevent fraud, the article suggests a gentler approach could have been taken, such as imposing extra fees for non-compliant accounts rather than outright locking them. It also calls for more proactive efforts from KYC registration agencies, companies, and fund houses to assist investors in meeting compliance requirements and ensure they are not unfairly locked out of their assets.</description>

			<description>India's banks, after overcoming a slew of bad loans, are facing new challenges, particularly in the realm of technology. Kotak Mahindra Bank, among others, has been directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to halt new customer acquisitions and credit card issuances due to serious deficiencies in digital operations. This move follows a significant scam at UCO Bank involving fraudulent fund transfers. While digitization has brought benefits, it also presents risks such as double-spending and fraud. Other banks, like HDFC Bank, have faced similar bans from RBI in the past. The problem extends beyond India, with examples like Singapore's DBS Group experiencing tech-related issues. With a surge in digital transactions, concerns about cybersecurity and fraud are mounting, prompting regulatory action. However, there's a need for a deeper understanding and updating of technology regulations by regulators like RBI to effectively combat emerging threats.</description>

			<description>The World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) report confirmed 2023 as the warmest year on record, with El Niño's lingering effects exacerbating global warming. India's Meteorological Department predicts above-normal temperatures, prompting proactive measures to ensure power availability and mitigate shortages. Economic impacts are anticipated, particularly on perishable crops, leading to food-led inflation. Short-term solutions are discussed, but long-term strategies like strengthening cold-chain infrastructure are deemed essential. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee remains cautious amidst inflationary concerns influenced by weather conditions, global economic factors, and currency fluctuations. Domestic bond yields are expected to remain stable despite volatility risks associated with index inclusion.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the immense scale of investment by China and the United States in industrial policies, effectively engaging in a proxy war. China, with its opaque government, reportedly spends a significant portion of GDP on industrial projects, focusing on advanced technologies and youth-driven research. Meanwhile, the US has passed bills aimed at substantial industrial investment, albeit less than China proportionally. The article highlights China's lead in critical technologies but also raises concerns about its economic management, including high investment levels and suppressed household consumption. It points out challenges such as debt accumulation, a deflating housing bubble, and overcapacity in future-focused industries. Additionally, it contrasts China's strategic industrial policy with India's less effective approach, emphasizing the importance of well-designed policies and international trade agreements.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk's abrupt decision to skip a planned visit to India in favor of an unannounced trip to China signals a potential setback for New Delhi's ambitions. India had been banking on a "China plus one" strategy to attract manufacturing investment amid global tensions. However, data suggests that India has struggled to capitalize on this opportunity, with Vietnam emerging as a more favored destination for relocating supply chains. China, meanwhile, is doubling down on its efforts to dominate future industries through massive investments in advanced manufacturing. The article highlights India's challenges in becoming a preferred manufacturing hub and the potential consequences of missing out on the "China plus one" window of opportunity.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the inadequacies of current public-policy education in India and proposes reforms to make it more relevant and accessible. It suggests integrating public policy into undergraduate and postgraduate curricula across disciplines, offering executive-level programs for working professionals, and incorporating public-policy education into entrepreneurship programs. The article advocates for innovative delivery formats such as immersive travel programs and summer schools to provide hands-on experience and foster collaborative problem-solving. Ultimately, the goal is to create a more informed, engaged, and empowered citizenry, while also nurturing a pipeline of future leaders for the public sector to address India's pressing challenges effectively.</description>

It notes disparities in credit uptake across different regions and emphasizes the importance of extending banking services to under-served areas. The article also addresses regulatory efforts to ensure fair lending practices, including recent warnings against unfair interest charges and measures to curb abusive loan recovery tactics.

			<description>The article discusses concerns about deepfakes spreading misinformation, particularly in the context of Indian politics. It mentions a Parliamentarian from Karnataka who claims to be the victim of a digitally-crafted fake video amid a sexual-assault controversy. Additionally, home minister Amit Shah has rejected a clip that appears to show him promising to end reservations for caste groups, leading to arrests of individuals allegedly linked to the opposition. The article emphasizes the importance of discerning truth from falsehood in a tech-driven world and highlights the need for people to become more skeptical of digital content.</description>

			<title>Raise funds off intellectual property: Opportunity knocks</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/raise-funds-off-intellectual-property-opportunity-knocks-11713109984797.html</link>
			<description>Intellectual Property (IP) financing is emerging as a significant financial innovation, offering IP holders the means to monetize their intangible assets for capital. Beneficial for R&amp;D-intensive ventures, it allows for quicker recovery of R&amp;D costs, thus promoting innovation and economic growth. India, being a major startup hub, stands to gain from embracing IP financing, which could attract substantial capital given its strong global standing in trademark and patent registrations. However, challenges persist, such as financial institutions' difficulty in valuing IP assets, lack of secondary markets, and regulatory hurdles like Basel III not recognizing IP as suitable collateral. Countries like Singapore and Jamaica are advancing the industry with valuation guidelines and training, while recommendations suggest development banks and governments share IP financing risks. As traditional bank funding models falter, IP financing's potential revolution in finance beckons, with India poised to benefit by adopting policy changes that improve IP asset valuation and risk management. Shuchi Agrawal of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy underscores the importance of this shift for India's economic progress.</description>

			<title>Iran attacks Israel: Biden’s big power test</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/iran-attacks-israel-biden-s-big-power-test-11713119933703.html</link>
			<description>In a significant escalation, Iran launched numerous drones and missiles at Israel, with most being intercepted, resulting in minimal damage and a child's injury. This was in retaliation for Israel's attack on Iran's consulate in Syria. The UN received Iran's message that the issue is now closed. The incident presents an opportunity for de-escalation, with the US rejoining Israel's defense. However, the risk of further escalation threatens to increase regional tension and oil prices. President Biden faces the challenge of persuading Israel to refrain from retaliating to prevent a broader conflict in West Asia, which could trigger an oil crisis amid global economic recovery efforts. Biden's political standing is already affected by the war's civilian casualties and the growing anti-US sentiment in the Islamic world due to the Gaza War's toll. His task is to de-escalate the situation for the benefit of all.</description>

			<title>The elderly men who run the world give us hope</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-elderly-men-who-run-the-world-give-us-hope-11713108936739.html</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the societal perception of elderly men, particularly those in positions of power. It questions the disdain for ageing men who don't fade into obscurity, highlighting that ageing is inevitable for everyone. The author ponders over Joe Biden's thoughts at 81, running for office again, and the mockery from Donald Trump, who is 77. The piece criticizes the world's contradictory stance of sneering at elderly men's ambition while simultaneously handing them control. It contrasts the active desire for power and respect in some elderly with others who retreat into a mundane retirement. The writer challenges the expectation for the elderly to lead uneventful lives and points out the discrimination they face solely due to age. Citing Clint Eastwood's productivity at 93, the article argues that health in old age is attainable and that the elderly's longing, including for sex, is natural. It concludes by questioning the overrated smartness of the young and suggests learning from the enduring spirit of ambitious elderly men. Manu Joseph, the author, is a journalist and creator of the Netflix series 'Decoupled'.</description>

			<title>Basel cop-out: Nonsense and bad regulation still prevail in banking</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/basel-cop-out-nonsense-and-bad-regulation-still-prevail-in-banking-11713109222723.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing debate over the 'Basel 3 Endgame' banking regulations. It highlights the misleading rhetoric used by some politicians and bankers, who claim that these rules would limit lending and harm the poor, while in reality, the regulations aim to make banks rely more on equity rather than borrowing. The author, Anat R. Admati, criticizes the banking sector's resistance to such regulations, which are designed to reduce financial risks and improve system stability. Admati also reflects on the banking industry's influence over policy decisions and the persistence of deceptive practices that undermine democracies. The piece underscores the need for more transparent and effective banking regulations to prevent financial crises and ensure social benefits. Admati's work, including a book co-authored with Martin Hellwig, challenges the banking status quo and calls for political action to reform the system.</description>

			<title>India’s economy: Now a force to reckon with globally?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-economy-now-a-force-to-reckon-with-globally-11713107723376.html</link>
			<description>The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the growing influence of G20's large emerging markets (EMEs) on the global economy. Over the last two decades, EMEs have become more integrated globally, creating significant economic 'spillovers'. Contrary to the traditional view that spillovers flow only from advanced to emerging markets, recent trends show that EMEs, especially China, India, Brazil, Russia, and Mexico, are affecting their neighbors' economies just as much as the US does. This shift challenges the long-held 'exorbitant privilege' of the US dollar and suggests a more interconnected global economic landscape. The article emphasizes the need for collective action to minimize the negative impacts of such spillovers, acknowledging that in a globalized world, countries' economic policies are inevitably intertwined.</description>

			<description>US President Joe Biden's previously unqualified support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under scrutiny amid the Gaza conflict. Criticism has grown over the US's role in supplying munitions for Gaza's bombardment, leading to political repercussions for Biden, particularly among young Americans and cease-fire advocates. Bernie Sanders has called for a halt to military aid to Israel, a sentiment echoed by 52% of US adults in a YouGov survey. Biden's political dilemma is exacerbated by opposing interests with Netanyahu, who benefits from the crisis. The Gaza situation and its impact on Biden's support from both Muslim and Jewish voters in key states add to the complexity, with potential political costs for any shift in his stance on Israel.</description>

			<description>India's engagement with Southeast Asia, as emphasized by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's recent tour, is pivotal for its Indo-Pacific aspirations. Despite historical ties and growing economic links, such as the India-Asean Free Trade Agreement, India's influence in the region is perceived as minimal. Strategic partnerships, particularly with Vietnam and the Philippines, focus on security, counter-terrorism, and maritime surveillance. The Act East policy, initiated in 2014, aims to strengthen India's role in regional geopolitics through economic integration and cultural ties. Challenges include Asean's divided response to Chinese actions in the South China Sea. India advocates for a rules-based order, as seen in Jaishankar's support for the Philippines' sovereignty and adherence to UNCLOS. India's non-claimant stance in the South China Sea dispute underscores its commitment to maritime security and regional stability, promoting cooperation and connectivity to maintain freedom of navigation.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on April 22, possibly leading to Tesla announcing a manufacturing plant in India. Despite being overtaken briefly by China's BYD Auto as the world's largest electric carmaker, Tesla faces challenges including lower growth in sales and reduced car deliveries. India's evolving EV market presents an opportunity for Tesla, especially with the government's reduced import tariffs on EVs. With Tesla's market value decreasing and competition rising, the Indian market could be crucial for its future success.</description>

			<title>Vi’s chances of staying afloat brighten. Graduating India’s remaining voice-only users to 4G+ data use is its best hope</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/vodafoneideas-survival-odds-brighten-but-it-needs-to-do-more-to-escape-the-quagmire-11712989226250.html</link>
			<description>Vodafone-Idea (VIL), India's third-largest telecom, is poised for a potential turnaround, planning to raise ₹45,000 crore. The immediate strategy includes a ₹20,000 crore raise through a follow-on public offer (FPO) and rights issue, with the FPO aiming for ₹18,000 crore at a discounted share price. The Aditya Birla Group will also invest ₹2,075 crore. These funds will boost VIL's 4G and 5G network expansion. Despite a subscriber base of 220 million, VIL trails behind Jio and Airtel, who lead with extensive 5G networks and higher average revenues per user (Arpu). VIL's growth could hinge on converting its 2G users to 4G/5G, potentially increasing its Arpu significantly. However, with a net debt of over ₹2.15 trillion, analysts suggest VIL needs to raise an additional ₹65,000 crore within two years to sustain competition. The upcoming fund infusion offers a chance for revival and to maintain a competitive market against the prevailing duopoly.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court’s Delhi Metro verdict opens a Pandora’s box for public-private infra projects</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/supreme-court-s-delhi-metro-verdict-opens-a-pandora-s-box-for-public-private-infra-projects-11712901981886.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant legal battle involving the Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), owned by Anil Ambani, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). Here's a summary:

- The **Supreme Court of India** reversed its own previous decision, a Delhi High Court order, and an arbitration award, rejecting DAMEPL's ₹8,000-crore claim against DMRC.
- The dispute centers on a 22.7-km metro rail project, India's first under a public-private partnership (PPP), which was completed in 2011 without exceeding its ₹5,700 crore budget.
- DMRC handled civil works, while DAMEPL was responsible for system works. However, DAMEPL terminated the project in 2013 due to safety issues and disagreements over fares and punctuality.
- DAMEPL won an arbitration claim for ₹8,009.38 crore, but this was contested through various levels of the Indian court system, with the Supreme Court ultimately setting aside the award.
- The case highlights the complexities and risks of PPP infrastructure projects in India, with concerns about the drafting of contracts and the potential discouragement of private companies from bidding on such projects.
- The Supreme Court's decision contradicts the Finance Ministry's guidelines for state-owned companies not to contest adverse arbitration awards, aiming to create a non-adversarial climate for arbitration in India.
- The article suggests that less than 5% of PPPs are canceled worldwide, but the impact of this verdict could be significant for future infrastructure projects in India.

			<title>Delhi Airport Metro Express: Justice on a slow track</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/delhi-airport-metro-express-justice-on-a-slow-track-11712846304823.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by foreign investors in India due to lengthy and often unsatisfactory judicial processes. It highlights a specific case where the Supreme Court of India reversed its own decision from 2021, which had approved an arbitration award to Reliance Infrastructure related to the Delhi Airport Metro Express. The case, which dates back 12 years, involves the private operator of the airport line service withdrawing due to the poor quality of construction by Delhi Metro, which they claimed compromised the project's viability.

In 2017, a tribunal awarded damages to Reliance Infra, but this was overturned by the Delhi High Court in 2019. The Supreme Court reinstated the award in 2021, only to reverse its decision recently, deeming the award illegal and stating it imposed an excessive liability on a public utility. This flip-flop in judicial decisions contributes to the uncertainty that deters investors, as consistent and predictable legal outcomes are generally preferred for investment decisions. The article suggests that such unpredictability in the judicial system can negatively impact India's reputation among foreign investors.

			<title>Amul in America: Let’s take Indian cooperatives global</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/amul-in-america-let-s-take-indian-cooperatives-global-11712845969330.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation's (GCMMF) recent partnership with the Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) to introduce Amul branded milk in the US. This marks the first time Amul's fresh milk is launched outside India, signaling potential global expansion for the brand and setting a precedent for other Indian cooperatives.

The article traces the history of India's cooperative movement, highlighting its significance post-independence and the establishment of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to replicate the successful Anand pattern of milk cooperatives nationwide. Despite challenges post-economic reforms in 1991, the cooperative sector, including GCMMF and IFFCO, has thrived, with over 850,000 cooperatives in various fields.

The success of Amul, under the leadership of Verghese Kurien, is attributed to his vision and political support, which transformed India into a major milk producer. The article suggests that Indian cooperatives can learn from global counterparts like New Zealand's Fonterra and partner with organizations like Cooperative Business NZ for international growth.

It proposes selecting a group of 'champion cooperatives' for global recognition, akin to the 'navaratna' concept for public enterprises. While challenging, this strategy could foster employment, wealth generation, and national development.

			<title>Question hour: Have opposition parties done well in Parliament?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/question-hour-have-opposition-parties-done-well-in-parliament-11712846560573.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of the Question Hour (QH) in the Indian Legislature, a period during which parliamentarians can question ministers on policy matters. It highlights that while QH is a critical tool for accountability and policy scrutiny, it has not received much scholarly attention.

As India nears general elections, the article examines data from the last four Lok Sabha terms to understand patterns in the 'starred' questions asked by opposition parties. The analysis reveals that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was more active in questioning the government than the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asking more questions when it was in opposition compared to the Indian National Congress (INC).

The article also presents a 'questions-per-seat' metric to assess the effectiveness of the opposition's role in QH, showing that the opposition was weakest in 2014-19. It further explores the performance of individual parties and notes that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was the most active in questioning, while other parties like the Telugu Desam Party and Shiv Sena have seen fluctuations in their questioning intensity.

Additionally, the article points out that the focus of QH queries shifts with changes in government, reflecting the policy priorities of the ruling coalition. It suggests extending this research to state-level assemblies and developing metrics to evaluate opposition performance more comprehensively.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of QH research in understanding the legislative process and its impact on policymaking, hoping it will increase political parties' awareness of their accountability to voters.</description>

			<title>A four-day work week won't be on the horizon for decades</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/a-four-day-work-week-wont-be-on-the-horizon-for-decades-11712846708498.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the debate around the concept of a four-day work week in the United States. It mentions that some billionaires and Senator Bernie Sanders see a shorter work week as part of America's future, with Sanders proposing legislation to reduce the standard work week to 32 hours. The article expresses skepticism about the immediate feasibility of this change, citing concerns about economic harm and questioning the efficiency of such a policy.

The term "four-day work week" can refer to either compressing 40 hours into four days or working only 32 hours across four days. While there's an argument that a shorter work week could maintain productivity due to less time wasted, this may not hold true for labor-intensive jobs. France's experiment with a 35-hour work week did not yield the expected benefits in employment or happiness.

The Sanders proposal, which would lower the threshold for overtime pay without reducing wages for fewer hours worked, could impose a significant burden on the economy. It might benefit high-skill workers in profitable companies but could lead to closures, price increases, or increased automation in firms with lower margins.

Historically, the full-time work week has been 40 hours since 1938 in the US, but work hours have been decreasing as technology and wealth increase. The article suggests that while technology has made people more productive, it doesn't always result in fewer work hours, especially for high-skill workers who have seen greater gains from working more.

The article concludes that while we may eventually work fewer hours, it will take decades before a 32-hour work week becomes the standard. Forcing this change prematurely could have negative consequences. The author expresses more confidence in the economic predictions of John Maynard Keynes than in the proposals of Bernie Sanders, implying that a natural progression towards fewer work hours is preferable to legislative enforcement.</description>

			<title>Investing for absolute returns can liberate investors</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/investing-for-absolute-returns-can-liberate-investors-11712846769506.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the transition from amateur equity investing to institutional investing, highlighting the importance of 'index weight' in portfolio management. Initially, the author was unfamiliar with the concept of 'weight' in the context of a stock's significance within a benchmark index. Institutional investing in India is typically relative return investing, where performance is measured against a benchmark.

The author explains that institutional investors focus on 'heavyweights' or stocks with significant index representation, like HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Larsen &amp; Toubro. These stocks may not offer the best returns but are crucial for the fund's relative performance. The terms 'overweight' and 'underweight' are introduced, indicating whether a stock's portfolio weight exceeds or falls short of its index weight.

The article also touches on the tendency of portfolios to mirror the benchmark, with the largest funds owning the five index heavyweights. It contrasts the goals of retail investors, who aim to beat inflation, with institutional investors, who have various financial obligations.

The benefits of absolute-return investing are discussed, such as efficient time allocation and focusing on areas of competence. Absolute-return investing requires a different approach, emphasizing risk management and the potential need to hedge against short-term market downturns.

In markets like emerging-market equities, where returns have been low, the author suggests that an absolute-return approach may be necessary to achieve significant gains. The article concludes by encouraging a shift from relative to absolute return strategies to meet the diverse objectives of investors.</description>

			<title>Airfares are soaring amid turbulence in civil aviation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/airfares-are-soaring-amid-turbulence-in-civil-aviation-11712763512812.html</link>
			<description>India's civil aviation sector is experiencing a period of difficulty, leading to a significant increase in airfares, particularly on busy routes where prices have risen by up to 30%. This surge is attributed to a combination of factors:

- **Vistara**, a Tata-run airline, has reduced its operations by 25-30 flights daily, which is about 10% of its total capacity, due to a pilot shortage. This reduction has had a considerable impact on the market, which was already facing capacity constraints.
- **IndiGo** has had to ground several planes because of engine issues, yet there remains a strong demand for air travel, a sign of recovery following the pandemic.
- Rising oil prices have led to increased fuel costs, contributing to the higher airfares.
- The aviation market is currently dominated by a **Tata-IndiGo duopoly** after Tata Group's acquisition of Air India in 2022. This lack of competition tends to result in higher prices.

The article suggests that it is uncertain when airfares will decrease, and expresses hope that the wait will not be long. The rest of the text appears to be promotional content for the Mint app and website, encouraging readers to subscribe or log in for additional features.</description>

			<title>Wealth inequality: Give all Indians a stake in capitalism—literally</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/wealth-inequality-give-all-indians-a-stake-in-capitalismliterally-11712761313647.html</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

**India's Economic Growth:**
- The **S&amp;P BSE Sensex** surpassed **75,000 points**, indicating a tripling of the market since the Modi government began a decade ago.
- Market capitalization reached **₹400 trillion**, reflecting a significant increase in investor participation, with demat accounts rising from 20 million to over 150 million in the past decade.
- Post-pandemic, there's been a surge in equity investment, with mutual funds investing **₹19,000 crore** monthly, a substantial increase from **₹2,000 crore** in 2014.

**Wealth Disparity and Political Implications:**
- Despite the growth, wealth disparity remains, with no reliable data on socio-economic levels.
- The stock market's capitalization suggests that the wealthy and middle-class primarily own the equity, leaving most of the population out.
- Wealth distribution has become a political issue, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi proposing a wealth survey for redistribution.

**Proposed Solutions for Inclusivity:**
- To address wealth concentration, the article suggests expanding equity ownership to every household.
- A novel privatization strategy could involve transferring PSU shares to 'Jan Dhan' demat accounts for families without equity.
- This approach aims to provide dividends and encourage broader participation in wealth creation, though it requires overcoming regulatory hurdles and the digital divide.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need for inclusive growth for sustainability and proposes innovative ways to involve more citizens in the equity market. It also touches on the political discourse around wealth distribution in India.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the dynamic between startups and large corporations in India, highlighting the agility and innovative spirit of startups as a lesson for larger entities. Here's a summary:

**Mindset of Build, Break, Learn, and Rebuild:**
Startups are characterized by their willingness to experiment, learn, and pivot based on market changes. They embrace a 'challenger' mindset, unlike large corporations that often prefer maintaining the status quo. The article cites Netflix and Myntra as examples of successful pivots.

**Bias for Agility and Action:**
Startups excel in making swift decisions and taking action, a trait that gives them a competitive edge. In contrast, large firms are slowed down by complex processes and systems. Streamlining these processes can help larger companies become more agile.

**Obsessive Customer Focus:**
Startups maintain a close connection with the market and customer needs, which informs their decision-making. Large organizations tend to have a more distant and sanitized view of the market, which can be improved by direct engagement with customers.

**Organization-First Approach:**
Startups often have a centralized decision-making process around the founder, but as they grow, they need to balance autonomy and accountability. Large companies can learn from this by creating structures that align with overall business objectives rather than siloed interests.

**Personal Connect and Collective Purpose:**
The close-knit nature of startups fosters camaraderie and a shared purpose. Large companies can try to maintain this atmosphere by implementing mini-business structures and cross-functional teams.

**Owner’s Mindset:**
The article argues that beyond structural changes, fostering an ownership mindset among employees is crucial. This involves giving employees a stake in the company and involving them in strategic decisions, which can make them feel more invested in the company's success.

The authors suggest that while large corporations can learn much from startups, the reverse is also true, which will be explored in a subsequent article. The views expressed are personal to the authors.

			<title>We should bridge the AI-human trust gap on ESG reporting</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-should-bridge-the-ai-human-trust-gap-on-esg-reporting-11712749961286.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the dual nature of AI in the context of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting. It highlights the **trust gap** and **blind acceptance** of AI, noting that while AI can automate data collation and analysis for ESG reports, there's debate over whether it can match human quality and trustworthiness.

**Pro-AI arguments** include AI's efficiency, accuracy, and ability to process large data sets, identify patterns, and provide predictive insights, which can enhance transparency and accountability in ESG reporting. AI is also seen as a way to eliminate human biases, standardize reports, and free up human resources for strategic tasks.

**Counterarguments** focus on AI's lack of nuanced understanding and the 'black box' nature of AI tools, which can obscure decision-making processes. Critics argue for the importance of human analysts who can interpret complex data, provide qualitative assessments, and add credibility to reports.

The article suggests that **building trust** in AI-generated information requires transparency about AI algorithms and data sources, human oversight to validate results, stakeholder engagement to co-create ESG narratives, and continuous learning to refine AI algorithms. It emphasizes that while AI offers unprecedented capabilities, the human touch remains indispensable for interpreting complex ESG issues and engaging stakeholders. Ethical considerations and adaptability are also crucial for ensuring fairness and accountability in AI-generated ESG reporting.</description>

			<title>Fairness: the hidden currency of the workplace</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/fairness-the-hidden-currency-of-the-workplace-11712755409549.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of fairness, particularly in the workplace, and how it impacts various aspects of life. It begins with the viral story of Brittany Pietsch, who was laid off from Cloudflare in a manner that many perceived as unfair. The article then explores the human preoccupation with fairness, citing studies that show people often prioritize fair treatment over monetary gain.

It highlights that fairness is a concern not only for employees but also for managers, CEOs, and customers. For instance, a judge ruled against Elon Musk's compensation package at Tesla, and a study showed that CEOs value being rewarded fairly. The article also touches on consumer reactions to price surges during high demand, like Uber fares or essential goods during emergencies, and notes that people generally support anti-price-gouging laws.

The COVID-19 pandemic is mentioned as an example of how fairness can be subjective, with remote work being beneficial for some but highlighting inequities for others. The article concludes by suggesting that while fairness can be complex, ensuring transparent processes can help manage these challenges.

			<title>10-year plan: Can the Indian rupee go global without 100% convertibility?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/10year-plan-can-the-indian-rupee-go-global-without-100-convertibility-11712673405268.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's ambition to make the Indian rupee a globally recognized and accepted currency. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tasked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with developing a 10-year strategy to achieve this goal, given the projection that India's economy will be among the top three in the world soon.

**Key Points:**
- **Global Currency Advantages:** A globalized rupee could lower credit costs in India due to increased overseas demand for trade and reserves.
- **Full Convertibility:** For the rupee to become a global currency, India's economy must globalize, and the rupee must become fully convertible.
- **Past Concerns:** Historical fears of capital account convertibility and the Asian currency crisis of 1997 have kept India cautious, maintaining partial convertibility with caps and restrictions.
- **Prerequisites for Convertibility:** A fully convertible rupee requires fiscal discipline to avoid inflation, a resilient banking system, transparent financial sector, and stable external balances.
- **RBI's Role:** The RBI must ensure the rupee's external value is market-driven without distortion.

The article also highlights the potential of RBI's e-rupee, a central bank digital currency (CBDC), to gain an edge in global markets if designed for minimal cost and maximum privacy. The e-rupee could start with diaspora use for low-cost transfers and expand to other commercial uses if it remains free of geopolitical sanctions. As RBI's direct liability, the e-rupee could attract international users with features like programmability for routine payments. However, for the e-rupee to succeed globally, RBI must establish itself as a credible issuer and maintain macroeconomic stability as advised in 1997.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/olas-india-refocus-makes-sense-11712679091239.html</link>
			<description>Ola Cabs, a major ride-hailing service, is exiting its markets in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand to concentrate on electrification over globalization. The company has begun notifying users of the closure, with the Australian operations ending on 12 April. Ola's strategy now focuses on premium rides and electrifying its fleet of cabs and two-wheelers, especially in the face of competition from BluSmart's electric fleet in Delhi and Bengaluru. To strengthen its position in the Indian market, Ola has also introduced subscription plans for auto-rickshaw drivers, similar to those of competitors like Namma Yatri and Rapido, which do not involve booking fees or commissions. This approach aims to improve the connection between rides and riders, indicating Ola's commitment to adapting and growing within the Indian market.</description>

			<title>We need urgent global talks on the EU’s carbon adjustment import charges</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-need-urgent-global-talks-on-the-eu-s-carbon-adjustment-import-charges-11712673526485.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is designed to align the carbon cost of imports with that of domestic products to meet climate-action commitments. Starting from 2026, EU importers will need to purchase CBAM certificates for products in five sectors, reflecting the carbon price difference between the EU and the exporter country. This aims to address the challenges of maintaining industrial competitiveness and preventing carbon leakage.

The CBAM focuses on emissions in production and the domestic carbon pricing of the exporting countries. For instance, if the EU carbon price is $100 per tonne and Australia's is $34, Australian exporters would pay a CBAM charge of $66 per tonne. India, lacking a direct carbon pricing system, will rely on EU auditors to assess the cost of carbon based on domestic regulations.

The article also touches on the IMF's recommendation for differential carbon pricing based on economic development stages, which contrasts with the CBAM's equalization approach. Critics argue that the CBAM may not significantly reduce emissions and fails to address the need for technology transfer to decarbonize imports. The CBAM's limited initial coverage may expand, affecting the entire production cycle of traded products and potentially conflicting with UNFCCC climate targets and free trade agreements.

The authors suggest that without effective negotiations at the UNFCCC and World Trade Organization, the CBAM could adversely impact industries in developing countries due to high compliance costs and carbon price differentials. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for substantive talks to find solutions that won't burden developing nations' industries.

			<title>IPL cricket is a fine example of free-market capitalism</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ipl-cricket-is-a-fine-example-of-free-market-capitalism-11712673813751.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Indian Premier League (IPL) and its resemblance to free-market capitalism, as demonstrated by the high auction price of cricketer Mitchell Starc. It highlights the IPL's operation similar to a corporate sector, with team owners, audiences, and sponsors representing shareholders, consumers, and investors, respectively. Players are likened to employees who are well-compensated for their performance and travel, akin to corporate executives.

The article also compares the bidding for players to an IPO, where a player's performance can be unpredictable despite high investments. It mentions the participation of foreign players and coaches, reflecting a free-market economy's openness to international talent.

The introduction of an 'impact player' in matches is compared to MNCs customizing products for local markets. The analysis of matches by experts is paralleled with economic analyses in newspapers and business channels.

Advertising in the IPL follows the general rules of the market, with some exceptions like surrogate ads for tobacco products by former cricketers. The rise of gaming apps associated with the IPL is seen as an extension of the market, where skill-based gaming is distinguished from gambling.

In conclusion, the article asserts that the IPL exemplifies capitalism, where market forces dictate outcomes, and stakeholders can choose to participate or not. The ecosystem around the IPL, including various businesses, thrives due to the value created by the tournament. The views expressed are personal to the author.</description>

			<title>China will confront the dreaded middle-income trap this decade</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/china-will-confront-the-dreaded-middle-income-trap-this-decade-11712663109975.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses China's economic challenges and the risk of it falling into the 'middle-income trap,' a situation where a country's growth stagnates after reaching middle-income levels and fails to transition to high-income status. Here's a summary:

- **China's Growth Slowdown**: After decades of near 10% growth, China's economy has slowed, with growth falling to 5.2% last year and projected to drop to 3.4% by 2028. This slowdown could lead to the middle-income trap.

- **Structural Issues**: The slowdown is attributed to structural factors such as an ageing population, a real estate bubble burst, high debt levels (nearly 300% of GDP), and a shift from market reforms to state capitalism.

- **De-globalization and Protectionism**: China's export-led growth model is challenged by global de-globalization trends, Western technology sanctions, and a domestic imbalance between high savings and low consumption rates.

- **Need for a New Model**: The old growth model based on manufacturing and exports is no longer viable. China is encouraged to focus on domestic services and private consumption to avoid overcapacity and deflationary pressures.

- **Policy and Leadership Challenges**: There's uncertainty whether Chinese leaders fully understand the need to shift to a more sustainable economic model. President Xi Jinping's recent actions suggest a continued preference for state capitalism, raising doubts about China's ability to implement necessary reforms.

- **Outlook**: The article concludes that China's actual policies in the coming year will indicate whether it can avoid the middle-income trap and achieve more robust growth.

This summary captures the essence of the article's analysis on China's economic situation and the critical need for policy changes to ensure sustainable growth. If you need more details or have specific questions, feel free to ask!</description>

			<title>Aadhaar-based age tokens can solve a privacy problem</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/aadhaarbased-age-tokens-can-solve-a-privacy-problem-11712663231351.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges and potential solutions related to the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023** in India, particularly focusing on **Section 9**. This section requires data fiduciaries to obtain verifiable parental consent before processing a child's personal data. The act mandates businesses to verify whether personal data belongs to a child, which introduces significant friction and privacy concerns as it may require everyone to present identity documents for age verification.

The author expresses concern that this requirement could disrupt the seamless nature of the internet and give businesses a pretext to collect more personal information than necessary. The article also notes that while the intent is to protect children from inappropriate content online—a concern shared globally—the implementation of such age-gating measures could compromise privacy.

As a solution, the article suggests using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, a cryptographic method that can confirm age without revealing other personal details. It proposes using India's Aadhaar system to generate ZKP tokens for age verification, allowing users to prove their age without disclosing additional information. This approach could streamline the process and preserve user privacy, potentially serving as a model for other countries facing similar challenges. The article concludes by highlighting the global relevance of finding effective age-verification methods that respect privacy.</description>

			<title>Five reasons why we are looking beyond the RBI’s hawkish talk</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/five-reasons-why-we-are-looking-beyond-the-rbi-s-hawkish-talk-11712639870364.html</link>
			<description>The article provides an analysis of India's current economic situation and the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy stance. Here's a summary:

- **India's Economy**: The country is experiencing strong GDP growth, controlled inflation, and manageable deficits. The RBI is in a favorable position regarding policy.
  
- **RBI's Decision**: The RBI has kept interest rates and its policy stance unchanged, which was expected. Despite this, the RBI has made some hawkish comments, indicating no rate cuts soon.

- **Rate Cut Speculation**: The article discusses five reasons why rate cuts might happen sooner than expected:
  1. **No Forward Guidance**: The RBI has avoided giving forward guidance to prevent market volatility, meaning any policy change could be unexpected.
  2. **Inflation Target**: The RBI aims for a 4% inflation target. With a downward revision in inflation projections and potential for an undershoot, there's room for easing.
  3. **Growth Concerns**: While headline growth is strong, concerns about its sustainability and composition persist, with rural demand and private capital expenditure remaining weak.
  4. **Policy Stance as Indicator**: Historically, the RBI's policy stance has not been a reliable indicator of future actions. A subtle policy shift towards more liquidity suggests a pivot.
  5. **Real Policy Rates**: Current real policy rates leave room for recalibration, even if neutral real rates are slightly higher than previous estimates.

- **Outlook**: The authors argue that while the RBI's rhetoric is hawkish, its inflation forecasts and actions are more dovish and neutral, respectively. They anticipate a rate cut in August, earlier than the market consensus of October or later.

			<title>Wipro’s CEO switch: Performance over shareholder value</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/wipros-ceo-switch-performance-over-shareholder-value-11712588512585.html</link>
			<description>Certainly! Here's a summary of the article:

**Wipro's CEO Transition:**
- **Thierry Delaporte**, CEO of Wipro Ltd, has unexpectedly left the company 15 months before his term was due to end.
- Despite the abrupt departure, the company's stock fell by only 1%, indicating that shareholders are not overly concerned.
- **Srinivas Pallia**, a long-time Wipro employee, has been appointed as the new CEO.

**Performance Under Delaporte:**
- Delaporte's tenure saw Wipro's shares increase by 116%, outperforming TCS and Infosys during the same period.
- However, despite acquisitions and operational overhauls, Wipro's profit growth was modest at 5.5%, and it faced management challenges.

**Challenges Ahead:**
- Wipro's performance has been lackluster compared to its peers, with a potential revenue drop for the fiscal year.
- The company has experienced executive discontent and issues with integrating new businesses.
- The IT sector faces threats from AI and changing market demands, which Pallia will need to navigate.

**Looking Forward:**
- Rishad Premji, Wipro’s executive chairman, had previously expressed confidence in Delaporte.
- Pallia is expected to stabilize the company and adapt to the evolving IT landscape, including the potential impact of AI on services.

The article also mentions the need for Wipro to quickly adapt to new market conditions and the strategic decisions that Pallia will have to make in order to ensure the company's success.

			<title>The persistence of unequal growth will be bad for India</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-persistence-of-unequal-growth-will-be-bad-for-india-11712588737515.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rising income and wealth inequality in India, as reported by the World Inequality Lab (WIL) in their recent publication titled "Income and Wealth Inequality in India 1922-2023: Rise of the Billionaire Raj." The report indicates that the top 1% of India's population receives nearly 23% of the national income and holds 40% of the wealth, marking the worst state of inequality in 100 years. The number of dollar-billionaires in India has risen to 271, with 94 added in 2023 alone.

The report, co-authored by Thomas Piketty, utilizes data from income-tax filings, which are considered more reliable than survey responses, though it acknowledges limitations due to the small fraction of the population that files returns. Inequality in India is not limited to income and wealth but extends to access to quality education, healthcare, basic amenities, and job opportunities. The unemployment report by the International Labour Organization and Institute for Human Development highlights the challenges of youth unemployment and wage stagnation.

The article presents two contrasting views on addressing inequality. One suggests focusing on high growth to generate revenue for redistribution policies, as exemplified by India's free-food scheme. The opposing view argues that the growth process exacerbates inequality, pointing to the disparity between India and China's economic growth and its impact on their populations.

The debate also touches on the Kuznets hypothesis, which posits that inequality initially increases with economic growth due to urbanization and industrialization but eventually decreases as development reaches a certain threshold. However, the evidence in India's case over the past three decades is mixed, with a 'winner takes all' dynamic leading to persistent inequality and limited social mobility.

The article concludes by suggesting that reducing inequality could potentially enhance growth in India, not just through welfare spending but also by investing in education and human capital development. It emphasizes the need for a growth process that promotes both economic expansion and social equity.</description>

			<title>If central banks are in thrall to gold’s glitter, why not others?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/if-central-banks-are-in-thrall-to-gold-s-glitter-why-not-others-11712577696613.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contrasting attention between gold and Bitcoin, particularly when both hit record highs. While Bitcoin's surge was widely covered in UK media, gold's rise was not, despite its long history as a valuable asset. The article notes that gold is seen as old money, with a history dating back to 550 BCE, and its physical form is now more likely to be found in museums than in circulation.

Investor interest in gold can be gauged by the flow into global gold ETFs, which saw outflows for nine months until the end of February, indicating a lack of interest. However, there are signs of a shift, with reduced outflows and small inflows into Asian ETFs.

Emerging-market savers and central banks have been significant buyers of gold, particularly since the start of the Ukraine war. They purchase physical gold as a long-term investment to hedge against political risk and to support their currencies, especially as the value of the US dollar and US government bonds becomes more uncertain.

Central banks are described as volume buyers and long-term holders of gold, suggesting a potential new era where strategic buyers could limit the supply and increase demand. If retail investors in the West, who currently have little exposure to gold, begin investing, the price of gold could continue to rise.

The article suggests that investing in gold ETFs and miners could be beneficial, as the sector's market capitalization is relatively low compared to its potential, and gold remains a reliable hedge against various risks. It concludes that if gold is a suitable hedge for central banks, it should be considered for personal portfolios as well. ©bloomberg</description>

			<description>The Congress party has faced setbacks in Himachal Pradesh with the defeat of its Rajya Sabha candidate and the resignation of a prominent member. However, the author argues that the party is still a force to be reckoned with.

Recalling past political history, the author notes that even the most powerful leaders have faced setbacks and that the Congress has shown resilience in the past. Despite its decline in vote share, the Congress remains a significant presence in several states and has a strong organizational structure.

Rahul Gandhi remains the most popular leader of the party, but the author argues that the party needs to address its weaknesses, such as its reliance on "old loyalists." The author suggests that the Congress should emulate the BJP's willingness to appoint younger and more dynamic leaders to key positions. The party may also need to consider forming flexible coalitions to remain politically relevant.</description>

			<description>Despite the notion that farming is "unremunerative," many other professions also face financial challenges. From entrepreneurship to entertainment, most individuals struggle for success. Even among salaried employees, few earn substantial incomes. Entrepreneurship carries inherent risk, as profits cannot be guaranteed due to competition. However, entrepreneurs who achieve success create an illusion of prosperity, motivating others to pursue similar paths that often lead to disappointment. The struggles of land-holding farmers, who are entrepreneurs seeking growth, stem from their high standards for remuneration. Moreover, some professions can become more lucrative through the creation of superstars, such as in entertainment and sports.</description>

			<title>India’s consumption numbers fit into our big picture of progress</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-consumption-numbers-fit-into-our-big-picture-of-progress-11709483131073.html</link>
			<description>The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23 reveals promising trends in India's economic growth. Over the past decade, monthly per capita expenditure increased significantly, with a 40% rise in rural areas and 33.5% in urban areas. Notably, the rural-urban divide has narrowed, dropping from an 83.9% gap in 2011-12 to 71.2% in 2022-23.

The survey also indicates a decline in economic inequality, with the bottom 5% of the population experiencing faster consumption growth (9.2% rural and 10% urban) than the top 5% (8% rural and 6.6% urban). This inclusive growth is further evidenced by rising MPCE/GNI ratios for lower-income groups.

The HCES attributes these positive developments to investments in infrastructure and empowerment programs, such as rural road expansion, women's collectives, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The survey highlights the impact of government-provided free-of-cost items, underscoring the improvement in living standards beyond what consumption data suggests.

While the survey provides valuable insights, the authors note that future iterations could enhance coverage of government support and update consumer baskets and poverty lines in line with evolving aspirations. Overall, the HCES 2022-23 results support the government's approach of growth through infrastructure and inclusion through empowerment.</description>

			<description>Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks, has finally relinquished his grip on the company with the announcement of collective bargaining agreement discussions between the company and employee unions. Schultz's previous opposition to unions, compounded by labor law violations allegations during his tenure, led to sharp criticism. Despite Starbucks' progressive values, Schultz's anti-union stance alienated a younger generation prioritizing ethical consumption. Current CEO Laxman Narasimhan faces financial pressures and the risk of losing Gen-Z customers due to the union dispute. These factors suggest that Schultz's era at Starbucks is truly over, and the company is embracing a more progressive stance on labor relations.</description>

			<title>Revitalizing India's cotton saga: A blueprint for growth</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/first-person/revitalizing-indias-cotton-saga-a-blueprint-for-growth-11709371029223.html</link>
			<description>India, the world's second-largest cotton producer, faces dwindling cotton yields due to pest resistance and unpredictable weather patterns. The decline in yield has prompted farmers to switch to other crops, threatening India's cotton production and self-sufficiency.

Revitalizing Bt Cotton: The initial success of genetically modified Bt cotton, designed to resist bollworms, has led to over-reliance. This dependency has resulted in stagnant and declining yields. To address this, the development and deployment of new Bt cotton varieties and more effective pesticides and insecticides is crucial.

Precision Agriculture: Cotton is water-intensive. Adopting precision agriculture techniques like drip irrigation can reduce water and fertilizer consumption while increasing yields. Targeted delivery of nutrients through precision agriculture is also seen as critical for yield improvement.

Embracing Digitization: Digitization holds immense potential for transforming cotton farming. Drones can scan large areas for pest infestations, while satellites can monitor weather patterns and provide farmers with essential information. AI and IoT can assist farmers in making informed decisions on crop protection and nutritional interventions.

Tried and Tested Practices: Pairing new technologies with tried and tested agricultural practices is essential. Weed infestation significantly affects yields. Implementing early-stage weed management, crop rotation, compost application, and green manuring can help minimize weed impact and support soil health.

Collective Action: Revitalizing India's cotton sector requires collective action, collaboration, and a shared commitment among stakeholders, including agricultural scientists, regulatory bodies, and the agrochemical industry. Technological advancements and sustainable farming practices are key to restoring India's position as a leading cotton producer and ensuring self-sufficiency.</description>

			<title>How Isro’s ‘naughty boy’ cryogenic engine became a ‘smart boy’</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/how-isro-s-naughty-boy-cryogenic-engine-became-a-smart-boy-11709355686013.html</link>
			<description>On March 30th, NASA and ISRO will launch the NISAR satellite to gather data on Earth's ecosystems, ice masses, and sea level rise. The launch will utilize ISRO's GSLVF14 rocket, now nicknamed the "smart boy" after its successful launch.

The GSLVF14's cryogenic engine was developed by ISRO after US sanctions prevented technology transfers. Despite initial failures, the engine has been perfected and will significantly enhance India's aerospace industry. Its higher thrust-to-weight ratio allows for heavier payloads, paving the way for future Moon, Mars, and space station missions.

Cryogenic engines also play a role in the global satellite market and in military applications. India's mastery of this technology positions it as a major player in the aerospace sector and provides strategic comfort in a tense geopolitical climate.</description>

			<title>DreamFolks: Is the upswing in air travel the wind beneath its wings?</title>

			<description>DreamFolks, a key player in India's airport lounge market with a 75% share, has seen significant growth due to increasing air travel and consumer spending. The company's net profit soared 4.5 times in FY23, with revenue jumping 2.7 times.

Driven by rising domestic flights, digital payment adoption, and lounge demand, DreamFolks anticipates strong growth. Industry analysts predict a 15-fold increase in lounge visitors by 2030, with the Indian lounge market growing exponentially.

DreamFolks has launched an exclusive membership program offering premium travel and lifestyle services. The company's acquisition of Golfklik expands its premium offerings. Motilal Oswal initiates coverage with a "buy" rating and a target price of ₹650, citing the under-penetrated airline industry and DreamFolks' asset-light model.

The company's international expansion and partnerships with operators in Singapore and Russia provide growth potential. The brokerage expects the increasing adoption of bank cards to further benefit DreamFolks, as India has a low credit card penetration rate.</description>

			<title>How to master the art of delegation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/how-to-master-the-art-of-delegation-11709279744423.html</link>
			<description>Delegation is crucial for effective management but can be challenging. Some managers avoid it due to mistrust, control issues, or previous startup experience. Others delegate for negative reasons like making difficult decisions or avoiding blame. Studies show that people tend to delegate when tasks are complex, affect others, or involve risk. To delegate effectively, establish a decision-making framework to clarify responsibilities. Distinguish between irreversible "type-1" and reversible "type-2" decisions. Allow subordinates some autonomy and avoid micromanaging, while maintaining involvement and decision-making authority when necessary. Like building abdominal muscles, delegation requires judgment, balance, and discipline.</description>

			<title>The Supreme Court order on hospital charges isn’t good for anyone</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-supreme-order-on-hospital-charges-isn-t-good-for-anyone-11709276226217.html</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court criticized the government for failing to enforce price controls for private hospitals, citing a 2010 law and 2012 rules that went unenforced. The court ordered a meeting between the union health secretary and state counterparts within a month to establish standard rates, using the Central Government Health Services scheme as an example.

The editorial criticizes the order as harmful to healthcare companies without benefiting citizens. It argues that India's healthcare system lacks a regulator to address price gouging and mistreatment. Instead of price controls, the editorial advocates for competition and effective enforcement of existing rules. The article also highlights the low effective tax rate for hospitals, with many claiming charitable status to avoid paying taxes.</description>

			<description>Motion pictures, unlike cars, became widely popular in India due to their low cost of reaching a mass audience. Reliance and Disney have partnered in a joint venture (JV) to dominate the Indian entertainment market. The JV combines popular TV channels (Viacom and Star TV) with online platforms (Hotstar and JioCinema), giving them significant market share. Synergies with Reliance's retail and telecom presence are expected. The JV's success evokes a nostalgic connection to silent cinema's appeal and Disney's early animation, both of which relied on simplified storytelling and exaggerated movements.</description>

			<title>There’s also a positive side of GenAI that can strengthen democracy</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/theres-also-a-positive-side-of-genai-that-can-strengthen-democracy-11709219220730.html</link>
			<description>As AI's ethical concerns emerge, 2024 promises a test of its impact on democracy. While deepfakes threaten to manipulate elections through misinformation, they have also been used strategically, as in Pakistan, where GenAI helped a jailed ex-prime minister's party win.

AI offers potential benefits for elections:

* **Transparency and Fraud Detection:** AI can monitor election data for irregularities and identify patterns of fraudulent activity.
* **Security Enhancement:** AI algorithms can improve the security of electronic voting systems and detect potential cyber threats.
* **Personalized Voter Education:** Generative AI can create customized content on candidates and issues, empowering marginalized groups.
* **Accessibility for Disabled Voters:** AI-powered systems can assist voters with disabilities in casting their votes.
* **Social Media Analysis:** AI can analyze social media information to gauge public opinion and ensure diverse representation in political discussions.
* **Logistics Optimization:** AI can streamline voter registration and verification, reducing queues and saving costs.

While acknowledging the risks of deepfakes, the article highlights that AI can also enhance democracy by improving transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency.</description>

			<title>India-EU trade mustn’t stumble on digital sovereignty</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indiaeu-trade-mustn-t-stumble-on-digital-sovereignty-11709219303430.html</link>
			<description>The EU's recent digital policy initiatives, including the Digital Services Act (DSA) and a white-paper on infrastructure, aim to increase digital sovereignty and regulatory control. However, these initiatives conflict with the EU's goal of accelerating digital trade, particularly with India, as they impose complex compliance obligations for Indian internet companies.

The EU's strict regulatory approach, guided by legal sovereignty, limits exceptions for FTAs and creates uncertainty for trade. Additionally, the EU's ex-ante regulation approach for digital markets, echoed in India's plans, complicates negotiations due to different forecasts of future risks.

Despite these challenges, both the EU and India acknowledge the potential of digital technology for economic growth. India can leverage its software and services capabilities to support Europe's digital transformation, while Europe must find ways to reduce its reliance on foreign digital infrastructure.

To foster collaboration, India should focus on innovation-friendly regulations and advocate for liberalization of EU digital markets. The EU, in turn, should collaborate with India to decrease its dependence on foreign technology. Both parties need flexible policy strategies to remain relevant in the evolving digital landscape.</description>

			<title>State-level rumbles in the Indian federation: Can the 16th FC help?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/statelevel-rumbles-in-the-indian-federation-can-the-16th-fc-help-11709207501212.html</link>
			<description>Amidst farmer unrest, there is concern about unfair fiscal treatment of states by the Union government. States receive a percentage of gross taxes collected by the Centre, as prescribed by Finance Commissions every five years. However, states allege that Central cesses and surcharges, which are excluded from the shareable revenue base, are used to reduce their statutory payments.

In 2022-23, states received 31.1% of the reported gross tax revenue, significantly below the adjusted target of 40.8%. This shortfall is attributed to the exclusion of cesses. Including statutory grants and non-statutory flows, states received a total of 57.8% of gross Central tax revenue (excluding GST cess).

The dissatisfaction arises from the statutory tax share being 8.3% below the target. The upcoming 16th Finance Commission is encouraged to incentivize the Centre to merge cesses into the basic tax structure in exchange for a lower aggregate share for states. The lesson is that the states' effective tax share can languish near its pre-ramp-up level if cesses and surcharges are excluded from the shareable revenue base.</description>

			<description>Google is facing accusations of biased AI due to its new chatbot Gemini generating images with excessive diversity, including non-Caucasian historical figures. This highlights the company's prioritization of growth over ethical considerations, as it has previously faced criticism for its photo-tagging tool labeling African-American individuals as apes. Google's focus on speed and market dominance has led to the release of faulty AI tools like Bard, despite warnings from employees. While Google claims responsible AI is a priority, its investment in AI ethics teams has been minimal, with safety testers significantly outnumbered by developers. Google's CEO advocates for regulation but acknowledges the lack of food inspectors in the AI industry. This allows the company to continue releasing problematic AI systems without immediate consequences, highlighting the need for a shift towards prioritizing safety and fairness.</description>

			<description>War is complex and often difficult to understand, especially for those not directly involved. The ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East highlight this challenge.

Europe struggles to respond to Russian aggression against Ukraine, with no consensus on sending troops and concerns about rising costs. Despite US military aid, Putin aims to outlast Western support.

The conflict in the Middle East continues, with Israel facing pressure to avoid escalating violence in Gaza. Both Ukraine and Israel rely on external support, but waning international support and challenges in formulating coherent strategies make achieving their goals difficult. The article emphasizes the need for Indian policymakers to learn from these conflicts and prepare for such challenges.</description>

			<title>The finite that hints at the infinite</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-finite-that-hints-at-the-infinite-11709201135481.html</link>
			<description>Visiting his college campus after many years, the author reflects on the passage of time and the difficulty in quantifying certain aspects of the campus and life in general. While some things, like student enrollment, can be easily counted, others, such as the number of trees, leaves, or bubbles in a cup of coffee, are much more challenging. Despite the apparent finiteness of these quantities, the act of counting them can be infinite due to the constant addition of new elements. The author suggests that this endlessness leads to the concept of "infinity" being applicable to seemingly finite numbers, such as grains of sand, stars, or cells in the body.</description>

			<description>Reliance Industries and Walt Disney have merged their Indian TV and streaming businesses, creating an $8.5 billion joint venture that gives Reliance a 63.16% stake and Disney a 36.84% stake. The venture, valued at $8.5 billion, combines Viacom18's and Star India's assets, making it the largest media empire in India, capturing 40% of the market. The merger is expected to strengthen Disney's position in India's streaming market and provide access to over 750 million viewers. While the merger is likely to attract advertisers initially, concerns remain about its potential impact on consumer welfare. The Competition Commission of India will review the merger, raising questions about whether it may lead to reduced competition, higher costs, or potential data exploitation.</description>

			<description>The BJP won 10 out of 15 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka. Notably, six Congress and three independent legislators in Himachal voted for the BJP's Harsh Mahajan, leading to a tie with Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi. A draw of lots resulted in Mahajan's victory. This raises questions about the Congress government's majority in Shimla. The BJP's total strength in Rajya Sabha will increase to 117, potentially giving it a majority (121) and strengthening its legislative hold and policy agenda.</description>

			<title>Fakeness and flakiness are not hard to spot in the social sector</title>

			<description>The author criticizes the use of the term "partner" for NGOs receiving funding, arguing that it misrepresents the relationship as equal. They observe that donors often profess virtues like treating grantees as equals but may act differently, a form of "fakeness" in the social sector.

The author introduces a "fake-flake" matrix to categorize organizations:

* **Fake-fake:** Intellectual and relational fakeness, without operational or ethical rigor
* **Authentic-flake:** Intellectual and relational authenticity, but operational and ethical flakiness
* **Fake-rigorous:** Intellectual and operational rigor, but relational and ethical fakeness
* **Authentic-rigorous:** Intellectual, operational, relational, and ethical authenticity and rigor

The author believes that "fake-flakes" are easily noticed, while "fake-rigorous" are subtle and insidious, but that "authentic-rigorous" organizations are effective and common. They acknowledge that some degree of fakeness and flakiness is inevitable but emphasize the importance of authenticity and rigor in the social sector.</description>

			<title>Sri Lanka may be back on the tourism map but its recovery is fragile</title>

			<description>Sri Lanka's Colombo airport is experiencing a surge in tourism, contributing significantly to the economy. The country's dependence on tourism, alongside textiles and tea, is highlighted as an example of oceanic countries' reliance on the industry.

However, Sri Lanka's economic recovery faces challenges. Despite currency devaluation, Western buyers prefer countries like Bangladesh for garment production due to efficient supply chains. The withdrawal of visa extensions for Russians and Ukrainians has raised concerns, but may be rescinded.

While there are positive indicators such as GDP growth and lower inflation, concerns remain about backsliding, arbitrary decision-making, and interest payment costs. Increased borrowing worsens the situation.

Sri Lanka faces difficulties in negotiating with private Western creditors and addressing allegations of corruption in Chinese-funded projects. The government must balance selling off public assets and cutting spending with the upcoming election. If it fails to do so, it may increase taxes, leading to comparisons with colonial-era taxation.</description>

			<title>Revaluation call: Don’t write off businesses challenged by sunrise rivalry</title>

			<description>Despite the perception that certain sectors (newspapers, thermal power, combustion engines) are dying out, they remain prevalent in reality. Investors overly focus on the potential decline of these sectors, leading to undervalued stocks.

Using a "zero-terminal-value discounted cash flow analysis" can help assess these undervalued stocks, assuming the company will eventually cease operations. However, this approach ignores potential upside scenarios, such as demand revival.

Factors contributing to the resurgence of undervalued stocks include tempered excitement for new technologies, strategic shifts by incumbent companies, and increased cash returns to shareholders. As interest rates rise, the value of steady cash flows increases.

Unexpected demand revivals can lead to significant price increases for incumbents in these sectors. Investors should consider evaluating these "forgotten stars" for potential value, recognizing that market perceptions can be overblown.</description>

			<title>The EU is planning clear emission-capture norms for its carbon market</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-eu-is-planning-clear-emission-capture-norms-for-its-carbon-market-11709122921660.html</link>
			<description>The European Union (EU) is establishing a Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) and Green Claims Directive to regulate the carbon market.

The CRCF defines "carbon removal" as capturing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere. The Green Claims Directive requires companies to obtain approval for green marketing claims, which must include certified carbon removal offsets.

Companies can only claim to offset emissions that cannot be reduced further. Carbon credits must be certified under the CRCF, which excludes fossil-fuel emissions and temporary removals like tree planting.

The regulations set standards for certifying carbon removal credits, creating trust and distinguishing them from existing poor-quality products. Companies can still purchase non-certified credits, but they cannot make environmental claims associated with them.

Despite potential limitations, the regulations aim to prevent greenwashing and establish clear standards for carbon removal and offsetting.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Modi has emphasized reducing government interference in citizens' lives, particularly for the middle class. He aims to create a society with minimal state intervention, offering support only to the poor for basic needs. This reflects Rajiv Gandhi's concerns about welfare leakages. Specific areas of reform include streamlining taxation, reducing harassment of taxpayers, simplifying compliance protocols for retirement funds, and improving the efficiency of online sarkari interfaces. Additionally, Modi advocates protecting privacy by preventing government overreach into personal lives and limiting the misuse of laws like sedition to stifle dissent.</description>

			<title>Indian households are investing more in stocks than it may seem</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indian-households-are-investing-more-in-stocks-than-it-may-seem-11709046613931.html</link>
			<description>Nilesh Shah's tweet suggests that Indian households invest little in stocks. However, this is an incomplete analysis.

From 2020 to 2023, 94% of household savings went to fixed-income investments like fixed deposits and life insurance, while only 6% went to mutual funds (MFs) and stocks.

However, some insurance premiums and EPFO contributions are invested in stocks indirectly, indicating that households invest more in stocks than the data suggests.

Despite this, the majority of household savings still go to low-risk fixed-income investments. Factors such as risk aversion, tax benefits of insurance, and effective MF advertising have contributed to this trend.

However, the share of household savings held in MFs has increased significantly in recent years, indicating a gradual shift towards equity investments.</description>

			<title>India’s household consumption survey captures predictable changes</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-household-consumption-survey-captures-predictable-changes-11709046735551.html</link>
			<description>A fact sheet highlighting the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23 was released. This survey covered approximately 100,000 urban and 150,000 rural households, indicating that the urban population comprises two-fifths of the total. The data demonstrates a transition in consumption patterns, moving from cereals to non-cereals, carbohydrates to proteins, home-cooked meals to packaged food, and food to non-food items. However, the consumption spending growth pace in urban India is higher than in rural areas, leading to a divergence in spending and partly explaining the north-south divide. The survey also reveals a slowdown in consumption spending across surveys conducted from 2004-05 to 2022-23, raising questions about the alignment of consumption spending with national income growth. This comprehensive data is vital for assessing household well-being, establishing poverty measures, and updating the consumption basket used to calculate the Consumer Price Index, which plays a crucial role in guiding monetary policy.</description>

			<description>- Researchers used AI to predict when people would die with 78% accuracy using data on thousands of people in Denmark, but the results were misrepresented and AI cannot predict the exact day of death.

- AI-based systems could have both positive and negative impacts, such as improving lifespan calculations or being used for discrimination.

- The AI technology has limitations: it cannot predict freak accidents or deaths far in advance since predicting the future becomes increasingly difficult the further ahead you go.

- There's a risk of humans trusting AI's predictions blindly due to authority bias, and AI can be influenced by bad studies and flawed data.

- The article emphasizes that our actions can change the future, and these forecasts do not seal our fate as certain events are still subject to change based on our choices.

- Income and job type can affect life expectancy, a correlation recognized even before AI.</description>

			<title>A wake-up call for banks, regulators and you</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/a-wake-up-call-for-banks-regulators-and-you-11709035223447.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the issue of lack of trust in bank relationship managers (RMs) among customers. A poll conducted by the author on Twitter revealed that a majority of respondents do not trust their bank RMs. The author attributes this to the banks' aggressive push to sell unwanted financial products to customers, often driven by misaligned incentives. The author calls for banks to invest in building a solid wealth management franchise that delivers on its promises to customers. The author also suggests that regulators, particularly the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), take action to curb mis-selling and align incentives. Lastly, the author advises customers to take responsibility for their investments, conduct their own research, and seek advice from independent financial advisors if needed.</description>

			<title>India’s consumption survey: A significant shift amid modest gains</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-consumption-survey-a-significant-shift-amid-modest-gains-11708958351847.html</link>
			<description>The latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) shows a moderate improvement in Indian consumption patterns over the past decade. Rural Indian households have reduced food expenditure (from 53% to 46.4%) and increased spending on non-food items. While average monthly per capita expenditure has risen in both rural and urban areas, the increase is modest. The survey also indicates a shift towards healthier diets, with increased spending on dairy, eggs, and fresh fruits. The methodology for this HCES round has been revised, but the exact changes are unclear. The survey results could become a political tool during upcoming elections, but they do not provide significant evidence of widespread prosperity or hardship.</description>

			<title>India’s development landscape has undergone a structural shift</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-development-landscape-has-undergone-a-structural-shift-11708958398028.html</link>
			<description>After an 11-year wait, India has released a Fact Sheet regarding the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23. According to the World Bank's extreme poverty line, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty in India has significantly decreased from 12.2% in 2011-12 to only 2% now. This means that extreme poverty has almost been eliminated in India. Using a higher poverty line of PPP $3.2, the poverty rate reduced from 53.6% in 2011-12 to 21% in 2022-23. Additionally, inequality has declined in both rural and urban areas, with rural Gini coefficient dropping from 28.7 to 27.0 and urban Gini coefficient falling from 36.7 to 31.9. This remarkable pro-poor development is attributed to strong growth and reduced inequality under the growth policies of the Narendra Modi government.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently announced the outcome of its policy review, and it has decided to keep its key rates steady. The RBI's stance remains focused on controlling inflation, with expectations of a repo rate cut in the next fiscal year. Despite a decrease in average inflation, the RBI wants to ensure price stability and complete transmission of its past actions. The central bank is cautious due to uncertainties in food prices and external geopolitical factors. While the economy is performing well, the RBI will continue to use various tools to manage liquidity. Overall, the RBI aims to achieve low and stable inflation before making any changes.</description>

			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that the Finance Minister made claims about the performance of the incumbent government in terms of poverty reduction and per capita income increase. However, the article questions the realism of these claims. It mentions that the claim of poverty reduction is based on extrapolated estimates using the Multi-Dimensional Poverty measure, but the conventional measure of poverty based on consumption expenditure is not available after 2011-12. As for per capita income, while it has increased by more than 50% over the past decade, there is a trend of deceleration in recent years. The article also discusses the income earned by workers, with moderate increases in rural areas but negligible rises in urban areas. It highlights a decline in real wages for regular workers and a decline in rural wages, which is the longest spell of declining wages since independence. The article also mentions a decline in cultivation income for farmers. Overall, the article suggests a decline or deceleration in the income earned by working Indians in the last five years.</description>

			<title>Ayodhya on screens: A B-school case study in marketing?</title>

			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding live screenings of the Ram temple consecration in Ayodhya in Tamil Nadu, India. Despite reports of cancellations, there is high demand for big-screen telecasts across the country. PVR Inox, a major multiplex company, partnered with a news channel to screen the event in over 160 theaters across 70 cities. Tickets were priced at a flat rate of ₹100 and included a popcorn-beverage combo, leading to sell-outs in many cities. The unique selling proposition of this event is the bundled refreshments, which not only attract cinema-goers but also generate goodwill for the PVR Inox brand. The successful screenings in Ayodhya could potentially be studied as a case in business schools.</description>

			<title>Chip-maker Taiwan’s electorate has rebuffed Beijing</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chipmaker-taiwan-s-electorate-has-rebuffed-beijing-11705330507318.html</link>
			<description>Taiwan's recent presidential election resulted in Vice President Lai Ching-te being elected as the island's president, marking the third consecutive win for the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). However, the DPP lost its narrow legislative majority, limiting Lai's ability to push for Taiwan's independence from mainland China. Taiwan plays a crucial role in global technological leadership, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing. The country is home to over 60% of the world's semiconductor manufacturing and makes over 90% of the most advanced chips. Taiwan's electronics industry also extends beyond semiconductors, with Taiwanese-owned companies in China producing and exporting high-end components. Taiwan's history includes Japanese rule and subsequent control by the KMT (KuoMinTang) party, which led to an uprising and brutal suppression by the KMT in 1947. The KMT later established a dictatorship but focused on developing the economy, especially in electronics and technology. Democratization began in the late 1980s, leading to tensions with Beijing, including missile firings by China during Taiwan's first free presidential election in 1996. The KMT and DPP have different views on Taiwan's status, with the KMT agreeing with China's "One China" policy, while the DPP sees Taiwan as separate from China. In the recent election, all three candidates were native-Taiwanese, reflecting the DPP's identity politics. A stable Taiwan Strait would benefit countries like India, as Taiwanese</description>

			<title>Combating fake news: Staying away from Google can be a solution</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/combating-fake-news-staying-away-from-google-can-be-a-solution-11705326180610.html</link>
			<description>A recent study published in Nature suggests that people are more likely to be fooled by fake news stories after conducting an internet search. The study found that searching for information often leads people to more bad information, creating a spiral effect. Participants in the study, who predominantly used Google, showed an increase in classifying fake news as fact after conducting online research. The study also revealed that people tend to trust search engines more than mainstream media. Additionally, the study found that certain search methods and approaches, such as relying on specific phrases or trusting certain sources, can contribute to misinformation. Fact checkers, who diligently check the credibility of sources and scan search results before selecting what to read, have an advantage in identifying accurate information. However, even fact checkers do not always agree on the credibility of certain stories. This study serves as a reminder that accessing the truth through a simple online search is not always reliable.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/why-are-we-staring-at-a-global-debt-problem-yet-again-11705326246084.html</link>
			<description>Global public debt reached historical highs in 2023, posing a risk to the world economy's growth. The US and China have public debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 120% of GDP. Debt has become a constraint for governments unable to meet essential payments, and many low-income and emerging market countries are at high risk of debt distress. The IMF believes the risk of a systemic wave of debt defaults is low, but the outlook is grim. The lack of effective debt resolution instruments and transparency around debt contribute to the problem. A global debt reporting system and improved fiscal data are needed to address these issues.</description>

It highlights the historical and cultural reasons for this phenomenon and suggests that communal dining can help build a sense of community and bridge divides. The author proposes various ways to promote communal dining, such as common canteens in educational institutions and workplaces, street food stalls with shared seating areas, and special feasts on national holidays. The article concludes by suggesting that restaurant owners can contribute to this cause by installing big round tables.</description>

			<title>India could be the third-largest economy soon, but what about GDP per head?</title>

			<description>India's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, predicts that India will become the third largest economy by FY28, which is supported by the International Monetary Fund's view. However, this alone will not significantly improve the average Indian's quality of life. To raise GDP per capita, India needs to achieve double-digit growth for a decade or more, as its current GDP per capita is much lower compared to larger economies and middle-income countries. While India has the potential for fast growth as a low-income country, sustained high growth is necessary to raise incomes like China did during its high-growth years.</description>

			<description>The World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos offers an opportunity for leaders to reflect on the past year and discuss challenges and opportunities. India is participating with a focus on rebuilding trust and showcasing its growth and development narrative. The country achieved a strong 7.7% growth in the first half of 2023-24 and aims to achieve 7% GDP growth in 2024-25. India's global engagement has increased, with exports reaching $776 billion in 2022-23. Reforms such as GST and the 'Make in India' campaign have improved business operations and attracted foreign investment. India can play a critical role in the WEF's priorities, including security, growth, artificial intelligence, and climate action. The country's efforts in AI governance, job creation, and energy transformation will be highlighted. India's presence at Davos aims to showcase its economic growth, reform agenda, and industry resurgence.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/henley-passport-index-upward-mobility-11704988569625.html</link>
			<description>The Henley Passport Index has released this year's scores, which measure travel freedom. Singapore and Japan have consistently had powerful passports, but now France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have joined them at the top. South Korea, Sweden, and Finland are ranked second. India's passport has improved by four spots, now at No. 80 with 62 visa-free destinations. The UAE has seen the most significant improvement, adding 106 places to its tally since 2014. Although travel freedom has generally increased, the gap between countries remains wide. The article suggests that India's economic growth may lead to more opportunities for Indian travelers.</description>

			<title>Develop Lakshadweep but only for eco-friendly tourism</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/develop-lakshadweep-but-only-for-eco-friendly-tourism-11704988367255.html</link>
			<description>Maldivian ministers' comments against India caused a diplomatic dispute and led to their removal from power in the Maldives. This incident sparked interest in developing Lakshadweep, a Union territory near Kerala, as an alternative tourist destination. While Lakshadweep and the Maldives share similar appeal as holiday destinations, replicating the high-end resort model on a smaller scale may be challenging. Nevertheless, there is a push for tourism development in Lakshadweep, with plans for a new airport and potential interest from corporations to set up five-star resorts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit further fueled anticipation for tourism growth. However, due to limitations in terms of size and infrastructure, Lakshadweep can likely cater only to affluent travelers. It is crucial to prioritize eco-friendly development from the beginning to protect the islands' natural treasures and appeal to the rising eco-consciousness in the world. Lessons should be learned from the Maldives, where increasing tourist arrivals led to waste disposal challenges and environmental degradation. Sustainability surveys and strict adherence to regulations are necessary to prevent similar issues in Lakshadweep. Limiting construction and controlling visitor numbers, while taxing affluent tourists to cover extra expenses, can help maintain the islands' integrity.</description>

			<title>Should India worry about retail loans growing furiously?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/should-india-worry-about-retail-loans-growing-furiously-11704899420224.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. The article discusses a consumer offer that challenges the concept of present-value of money. It explains how opting for a no-cost six-month equated monthly installment (EMI) plan for purchasing a refrigerator can result in a discount, while making the full payment instantly does not offer the same discount. The article suggests that this discount is funded by the appliance manufacturer and the lender providing the EMI option. The lender benefits from customers who delay payments and can charge higher interest rates, which subsidizes customers who pay on time. The article also mentions the increase in household debt-to-GDP ratio in India and the implications of borrowing from future earnings to consume goods and services today. It highlights the importance of strong income growth for this trend to continue and raises concerns about the end use of personal loans and potential asset quality problems for lenders. The article concludes by mentioning the efforts of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to address risks in unsecured consumer lending.</description>

			<title>Why nutrition, not hunger alleviation, needs to be India’s primary focus</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/why-nutrition-not-hunger-alleviation-needs-to-be-india-s-primary-focus-11704794538570.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the Indian government's efforts to eliminate hunger and improve nutrition in the country. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) scheme, which provides free foodgrains to the poor, has been extended for another five years. The government will spend ₹11.8 lakh crore to provide 5 kg of free foodgrains every month to approximately 810 million people. Despite these efforts, the article highlights that India still faces challenges in achieving a nutritious diet for its population. The Poshan Abhiyan scheme, aimed at eradicating malnutrition, has not met its objectives. The article emphasizes the need to focus on balancing the diet and improving the quality of intake, including higher protein consumption, particularly among children and women. This can have positive outcomes in terms of better learning outcomes, work quality, and productivity.</description>

			<title>Bank retail credit at  ₹50 trillion is not an economic achievement</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bank-retail-credit-at-50-trillion-is-not-an-economic-achievement-11704813407985.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that retail lending by banks in India has crossed ₹50 trillion for the first time. Retail lending includes housing and vehicle loans, credit card receivables, loans against gold jewelry, and personal loans. Retail lending now constitutes around 32.5% of the non-food credit given by banks. This shift towards retail lending has been influenced by factors such as the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, the default on loans by corporates, and the cleaning up of balance sheets by banks. It is worth noting that the growth in retail lending has led to a decrease in household financial savings and a contraction in lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises.</description>

			<title>Mutual funds have held strong</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mutual-funds-have-held-strong-11704730545944.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the increasing participation of retail investors in the Indian markets, despite concerns from big investors due to high valuations. In December, investments through systematic investment plans (SIPs) reached ₹17,610 crore, surpassing the previous month's ₹17,073 crore. The total assets under management of India's mutual fund industry also surpassed ₹50 trillion, with the last ₹10 trillion added in just over a year compared to several decades for the first ₹10 trillion.

The rising involvement of retail investors contributes to the depth of India's financial markets and provides a buffer against volatile foreign inflows. However, the true test for these investors will be their response during a significant market downturn, as the stock indices have been consistently rising for a long time.

Although the country's economic fundamentals are strong, stretched valuations in certain areas could lead to profit-taking. Additionally, there is a surge in foreign investors buying Indian shares, possibly due to expectations of a pre-budget or pre-election rally, which could also involve speculation.</description>

			<title>UPI versus e-rupee?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/upi-versus-erupee-11704382980214.html</link>
			<description>India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has seen significant growth, with 118 billion transactions worth ₹182 trillion in 2023, marking a 60% increase in volume and a 44% increase in value compared to the previous year. The UPI's popularity can be attributed to its outreach, as more people across the country are adopting it for small payments. The rise in usage is also due to improved telecom connectivity, particularly in remote areas, where the benefits of the JAM trinity (Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar identity numbers, and mobile phones) are evident. The success of the UPI raises questions about its impact on India's e-rupee project, which requires further debate.</description>

			<title>Harvard's top-level exit: Politics has trumped academic principle</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/harvards-top-level-exit-politics-has-trumped-academic-principle-11704382107289.html</link>
			<description>Professor Claudine Gay has resigned as president of Harvard University amid controversy over her alleged plagiarism and her response to a question about calling for the genocide of Jews on campus. While Harvard's board supported her, her departure was met with right-wing criticism of "diversity gone wrong" at Ivy League institutions. Gay's statement emphasized her commitment to confronting hate while preserving free expression. The article contrasts her resignation with a past controversy involving former Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who faced protests over his comments on women in math and science disciplines. The article suggests that Gay's departure is a loss for academic freedom and highlights the importance of open dialogue in higher education.</description>

			<title>Elite American universities are mostly overrated</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/elite-american-universities-are-mostly-overrated-11704369997830.html</link>
			<description>The article criticizes Harvard University for lacking academic standards and moral clarity, which has brought unwanted attention to the institution. It argues that top universities in America, including Harvard, have taken on an unhealthy role in society and the economy. These universities have formed an oligopoly with outsized power by using their reputation for excellence to signal their students' intelligence and connections. The article discusses the concept of signaling in economic transactions and how attending an elite school has become a valuable signal for employers, despite its imperfections. This pressure to attend elite universities has led to anxiety among students and their parents. Moreover, the concentration of market power in these universities has resulted in less innovation and more waste. The article suggests that the focus should be on academic excellence, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and calls for a breakup of the oligopoly in elite higher education. It concludes that the current system of elite education in the US needs to be diminished in importance and employers should consider graduates from other impressive universities for a better and more diverse staff.</description>

			<title>Climate action: India Inc needs a clear road map for our green transition</title>

			<description>India's aggressive push for renewable power has made renewable electricity costs competitive with grid power. However, round-the-clock power still needs to be made competitive. A differential market approach can benefit high-paying customers like industry and the commercial sector, while demand-response programs can help deal with the intermittency of renewable power. The government's aggressive targets are also helping mature electricity markets and build capacities in related institutions. India's early action on green hydrogen and electric vehicles shows promise, but there are challenges to address, such as charging infrastructure and safety. Clarity is needed on India's evolving economic structure and the obligations of energy-consuming sectors. Responsible tourism and a sectoral approach to decarbonization are important. Long-term goal clarity is crucial for supply chains and skilled manpower adjustments. Overall, industry needs to act together to mitigate responsibly and adapt inclusively.</description>

			<title>We must bust myths around the social service sector</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-must-bust-myths-around-the-social-service-sector-11704295826227.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses three pervasive myths in the social sector that hinder its effectiveness. The first myth is about sustainability, believing that once changes are made, they will be self-sustaining without external support. However, continuous nurturing and energy are needed to counter opposing forces. The second myth is about scale, assuming that human relationships and social ties can be easily scaled up. The article argues that the uniqueness of context and the human element make scalability unrealistic. The third myth is about system change, with many claiming to work for systemic change without fully understanding the complexity of the systems they contribute to. Lastly, the article challenges the myth that civil society organizations (CSOs) are inherently corrupt and ineffective, stating that they are no different from other enterprises in society. The responsibility lies with philanthropists, donors, academics, and policymakers to debunk these myths and face reality for a better society.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court verdict on the Adani Group's alleged capital-market rule violations has brought relief and triumph to the conglomerate. The court rejected demands for an independent probe and found no merit in conflict-of-interest charges against the expert panel tasked with checking the regulatory set-up. The Securities and Exchange Board of India's ongoing investigation ordered by the court will continue. The court also directed the SEBI to conclude its probe within three months. The Adani Group's shares saw a sharp recovery and its market value reached ₹15 trillion. While no direct evidence of wrongdoing has been found, the episode highlights the need to address regulatory gaps in capital markets to prevent rule-skirting scandals.</description>

			<title>India's factory orders have slowed a bit</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/indias-factory-orders-have-slowed-a-bit-11704296069260.html</link>
			<description>India's manufacturing sector experienced a decline in its purchasing managers' index (PMI) at the end of 2023, reaching an 18-month low of 54.9, down from 56 in November. Although still within the expansion zone, new order growth, particularly from export markets, has slowed. Domestic demand becomes crucial as external orders are expected to remain weak. However, the PMI reading suggests that Indian factories are still maintaining a level of expansion and are likely to continue operating at capacity, leading to potential investments by the private sector. While some foreign industrial players may consider dumping excess output in other markets, it should not be confused with legitimate competition based on true competitiveness.</description>

			<title>Trade policy: India must reverse its tariff barrier uptrend</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/trade-policy-india-must-reverse-its-tariff-barrier-uptrend-11704204996971.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the decline in popularity of free trade globally, the ineffectiveness of the World Trade Organization, and the geopolitical split in globalization. It focuses on India's trade policies, particularly its rejection of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the negative impact of its free trade agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN, South Korea, and Japan. The report highlights the significant trade deficits India experienced with these partners, attributing it to asymmetry in tariff reductions. The article suggests that lower tariffs and increased competitiveness may have led to a different outcome. It also emphasizes the need to reverse tariff escalation to attract global value chains and minimize input costs.</description>
