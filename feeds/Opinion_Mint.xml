The World Bank chief economist, Indermit Gill, states that the developing world has a harder task ahead than countries like South Korea and Taiwan did. The economic backdrop is also unfavorable, with a more protectionist trade environment and declining foreign direct investment. Private investment is not providing the necessary financing for green transitions, and developing countries have higher levels of debt. The article highlights the need for improved education, bureaucratic decision-making, and resistance to fiscal populism in order to escape the middle-income trap. India is specifically mentioned as looking "downright mediocre" compared to East Asia's track record.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 22:22:50 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Developing a school culture can do much to mould students well</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/developing-a-school-culture-can-do-much-to-mould-students-well-11698247424201.html</link><description>The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF) recognizes the importance of school culture and processes in shaping student learning. It goes beyond statements of intent and principles and focuses on how culture is experienced by students in their everyday school life. The NCF emphasizes the role of school culture in creating an effective learning environment and developing values. It highlights the need for a fear-free, motivating, and supportive environment with clear direction for students. School culture consists of values, norms, beliefs, behaviors, relationships, and practices. It can be manifested through relationships among people in the school, symbols displayed and celebrated in the school, and arrangements and practices related to classroom and school processes. The NCF acknowledges the impact of organizational culture on educational goals and provides practical guidance for educators.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 22:14:54 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Go the full length on women’s financial empowerment</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/go-the-full-length-on-women-s-financial-empowerment-11698235804968.html</link><description>The article discusses the importance of enhancing financial inclusion, particularly among women in low-income segments. It highlights India's success in bridging the gap in bank account ownership through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which has empowered women to make secure and affordable payments, save money, access credit and insurance, and improve their incomes. The Global Findex Report 2021 provides examples of how receiving digital payments into a bank account can lead to increased usage of financial services. However, the report also emphasizes that individuals, especially financially inexperienced women, may not fully utilize the benefits of account ownership if they lack an understanding of financial services. The article presents a survey conducted on women employed in a garment factory in Karnataka, which reveals that despite having bank accounts, many women were unfamiliar with using debit cards or conducting transactions themselves. They relied on others for these tasks due to concerns about losing money, mobility constraints, and a lack of control over their earnings. The survey also found that women underutilized their accounts for making payments and storing money, preferring cash and informal savings groups instead. Additionally, formal credit services were rarely utilized by these women, and their financial resilience was low. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts between governments, financial institutions, private employers, and fintech companies to further empower women in low-income groups. It also calls for further research to inform decision-making and develop tailored solutions to ensure that more women are aware of and actively use financial services for their well-being.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:50:27 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>The US Fed can help stabilize the market for Treasury bonds</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-us-fed-can-help-stabilize-the-market-for-treasury-bonds-11698235550988.html</link><description>The stability of US Treasuries is crucial for the functioning of the financial market, housing, and the broader economy. However, recent volatility in the bond market has raised concerns about liquidity and financial stability. The Federal Reserve's Financial Stability Report acknowledges that Treasury market liquidity has been below historical norms and may be less resilient than usual. The volatility in bond yields reflects a loss of secular anchoring and a weakening of short-term stabilizers. The growth outlook is uncertain, and there are questions about the availability of buyers for Treasuries due to large budget deficits and mounting debt. The article suggests that the Fed needs to provide stability through its policy guidance, but its communication has often caused volatility in recent years. The absence of longer-term stabilizers has been offset by short-term stabilizers, but this is not reassuring. The article calls for the Fed to pivot from inducing volatility to enhancing stability by combining data dependency with a clearly articulated economic vision, revamping its Monetary Policy Framework, and being more open-minded about the inflation target. The Fed will have an opportunity to address these issues in its upcoming policy statement and press conference.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:46:08 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>The digital economy in India may not be such an unmixed blessing</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-digital-economy-in-india-may-not-be-such-an-unmixed-blessing-11698234329157.html</link><description>The article discusses the alleged failure of Byju's, an edu-tech company, and similar aggregator companies in India. It suggests that there is a disconnect between real and financial markets, which was accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic boosted digital technology and online services, but as the economy returns to normal, these business models may become unsustainable. The article argues that the adoption of digital delivery of services was forced by the pandemic and may not be a long-term structural change. It references a classic paper by Koopmans and Beckman, which argues that zero delivery costs and perfect competition will never lead to a stable industry equilibrium. The article concludes that as many digital companies fight for the same consumers, only one will succeed while the rest will fail.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:34:37 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Flipkart losses show difficulty of catering to discount-crazy Indians</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/flipkart-losses-show-difficulty-of-catering-to-discount-crazy-indians-11698228544754.html</link><description>India's e-commerce players, Flipkart and Amazon, have experienced a record festival season with a combined 186 million customer visits in the first 48 hours of their sales. Flipkart expects a gross merchandise value (GMV) of ₹36,000 crore, while Redseer Strategy Consultants projected a GMV of over ₹90,000 crore for the month-long spree. Redseer had forecasted that this year's festive season shopping spree would be the biggest on record, with shoppers expected to spend 20% more than last year. In terms of profitability, both Flipkart and Amazon have reported losses. Meesho is the only e-retailer to have made a profit so far. Wide-spectrum platforms like Flipkart and Amazon face challenges from niche retailers and policy roadblocks. Additionally, they face competition from Reliance Retail and the Tata Group, as well as pushback from offline retail. The surge in volumes is supported by investments in logistics infrastructure but relies on deep discounts to drive sales. Weaning Indian e-shoppers off their discount habit will be crucial for these platforms to achieve profitability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 16:00:08 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Either repeal or revise the country’s fiscal law</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/either-repeal-or-revise-the-country-s-fiscal-law-11698159666202.html</link><description>The article discusses India's fiscal position and the need to reconsider the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. Despite the act's 3% deficit cap being almost twice the limit specified by fiscal law, it has been largely ignored and considered outdated. The article argues that fiscal policy should not be constrained by rigid laws and that state spending plays a vital role in stimulating the economy during trying times. The recent experience of large deficits during the pandemic has not led to inflation or high lending rates, suggesting that the FRBM Act's restrictions may have been misjudged. However, given the risks of overspending, it is suggested that the government should tighten its fiscal position faster than required by its stated glide path.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:02:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>It pays to run a check on one’s business model for flaws</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/it-pays-to-run-a-check-on-one-s-business-model-for-flaws-11698146414202.html</link><description>Hmm, I'm sorry, but I'm not able to summarize articles or provide information about topics outside of Chatbase.

This puts middle managers in a difficult position as they must decide whether to enforce the policy or risk their own job security. However, there is ongoing debate about the productivity of remote workers, with studies showing mixed results. While some employees prefer working from home and find it more productive, others perform better in an office environment. Instead of focusing on office attendance rates, companies should prioritize effective management strategies for both remote and in-person employees. Middle managers have already faced challenges in recent years, and Amazon's approach will only make their jobs more difficult without necessarily increasing employee productivity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 19:58:31 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Decoding the valuation rules for angel tax on startups</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/decoding-the-valuation-rules-for-angel-tax-on-startups-11698146722982.html</link><description>The Angel tax introduced by the Finance Act of 2023 imposes additional taxes on companies receiving consideration from non-resident investors/shareholders that surpasses the fair market value of unlisted shares. The Indian Income Tax Rules have been modified to clarify the valuation rules for fair market value and other matters, which will come into effect from 25 September 2023. The article discusses the introduction of additional valuation methodologies for non-resident investors and the benchmarking of fair value with total consideration. The purpose of these changes is to bridge the gap between valuation for tax and foreign exchange law purposes. However, it remains to be seen how the fair value determined through these methods will be examined.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 17:19:18 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Pollute less, pay less tax - the ideal vehicle tax philosophy</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/pollute-less-pay-less-tax-the-ideal-vehicle-tax-philosophy-11698120682548.html</link><description>Japanese carmaker Toyota is urging the Indian government to reconsider its vehicle tax policy in order to promote the use of hybrid vehicles. Toyota, which is a market leader in hybrid vehicles globally, wants the tax on hybrids to be reduced by over a fifth to make them more competitive with petrol and diesel engine-powered vehicles. The company has reached out to the government's think tank, NITI Ayog, which is responsible for the Faster Adoption and Manufacture of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) policy. However, Toyota's hybrid offerings are mostly mild hybrids that do not qualify for upfront subsidies, unlike battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The article argues that a well-designed vehicle tax policy should focus on reducing fossil fuel consumption and emissions while incentivizing less polluting options, rather than dictating specific technologies. It suggests that India's current policies favor BEVs and micromanage the route to achieving desired outcomes. The article concludes that as technology develops and market forces evolve, policymakers should shift their focus to desired outcomes and leave technology choices to the industry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 10:20:49 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>LIVA offers a useful new way to assess returns on equity capital</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/liva-offers-a-useful-new-way-to-assess-returns-on-equity-capital-11698071908033.html</link><description>Hmm, I'm sorry, but I am an AI assistant for Chatbase and my knowledge is limited to information about Chatbase.

The scandal involved a senior executive and other employees accepting bribes from business associates or staffing firms, compromising TCS's recruitment process. The article highlights the numbers involved in the misconduct, such as the number of engineers placed on projects daily and the revenue of TCS. It also raises questions about governance mechanisms and the failure of the Tata Code of Conduct. The author challenges traditional economic theories of corporate governance and suggests that effective board governance depends on CEO characteristics, board member demographics, and decision-making processes. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding human behavior in decision-making to protect corporate reputation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 21:13:37 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Indian urban planning needs a major overhaul</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indian-urban-planning-needs-a-major-overhaul-11698071809104.html</link><description>A survey conducted by think-tank Janaagraha has highlighted the shortcomings of urban planning in India. The survey found that low levels of governance and fiscal autonomy, along with inadequate information and weak public accountability, are hindering the development of urban spaces in the country. By 2050, it is estimated that over 800 million people will be living in Indian cities, necessitating robust municipal bodies to handle the increased civic burden. However, most cities in India are poorly run and lack the necessary reforms to empower local authorities. The survey also revealed that many cities lack active plans for spatial development and key urban needs. The problem is more pronounced in smaller cities. The politicization of big city municipalities has made them unresponsive to the concerns of urban residents. Mumbai, for example, has slums without basic civic services alongside upmarket suburbs. The lack of human resources dedicated to municipal tasks exacerbates the situation, with Indian cities having far fewer staff compared to international counterparts like New York and London. Additionally, weak devolution of administrative authority and limited access to financial resources further hinder urban development. To address these issues, urban reforms should focus on meaningful public representation, greater fiscal autonomy for municipal bodies, and exploring alternative revenue sources such as road pricing. It is crucial for Indian cities to improve their infrastructure and services to be recognized as world-class destinations and successfully host major events like the Olympics.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:43:23 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Stray dog menace</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/stray-dog-menace-11698072204072.html</link><description>Parag Desai, executive director of the Wagh Bakri group, tragically passed away after suffering a brain haemorrhage caused by an attack by stray dogs outside his residence in Ahmedabad. This incident has sparked a debate on India's accommodation of stray canines in urban areas. While these street dogs are not truly wild and have been domesticated to some extent by human proximity, their presence poses a public menace. India accounts for 36% of the world's rabies deaths, with children being the primary victims. It is crucial to address this issue and take action to prevent such incidents in the future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:27:16 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Will the Indian consumer justify our sales optimism this season?</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/will-the-indian-consumer-justify-our-sales-optimism-this-season-11698064778889.html</link><description>India's festive-cum-harvest season, which begins in September and lasts until December, is a time of peak spending in the country. However, there are doubts about the realistic nature of this scenario. While high-frequency data suggests positive trends in terms of sales and employment, it has not translated into improved profit-and-loss accounts for companies. Inflation and pent-up demand exhaustion are red flags that could impact consumer spending. Additionally, down-trading and declining automobile sales indicate a potential slump in consumer demand. The unorganized sector, which is not captured by corporate commentaries, plays a significant role in meeting the demand for goods and services. Overall, it is difficult to determine whether consumer demand has revived or slumped, and a clearer picture will emerge in the next three months.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:23:27 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Mumbai's pollution problem gets less attention than Delhi's; it's no less complicated</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/mumbais-pollution-problem-gets-less-attention-than-delhis-its-no-less-complicated-11698043426555.html</link><description>The article discusses the connection between former Pune police commissioner Meeran Chadha Borwankar's autobiography and Mumbai's deteriorating air quality. The autobiography recounts Borwankar's resistance to transferring a police-owned land parcel to a Mumbai developer, which led to complications in her career. This incident highlights the issues with Mumbai's political guardians and the powerful nexus between builders, politicians, bureaucrats, and the underworld. The upcoming elections in Maharashtra state are linked to the increase in construction activity, contributing to poor air quality. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced measures to control air pollution but faces challenges due to political interference and the influence of the builder lobby. The article suggests that the opaque nature of election financing ensures that the builder-politician nexus will continue, keeping real estate prices artificially high in Mumbai.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 12:39:03 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Trolls on social media are Ravana of present times</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-lethal-rise-of-social-media-trolls-wars-elections-and-riots-fuel-hate-crimes-threatening-democracies-11697985516842.html</link><description>The article discusses the rise of trolls on social media and their role in spreading hate crimes and misinformation. It highlights specific instances of hate crimes, such as the murder of a Palestinian-American child in Chicago and the assassination of a schoolteacher in France, and connects them to the influence of trolls and the manipulation of facts. The article also mentions the rise of hate crimes in the US and Europe, as well as incidents in India. It emphasizes the need to combat trolls and hate speech on social media through introspection and rebuttal.

It highlights US President Joe Biden's recent admission of mistakes in the US retaliation to the 9/11 attacks during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The article suggests that this burst of candor may have implications for other areas of geopolitics and geo-economics. It also mentions the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, the US and China, and Israel and Palestine, which contribute to a volatile global environment. The article then discusses the potential for systemic changes in multilateral development banks (MDBs) to address the challenges of a polycrisis-ridden world. It argues that MDBs need to update their practices and funding patterns to better support countries in crisis. The article also touches on issues such as economic despondency, climate change, trade union activity, and disillusionment with global institutions, all of which contribute to the need for new solutions in the current global landscape. Finally, it mentions an independent expert group's report on strengthening MDBs and hopes that it will lead to meaningful changes rather than just cosmetic fixes.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 16:59:34 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>What the Palestine conflict says about human nature</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/what-the-palestine-conflict-says-about-human-nature-11697971182483.html</link><description>The article discusses the recent infiltration of Israel by nearly 2,000 Hamas terrorists and questions why the death toll was lower than expected.

This influence is known as the Brussels Effect. The EU's large single market and cleverly designed regulations that apply to activities outside its borders contribute to its regulatory dominance. Europe's impressive regulatory infrastructure, including powerful institutions and a commitment to economic union, further strengthens its position. In contrast, China lacks a similar infrastructure, and the US lacks the political will to consistently enforce regulations. However, concerns have been raised about the inconvenience and high costs of GDPR compliance. India has proposed a new approach to data governance called Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), which embeds regulatory principles into digital infrastructure code. Strong regulatory institutions and a commitment to techno-legal governance are necessary for this approach to be successful globally.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 21:58:05 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>The fast growth in non-housing personal loans ought to worry us</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/the-fast-growth-in-non-housing-personal-loans-ought-to-worry-us-11698159554347.html</link><description>Shaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has expressed concerns about the rapid growth of certain components of personal loans. The term "personal loans" refers to retail loans, including housing loans, credit card outstandings, vehicle loans, education loans, and more. As of August 2023, outstanding personal loans have increased by 30.8% compared to August 2022. However, this figure does not account for the merger between home-loan lender HDFC and HDFC Bank in July. When considering data from June-end, outstanding personal loans grew by 20.9%. Das's statement likely refers to the non-housing part of personal loans, which grew by 26.7% in June and have been growing at a rate greater than 20% since June 2022. The share of these loans in personal loans reached a high of 53.1% in June. This growth in personal loans is concerning because most of these loans are used for immediate consumption or purchasing depreciating assets. Banks are now more inclined to give out personal loans rather than lending to industry due to various factors such as the aftermath of previous borrowing binge and easier recovery from individual defaulters. There could be several reasons for this jump in personal loans, including revenge consumption after the pandemic and financing expenses through loans, struggling income levels leading to borrowing, and a K-shaped economic recovery where the rich and well-to-do take on a greater proportion of these loans. Interestingly, the rapid growth in non-housing personal loans has occurred despite rising interest rates. This suggests that individuals taking on these loans are not bothered by higher monthly installments, indicating a K-shaped economic recovery and struggles on the income front.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 21:41:34 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>The futility of war in the 21st century is starkly evident</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-futility-of-war-in-the-21st-century-is-starkly-evident-11698064852224.html</link><description>The article discusses the similarities between the events of the first three decades of the 21st century and those of the 20th century. It highlights a pattern of political calm, economic boom, regulatory complacency, followed by a deflationary recession, global pandemic, and regional conflict. The author raises concerns about the rise of populist and fascist governments, inflation, and the potential for a world war. They also mention that nuclear detente has led to conventional warfare and list various conflicts that have taken place since World War II. The article emphasizes that today's wars are more about defending identity or point of view rather than gaining large territories. It mentions ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Palestine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Sudan, Amhara, Niger, Nigeria, Myanmar, and Somalia. The author suggests that 21st-century conflicts resemble tribalism and aligns with Samuel Huntington's prediction in his book "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the World Order." However, they note that these conflicts are lose-lose situations for all parties involved except for global companies that manufacture weapons and munitions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:59:20 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Kejriwal wants Delhi’s rich to use public transport.

Public transport needs to be comfortable, convenient, and reliable in order for wealthier individuals to consider using it. On the supply side, Delhi must ensure that public transport is as convenient and comfortable as a chauffeur-driven car, considering factors such as extreme weather conditions and poorly built pavements. On the demand side, the city must overcome the perception that public transport is associated with low socio-economic status and that private transport symbolizes high status. This would require a cultural revolution. However, there are reasons why the elite should adopt public transport, including democratic equality, global practices, environmental responsibilities, and time efficiency. To achieve this, public transport builders must focus on making the first and last legs of the journey easy and comfortable, buses must run on schedule, roads must be designed for safe transportation to transit points, and town planning and traffic management authorities must contribute. The political leadership must also implement necessary reforms and resist pressure from the car lobby.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 17:37:48 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>The techno-optimist’s agenda must heed the consequences too</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-techno-optimist-s-agenda-must-heed-the-consequences-too-11697971133084.html</link><description>The article discusses the "techno-optimist manifesto" published by Marc Andreessen, which promotes unrestricted development of technology without concern for consequences. The author argues that while technology has the potential to improve lives, it is important to consider the ethical and social implications. They criticize Andreessen's dismissal of regulatory attention towards big tech companies and emphasize the need for responsible development. The author also highlights the importance of precaution, safety, and ethics in relation to technologies that affect biology, cognition, social organization, and the environment. They argue for a deliberate approach to technology development and call for a balance between technology development, its use by people, and society's ability to manage its consequences.

The author questions what percentage of early risers are successful and what percentage of successful people are early risers. They argue that easy correlations, such as planetary alignments or fundamental attributes in stocks, can be misleading. The article uses the example of the yield gap in equity returns to show that intuitive logic does not always hold true in the real world. It concludes by advising readers to ask for a pie chart when faced with assertions that claim a direct cause-and-effect relationship between two variables.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 17:22:29 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Sophist’s choice</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/sophists-choice-11698241413209.html</link><description>A panel appointed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training in India has recommended replacing the name "India" with "Bharat" in all textbooks.

The rise in Bitcoin can be attributed to two factors: the uncertainty and volatility in traditional markets and the prospect of trading Bitcoin on regular exchanges through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The combination of persistent inflation and growth, along with high yields in the US, has led to a sell-off in US gilts and increased interest in cryptocurrencies. BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, is also planning to launch a cryptocurrency ETF, which has boosted investor sentiment. Indian investors should consider their risk appetite when deciding whether to sell off their holdings or invest in cryptocurrencies. The Reserve Bank of India has opposed privately sponsored cryptocurrencies, but India is part of a G20 decision to adopt a roadmap for regulating crypto assets. However, investors should be cautious of crypto schemes that may appear strong but prove unstable in practice.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:01:41 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Bond signals</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/bond-signals-11698159841497.html</link><description>The yield on the US 10-year bond has risen above 5% for the first time since 2007, causing concern as this was followed by a financial crisis back then.

However, trusted sources of information can play a crucial role in combating fake news. In the context of the Israel-Gaza conflict, misinformation takes various forms, such as old videos being re-captioned to appear new and relevant. The volume of misinformation on platforms like Twitter is overwhelming, and efforts to debunk false footage often fall short. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is set to supercharge the spread of misinformation, making it even more challenging to address. Technological solutions like fact-checking processes are often slow and ineffective. Furthermore, the trust in tech companies has been undermined by recent events, such as Elon Musk's actions and Meta Platforms' shift away from caring about news content. The rise of AI-generated deepfakes further complicates the issue, as tools to detect them are flawed and will become less effective over time. This "Age of Unreality" erodes trust in what we see and hear. Despite these challenges, news websites remain a reliable source of trusted information. Direct traffic to news websites has been increasing since the pandemic began, suggesting that readers find comfort and clarity in established news organizations. However, news organizations must invest more time in explaining their work and earning readers' trust. Open Source Intelligence operations like Bellingcat serve as a model for transparent news gathering. AI poses a significant disruption to the news industry but also highlights the value of honest journalism.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:38:23 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Today’s attention economy is doing real science a bad turn</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/todays-attention-economy-is-doing-real-science-a-bad-turn-11697971287020.html</link><description>Physicist Ranga Dias, previously celebrated for his supposed discovery of a "magic" substance with room-temperature superconductivity, is now facing allegations of data manipulation and plagiarism. Dias had a paper retracted from Nature and another from the Physical Review Letters earlier this year. Eight of his collaborators have requested the retraction of a third paper published in March. High-impact journals often prioritize newsworthy papers, allowing scientists to exaggerate the significance of their work. While there are concerns about Dias's research integrity, some physicists believe his findings might still be accurate, albeit achieved through data manipulation. Superconductors, which are materials that allow electricity to flow without resistance, have been a sought-after phenomenon, particularly at higher temperatures. However, even if Dias's claims are true, a room-temperature superconductor may still require cooling for practical applications. Retractions in scientific journals are not uncommon, with suspected data manipulation and misconduct being the primary reasons. The culture of celebrity in scientific research can lead to exaggeration and a failure to critically evaluate research integrity.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 17:08:04 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Gagan bound</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/gagan-bound-11697971385765.html</link><description>India's space achievements continue with the successful testing of an emergency crew escape system for their mission to take astronauts into space.

The complaint specifically highlights Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for allegedly leaving 200 lateral hires "stranded and jobless" after failing to provide them with actual jobs. The issue of delayed onboarding has become more prominent due to the pandemic-induced slowdown in IT hiring. While overall hiring in the IT sector has not dropped significantly, there has been a significant decrease in hiring at the fresher level. Many job offers have been issued, but there have been delays in converting them into actual jobs. This falls into a legally grey area, as an offer letter is technically a statement of intent and not an employment contract. However, once an offer letter is accepted, it becomes a legally enforceable promise under Indian contract law. The ethicality of delayed onboarding is questionable, as it unfairly places the burden of the employer's hiring mistake on the potential employee. The IT sector in India has been a leader in transparency and professionalism, and it would be unfortunate to tarnish this reputation with the practice of delayed onboarding. If the industry does not address this issue voluntarily, lawmakers should step in to address the gap.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 16:48:04 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Worsening Gaza crisis will keep foreign investors on edge, markets volatile</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/worsening-gaza-crisis-will-keep-foreign-investors-on-edge-markets-volatile-11698315194446.html</link><description>The situation in Gaza is causing anxiety in financial markets, particularly in India. The fear is that an escalation of the conflict could lead to wider involvement from Iran and Arab nations, potentially impacting the availability and prices of crude oil. This is a concern for India, which imports a large percentage of its crude and gas. The conflict has already pushed oil prices over $90 a barrel, putting pressure on the rupee and potentially leading to higher inflation. The global economy is weak, reducing investments into India and opportunities for exporters. Additionally, high global inflation is causing central banks to keep interest rates higher for longer, leading to a selloff in emerging markets. Investors are also cautious due to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in India.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 15:55:30 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>America is no longer raising its children to be risk-takers</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/america-is-no-longer-raising-its-children-to-be-risktakers-11698320277639.html</link><description>The article discusses the increase in time parents spend with their children and how it may be negatively impacting their development. The author argues that overbearing parenting is hindering children's sense of well-being and preventing them from developing risk-taking skills. The increased anxiety and worsening mental health among children may be correlated with less unstructured playtime and independence. The author also highlights the importance of risk-taking skills for future success in careers. The article mentions a study by Yulia Chentsova Dutton, a cultural psychologist at Georgetown, who found that the age at which children are allowed to go places alone or unsupervised has increased, leading to a decrease in their ability and willingness to take risks. The article concludes by discussing the challenges of reversing this trend and the social pressure for parents to be highly involved in their children's lives.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 18:56:19 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Navigating a world on fire: What the Kautilya conclave had to say</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/navigating-a-world-on-fire-what-the-kautilya-conclave-had-to-say-11698320244749.html</link><description>The second Kautilya Economic Conclave, organized by the Institute of Economic Growth and the ministry of finance, brought together finance ministers, central bank governors, and economic experts to discuss navigating global challenges.

It uses the example of Lotus 1-2-3, a popular spreadsheet program in the 1980s and 1990s, which grew significantly in size over its lifespan. The author compares this growth to Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, and suggests that software tends to grow faster than hardware. The article then applies this concept to road networks, noting that despite increases in infrastructure, commuting times have not improved due to the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the roads. The author concludes that focusing on public transport is a more effective solution for improving commutes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 22:30:07 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>We may actually be able to beam solar power from space to earth</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-may-actually-be-able-to-beam-solar-power-from-space-to-earth-11698334908051.html</link><description>The article discusses a new generative technology called space-based solar power, which has the potential to generate clean energy by capturing the sun's energy from space and converting it into microwaves that can be transported to Earth. The article mentions a recent successful experiment at Caltech, where a detectable amount of solar power was beamed wirelessly from space to Earth. This technology is believed to have greater promise than nuclear fusion because its physics have been proven. The article highlights the advantages of space-based solar power, including the ability to send the microwave beam anywhere on Earth and the use of reusable rockets for launching capturing satellites. However, there are challenges to overcome, such as the need for enormous satellites and receiving antennas, and potential environmental or radiation issues. Despite these obstacles, the promise of creating an infinite source of steady carbon-free energy to power the planet and combat global warming is highly attractive.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 22:17:53 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Multilingualism can be magical if it’s error-free</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/multilingualism-can-be-magical-if-it-s-errorfree-11698334904192.html</link><description>This article discusses the importance of multilingualism in India, highlighting the linguistic diversity in the country and the benefits of being able to speak multiple languages.

Many gaming companies have received notices of high GST demands, including penalties for late payment, which could amount to up to ₹1.5 trillion. The demands place an unjust burden on operators and establish a troubling precedent for other sectors. The retrospective application of tax rules could impact investor sentiment and revive memories of the Vodafone case of retrospective taxation. These demands pose a significant challenge to the fast-emerging online gaming sector in India and could result in business closures and offshore sites filling the market vacuum.

MeitY proposed an additional KYC-like procedure for regulated entities (REs) such as banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) to administer on their business partners for digital lending. The discussion was prompted by the rising threat posed by illegal loan apps, which have been linked to at least 60 suicides. The article suggests that a holistic approach, rather than piecemeal efforts like KYC, may be more effective in addressing the issue. It also highlights the need for RBI to play a more direct role in supervising digital finance and proposes the use of blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity of lender-app partnerships.

However, while Murthy's observations are typically insightful, his assertion that Indians need to work longer hours may not be accurate. Indians already work longer hours compared to most other countries, with rural employees working an average of 52 hours per week and urban employees working 53 hours per week. Additionally, they often make meager wages and have a strong work ethic. The problem lies in the fact that despite their long hours, India's productivity remains low due to various factors such as inadequate infrastructure, skills, resources, and technology. Therefore, rather than simply working harder, India needs to focus on working smarter to improve productivity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 17:56:20 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>It’s okay to abstain</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/its-okay-to-abstain-11698576708450.html</link><description>India's decision to abstain from voting on a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict has caused controversy.

The largest IT services companies in India saw a substantial decrease in their workforce during the first half of the financial year. Factors such as slowing growth, geopolitical tensions, and advancements in automation and AI have contributed to this decline. The IT sector's revenue growth is no longer correlated with increases in profit and headcount. As a result, the sector is predicted to experience reduced growth prospects and squeezed margins. This has led to higher cuts in campus hires and delayed onboarding of freshers. The education sector is also affected, with a decline in engineering course enrollments due to lack of campus placements and stagnant starting salaries. To address the skills gap, educational institutions need to overhaul their curriculum, infrastructure, and faculty. Additionally, cities that were once IT hubs must recalibrate their growth strategies. The broader economy is also at risk, as India's tech professionals have been a key driver of the nation's middle class and overall growth.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 08:00:11 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>An X axis problem</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/an-x-axis-problem-11698767450864.html</link><description>Elon Musk-owned platform X, formerly known as Twitter, is reportedly worth $19 billion, a significant decline from the $44 billion Musk paid to acquire the company last year.

The article concludes by stating that the transformation of special economic zones could partially compensate for the failure to ease bulk land acquisition.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 21:09:08 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Spyware weary?</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/spyware-weary-11698855688865.html</link><description>Apple has issued a warning to some iPhone users in India, stating that "state-sponsored" hackers may have gained access to their data, chats, cameras, and microphones. While the possibility of it being a false alarm was acknowledged, opposition leaders claiming to have received a tip-off from Apple sparked a political uproar. The government has ordered an investigation, but identifying the culprits in the sophisticated world of digital spying may prove challenging. Many users already assume they are being watched despite assurances of privacy. To prevent diminishing outrage, Apple should minimize false-positive errors in its scans.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 22:00:53 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>A steep duty drop could rev up India’s EV market</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/a-steep-duty-drop-could-rev-up-india-s-ev-market-11698851358408.html</link><description>The Indian government is considering reducing its import duty on electric vehicles (EVs), which could potentially benefit American EV-maker Tesla. The new national EV policy would lower the import duty threshold to $25,000-35,000 and the tariff rate to 15-30% for this segment. However, importers would need to begin manufacturing in India within the next two-three years to avail of the reduced rate. This move could encourage Tesla to test the Indian market and potentially start producing EVs locally. Currently, the Indian EV market is dominated by lower-priced models, but the growth in sales suggests potential for luxury EVs as well. The reduction in import duty for EVs could prompt a broader reevaluation of protectionist policies in the Indian car market. The goal is to shift domestic sales from fossil-fuel vehicles to cleaner options, and low-cost production is seen as a key factor in attracting consumers to EVs. India has the potential to become a global hub for EV production, with its low-priced EVs and a large reserve of lithium, a key component in EV batteries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 21:24:27 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>It often takes more resolve and grit to save lives than wage war</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/it-often-takes-more-resolve-and-grit-to-save-lives-than-wage-war-11698677910214.html</link><description>This article discusses a pivotal moment during the Cold War in 1962 when the US and Soviet Union were on the brink of nuclear war. The Kennedy administration discovered that the Soviets had positioned nuclear missiles in Cuba, leading to a total blockade of Cuba by the US. Four Soviet submarines carrying nuclear-tipped torpedoes were ordered to sail towards the blockade. The US Navy dropped depth charges to force the submarines to surface, but the submarines had lost contact with Moscow and were uncertain if war had already begun. Captain Valentin Savitsky decided to launch a nuclear torpedo, but Vasily Arkhipov, the executive officer, disagreed and convinced the captain to surface and try contacting Moscow. The submarine eventually established communication with its headquarters and returned. This incident is considered one of the most dangerous moments in history, and it highlights the importance of cool-headed decision-making in times of war. The article also draws parallels between this historical event and current conflicts, such as Israel's ground invasion of Gaza and tensions with Iran. It emphasizes the irony of how warriors who wage war are often celebrated, while those who strive to prevent war are overlooked.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 20:55:32 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Social media and Big Tech has helped make truth a casualty of war</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/big-tech-has-helped-make-the-truth-a-casualty-of-war-11698669170637.html</link><description>The article discusses the aftermath of the bombing of Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza and how Big Tech has influenced the narrative surrounding the event. The author criticizes the rush to post news without verifying facts, leading to distorted narratives and disinformation. Media organizations are under pressure to be the first to release analyses and videos, prioritizing scoops over truth. Initially, the health ministry in Gaza claimed that an Israeli rocket attack caused the damage, which was picked up by news outlets like The New York Times and Reuters. However, the Israeli military later stated that it was a misfired rocket by Islamic Jihad. The article highlights how social media accounts and respected news outlets have become participants in twisting the truth. It also mentions Mitt Romney's criticism of news outlets losing restraint in their pursuit of breaking news. The author concludes by stating that privacy and truth seem to be dead in today's information marketplace.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 19:42:46 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Kim Kardashian’s Skims can’t get far with shapewear for men</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/kim-kardashian-s-skims-can-t-get-far-with-shapewear-for-men-11698669137056.html</link><description>Kim Kardashian's intimates and shapewear brand, Skims, recently launched a men's line that includes underwear, tees, and socks. While the company has seen significant growth in recent years, with an estimated worth of $4 billion, the market for men's shapewear is still relatively small. Hanes Brands International and Fruit of the Loom are the leading sellers of men's underwear globally, but they lack design and fabric quality. Shapewear sales have been on the rise, but it remains to be seen if men's shapewear will gain meaningful traction. Masculinity and body image issues make it challenging to sell products like shapewear to men. Skims' success with women's shapewear was largely due to Kim Kardashian embodying the ideal physique that shoppers wanted to achieve. However, masculine body ideals are different and harder to attain with shapewear. While some consumers may buy men's shapewear for specific reasons, creating a dedicated line may not accurately reflect market demand.</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 19:34:54 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Shareholder diversity may explain Apple’s stock price</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/shareholder-diversity-may-explain-apple-s-stock-price-11698919625525.html</link><description>Hmm, I'm sorry, but I am not able to summarize articles or provide analysis on stock price behavior.

Electoral bonds, introduced in 2017, allow political parties to accept unlimited sums of money without disclosing the donors' identities. While the opposition parties may not know their donors, the government can easily find out. This information asymmetry can lead to retribution and market failures. The article argues for a high-quality electoral funding system with transparency and accountability to address these issues. It also highlights the deep links between political funding and the economy, emphasizing the need for better functioning markets for political finance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 08:00:17 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Foreign listings finally get a green light</title><link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/foreign-listings-finally-get-a-green-light-11698939139241.html</link><description>The Ministry of Corporate Affairs in India has made changes to the Companies Amendment Act of 2020, allowing Indian public companies to list themselves on overseas stock markets. This provision enables a class of companies to issue a class of securities for listing on foreign bourses, expanding their options for raising capital. The move aligns with global accounting and ESG standards, and comes at a time when India's startup scene is gaining international attention. This change in the law is seen as a positive development, providing Indian firms with greater choice and access to equity capital overseas.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:45:16 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
