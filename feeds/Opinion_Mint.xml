			<title>Focus on foundational literacy and numeracy to improve educational outcomes</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/literacy-numeracy-school-education-students-teaching-ai-in-education-parent-teacher-meetings-quality-of-education-11726811884681.html</link>
			<description>The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasized foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) as crucial for education, leading to the NIPUN Bharat Mission aimed at ensuring all Grade 3 students achieve FLN skills by 2027.  States are adopting four key principles to drive change: aligning the system with clear goals; augmenting teaching practices through structured pedagogy, technology, and teacher training; utilizing low-stakes assessments to improve learning; and engaging parents and communities.

Early successes include Madhya Pradesh, which has significantly improved Grade 2 students' reading and numeracy skills, and Uttar Pradesh, with 24% of its schools declared NIPUN, highlighting its effectiveness. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 4 of inclusive and equitable quality education for all,  it is crucial to continue energizing this system, augmenting processes, assessing progress, and involving parents and communities.</description>

			<title>Dear value investor, welcome to perplexing times</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/value-investing-fed-interest-rate-cut-stock-markets-valuations-small-caps-mid-caps-large-caps-asset-allocation-11726736973060.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by value investors in the current Indian market. Despite the market reaching all-time highs, valuations are not considered excessively high. However, there's a lot of liquidity chasing mid and small-cap stocks, leading to stretched valuations in those segments. This situation squeezes value investors who follow strict criteria for identifying stocks, as fewer genuinely attractive options are available. 

The author, while acknowledging the predicament, suggests staying disciplined with investment criteria and potentially considering booking profits if near-term liquidity needs arise. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of asset allocation planning to navigate these perplexing market conditions.</description>

			<title>Cycle lag effect: After the Fed's rate cut, RBI’s job gets tougher</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-policy-easing-rbi-employment-data-jerome-powell-inflation-monetary-policy-11726766810367.html</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point, marking a shift in focus from inflation control to supporting economic growth. This move follows similar actions by other major central banks. 

The Fed believes its 2% inflation target is achievable and aims to prevent a potential economic slowdown. Cheaper credit is expected to encourage consumer spending and business investment. 

While the initial impact on financial markets was muted, the rate cut could potentially boost capital flows to emerging markets, including India, strengthening their currencies and assets. This could also attract foreign investment to Indian stocks and bonds. 


 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may need to closely monitor the rupee's appreciation and manage liquidity to ensure stability.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Exploding handsets: A new phase of West Asia’s war?</title>

			<description>A series of explosions targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, linked to remote-controlled explosives in walkie-talkies and previously pagers, has raised fears of escalation. Israel, while not directly claiming responsibility for the attacks, has indicated a "new phase" in the conflict. This event, potentially drawing Iran directly into hostilities, adds to the existing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.  With the uncertainty surrounding the US election and lack of a clear resolution plan, the situation threatens regional peace, though global markets remain relatively stable for now.</description>

			<title>Uniform civil code: Can AI help India find a real consensus?</title>

			<description>The article explores the possibility of using AI to help India achieve a uniform civil code. The author argues that while AI might be helpful in analyzing data on marriage, divorce, and inheritance, it is unlikely to be able to fully understand the complex social and cultural factors at play.  

The author acknowledges the need to address gender asymmetry in family laws,  but believes that true progress requires more than just algorithmic analysis.  A truly fair and equitable civil code will require a society that is open to change and willing to engage in civil and thoughtful debate.  Ultimately, the author concludes that the quest for a fair and equitable civil code is a complex one that goes beyond the capabilities of current AI technology.</description>

			<title>What exactly is a pregnancy brain? We may finally have some answers.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/pregnancy-brain-hormonal-changes-cerebral-cortex-human-brain-pregnancy-brain-mapping-blood-pressure-depression-11726716611063.html</link>
			<description>A new study published in Nature Neuroscience offers the first comprehensive look at the transformations the human brain undergoes during pregnancy. Researchers conducted MRI scans on pregnant women before conception, throughout pregnancy, and two years after birth, revealing significant changes in brain structure. 

One key finding was a reduction in grey matter in almost all areas of the cortex, which persisted for years after childbirth. While this may sound concerning, the researchers suggest this could be a form of cortical refinement, optimizing brain function for motherhood. Other changes included transient increases in white matter quality during the second and third trimesters. 

This research, led by Emily Jacobs from the University of California, Santa Barbara, aims to gain a better understanding of pregnancy complications like preeclampsia, migraines, and postpartum depression. Ultimately, the study highlights the dynamic nature of the female brain during pregnancy and emphasizes the need for more research on women's health.</description>

			<title>Dani Rodrik: The world is haunted by a whole new trilemma</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/climate-change-globalization-middle-class-global-poverty-carbon-emission-developed-countries-export-manufacturing-jobs-11726716537923.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the trilemma of balancing global climate change mitigation, boosting the middle class in developed nations, and reducing global poverty. 

The author argues that current policies create a conflict where pursuing two goals often comes at the expense of the third. For example, policies aimed at combating climate change may harm the economic prospects of developing countries seeking industrial growth. Similarly, prioritizing domestic economic recovery in developed nations could lead to job displacement and wage suppression in low-skilled sectors.

However, the author suggests that some potential solutions exist.  They highlight that the service sector will be a key driver of job creation in both developed and developing economies.  Additionally, they emphasize the need for developed nations to cooperate with developing countries on climate change mitigation, framing it as mutually beneficial.  


The author concludes by asserting that achieving all three goals requires innovative policymaking that transcends the current trilemma.</description>

			<title>What debate? Reducing debt is the same as tightening the fiscal deficit.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/fiscal-deficit-debt-to-gdp-ratio-government-expenditure-inflation-government-debt-capital-expenditure-reserve-currency-11726715625294.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the appropriate level of India's debt-to-GDP ratio. It notes that while a 60% target set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act seems aggressive compared to global averages, a level of 70-75% might be more realistic, considering India's developmental needs.  

The article emphasizes that the focus should not solely be on reaching a specific debt-to-GDP ratio but also on the quality of government spending. Prioritizing capital expenditure, which fosters income generation, is crucial. Additionally, managing the tenure of borrowings, aiming for shorter maturities to reduce interest costs, and ensuring fiscal discipline to avoid a "fiscal cliff" are essential for sustainable economic growth.</description>

			<title>After US Fed's surprise interest rate cut, all eyes on RBI's management skills</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-federal-reserve-fed-rate-cut-50-bps-rate-cut-rbi-rupee-dollar-treasury-interest-rates-mpc-fpi-inflows-inflation-11726726058569.html</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve implemented a larger-than-anticipated 50 basis point rate cut, signaling a strong commitment to further reductions. This move will impact the global economy, particularly the US bond market, leading to lower yields and a potential 'risk-on' environment favoring equities, especially in emerging markets like India. 

The expected weakening of the US dollar will also have implications, potentially strengthening the rupee and influencing commodity prices.  As a result, other central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), will need to respond to these changes. The RBI may consider aligning with the Fed by cutting rates, potentially boosting market sentiment further.</description>

			<title>Nano businesses in India need special policy attention to flourish</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/nano-businesses-msmes-entrepreneurship-gst-employment-formal-credit-lending-policy-support-11726679009443.html</link>
			<description>A significant portion of Indian MSMEs are "nano businesses," characterized by small operations typically run from homes, low access to credit, and informal structures.  While they employ a substantial number of people (estimated at 110 million) and contribute to the economy, they lack proper financial records and face challenges accessing formal loans. Policymakers struggle to adequately understand their unique needs due to limited data. 

There is potential for nano businesses to drive inclusive growth and innovation, but they require targeted support in areas like financial inclusion, skill development, technology adoption, and regulatory simplification.  Creating a separate policy framework and possibly even a dedicated ministry for nano businesses could be crucial for unlocking their full potential.</description>

			<title>Here’s how authorities ought to deal with India’s market froth</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ipo-oversubscription-equity-market-stock-market-sebi-retail-investors-mutual-funds-market-valuation-11726678349798.html</link>
			<description>The Indian stock market is experiencing a frenzy, fueled by retail investors pouring money into IPOs and penny stocks. This activity mirrors previous market bubbles and has alarmed regulators like Sebi, who fear potential manipulation and a market crash. The surge is partly driven by a shortage of alternative investment options offering competitive returns. This scarcity is also evident in the banking sector, where deposit growth lags behind credit growth, forcing banks to rely on expensive liabilities. Retail investors hungry for returns are further channeling money into IPOs through mutual funds, reinforcing an artificial valuation boom. There are concerns of collusion between institutional investors and shady issuers, further inflating valuations for the benefit of promoters and to the detriment of unsuspecting retail investors. 

 


Regulators are advised to focus on raising awareness about market fragility and investor caution rather than resorting to heavy-handed administrative controls. They should also strengthen penalties for market misconduct to deter future transgressions and protect retail investors from potential losses.</description>

			<title>It’s an age of leaderless movements but can they succeed in India?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/kolkata-doctor-rape-case-protests-bangladesh-student-protests-leaderless-movements-arab-spring-social-change-dissent-11726601979093.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the recent upsurge in leaderless mass movements, exemplified by events in Bangladesh, West Bengal, and other countries like Egypt, Bolivia, Hong Kong, and Myanmar. 

These movements, driven by anger against corruption, political repression, and injustice, primarily rely on social media for organization and communication, lacking traditional leadership structures. While they can successfully topple regimes, as seen in Egypt, their sustainability and effectiveness are questionable.

The article argues that in India, these movements are unlikely to cause a revolution due to the country's deeply divided social fabric. It suggests that a unifying economic crisis might be the catalyst for mass mobilization, but ultimately, achieving substantial change will likely require traditional political channels and established parties.  The author concludes that while dissent is essential in a democracy, it should be viewed as a warning signal to the ruling class rather than a harbinger of revolution in India's context.</description>

			<title>At last, inflation seems set to soften and stay in a relatively cool range</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/food-inflation-cpi-rbi-interest-rate-headline-inflation-consumption-policy-easing-crude-oil-price-rainfall-pulses-11726600904026.html</link>
			<description>India's inflation has eased from its peak in 2022-23, primarily due to easing supply chain disruptions, lower commodity prices, and a controlled increase in service sector costs. Despite a slight uptick in August, inflation is expected to remain within the 4.2-4.6% range for the year.

Several factors contribute to this optimistic outlook: a good monsoon season, easing food prices, and benign core inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to maintain its policy rate for now due to these positive developments. However, potential future changes in the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee composition, the US Federal Reserve's actions, and upcoming domestic growth and inflation data could influence monetary policy decisions in the coming months.</description>

			<title>Can GenAI really craft effective advertising campaigns?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/genai-advertising-campaigns-human-creativity-artificial-intelligence-advertising-technology-emotions-ai-11726603360421.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the potential of generative AI (GenAI) in the advertising industry. While GenAI can quickly produce images, headlines, and basic ad copy, its lack of originality and understanding of nuanced human emotions presents a challenge.

The author uses the example of the masala pouch in instant noodles to illustrate the need for human intervention. Just as adding masala enhances the taste, human creativity is crucial for crafting effective advertisements that resonate with consumers.

The article argues that true creativity lies in identifying the right emotional stimuli to generate the desired response, something GenAI currently struggles with.  The successful "Shot on iPhone" campaign, with its evocative imagery and focus on emotional connection, is cited as an example of the power of human-driven creative intelligence in advertising. 

The author concludes that GenAI can be a useful tool, but its success in advertising depends on human creativity guiding and enhancing its output.</description>

On average, people's belief levels in conspiracy theories dropped by 20%, with a quarter of participants dropping their belief levels below 50%.  The chatbot's success was attributed to its ability to provide instant access to counter-evidence and logical reasoning, which outperformed human efforts in countering the often overwhelming amount of evidence believers present. This research suggests that evidence-based arguments can be effective in challenging conspiracy theories and may offer a path towards mitigating the spread of misinformation.</description>

			<title>A sovereign wealth fund can do plenty for India is a changed world</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sovereign-wealth-fund-trade-deficit-swf-foreign-exchange-reserves-fiscal-deficit-development-investment-11726599191953.html</link>
			<description>India is reportedly considering establishing its own sovereign wealth fund (SWF). This idea has been discussed before, notably in 2007-08 and 2010-11, but faced pushback due to India's current account and fiscal deficits, alongside a belief that domestic markets are sufficiently deep. 

However, the author argues that the global landscape and India's aspirations have changed significantly.  An SWF could benefit India socially, politically, and economically, not just financially.  

It could be used to attract specialized knowledge and critical technologies, boost India's global influence through infrastructure projects, and address concerns about resource dependence and economic coercion by nations like China.

Moreover, an SWF could complement the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with a distinct mandate focused on balancing liquidity, security, and returns.  The author concludes that defining India's SWF approach should be guided by the nation's future ambitions, not its current economic standing.</description>

			<title>Drones should be made wholly in India for the sake of our security</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/drones-manufacturing-pli-scheme-national-security-startups-localized-production-ukraine-war-drone-technology-bombs-11726597381834.html</link>
			<description>An increasing number of drones are needed to meet the growing demands of various sectors. Recognizing India's need for self-sufficiency, the government is considering substantial funding for drone manufacturing and research. The focus should be on developing indigenous capabilities for all aspects of the drone ecosystem, including components like motors, sensors, cameras, batteries, and advanced electronics.

This move will not only reduce dependence on foreign suppliers but also enhance national security by ensuring control over drone technology.  Supporting drone R&amp;D could also have positive spillover effects on other sectors, such as electric vehicles. 


Developing a robust testing infrastructure is crucial to identify vulnerabilities in drone software and prevent hacking. Funding startups to create locally developed components and encouraging the use of indigenous technology in drone manufacturing are essential steps in establishing a thriving domestic drone industry.</description>

			<description>Arvind Kejriwal resigned as Delhi's chief minister amidst corruption charges. This move, following his release on bail, allows him to maintain public visibility while preparing for the upcoming elections in 2025. 

Atishi, a cabinet minister, has been chosen as the interim replacement. This transition allows for the resumption of governance in Delhi, addressing the public's growing concerns since Kejriwal's bail conditions restricted his official duties. While the change ensures  functional continuity, the political impact of Kejriwal's resignation remains to be seen.</description>

			<title>We do need tighter scrutiny of pricey deals by competition authorities</title>

			<description>India has implemented a new competition law rule requiring mandatory review of deals valued over ₹2,000 crore, even if they don't meet established turnover or asset thresholds. This change aims to address concerns about "killer acquisitions" in the digital sector, where large companies may buy smaller startups to stifle competition. 

Deal value is broadly defined and includes previous transactions between the same parties.  International deals won't be automatically caught if the target company lacks significant business operations in India.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is adopting a proactive stance, using a 10% business nexus with India for digital services and applying a minimum turnover threshold for other sectors. The CCI's focus aligns with global trends of increased scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions in digital markets, aiming to protect innovation and fair competition. Industry is adapting by carefully assessing competition risks and revising deal documents to ensure timely closure.</description>

			<title>Sebi's proposed changes can spruce up investment advisory regulations</title>

			<description>India's market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), proposed significant changes to the regulations for registered investment advisers (RIAs) and research analysts (RAs). These changes aim to relax many existing rules, potentially increasing the number of RIAs and widening the scope of regulated investment advice. 

The proposals would  lower barriers to entry for RIAs,  allowing part-time advisors and individuals with  less experience to join the industry.  However, they also restrict RIAs from offering advice on products not regulated by Sebi, potentially impacting holistic financial planning. Sebi argues this protects clients by ensuring they have recourse to Sebi for grievance redressal on advice concerning regulated products. 

Critics argue these restrictions fragment financial advice, as clients might need to consult multiple advisors for different aspects of their financial planning. They suggest the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) could play a role in coordinating regulation across various financial sectors to ensure comprehensive and integrated financial advice.</description>

			<title>Why the US Federal Reserve may go for a big rate cut this week</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-fed-meeting-us-recession-unemployment-inflation-jerome-powell-price-stability-11726561919451.html</link>
			<description>The Federal Reserve faces a crucial decision this week: lower interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points. 

Several factors suggest a 50 basis point cut is likely. Economic data indicates a slowing economy with moderate wage inflation and a cooling job market. This, coupled with market expectations for significant rate reductions by the end of 2024, makes a larger cut more suitable. 

However, the Fed may hesitate due to concerns about perceived inflation reversal and potential accusations of manipulating the economy for political gain.  Despite these considerations, the author believes that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will favor an aggressive approach, leading to a 50 basis point reduction.  A larger cut will align better with market expectations and address the current tight monetary policy stance.</description>

			<title>India’s Unified Lending Interface is worth much more than it seems</title>

			<description>This article discusses the use of digital public infrastructure (DPI) to improve access to capital for small dairy farmers in India. 

It highlights the challenges faced by these farmers who lack the collateral needed for traditional loans, despite the success of dairy cooperatives in empowering them. 

The author argues that the newly launched Unified Lending Interface (ULI) by the Reserve Bank of India offers a solution by providing lenders with access to relevant non-financial data like milk production and quality from the National Dairy Development Board. 

The ULI, through its interoperability with other DPI platforms, can potentially empower farmers with improved access to credit, allowing them to scale their operations and contribute further to the success of India's dairy sector.</description>

			<description>Australia is aiming to be the first country to legally mandate a minimum age for social media access, potentially between 14 and 16 years old. While the intent is to address the documented mental health concerns and dangers of social media for young people, implementing such a law faces challenges. 

Critics argue that restricting access could deprive children of valuable information and support, and that technical solutions for age verification are inadequate. 

Furthermore, the article highlights that laws alone cannot solve societal problems, citing examples like underage drinking and child marriage, despite these practices being illegal. Ultimately, the article suggests that lasting solutions require widespread social consensus and action.</description>

The author highlights the limited scope of these books, which often cherry-pick data to support pre-determined narratives. They argue that these simplistic explanations fail to capture the complex reality of business and rely on the human tendency to prefer clear-cut stories over nuanced truths. 

The author suggests that focusing on failed companies could provide valuable insights and encourage more realistic assessments of success.  They also advocate for greater transparency in business books, urging authors to acknowledge the limitations of their research and avoid perpetuating the illusion of predictability in business.</description>

			<description>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has loosened a rule regarding company takeovers, allowing firms to acquire up to 25% of a target's shares on the secondary market without prior approval. This move marks a shift away from the historical aversion to hostile takeovers in India, often driven by the prevalence of family-run businesses. 

The CCI's decision aims to foster a more competitive environment, allowing for the reshuffling of assets and promoting efficiency. The CCI stresses that while this change is beneficial, it will continue to scrutinize mergers, especially in the digital sector, to prevent monopolistic practices and protect consumer interests.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the potential challenges faced by IT service providers in implementing and monetizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). 

While GenAI offers promise, the author highlights issues such as factual inaccuracies (hallucinations) in GenAI outputs and the difficulty in integrating it seamlessly with existing IT systems. 

The author argues that IT service providers' existing approaches to training their workforce and showcasing GenAI benefits are insufficient. 

Furthermore, the author predicts that initial GenAI implementations will likely be limited to modest productivity improvements through automation, failing to meet the high expectations surrounding its potential.


The author expresses concern that a lack of tangible results will lead to blame-shifting between clients and service providers, creating opportunities for third-party consultants.</description>

			<description>Long considered untouchable by regulators, tech giants like Apple and Google are facing an era of accountability. European authorities have levied hefty fines against both companies for anticompetitive practices, including Apple's Irish tax avoidance and Google's preferential treatment of its own shopping service. 

These decisions mark the end of prolonged legal battles and signal a shift towards quicker and more efficient enforcement of antitrust laws.  The EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), launched in March, provides a clear framework for dealing with monopolistic behavior, forcing companies like Apple and Google to allow app uninstallation and preventing biased search results. 

While these companies may be able to weather the financial fallout, the DMA threatens their long-held advantages, potentially creating a more level playing field for smaller competitors and fostering innovation.</description>

			<title>US-China relations need a reset before we all end up paying a heavy price</title>

			<description>The US-China relationship is currently strained, with key bilateral agreements, such as the US-China Science and Technology Agreement, allowed to lapse. Tensions have intensified due to US tariffs, export restrictions on technology, and accusations against Chinese firms for aiding Russia militarily. This deterioration is concerning as global challenges like climate change and economic instability demand cooperation between these two economic giants. 

Despite the challenges, there are glimmers of hope. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's recent visit to Beijing suggests a potential for dialogue. Future US administrations might prioritize rebuilding cooperation, starting with collaborative efforts on regulating artificial intelligence and tackling climate change.  

China's expertise in green technology and the US's market influence present an opportunity to  forge a more balanced trade relationship and simultaneously reduce global carbon emissions. Another crucial area for collaboration is addressing low-income countries' debt burdens and managing competition in outer space. However, obstacles remain, including disagreements over human rights, Taiwan, Ukraine, and trade practices.</description>

			<title>How best to stop sexual violence in India isn’t obvious</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/how-best-to-stop-sexual-violence-in-india-isn-t-obvious-crimes-against-women-rape-kolkata-sexual-assault-society-11726231351664.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recurring problem of sexual assault in India, highlighting the cyclical response of outrage, temporary measures, and societal complacency that fails to address the root causes. The author argues that relying on punishments like capital punishment or increased security is ineffective and only treats the symptoms.

Instead, the article emphasizes the need to acknowledge the deeper societal issues that contribute to sexual violence. These include condoning everyday harassment, failing to protect victims, and protecting perpetrators instead of holding them accountable. 

The author points to the economic cost of sexual assault, as it restricts women's participation in the workforce and hinders national productivity. Ultimately, the article calls for a fundamental shift in societal attitudes and a commitment to zero tolerance towards any form of violence against women.</description>

			<title>The US Fed is under watch for more than just its policy rate</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-us-fed-is-under-watch-for-more-than-just-its-policy-rate-federal-reserve-interest-rates-rate-cut-employment-11726406972776.html</link>
			<description>The Federal Reserve (Fed) is widely expected to cut interest rates this week, marking a reversal from its previous hikes aimed at curbing inflation. While inflation is cooling closer to the Fed’s 2% target, the US economy is also showing signs of weakness, with job growth sputtering. This potential rate cut comes after a 30-month period of aggressive tightening, which has been credited with bringing inflation under control.

The article highlights concerns about the potential aftermath of the Fed's easy money policies, particularly concerning inflated asset values and risks to financial stability. There are also questions about how effectively the extensive stimulus measures implemented during the pandemic have been utilized. As the Fed balances its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, it faces the challenge of preventing another economic downturn while also mitigating the potential consequences of its past policies.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | What fresh EV subsidies tell us about their market</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-what-fresh-ev-subsidies-tell-us-about-their-market-electric-vehicles-climate-change-green-mobility-11726406129134.html</link>
			<description>A new subsidy scheme aims to boost electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India by providing financial incentives of ₹10,000 for electric two-wheelers and ₹50,000 for three-wheelers until March 2025. While this is seen as a step in the right direction for decarbonizing transportation, the continued reliance on subsidies highlights the slow pace of EV adoption.  

The scheme covers buses but excludes cars, despite their lagging transition. The lack of widespread charging infrastructure deters potential buyers.  The government remains hesitant about easing taxes on hybrids as a transitional step.  Increased competition in the EV market is seen as crucial for accelerating the shift, but progress in this area has been limited. Ultimately, the  success of India's EV transition may hinge on local technological advancements that make EVs more affordable and accessible.</description>

			<title>Royalty ruling: It’s ironic how a judgement can prove so taxing for an economy</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/royalty-ruling-it-s-ironic-how-a-judgement-can-prove-so-taxing-for-an-economy-supreme-court-tax-mining-iron-ore-11726232228077.html</link>
			<description>A 1990 Supreme Court judgement, India Cement vs State of Tamil Nadu, incorrectly stated that mining royalty was a tax. This error, called an "inadvertent error" by the court itself, was only recognised in 2004. Despite this, the ruling remained in effect for decades, causing confusion and legal ambiguity. 

A nine-judge bench finally overturned the India Cement decision in 2024, ruling that royalty is not a tax. The court attributed the initial error to a typographical mistake, but a dissenting opinion argued that the judges had intended royalty to be classified as a tax.  

This decades-long situation highlights concerns about the Supreme Court's accountability and its handling of errors in its judgements. It raises questions about why it took so long to correct the mistake and the impact these errors have on the implementation of law and policy.</description>

			<title>Why Ford now wants to make for the world from India</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ford-india-re-entry-electric-vehicles-ev-exports-tamil-nadu-auto-manufacturing-hub-11726400861017.html</link>
			<description>Ford Motor Co. is returning to India, reopening its Chennai manufacturing facility to serve as an export hub. While the company previously exited the Indian market in 2022 after accumulating losses, it maintained a presence through service and spare parts operations.  

Ford's decision to return is largely driven by India's established automotive ecosystem, robust export infrastructure, and government incentives for EV manufacturing.  Although the specific focus of the Chennai plant is unclear, Ford is reportedly considering producing affordable electric vehicles there, capitalizing on the growing global demand for EVs.  

India's vehicle exports reached $20 billion in 2023-24, solidifying its position as a significant player in the global automotive market. With a thriving manufacturing and supply chain network, Chennai, in particular, is a key export hub for passenger vehicles.</description>

			<title>India’s FDI restrictions need a rethink for a competitive economy</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-fdi-restrictions-need-a-rethink-for-a-competitive-economy-retail-online-platforms-digital-news-multibrand-retail-11726131474363.html</link>
			<description>India's economic growth hinges on easing the process of doing business and welcoming Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).  While India has made strides in improving its ranking for ease of doing business, restrictive FDI policies in key sectors like insurance, media, and e-commerce are hindering progress. These limitations stifle competition, innovation, and consumer choice. 

For instance, the 74% cap on foreign ownership in the insurance sector limits the entry and capital infusion of global players, potentially resulting in higher premiums and fewer options for consumers.  Similarly, restrictive FDI norms in the media and digital media sector stifle content diversity and innovation.  

The e-commerce and retail sector faces further complexities with multiple, differing FDI regimes, creating uncertainty and discouraging foreign investment.

To achieve its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy, India must adopt bold reforms that relax FDI restrictions in key sectors.  This will attract foreign investment, technology, and expertise, boosting job creation, enhancing productivity, and ultimately leading to a more competitive and prosperous India.</description>

			<title>US presidential debate: Harris seemed from Earth and Trump from Alpha Centauri</title>

			<description>The article assesses the climate positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump during their recent debate. While acknowledging that Harris' stance is not perfect, the author argues that it is far better than Trump's.  Harris, though continuing to support increased domestic gas production, highlights the Inflation Reduction Act's benefits for clean energy. She also shies away from banning fracking. Trump, on the other hand, rambles incoherently about climate change,  making misleading claims about manufacturing jobs and renewable energy, and reverting to his "drill, baby, drill" mantra.  Although Harris's position could be seen as compromising, the author concludes that it is necessary to balance climate concerns with economic realities and preventing Trump's more damaging approach from taking hold.</description>

			<title>Watch out, industrial strategy could leave us with a herd of white elephants</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/watch-out-industrial-strategy-could-leave-us-with-a-herd-of-white-elephants-chips-free-trade-national-security-11726129944681.html</link>
			<description>This article argues that while "industrial strategy," a modern rebranding of industrial policy, has some merit in improving public governance, its interventionism in the private sector is dangerous. 

The author critiques the idea of governments picking winners in industries like chip manufacturing, citing examples like the US's CHIPS and Science Act. He contends that these subsidies, while intended to boost domestic production and national security, distort markets, lead to inefficiencies, and stifle innovation. He believes that this approach ultimately harms the global economy, citing the resulting trade barriers and weakening of essential sectors like green technology.

The article urges for a global dialogue on the appropriate role of industrial strategy, emphasizing the need to prioritize market-driven solutions and avoid the pitfalls of costly government interventions.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: How unhealthy behaviour could deliver success</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/manu-joseph-how-unhealthy-behaviour-could-deliver-success-drinking-socializing-social-group-human-behaviour-nature-11726126031886.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the paradoxical relationship between success and unhealthy behavior. 

The author argues that modern success often hinges on participating in social gatherings that involve excessive alcohol consumption, late nights, and unhealthy foods. This is because these activities are where powerful individuals network and build relationships, which are essential for career advancement.

He acknowledges that prioritizing health, like former Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan, can be seen as a deviation from this norm and may lead to professional isolation. 

The author also observes that this culture of late-night socializing reinforces the idea that fun and connection happen outside of healthy habits, creating a social pressure to conform. He suggests that finding an ideal balance between health and success requires deliberate effort and may involve sacrificing some aspects of professional advancement.</description>

			<title>Will AI leave us humans jobless? Here’s why it’s very unlikely</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/will-ai-leave-us-humans-jobless-here-s-why-it-s-very-unlikely-nvidia-jobs-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-employment-11726125615217.html</link>
			<description>Concerns are growing regarding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on labor displacement and income inequality. While AI tools offer efficiency in tasks and data analysis, they often lack transparency in their decision-making processes and may displace workers across various skill levels.  

The article compares the current AI hype to the Y2K scare, suggesting that both may be overblown. Despite potential job losses in some sectors, the author argues that AI's reliance on human consumption will ultimately prevent complete labor redundancy.  Reallocation of labor, rather than complete displacement, is the likely outcome. 


New technology creates new products and services, requiring human labor for consumption. As technology advances, this cycle continues, creating a dynamic where labor evolves rather than disappears.  The author concludes that while AI will undoubtedly reshape the job market, concerns about complete labor obsolescence are unfounded.</description>

			<description>The increasing frequency and intensity of cyber attacks have made cybersecurity a top priority for CEOs in India. India is now the second most targeted nation in the Asia-Pacific region by cybercriminals.  

The article emphasizes that the responsibility for protecting companies from cyber threats lies with the CEO, who must quantify and mitigate these risks.  This includes investing in cybersecurity technology and talent,  collaborating with other CEOs and experts, and  advocating for stronger government regulation and enforcement.

  Factors contributing to this heightened risk include: evolving attack methods like phishing and deepfakes, the vulnerability of companies undergoing digital transformation, and the expanding attack surface due to increased reliance on third-party vendors.  Regulatory pressure is also mounting,  requiring greater transparency and accountability for data breaches.</description>

			<title>Regulators, like Caesar’s wife, must always be above suspicion</title>

			<description>The controversy surrounding Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch intensifies as the Indian National Congress accuses her of a conflict of interest. The Congress alleges that her consulting firm, Agora Advisory, received fees from entities regulated by Sebi even after she took office, despite previous rejections of preferential treatment claims from those entities.  

Buch, who previously owned a Singapore-based consultancy, Agora Partners, until her husband assumed ownership shortly after her Sebi appointment, denies any impropriety. However, the accusations raise concerns about transparency and potential favoritism in regulatory oversight. 

Calls for a complete probe into the allegations and for Buch to step aside until her name is cleared are gaining momentum. Experts emphasize the need for stronger safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest in financial regulations and advocate for a bipartisan approach to appointments for regulatory heads.  They argue that maintaining public trust is crucial for the integrity of India's equity market and its wider economic implications.</description>

			<description>SpaceX's recent Polaris Dawn mission marks a significant step in private spacefaring. The mission featured the first commercial spacewalk, with SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis and billionaire Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4Payments, venturing outside the Crew Dragon spacecraft at an altitude of 700km. While the mission also involved testing SpaceX's Starlink satellite communication equipment, it underscores the growing potential of space tourism. 

Commercial space travel, initially a luxury for the ultra-wealthy, may depend on economic viability to expand further. However, its success in attracting a wider audience remains uncertain.</description>

			<title>Run a firm in founder or manager mode? There’s no clear answer</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/run-a-firm-in-founder-or-manager-mode-there-s-no-clear-answer-management-corporate-governance-family-businesses-11726050218851.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing debate between 'founder mode' and 'manager mode' in Indian businesses.  Founder mode is characterized by strong centralized control by the founder, while manager mode emphasizes delegation and professional autonomy.  

Many Indian companies, particularly family-owned businesses, struggle with transitioning from founder mode. This is due to a reluctance to relinquish control, even to qualified professionals. 

Despite sending managers for training, communication gaps persist between promoters (founders) and professionals, leading to frustration on both sides. 

The article points out that venture capital and private equity investments can also complicate this dynamic, putting pressure on founders to share decision-making power.  Finally, the article highlights the increasing instance of family businesses facing succession crises, potentially opening up opportunities for professional managers to take on more prominent roles and build their own legacies.</description>

			<title>Trump’s dollar defence plan: It’ll hurt more than benefit the US</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/trumps-dollar-defence-plan-it-ll-hurt-more-than-benefit-the-us-dollar-dominance-dollar-index-foreign-currency-11726048973069.html</link>
			<description>Donald Trump claims the dollar is under attack and countries are moving away from it. He asserts that this is a grave threat and proposes a 100% tariff on goods from nations that abandon the dollar as their primary currency. However, the opposite is true. 

The U.S. dollar remains the world’s primary reserve currency, with its dominance increasing since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. 
The global use of the dollar in transactions has surged, and foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities continue to grow under President Biden.

In contrast, during Trump’s presidency, the dollar’s share of global currency reserves declined, reaching its lowest point since 1995. 

Trump's proposal, experts warn, could backfire by driving countries further away from the dollar, potentially destabilizing global markets and harming the U.S. economy.</description>

			<title>Strengthen industrial statistics to get a true picture of manufacturing</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/strengthen-industrial-statistics-to-get-a-true-picture-of-manufacturing-data-statistics-iip-asi-nss-mospi-economy-11726046672569.html</link>
			<description>India's statistical system relies on three major indicators to track industrial performance: the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), and manufacturing-related data within National Accounts statistics.  

While the ASI is the primary source for detailed industrial analysis, it suffers from limitations. Its sampling frame, based on factory registrations, excludes many modern establishments, especially those utilizing outsourcing or IT. This results in an incomplete picture, particularly regarding high-value-added manufacturing.

The 2011-12 shift to using the MCA database for National Accounts, while comprehensive,  involves allocating a company's entire value addition to its primary sector, leading to imprecise sectoral assessments. This is because some services and manufacturing activities are interwoven, particularly in the context of Industry 4.0.

The author proposes a two-pronged solution. Utilizing the GST registration database, with its  establishment-based structure and turnover threshold, can improve ASI coverage and capture multi-state enterprises. Detailed GST filings can offer a comprehensive view of production and input usage, although separate surveys would be needed for employment data.  

Additionally, leveraging the Collection of Statistics Act (2008) for a follow-up survey of large listed companies could fill gaps in MCA data, as their management systems hold more detailed information than factory records.  To begin, simply shifting the ASI sampling frame to the GST register and using GST data for reports on sectoral value addition is a feasible step, allowing for precise, timely, and comprehensive industrial performance assessment.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the rising political issue of immigration, citing examples like Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric in the US and the growth of anti-immigrant parties in Europe. 

Despite global migration rates remaining relatively stable, countries like the US and Australia have significant foreign-born populations. The article highlights the economic benefits of immigration but acknowledges the cultural anxieties it can trigger, especially in Europe where concerns about Islamization and the erosion of traditional values are prevalent. 

The author uses the example of India, where internal migration is widespread, to illustrate how cultural differences can lead to tensions even within a single country.  They argue for proactive policies to manage migration and promote tolerance, emphasizing the importance of  economic prosperity and national solidarity.</description>

			<description>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is facing challenges due to inadequate charging infrastructure.  The high cost and complexity of setting up fast-charging stations, coupled with competition from cheaper home and workplace charging options, make it difficult for charging network operators to be profitable.  

Despite government incentives, the rollout of fast-charging stations is lagging behind targets. Several companies operating charging networks have resorted to job cuts and are exploring different business models to remain viable.

One potential solution lies in integrating fast-charging stations with other revenue streams, such as convenience stores or grocery stores, as seen with retailers like Carrefour and Walmart. This approach, similar to how gas stations supplement fuel sales with convenience items, could make fast-charging stations more financially viable and accelerate the adoption of EVs.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the current boom in IPOs in India, highlighting the significant increase in funds raised through this method. It points out that a high proportion of allotted IPO shares are quickly sold, suggesting a 'greater fool' theory at play where investors buy hoping to resell at a higher price. 

The article draws parallels with historical financial bubbles, citing examples like the South Sea Bubble and the recent crypto frenzy. It emphasizes the warning of bubbles recurring throughout history and the inevitability of a bust. The author uses Isaac Newton's experience with the South Sea Bubble to illustrate how even brilliant individuals succumb to the allure of quick profits in a bubble, ultimately losing substantial sums. The article concludes by cautioning readers against current speculative trends, advising them to only participate if they possess exceptional knowledge and insight surpassing even that of Isaac Newton.</description>

			<title>China’s export thrust is pushing tariffs up across Asia</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/chinas-export-thrust-is-pushing-tariffs-up-across-asia-international-trade-india-trade-war-rcep-imf-globalization-11725965393079.html</link>
			<description>Growing concerns over the surge of cheap Chinese imports are spreading across Southeast Asia.  Countries like Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are facing challenges from a range of industries, from textiles to electronics and automobiles. The flood of goods, sometimes at prices below half those of local competitors, is putting pressure on domestic manufacturers and driving job losses. 

Faced with this,  Southeast Asian governments are responding with measures like raising tariffs and investigating unfair pricing practices. Experts point to two main factors behind this wave of Chinese exports: a persistent reliance on industrial growth and exports, despite calls for greater domestic consumption, and a property bubble burst that has spurred Beijing to ramp up manufacturing capacity.  Despite subsidies reaching record levels, concerns are mounting that China is entering a period of intensified deflation, which could further lead to export-driven pressures in the region.</description>

			<title>India’s renewable energy target may prove elusive without course correction</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-renewable-energy-target-may-prove-elusive-without-course-correction-green-energy-clean-energy-solar-energy-power-11725964576445.html</link>
			<description>India's energy future heavily relies on solar power. Projections show solar-based capacity reaching 1,000 GW by 2047, a significant leap from the current 85 GW.  

While India's renewable energy (RE) capacity is growing rapidly, challenges remain in integrating RE into the grid. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) between RE producers and distribution companies (discoms) are not executed at rates that align with market prices, leading to an "unsold inventory" of RE.   Discoms face difficulties forecasting demand, adjusting coal-based power plants, and reflecting the costs of RE obligations in consumer tariffs.  

A new approach is needed to incentivize RE integration. It should involve equitable risk-sharing between producers and discoms, exploring market-based dispatch systems, and encouraging discoms to choose cost-effective RE options.  Long-term PPAs with reduced duration (15 years), coupled with short-term market-based deals, will play a crucial role. These measures can ensure a smooth transition to a cleaner energy future while keeping consumer tariffs in check.</description>

			<title>Unilever’s ice-cream business hive-off: Should HUL follow its parent’s exit?</title>

			<description>Unilever, a multinational corporation, is spinning off its ice-cream business, prompting speculation that its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), might follow suit.  

While Unilever cited business efficiency reasons, such as seasonality and complexity of the ice-cream supply chain, analysts suggest the move could be a way to maximize shareholder value by separating distinct business units.  

HUL's ice-cream venture, which includes brands like Kwality Walls, has been successful in India, leveraging its extensive distribution network and Unilever's brand recognition.  

Experts argue that HUL could continue the business independently, dropping the "Walls" branding and utilizing local resources to address potential research gaps. 

Ultimately, HUL's decision will likely depend on a careful assessment of the Indian market and its own long-term strategic goals.</description>

			<description>Due to sluggish sales, India's car market is experiencing a wave of discounts and promotional schemes. Tata Motors has recently reduced prices on some models by up to ₹2 lakh. Dealers are reportedly facing significant inventory, totaling around ₹80,000 crore, which poses a risk to profitability for both dealers and the overall industry. Excessive rainfall is believed to be a factor contributing to the slowdown in demand, as potential buyers may be delaying purchases. The upcoming festive season will be a crucial test for the market, with mass-market car manufacturers hoping for a recovery.  However, prolonged discounting is not a long-term solution.</description>

			<title>White Revolution 2.0: Milk sufficiency for all</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/white-revolution-2-0-milk-sufficiency-for-all-national-milk-day-family-household-consumption-expenditure-survey-11725883940858.html</link>
			<description>This article examines the impact of family size on milk consumption in India. Using data from the National Household Consumption Survey 2022-23, the authors find that, on average, two-child families spend 30-32% less on milk per person compared to one-child families.

This lower spending is attributed to a combination of factors, including limited increases in family income and competing priorities for essential expenditures like education and healthcare. While two-child families spend a smaller portion of their income on milk, they allocate a slightly higher share than one-child families.

The authors highlight a concerning trend: even in the lowest income quartile, milk spending by single-child families is low.  They emphasize the importance of addressing nutritional gaps in India, particularly for children, and suggest policy interventions like expanding programs like the Gift Milk Initiative to increase milk consumption.


While acknowledging challenges like rising milk prices driven by production costs, the authors conclude by calling for India's "White Revolution 2.0" to ensure adequate access to this essential nutritional source for all.</description>

			<title>OPEC+ has postponed a tough decision it can’t put off for long</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/opec-has-postponed-a-tough-decision-it-can-t-put-off-for-long-crude-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia-brent-nymex-11725883105731.html</link>
			<description>OPEC+ recently delayed an output increase, hoping to shore up oil prices which had fallen to a one-year low. This short-term action won't solve the underlying issue of supply exceeding demand. Analysts predict further price drops unless OPEC+ takes more drastic measures, like cutting production, in the near future.  Current projections show the need for OPEC+ oil will decrease in the coming months.  Saudi Arabia,  a key player in OPEC+, wants to raise prices but is facing opposition from other members.  The group's tentative agreement highlights internal disagreements and raises concerns about their ability to effectively control the market in the long term.</description>

			<title>India’s urban agglomerations are no longer held back by state boundaries</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/indias-urban-agglomerations-are-no-longer-held-back-by-state-boundaries-economy-trade-gst-tamil-nadu-karnataka-11725882519751.html</link>
			<description>Urban agglomerations in India are increasingly spilling across state borders, creating new challenges for Indian federalism.  This trend is driven by factors like improved infrastructure and the implementation of GST, which has facilitated the growth of integrated economic zones. 

Examples include Sarjapura in Karnataka being closer to the Tamil Nadu town of Hosur, and the proximity of Sri City in Andhra Pradesh to Chennai, Tamil Nadu. 

These cross-border urban zones require new forms of cooperation between states to manage their growth and ensure efficient infrastructure and urban planning. There are also potential future challenges, such as people identifying more strongly with a neighboring economic zone than their own state.


The article suggests that we can expect more of this cross-border integration, and that managing it effectively will be crucial for the future of Indian federalism.</description>

			<title>Thank digital tools for small businesses going formal on their own</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/thank-digital-tools-for-small-businesses-going-formal-on-their-own-digital-public-infrastructure-formalization-tax-gst-11725881660755.html</link>
			<description>While India's digital public infrastructure (DPI) has seen impressive growth, questions remain about its accessibility and usage by those most in need.

Initial scepticism stems from India's large cash economy and reluctance among small businesses to formalize due to perceived higher liabilities with minimal benefits. However, recent trends suggest a shift.  The number of businesses registered on the GST platform has surged, boosting tax collections significantly.

The IMF suggests that other countries can learn from India's experience. They propose a three-step approach: simplify entry into the formal financial system, align incentives to make it advantageous for businesses to operate formally, and offer tax-based incentives for formalization.

Crucially, these efforts should prioritize citizen-driven participation, ensuring individuals understand the benefits of formal engagement in the economy and feel it's in their best interest.</description>

			<title>Why India needs a sovereign wealth fund now</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sovereign-wealth-fund-swfs-temasek-gic-forex-reserves-niif-global-financial-crisis-government-debt-return-on-investment-11725940083167.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the potential benefits and risks of India establishing a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). 

Unlike nations with current account surpluses that typically fund SWFs, India's reserves stem largely from capital inflows. The article argues that this presents an opportunity, as investing a portion of these reserves in an SWF could yield higher returns than traditional sovereign debt investments. 

An SWF could contribute to India's strategic interests by securing stakes in strategic industries abroad, supporting external projects funded by Indian foreign aid, and gaining access to cutting-edge technologies.

The article suggests adopting a structure similar to Singapore's Temasek or GIC, owned by the central bank, to ensure operational autonomy and focus on strategic investments. Ensuring ethical management through professional leadership, robust oversight mechanisms, and a strong whistleblower policy is crucial. 


Ultimately, the article concludes that the potential benefits of an SWF, coupled with appropriate safeguards, outweigh the risks, making it a compelling proposition for India.</description>

			<title>Here’s why the shares of small businesses sell at inflated prices</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/sme-ipos-shares-small-businesses-sme-platform-inflated-prices-stock-markets-retail-investors-11725880737088.html</link>
			<description>The surge in initial public offerings (IPOs) by companies listed on the SME platform has raised concerns regarding insufficient checks and balances. There are worries that chartered accountants, exchanges, and merchant bankers are not conducting adequate due diligence, potentially leading to inflated valuations and risky investment decisions. 

History highlights similar occurrences in various bubbles, such as the dotcom bubble and the 1990s IPOs in India where promoters disappeared with raised funds.  The inherent nature of limited liability incentivizes those selling shares to maximize profits, sometimes at the expense of investor protection. 

While Sebi has issued advisories, expecting due diligence from those selling shares may be unrealistic, given their profit-driven motives. As investors rush into promising ventures, market sentiment can become driven by speculation rather than fundamental values.</description>

			<description>Nvidia, with its dominant 80% market share in AI chips, is facing increased scrutiny from the US Justice Department. Concerns stem from Nvidia's alleged control over chip allocation due to high demand and its potential to punish customers who deal with rivals. While Nvidia denies engaging in exclusivity practices, regulators are investigating its contract terms and the impact of its market power. 

Additionally, Nvidia's acquisition of Run:ai, a software firm, is under review for its potential to further consolidate its position. 

The potential for AI to create a winner-takes-all market and its significant impact on society are driving proactive antitrust measures, extending to both AI software and hardware providers like Nvidia.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Is a GST rate cut for insurance good news?</title>

			<description>Discussions are underway to potentially reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on life and health insurance premiums from 18% to 5%, a rate designated for essential goods.  While this move is positive, it highlights a deviation from the GST regime's initial principles of minimal rate adjustments and reduced influence of lobbying groups. The ideal scenario envisioned for GST was a single rate for most items, with specific slabs for items requiring unique treatment. Although insurance may fall into a grey area, the potential reduction in premiums is a welcome development for consumers.</description>

			<description>This article argues that improving the quality of primary education in India is crucial for the country's development. It highlights that despite high enrollment rates, learning outcomes in reading and arithmetic remain stagnant. 

The article cites the success of East Asian nations, whose investment in education contributed to their economic growth. It emphasizes the importance of  parental literacy, particularly maternal literacy, and suggests interventions like improved school infrastructure, learning materials, pedagogy, and teacher incentives to enhance learning outcomes. 

Finally, it stresses the National Education Policy (NEP 2020)'s role in setting the stage for this transformation, calling for tangible progress in foundational literacy and digital skills for India's future prosperity.</description>

			<description>This article explores the concept of email hierarchy, drawing parallels with primate social structures.  

It argues that email exchanges often involve an inherent power dynamic, where the sender typically has a lower status than the recipient. This dynamic influences the time and effort invested in crafting emails, with lower-status individuals often expending more effort to impress their superiors. 

The author uses examples like students writing to professors and experts requesting interviews to illustrate this point.  The article suggests that recognizing this status game can help us navigate the often overwhelming world of email more effectively. It advises spending minimal time on emails from lower-status correspondents and treating those from higher-status individuals with more care. However, it acknowledges that navigating unclear status relationships, such as those between colleagues, can be more challenging.</description>

			<description>The article argues that India should approach its "challenging" neighborhood with the understanding that it cannot single-handedly determine the future of its neighbors.  It criticizes those who blame New Delhi for every regional instability, pointing out that India's success, particularly its rise on the global stage, has come despite these challenges and the turmoil in many neighboring economies. 

The author uses Bangladesh and the Maldives as examples, highlighting that recent political changes in these countries are more a result of internal dynamics than a reflection of Indian policy successes or failures.  

The piece concludes by urging India to continue investing in its neighbors but to do so realistically, recognizing that the outcome ultimately lies with the countries themselves. India should focus on being a global power rather than getting too entangled in the complexities of its immediate region.</description>

			<description>Despite significant investments and the rise of CX leadership roles and consulting practices, customer satisfaction remains low in India.  

Companies are struggling to bridge the gap between expectations and reality, as evidenced by long wait times, difficulty reaching human agents, and unresolved complaints. 

While technology like AI and chatbots are being implemented, there's a need to combine them with personalized human interaction. 

Addressing service quality issues, improving cross-functional collaboration, and integrating feedback across channels are crucial for companies to achieve true customer satisfaction.</description>

			<description>India is making a concerted effort to become a major player in the global semiconductor industry.  Building on deals with the US and EU, a recent pact with Singapore aims to establish India as a hub for chip-making by 2030. Singapore offers India access to advanced technology, a skilled workforce, and a business-friendly environment.

India's strategy focuses on producing "mature node chips," which are used in a variety of applications and require lower upfront investments compared to high-end chips. The government has approved several semiconductor projects and established a $10 billion fund to attract further investment. With a growing talent pool and a supportive policy framework, India is well-positioned to overcome its semiconductor struggles and strengthen its position in the global technology landscape.</description>

			<description>Donald Trump proposes a shift in US foreign policy, favoring trade tariffs over financial sanctions. He argues that while financial sanctions may weaken the US dollar's global influence, tariffs harm global trade and lead to economic inefficiency, reminiscent of pre-World War II mercantilist policies. 

Trump believes fostering frictionless world trade is the best way to prevent conflict and maintain America's standing on the world stage. He also emphasizes the need to avoid "nuclear warming" and mitigate the risk of another catastrophic war.</description>

			<title>Pension alert: Even the unified scheme could acquire a sell-by date over time</title>

			<description>This article analyzes the Indian government's recent decision to introduce a Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) after years of promoting the New Pension System (NPS). This sudden shift is attributed to political pressure, with opposition parties promising the reintroduction of the old pension scheme (OPS).

Five states have already restored the OPS, and the BJP's electoral losses in key states have further fueled this trend. The article emphasizes concerns about the efficacy of the existing pension system, noting India's low ranking in the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index. 

It highlights the inadequacy of pension payouts, especially considering rising healthcare costs and inflation.  The reliance on fixed-income investments within the NPS is criticized as it has led to low returns, failing to keep pace with inflation.  

The article concludes by suggesting that the government must either increase funding for pensions, beef up investment in public healthcare, or implement stricter regulations on private healthcare to mitigate the growing disconnect between pensions and the cost of living in retirement.</description>

			<description>Following the suicide of a popular TikTok creator in Malaysia who was targeted by cyberbullies, the government announced sweeping new social media licensing requirements. Authorities aim to curb online harms like scams and cyberbullying, but critics fear the regulations will stifle free speech.  

The plan requires platforms with over 8 million users in Malaysia to obtain a license and adhere to yet-to-be-determined conditions. Some worry these guidelines could be used to suppress dissent, pointing to the government’s history of restricting media freedom and its increasing  requests for content removal from TikTok.  

While Malaysian officials argue the licensing scheme is necessary to hold Big Tech accountable, they lack specifics on how it will address cyberbullying.  Critics point out that more immediate steps, such as more robust platform policing and criminalizing cyberbullying, might be more effective.

This situation highlights the global struggle to balance online safety with free expression, with Malaysia becoming a potential test case for navigating this complex issue.</description>

			<title>E-commerce is impacting Indian jobs and consumer welfare</title>

			<description>A recent study by Pahle India Foundation and PRICE reveals the growing impact of e-commerce in India. Over 90% of urban respondents spend significant time online, with 85% shopping online weekly.

Cash-on-delivery (COD) and UPI remain the most popular payment methods, highlighting trust concerns around alternative digital options. 

The study found that convenience is the biggest benefit of e-commerce for consumers, but challenges remain in cost-effectiveness and grievance redressal.

While online sellers have seen job growth and increased profitability through digital tools, traditional offline retailers struggle with digital adoption due to technological barriers and concerns about competition.  

The study emphasizes the need for government support for offline retailers through training programs, infrastructure improvements, and financial incentives. Addressing trust issues with digital payments and investing in reskilling initiatives are crucial for ensuring that the benefits of e-commerce are shared widely.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: Why Indian cities may be doomed to remain unliveable</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/manu-joseph-why-indian-cities-may-be-doomed-to-remain-unliveable-nitin-gadkari-urban-development-11725781457626.html</link>
			<description>The article laments the state of Indian cities, describing them as  unliveable and ugly.  

The author criticizes the Indian elite for their lack of investment in improving urban life, attributing their focus on migration abroad as a key factor. They argue that while successful nations were transformed by their elites, India's elite has been consistently absent from shaping its cities.

Despite the pessimism, the author offers a sliver of hope, suggesting that India's growing prosperity and the returning interest of a new economic elite might signal a shift in priorities. This new elite,  discontented with Western life and seeking opportunities in India, could potentially invest in and improve urban infrastructure, leading to safer roads, greener spaces, and a more aesthetically pleasing environment. Ultimately, the author believes that a renewed commitment from India's elite  could be the key to uplifting its urban landscape.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the public outcry following a heinous crime against a woman in West Bengal and highlights the systemic lack of faith in the Indian justice system. The author argues that quick fixes like fast-track courts are ineffective and that a comprehensive solution requires significant reform of police and law enforcement. 

The author cites a study showing abysmally low conviction rates and lengthy delays in investigations and court proceedings, leading to a cycle of impunity for criminals and discouragement for victims.  Solutions proposed include: 

* Setting up specialist investigation units within police departments 
* Publicizing successful prosecutions to deter crime
* Establishing case progression units to prevent bureaucracy-related delays

The author emphasises the need for national leadership and cooperative federalism to bring about lasting change, advocating for a national blue ribbon commission to develop policy recommendations. Ultimately, the article calls for a systemic overhaul of the indian law enforcement system to protect citizens and restore faith in justice.</description>

			<title>Sheikh Hasina’s extradition conundrum: What are India’s options?</title>

			<description>Sheikh Hasina's potential extradition from India due to demands from Bangladesh has created a complex dilemma for India. While traditionally viewed as a close ally, this situation necessitates a careful balancing act. India can invoke exception clauses within the extradition treaty based on the political nature of the accusations and lack of good faith, but this risks straining bilateral relations. 

India needs to move beyond its perception as an ally of Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League specifically, and instead see itself as a partner of Bangladesh as a whole. Engaging with Bangladesh's opposition parties, including the BNP, is crucial. Additionally, avoiding the "minority card"  in domestic politics will prevent an unfavorable reaction in Bangladesh. 

Ultimately, a pragmatic diplomatic approach that considers both international law and the complex realities of Bangladesh's political landscape is required.</description>

			<description>AI and Generative AI are rapidly transforming businesses across sectors in India, promising significant economic growth and increased profits.  

A study indicates that successful AI adoption could boost India's GDP by 1.4 percentage points annually and add ₹1.5-2.5 trillion to the profits of the top 500 Indian companies in five years.  

Meta's research reveals that Indian businesses are eager to embrace Generative AI, with over 80% planning to invest in it within the next two years. The company is actively developing AI-powered tools for businesses, including  conversational agents that emulate human-like interactions.  

While AI offers immense potential, human expertise remains crucial for understanding customer contexts, interpreting data, and crafting effective creative strategies.  As AI evolves,  new job roles will emerge, requiring skills in areas like visual and copy editing to manage the volume of AI-generated content.  


Industry-wide collaboration is essential to train AI models on brand-specific insights and ensure accessibility of these technologies for businesses of all sizes.</description>

			<title>Women savers could help India accelerate bank deposit growth</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/women-savers-bank-accounts-for-women-bank-deposit-growth-indian-economy-women-empowerment-rbi-credit-deposit-ratio-11725599650124.html</link>
			<description>The article highlights the growing concern of declining deposit growth in the Indian banking sector and proposes addressing this issue by engaging women as depositors.  

A significant gap exists as women currently hold only 20.5% of total bank deposits despite having a high percentage of bank accounts.  The reason behind this limited participation is attributed to a lack of formalized, accessible, and appealing savings products tailored to their unique needs and circumstances.

The article suggests that innovative financial products and solutions, along with increased financial literacy programs specifically designed for women, can help bridge this gap. It emphasizes the immense potential of women's participation in formal savings, citing data showing that even small contributions from a large segment of women could significantly contribute to overall deposit growth. 


Empowering women through financial inclusion is not only a social equity issue but also a strategic imperative for the long-term stability and growth of the banking sector and the Indian economy.</description>

			<description>Indian business schools are gaining global recognition, with ISB Hyderabad ranking sixth on LinkedIn's 2024 list of top MBA programs.  India's B-schools offer high-quality education at a fraction of the cost of their US counterparts, making them attractive options for international students.  

Despite this, India faces challenges in transforming itself into a global education hub. These include limited seat availability and concerns about the quality of education in some institutions.  

The National Education Policy 2020 aims to address these issues by encouraging foreign universities to set up campuses in India. However, a lack of clarity around academic freedom may be deterring some investors.  

Overcoming these challenges and fostering a more open and competitive education sector could lead to India becoming a major destination for international students.</description>

			<description>Kamala Harris has unveiled new economic policies in an effort to appeal to a broader range of voters.  These proposals include increased startup deductions, expanded child tax credits, middle-class tax cuts, and down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.  

This strategy reflects a "pivot to the center" as Harris seeks to counter criticism from Republicans who label her as too leftist. This move follows her previous backpedaling on her stance against fracking.  The upcoming televised debate is expected to have a significant impact on the race.</description>

			<title>Who is Madhabi Puri Buch really accountable to?</title>

			<description>The article discusses the lack of clear accountability for regulators in India, using Madhabi Buch, the head of Sebi, as an example. Criticisms have been leveled against her, including accusations of harsh language, conflicts of interest related to her husband's investments and consultancy work, and interference in corporate mergers. 

The article argues that Buch should clarify these allegations, but questions who she should be accountable to. It proposes that parliamentary standing committees on relevant subjects, such as the finance committee where Buch could testify quarterly, would be the most suitable forum for this accountability. 
 
The author examines each of the charges against Buch, finding some to be unfounded while emphasizing the need for transparency regarding her husband's consultancy firm.</description>

			<title>The Wayanad landslide holds lessons on the governance of fragile zones</title>

			<description>The article discusses the devastating landslides in Wayanad, India, attributing them to both extreme rainfall amplified by climate change and the vulnerability of the landscape due to unchecked construction, mining, and quarrying. 

The author highlights two previous reports – one by the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) in 2011 and another by the Kasturirangan Committee in 2013 – both advocating for stricter environmental regulations in the Western Ghats region. However, these recommendations, particularly the WGEEP's proposal to designate ecologically sensitive zones (ESZ), have not been implemented, leaving the region vulnerable. 

The author criticizes the Indian government's tendency to establish committees instead of taking decisive action, emphasizing the role of Parliament's standing committees in assessing and implementing expert recommendations. 

He points to the lack of public resistance against environmentally damaging practices despite their risks, potentially due to the allure of short-term job opportunities. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a strong commitment from both the central and state governments to prioritize sustainability and protect ecologically sensitive areas.</description>

			<description>Pavel Durov, the creator of Telegram, was arrested in France facing charges related to child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking, and money laundering. The situation has drawn attention globally, with contrasting reactions from various countries. While the app remains operational in France, concerns are rising about potential regulation of similar platforms. 

This incident highlights the complexities of investigating cybercrime and the need for robust judicial capacities to tackle evolving digital challenges. India, facing its own cybercrime surge, should focus on building specialized investigative units and avoid arbitrary app bans, mirroring France's approach. Further, India must be cautious about protectionist app regulations, ensuring they don't hinder the development of a healthy digital ecosystem.</description>

			<title>Revise direct taxes: Corporate taxation needs to be progressive</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/corporate-taxation-income-tax-government-revenue-tax-reform-direct-taxes-regressive-taxes-employment-tax-slabs-11725501378865.html</link>
			<description>Over the past two decades, India has focused heavily on direct tax reforms, primarily concerning income tax, while corporate taxes have received less attention despite contributing significantly to direct tax revenue. 

The effective corporate tax rate has declined steadily, reaching its lowest point after 2019 due to substantial tax breaks given to companies. While these breaks were intended to stimulate investment and job creation, the results have been underwhelming. 

The Economic Survey itself acknowledged the private sector's failure to invest or generate employment despite these tax incentives. The 2019 reforms, rather than promoting a progressive tax structure, have arguably made it more regressive, with the wealthiest companies benefiting the most. The outcome has been a sharp decline in effective tax rates, a rise in corporate profits, and a reduction in employee costs as a proportion of sales. 


This sluggishness in investment and job creation highlights the need to rethink corporate tax policies. Experts argue that fixing corporate taxation is crucial for meaningful direct tax reforms and achieving equitable growth.</description>

			<title>Imperial Blue is up for sale: A win for gender sensitivity?</title>

			<description>Pernod Ricard has decided to sell its popular Imperial Blue whisky brand in India.  This move is likely driven by the company's focus on premium brands like Glenlivet and Jameson. 

The  decision coincides with  regulatory challenges Pernod Ricard faces in India, including license issues and tax disputes. However, an unstated reason might be a desire to distance the brand from its past association with a sexist advertising tagline: "Men will be Men."  

Though  this campaign was successful two decades ago,  attitudes have shifted significantly. Modern consumers, especially women, are less tolerant of gender insensitive marketing.  

Companies need to be sensitive to these changing views and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.  Shedding sexist associations, even indirectly, is a step towards creating a more inclusive and respectful marketplace.</description>

			<description>This article analyzes the tax contributions of individuals and corporations in India. It states that while individual income taxes may appear higher at first glance, when analyzing aggregate data, corporations pay a larger proportion of taxes relative to their Gross Total Income (GTI) than individuals do.

The article cites data from the Income Tax Department showing that between 2020-21 and 2022-23, corporations paid an average of 18.2% to 18.7% of their GTI in taxes, compared to individuals' 9.4% to 10.9%. This trend holds true even when factoring in the change in dividend taxation policy since 2020-21, where dividend income is now taxed at the individual level. 

The article also compares India's tax structure to the US, noting that individual income tax collections are significantly higher in the US than corporate tax collections. It concludes that globally competitive corporate tax rates are essential for India to attract investment and stimulate economic growth, ultimately benefiting both individuals and corporations.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/income-tax-corporate-taxation-india-s-middle-class-consumption-tax-policy-inflation-unemployment-regressive-taxation-11725503484923.html</link>
			<description>This article argues that India's tax system has become increasingly regressive, disproportionately burdening the middle class. 

It points to the decrease in corporate tax revenue as a result of tax cuts implemented in 2019, despite the lack of corresponding benefits in terms of increased investment or economic growth. 

The article highlights the economic struggles of the middle class, citing factors like stagnant salaries, high GST rates, persistent inflation, and rising unemployment.   

It contrasts India's approach with global trends, where countries are moving towards more equitable tax policies that prioritize reducing inequality.

The author calls for tax reforms that create a more transparent and progressive system, where those with greater means contribute a fairer share to support national development.</description>

			<title>Deposits won’t grow faster; it is time for credit growth to slow down</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/deposits-credit-growth-rbi-system-liquidity-11725465990059.html</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is deliberately managing deposit growth by implementing a "withdrawal of liquidity" stance. This policy aims to curb excessive credit expansion.  

The RBI has used various tools, like repo auctions and managing reserve money growth, to influence deposit levels. While deposit growth remains stable near 12%, the composition is shifting, favoring term and bulk deposits over Casa deposits due to higher interest rates. 

To mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on bulk deposits, the RBI has advised caution and introduced a new liquidity coverage ratio framework to encourage more granular deposits.  

The RBI has also taken a strong stance on credit, addressing excesses in specific segments and products. By increasing risk weights and issuing cease-and-desist orders, the central bank aims to ensure financial stability.

As a result of these actions, credit growth is expected to moderate to 12.5-13% in FY25, from 16% the previous year.  The widening credit-deposit ratio is anticipated to converge in the coming year, aligning with the RBI's Financial Stability report analysis.  This slowdown in credit growth will also provide a test of the quality of credit originated during the post-pandemic period of easy money.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | AI chip-maker Nvidia’s share crash is a reality check</title>

			<description>Global stock markets declined on Wednesday, influenced by a downturn in US markets triggered by Nvidia's shares. Nvidia experienced a 9.5% drop after news of a US Department of Justice subpoena related to alleged monopoly practices. Investor confidence was further shaken by Nvidia's recent quarterly earnings report, which fell short of expectations. Despite this, Nvidia's shares remain significantly up year-to-date, reflecting the robust demand for its AI-powered chips. However, the recent correction suggests that market expectations may be adjusting to reality.</description>

			<title>Do responses to the Hindenburg report reveal a colonial hangover?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sebi-madhabi-puri-buch-hindenburg-report-adani-colonial-mindset-western-narratives-british-raj-credibility-11725414371389.html</link>
			<description>The article critiques the automatic acceptance of foreign analyses, particularly those from Western sources, in India. It argues that this tendency reflects a lingering colonial mindset, where external perspectives are viewed as inherently more credible and authoritative than domestic ones. 

This, the author suggests, is evident in the immediate call for investigations into allegations made against Indian institutions by foreign entities, without due scrutiny of the allegations themselves.  

The author contrasts this with the apparent disregard for criticism of Western policies and institutions from non-Western sources, highlighting a one-sided dynamic. 

The article concludes by calling for a shift towards greater self-reliance and trust in Indian institutions, urging a critical examination of foreign assessments and a stronger assertion of an independent Indian narrative.</description>

			<title>There is no such thing as ‘unskilled labour’: Drop its use.</title>

			<description>This article argues against the term "unskilled" labor, stating that it is demeaning and misleading. 

The author contends that the market value of skills doesn't reflect their inherent human value.  With AI potentially automating many jobs, the focus should shift to valuing "soft skills" like empathy and communication, which are harder for AI to replicate. 

The article highlights the growing importance of service sector jobs and  urges a re-evaluation of the worth of caregiving roles.  Ultimately, it emphasizes that human worth transcends market value and is defined by our ability to connect, contribute, and care for one another.</description>

			<title>Tactical voting can play a big role: Lessons from Barmer and Ladakh poll results</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/tactical-voting-barmer-ladakh-poll-results-voter-behaviour-bjp-congress-independent-candidates-first-past-the-post-11725415498897.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 Lok Sabha elections in the vastly different regions of Barmer (Rajasthan) and Ladakh (Jammu and Kashmir) revealed intriguing similarities. Both constituencies, dominated by specific communities (Jats in Barmer and Leh Buddhists and Kargil Shia Muslims in Ladakh), witnessed tight contests with candidates from the dominant groups.  The BJP and Congress fielded candidates from these communities, leading to triangular contests, where independent candidates from the next-dominant group also made a strong showing.  Tactical voting, influenced by perceptions of candidate winnability, weighed heavily in Barmer, leading to a Congress victory despite the BJP's performance in the 2023 assembly elections. 
In Ladakh, a split in Buddhist votes benefited the independent Shia candidate, who won decisively. These contrasting outcomes demonstrate  the complexity of Indian politics where community dynamics, party strategies, and voter psychology intersect in unpredictable ways.</description>

			<title>Unsafe harbour: Social media platforms are being hauled up for what others post</title>

			<description>The article discusses tensions between social media platforms and nations regarding content moderation. It highlights cases of Telegram's CEO, Pavel Durov, being arrested in France for alleged crimes facilitated through his platform, and Elon Musk's conflict with Brazilian authorities over X (formerly Twitter). These incidents signal a shift in global attitudes towards tech company immunity. 

A US court ruling declaring TikTok's algorithmic recommendations as "first-party speech," and therefore not protected under Section 230, raises further concerns. If this precedent is followed, it could discourage platforms from using algorithms, potentially limiting how users discover content online. The article concludes that governments are pushing for greater control over online content and that the landscape of internet content moderation is changing significantly.</description>

			<title>Dunzo could have been a Zepto. So why did it fail?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/dunzo-job-cut-zepto-swiggy-instamart-bigbasket-zomato-blinkit-quick-commerce-delivery-platform-flipkart-amazon-reliance-11725422823641.html</link>
			<description>Dunzo, a quick commerce startup, is struggling after recent job cuts, facing a potential demise. Despite being an early entrant in the market, Dunzo failed to capitalize on the rapid growth of online grocery delivery. While rivals like Zepto, Swiggy, and Blinkit focused on quick commerce, Dunzo initially dabbled in a broader range of consumer-to-consumer delivery services, leading to a lack of focus and scale.

Their pivot to instant grocery delivery came too late, as competitors already had established dark store networks and strong market positions. Dunzo's past success as a marketplace platform provided little advantage in the competitive grocery market, where speed and efficiency are paramount.  The company's struggles highlight the challenges of pivoting in a rapidly evolving market and the importance of a clear core business strategy.</description>

			<title>Anti-rape protests aren’t pointless if they alter the behaviour of perpetrators</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/antirape-protests-kolkata-doctor-rape-case-malayalam-fil-industry-justice-hema-commission-report-sexual-violence-11725416780100.html</link>
			<description>Recent protests in Calcutta and Kerala against violence against women raise the question of whether they will influence societal attitudes. The author analyzes two distinct scenarios: a random act of violence in a hospital and a systemic issue within the Malayalam film industry.

While preventing isolated incidents like the Kolkata hospital attack is difficult, the author expresses optimism about the impact of the protests on the film industry. 

Following testimonies from female actors,  a sense of fear and uncertainty has emerged among powerful perpetrators. This 'what if she speaks up?' mentality can deter future abuses. 

The author draws a parallel with 'nakka bandis' (temporary police checkpoints) which, despite their simplicity, deter terrorist attacks by introducing an element of doubt and uncertainty. 

Ultimately, the author argues that even small, determined voices like those of the courageous actresses can create significant behavioral change within an industry, highlighting the power of collective action in addressing societal issues like gender-based violence.</description>

			<title>The IPO frenzy isn’t a sign of a robust stock market</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ipo-frenzy-stock-market-share-prices-issue-pricing-capital-allocation-retail-investors-equity-portfolios-11725413650722.html</link>
			<description>A recent study by India's Securities and Exchange Board (Sebi) highlights a concerning trend in the stock market. Analysis of 144 initial public offerings (IPOs) revealed that a majority of shares allotted to individual investors were sold shortly after listing, indicating a focus on short-term gains rather than long-term value creation. The study found that 54% of shares were sold within a week, and 70% within a year.

This behavior is further amplified when IPO prices surge post-listing, with over 67% of shares in such cases being sold within a week. The report suggests that this resembles a pre-Sebi era where allotments operated more like lotteries, driven by speculation rather than fundamental company performance. 

While the researcher acknowledges the responsible behavior of mutual funds, it expresses concern over the potential for market instability and a "financialization trap" where financial markets unduly influence policy decisions.</description>

			<description>India plans to maintain a tax disparity between electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids to encourage battery production and accelerate the shift to electric transport. While India aims for net-zero emissions by  2070, hybrid vehicles  remain expensive due to high taxes, hindering their adoption as a cleaner transportation option. 

EV sales are also lagging due to concerns like insufficient charging infrastructure, limited home charging space, and "range anxiety".  Addressing these issues could take time. In the meantime, the article suggests utilizing hybrid vehicles as a bridging technology by reducing their tax burden to encourage their purchase and thus contribute to India's decarbonization efforts.</description>

			<title>Has Warren Buffett lost his touch?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/has-warren-buffett-lost-his-touch-11725412706855.html</link>
			<description>Berkshire Hathaway recently reached a $1 trillion market value, a significant milestone for the company. However, despite this achievement, Berkshire's performance has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500 in recent years. 

Warren Buffett, Berkshire's CEO, attributes this to the company's size, arguing  that it's harder to achieve outsized growth with such massive operations.  

However, critics contend that Berkshire's investment strategy is outdated and its reluctance to embrace technology is hindering its growth. The company's opaque corporate governance and lack of shareholder engagement also draw scrutiny.  

While Buffett remains optimistic about Berkshire's future, some believe the company needs to adapt to the changing landscape to remain relevant and competitive. They suggest actions like paying dividends and share buybacks could be beneficial.</description>

			<title>Weak bank deposit growth: Beware faulty explanations</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/weak-bank-deposit-growth-rbi-scheduled-commercial-banks-banking-system-cash-reserve-ratio-bank-lending-11725309025261.html</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the recent trend of slow deposit growth in the Indian banking system.  It suggests that attributing this to factors like investments in capital markets or household savings patterns is misleading. Instead, the article proposes examining the broader money supply (M3) and its components, such as cash in circulation, government balances with the central bank, and the balance of payments.

The analysis reveals that increased cash in circulation and government balances with the RBI have acted as leakages from the banking system. However, a BoP surplus has provided an infusion.

Looking at bank balance sheets, the article highlights a shift in liabilities, with deposits now comprising a smaller percentage, replaced by equity and reserves due to increased bank profitability.

The article concludes that the current situation is cyclical and deposit growth is expected to normalize. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these broader money supply dynamics to analyze deposit growth trends accurately.</description>

			<title>The end of monetary dominance in the US is not a bad thing</title>

			<description>The US Federal Reserve's recent success in taming inflation might be a temporary peak in its authority. Experts suggest the US is shifting from a "monetary dominance" to a "fiscal dominance" regime. 

This means the government's large-scale debt, rather than the Fed's interest rate adjustments, is becoming the dominant force in the economy. While this reduces the Fed's control over inflation and interest rates, the shift also brings an opportunity.

The government is taking on a larger role in managing the supply side of the economy through policies aimed at boosting manufacturing, infrastructure, and housing. This could lead to healthier long-term growth.

However, the effectiveness of these policies hinges on the government's ability to manage its debt and prevent a return to fiscal dominance, which would further weaken the Fed's independence.</description>

			<title>Six key aspects of a carbon credits trading system that India must get right</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/carbon-credits-trading-system-decarbonization-carbon-tax-power-sector-carbon-credits-net-zero-goal-exports-cbam-11725307769817.html</link>
			<description>A new Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) is being implemented in India, making it part of a select group of countries using this approach to reduce emissions.  

The CCTS is designed to directly manage the quantity of emissions by setting limits on what can be released per unit of output. 

While a carbon tax is considered more economically efficient, a CCTS is seen as more politically acceptable as the costs are primarily borne by larger producers, who can pass them on to consumers.

Key challenges in designing a successful CCTS include determining appropriate emission allowances, deciding which sectors should be included (the power sector, in particular), ensuring allowances decrease over time to meet net-zero goals, and addressing revenue generation.

The system must also consider potential carbon border adjustments from the EU to ensure Indian exports remain competitive.  

Finally, the CCTS will likely increase production costs in the covered sectors, requiring cost-reflective electricity tariffs, potentially with compensatory cash transfers to protect low-income households.</description>

			<description>The article stresses the urgency for India to take a more aggressive stance on climate change.  

Citing increasingly frequent and severe climate-related disasters worldwide, the author argues that India's vulnerability is high due to its large population and status as the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. 

While India has implemented mitigation measures, the author contends that a more proactive approach is needed, particularly focusing on the energy transition and building climate resilience.  

The article proposes several concrete actions, including revitalizing the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), strengthening the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, implementing strategic environmental assessments (SEAs), and establishing a robust national data and analytics ecosystem.</description>

			<title>'Angry Young Men': A documentary that entertains but doesn’t elucidate</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/angry-young-men-documentary-salim-khan-javed-akhtar-script-writers-cinema-deewar-sholay-11725306591555.html</link>
			<description>"Angry Young Men," a documentary about the legendary screenwriter duo Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, offers a heartwarming look into their lives and careers.  The film, produced primarily by their families, provides nostalgic glimpses into the 1970s Bollywood scene, particularly through their iconic "angry young man" characters.  While it touches on key influences and inspirations behind their works like "Deewar" and "Sholay," it lacks in-depth analysis of their collaboration and the evolution of their writing style.  The documentary omits a thorough exploration of how the "angry young man" trope emerged and their individual post-collaboration careers. Despite its shortcomings, the film, primarily through Honey Irani’s recollections, provides entertaining anecdotes and insights into the lives of these cinematic titans.</description>

			<title>Audit quality is a bigger concern than market concentration</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/nfra-lead-auditors-audit-quality-icai-auditors-subsidiaries-promoters-kpmg-pwc-deloitte-ey-market-concentration-11725305935727.html</link>
			<description>The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) proposes revising accounting standard SA600 to hold parent company auditors responsible for subsidiary audits, aiming to enhance accountability and minimize governance lapses. 

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) expressed concerns about this proposal, fearing it would weaken smaller audit firms and concentrate power within the "Big Four" accounting firms.

The ICAI argues that individual auditors, regardless of firm size, possess equal qualifications and that a hierarchical structure would be antithetical to the profession's flat architecture.

However, proponents of the change highlight the need to improve audit quality and investor confidence, noting that split assignments have previously allowed for unnoticed financial irregularities.

While acknowledging the concerns of smaller firms, the need to align Indian auditing practices with global standards and restore public trust in the profession is emphasized. The ICAI is encouraged to work with the NFRA to find a solution that balances efficiency and protects the interests of all stakeholders.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk's rebranding of Twitter to X has been seen as a failure, with the original name still widely used, including by Musk himself.  The name "Twitter" effectively captured the essence of the platform, with its bird-call analogy and concise messaging. Despite Musk's desire to create a more versatile brand with "X," the original name remains deeply ingrained in public consciousness. It's argued that Musk should consider returning to the successful "Twitter" brand to regain user familiarity and loyalty.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/a-time-to-choose-between-growth-and-expansionism-column-opinion-11725272968684.html</link>
			<description>The period between 1991 and 2019 witnessed a relative global peace, attributed to Western dominance and a focus on alleviating poverty.  Landmark attacks like 9/11 shifted the geopolitical landscape, leading to the US-led wars in Afghanistan, marked by ethical concerns and mistrust.  

The early 21st century saw the rise of assertive powers like Russia and China, engaging in conflicts and territorial disputes. This escalation has resulted in widespread global instability, with conflicts intensifying in Ukraine, Israel-Palestine, and the Middle East. 

The UN Security Council, plagued by veto powers, has become ineffective in addressing these crises. Calls for reform highlight the need to prioritize peace and security in the face of rising global tensions and the potential for economic disruption.</description>

			<title>Smart industrial cities can propel India towards its export targets</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/industrial-corridor-export-manufacturing-sector-job-creation-foreign-investment-domestic-production-employment-11725222748739.html</link>
			<description>India's government has announced plans to develop 12 smart industrial cities under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP). These cities, strategically located across six industrial corridors, aim to boost India's manufacturing sector,  increase exports, and create employment opportunities.  

The project, with a ₹28,600 crore budget, focuses on sectors with high export potential like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles.  India's target is to reach  $1 trillion in merchandise exports by 2030, and these cities are designed to support this ambitious goal.   

Sustainability is a key aspect of this initiative, incorporating circular economy principles and eco-friendly features such as renewable energy and efficient waste management. This aligns with India's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. 

Public-private partnerships are encouraged to accelerate the development of these cities, with infrastructure improvements playing a crucial role in attracting businesses and skilled workers.  The government hopes these smart industrial cities will  transform India's manufacturing landscape, making it a more competitive player in the global economy.</description>

			<title>CEA: No inflation targeting framework is sacrosanct</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/cea-inflation-targeting-rbi-food-inflation-monetary-policy-indian-economy-headline-inflation-fiscal-policy-intervention-11725221362828.html</link>
			<description>The Economic Survey of 2023-24 questions the effectiveness of India's inflation targeting regime, which aims for a 4% headline inflation rate. The survey suggests that targeting inflation excluding food prices might be more appropriate, especially considering its impact on farmers' terms of trade.  

The author argues that questioning established economic models is crucial, citing how past economic stances, like free trade and industrial policy, have undergone significant shifts. They highlight several concerns with the current inflation targeting framework, including its focus on a metric largely influenced by factors outside the central bank's control (food prices). They also contend that monetary policy is not always effective against supply-induced inflation, and that fiscal policy plays a significant role in managing inflation, raising questions about its inclusion in decision-making.

The author further challenges the assumption that inflation targeting is neutral, pointing out its implicit influence on labor income in advanced economies and farmers' terms of trade in developing countries. They also question the effectiveness of targeting inflation based solely on monetary factors, citing evidence showing the influence of real factors like globalization, competition, and technology.


The author concludes by emphasizing that discussions about inflation targeting and its underlying assumptions should remain open and critical, as the experience of past economic models demonstrates the need for continuous reassessment and adaptation to changing circumstances.</description>

			<title>Ajit Ranade: A truly secure nest egg is one that’s fully funded</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ajit-ranade-unified-pension-scheme-retirement-planning-old-pension-scheme-personal-finance-national-pension-scheme-11725220619011.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has announced changes to the National Pension System (NPS), increasing the government's contribution from 14% to 18.5% of an employee's basic pay. This new scheme, called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), guarantees retirees 50% of their average salary in the year before retirement, similar to the old Old Pension Scheme (OPS).  

While supporters see this as a  "minor tweak," many view it as a return to the principles of the OPS, which provided a guaranteed pension and shifted the financial burden from employees to the government. This change has been attributed to political pressure, as several states have reintroduced OPS in response to public demands.

Critics argue that the UPS puts an increasing strain on government finances, crowding out spending on essential services like healthcare and education. They also raise concerns about intergenerational equity, with future generations potentially shouldering the burden of these "assured incomes."  

The author suggests that the NPS, designed to move towards a fully funded system with no government liability, could have incorporated a solution for the transitional batch of employees who were adversely affected by the switch from OPS in 2004.</description>

			<title>Data privacy is Signal’s edge over Telegram and Whatsapp</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/data-privacy-signal-telegram-whatsapp-end-to-end-encryption-data-security-big-tech-social-media-apps-11725220153550.html</link>
			<description>This article compares the privacy and security features of three popular messaging apps: Signal, Telegram, and WhatsApp. 

Signal is lauded for its strong end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default for all communication, minimal data collection, and non-profit status, making it the gold standard for privacy-conscious users.

Telegram, while popular due to its features like group chats and channels, offers less robust security. Its standard chats are not E2EE and rely on cloud-based encryption, making user data potentially vulnerable.  Telegram's hands-off approach to content moderation has also drawn criticism for its role in harboring illegal activities.

 WhatsApp, the most widely used app, utilizes E2EE but is owned by Meta, a company known for data collection.  WhatsApp collects metadata, raising concerns about user privacy despite encrypted messages. Recent privacy policy changes further fueled these concerns.  

The article concludes by emphasizing Signal's commitment to user privacy as a valuable countercultural stance in today's data-driven world.</description>

			<description>While India's economic growth remains strong with a high share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP, there is a need to look beyond simply being the world's fastest growing major economy.  Recent growth rates, though impressive, may be deceptive and require a shift in focus towards sustained double-digit growth.  Maximizing India's demographic dividend, which is beginning to decline, is crucial.  

This involves policies that prioritize labor force participation, job creation, and productivity enhancement. Investing in education, particularly fostering critical thinking skills in children, is vital.  Further, robust infrastructure development,  leveraging private sector investment through public-private partnerships, is essential.  Finally, fostering innovation in areas like climate technology is key to securing India's long-term growth trajectory.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | So, will UPS sign up private sector folks too?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-ups-private-sector-old-pension-scheme-government-employees-national-pension-scheme-11725218743864.html</link>
			<description>The government's new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) offers a guaranteed pension of half an employee's average basic pay for those with 25 years or more of service. While billed as an improvement to the National Pension System (NPS),  the UPS is exclusive to central government employees, raising questions about its parity with the old pension scheme (OPS). 

Proponents argue the UPS's funded nature will limit its budgetary impact. However, critics point out that excluding private sector employees creates a disparity, especially given that the stock market's performance, which influences both the UPS corpus and the NPS, could negatively affect retirement plans for the majority of Indian workers, creating pressure for better old-age support.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the upcoming reconstitution of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).  

It highlights the current composition of the MPC, comprising three RBI officials and three external experts primarily from academia. The article then compares this model to those of other central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank,  People's Bank of China, and the Bank of Japan, which vary in their membership structure and representation. 

The author explores the debate surrounding  whether the MPC should include members from sectors beyond academia, such as industry or households, to provide diverse perspectives. The advantages and disadvantages of such a move are weighed, considering the potential for representing specific interests versus the risk of overlooking the broader economic picture. 

Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of the MPC's role in navigating the current economic climate, characterized by strong growth and unpredictable inflation, and suggests that the composition of the new MPC will be crucial in steering the economy.</description>

			<description>Meta has outperformed its tech rivals this year, with investors showing more confidence in Mark Zuckerberg's approach to artificial intelligence (AI). While companies like Google and Microsoft haven't clearly demonstrated the financial benefits of AI, Meta has showcased how AI is boosting its advertising systems and user engagement on platforms like Instagram and Reels. Zuckerberg's transparency about AI's positive impact on Meta's bottom line has earned him praise from analysts and contributed to the company's stock increase.

In contrast to Meta,  Google  has remained vague about how AI is driving revenue growth, despite claiming it plays a vital role. This lack of concrete examples has fueled investor uncertainty about AI's economic value. Zuckerberg's success with AI emphasizes the importance of "showing, don't telling," and demonstrates a clear link between AI investments and tangible business results.</description>

			<title>Desilting can ease India’s water storage constraints and its rural water crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/desilting-water-scarcity-underground-water-table-reservoirs-lakes-water-storage-rural-water-crisis-11725176888127.html</link>
			<description>India is facing a severe water crisis exacerbated by climate change. The increasing frequency of droughts, coupled with declining groundwater levels, threatens agriculture, livelihoods, and food security.  Reviving silted water bodies offers a cost-effective solution.  

Initiatives like the Amrit Sarovar project and Niti Aayog's scheme in drought-prone areas demonstrate the success of this approach. By reviving these water bodies, India can increase water storage, recharge groundwater, improve irrigation, and support sustainable agriculture.

Community involvement is crucial for this effort. By engaging local communities in managing and maintaining these water bodies, a sense of ownership can be fostered, leading to long-term sustainability.  


The government's commitment to sustainable water management practices, as highlighted by Prime Minister Modi's "Catch the rain--where it falls, when it falls," slogan, is encouraging. However, widespread implementation of these initiatives across water-stressed regions requires sustained efforts and investment.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-nari-hira-magna-publishing-company-narendra-hiranandani-stardust-magazine-entertainment-industry-11725175850180.html</link>
			<description>This article is a reflection on Nari Hira, the flamboyant founder of Magna Publishing Company, which included the popular film magazine Stardust.  Hira, who hailed from a wealthy South Bombay family, was known for his ability to stir controversy within the Hindi film industry, often antagonizing stars with his fearless and sometimes scandalous reporting.  He was a product of an era in Bombay where a cosmopolitan elite, unconcerned with traditional Indian values, held sway in media and entertainment.  

The article highlights Hira's media savvy, noting how he mimicked trends from New York and brought them to India, exemplified by his magazine and direct-to-video film productions.  Stardust, during its heyday, commanded the respect and fear of celebrities, while also provoking heated reactions. Its influence waned as the media landscape changed and stars gained more power and control. Hira, the article suggests, was a relic of a bygone era –  a "last of the urban gentry" who ultimately lost his battle against the growing dominance of star-centric media.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh must strive to keep its success story going</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bangladesh-protest-sheikh-hasina-bangladesh-interim-government-democracy-secularism-authoritarianism-religious-extremism-11725175294379.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's rule in Bangladesh ended abruptly after widespread protests ignited by a controversial job-quota system. The system, criticized amidst economic hardship and rising youth unemployment, served as the spark for a deeper discontent with Hasina's growing authoritarianism.  Concerns about her stifling of dissent and media freedom had been simmering for some time. While Hasina was lauded for her leadership in steering Bangladesh away from religious extremism and overseeing economic growth, her recent actions raised serious questions about her commitment to the country's founding principles of democracy. The sudden power vacuum poses a threat to Bangladesh's stability, with the risk of religious extremist groups exploiting the situation. However, the establishment of an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus has injected a sense of hope. The focus now is on stabilizing the economy, rebuilding political institutions, and ensuring fair and transparent elections in the future.</description>

			<title>How India’s GST revenues can sustain their incline</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/gst-collections-tax-reform-gst-revenue-gdp-growth-gst-filing-gst-evasion-gst-council-11725005081732.html</link>
			<description>This article analyzes the growth of India's Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue since its implementation in 2017. It attributes this growth to several factors: a robust labor market with increasing employment and wages,  a rise in private consumption expenditure, particularly in higher-value items, and effective measures to curb tax evasion and bogus registrations.  

The article highlights the government's efforts to improve GST compliance, e-invoicing, and e-way billing, leading to a surge in the number of GST returns filed. It also acknowledges the role of rate rationalization, such as the recent increase in GST on online gaming, in boosting revenues.

Looking ahead, the article emphasizes the importance of sustained economic growth, a rise in the worker population ratio, and creating more productive jobs in manufacturing and services as key drivers for continued GST revenue growth.</description>

			<title>Right to Disconnect: Will employers self-correct their work expectations?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/australias-right-to-disconnect-work-life-balance-work-timings-leisure-work-from-home-sweat-equity-work-hours-11724951842754.html</link>
			<description>Australia has implemented a law granting employees the right to disconnect from work-related communication outside their scheduled hours. This legislation aims to protect employees' personal time and address concerns about work-life balance, especially in a post-pandemic world where boundaries between work and home have become increasingly blurred. 

While proponents argue that the law is necessary to safeguard employee well-being and prevent burnout, critics claim it may distort the labor market and negatively impact productivity.  They suggest that market forces would naturally incentivize companies to optimize work practices and avoid overworking employees. However, the Australian law reflects a growing global concern about protecting employees' right to disconnect and the potential negative consequences of constantly accessible work environments.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | The boost India can get from its billionaire boom</title>

			<description>India has witnessed a surge in its billionaire population, reaching 334 according to the Hurun India Rich List for 2024. This growth reflects a strong trend of wealth creation in the country. While this increase is positive, it's important to note that much of this wealth is tied to rising share values.  Billionaires who are not in danger of losing control of their companies could consider gradually selling shares to support philanthropic efforts, potentially benefiting society and their businesses.  This approach could address income inequality and contribute to a more stable and prosperous economy.</description>

			<title>Making capital costlier in relation to labour may help generate more jobs</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/employment-paradox-economic-growth-capital-costs-agriculture-labour-costs-employment-linked-incentives-corporate-bonds-11724922955034.html</link>
			<description>India's economic growth is failing to translate into job creation. While the GDP grew significantly between 2011-12 and 2022-23, employment grew at a much slower pace. This has resulted in a surge in unemployment. 

The article suggests that to address this issue, the government needs to implement policies that encourage labour-intensive growth. A key strategy is lowering the wage-rental ratio, which compares the cost of labour to the cost of capital. This can be achieved by raising the cost of capital through policies like a depreciating exchange rate or real interest rate hikes. 

Another solution proposed is an employment-linked incentive scheme (ELI) similar to the existing Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, but focused on job creation instead of production. 

The article also highlights the need to address structural rigidities in the labour market, which may be hindering job growth despite low wage levels.  Variations in labour laws across states provide opportunities to study these rigidities and find effective solutions.</description>

			<title>Viksit Bharat will get closer as family philanthropy gains momentum</title>

			<description>Family philanthropy is growing rapidly in India, driven by a rise in ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNI) and affluent donors.  This growth is notable in sectors like gender equity, arts and culture, climate action, mental health, and sports.

While progress is being made, there are still challenges to overcome. Funding gaps persist in certain areas, and a greater focus on intersectional approaches addressing caste, gender, and regional disparities is needed. 

Moreover, philanthropy predominantly benefits Tier 1 cities, leaving other areas underserved.  

Family philanthropists are increasingly adopting innovative strategies, collaborating, leveraging data and technology, and prioritizing marginalized communities.  However, continued efforts are required to enhance transparency and governance within the sector.  With a focus on inclusivity and addressing deep-rooted inequities, family philanthropy has the potential to significantly contribute to India's development.</description>

			<title>Suppressed feminism: China’s gaming industry is too gender insensitive</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-online-gamers-gaming-industry-womens-rights-censorship-game-science-gender-discrimination-feminism-11724921074578.html</link>
			<description>The Chinese game "Black Myth: Wukong," which is gaining international acclaim, has landed in controversy over its alleged suppression of discussions about women's rights.  The game's developer, Game Science, reportedly asked reviewers not to discuss "feminist propaganda" during streams. This follows past controversies including vulgar comments made by the studio's founder and allegations of sexism within the company. 

Despite China's government censoring feminist discussions online, the controversy surrounding "Wukong" has sparked debate and scrutiny.  While some see the backlash as an attack on Chinese culture, others view it as a symptom of the wider gender inequality within the gaming industry in China.</description>

			<title>The magnificent seven ways in which AI can transform human life</title>

			<description>The author argues that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have a profound impact on our lives, surpassing its current capabilities. They highlight seven key ways AI will reshape our world:

1. **AI as the new UI:**  Voice interaction will become the primary way we interact with machines, similar to how we collaborate with colleagues.
2. **Agents replacing apps:** AI agents will handle tasks for us, like booking travel, integrating with various apps and services.
3. **SaaS evolves to service-as-a-software:**  AI will take over the responsibility of achieving desired outcomes, offering services rather than just tools.
4. **English as the language of coding:**  Natural language will enable anyone to "code" by instructing AI to build things.
5. **The AI phone:**  Future phones will be voice-controlled with agents replacing apps, and large language models powering the operating system.
6. **The CHRO becomes the new CIO:**  Companies will need to promote AI literacy among employees, making the CHRO responsible for fostering AI adoption.
7. **Homo Deus:**  AI will merge with humans, leading to advancements in technology and potentially a new species.


The author concludes that AI literacy will be crucial for everyone in the future, as it becomes a powerful general-purpose technology shaping our world.</description>

			<description>A recent BCG study found that while over 80% of companies see digital transformation as a priority, only 30% succeed. The study identifies key factors contributing to this low success rate, emphasizing the importance of a well-defined strategy with clear goals and a roadmap. 

Companies must avoid simply automating existing processes and instead reimagine workflows to leverage technology's full potential. 

Sustained leadership commitment is crucial, with top executives leading by example and allocating resources accordingly. Assembling a dedicated team of top talent and fostering a culture of experimentation are also essential.  

Finally, companies should adopt a holistic approach, considering the entire ecosystem, including suppliers and partners, to maximize the benefits of digital transformation.</description>

			<title>Ayurvedic medicines mustn’t get a free pass on advertising</title>

			<description>The Indian Supreme Court upheld a ban on misleading advertisements of Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani drugs, rejecting a July notification by the Ayush Ministry that aimed to lift the restriction.  Rule 170 of India’s Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945, which prohibits ads that might mislead people about the therapeutic value of these medicines, remains in effect.

This follows a long-standing debate between proponents of allopathy and Ayurveda, sparked by Patanjali Ayurved's claim that its product Coronil could cure COVID-19. The Court, recognizing the need for a balance between traditional medical practices and public health, reinstated the rule while emphasizing the importance of clear advertising standards for Ayurvedic products.  


It highlighted the difference in regulatory processes between allopathic drugs, which undergo rigorous clinical trials, and Ayurvedic formulations, which are subject to softer regulations focusing on traditional texts and safety.</description>

			<description>The Indian cabinet has approved the development of twelve industrial smart cities under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme, with an investment of ₹28,602 crore. These cities will operate on a ‘plug-and-play’ model, providing ready infrastructure for businesses to establish operations quickly.  The goal is to create activity hubs and stimulate domestic manufacturing.  

While the concept is promising, there are concerns about the effectiveness of similar initiatives in the past, which have faced operational challenges.  To avoid this, simultaneous efforts are needed to create a more favorable policy environment for businesses.  Progress has been made in simplifying business regulations, but red tape still persists, hindering manufacturing growth.</description>

			<title>Telegram CEO’s arrest is a moment of social media reckoning</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-social-media-regulation-end-to-end-encryption-terrorism-digital-governance-meta-tik-tok-youtube-11724873986322.html</link>
			<description>Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, was arrested in France on charges related to the app's alleged facilitation of criminal activity like child sexual abuse material distribution, drug trafficking, and money laundering.  

While Telegram boasts a "no consequences" approach to content moderation, its hands-off policy has resulted in the platform being used for harmful purposes. Despite claiming full end-to-end encryption, the app utilizes client-server encryption by default, allowing Telegram to potentially access user data. 

The arrest signals a shift towards holding social media platforms accountable for the content hosted on them.  Durov's critics argue that his arrest threatens free speech, but proponents of the charges emphasize that ignoring online criminal activity is not a defense of liberty but a dereliction of duty.

This event highlights the growing pressure on tech giants to operate in a less unregulated environment and face consequences for facilitating illegal activities.</description>

			<title>How to tell fake NGOs apart from actual do-gooders? Here’s a guide.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ngos-social-work-grassroot-immersion-commitment-impact-social-sector-fakeness-11724788435949.html</link>
			<description>The article critiques NGOs that the author refers to as "SAGs" (self-appointed guardians and guides) within the Indian social sector. These NGOs, it argues, prioritize appearances and scale over genuine impact, employing tactics such as: 

* **Exaggerated scale:** Claiming to work across multiple states or in vast numbers of schools while engaging in limited or superficial activities.
* **Shallow depth:** Emphasizing broad narratives and metrics over the intensity and quality of their work.  
* **Inflated impact:**  Making grandiose claims about their effects, often unsupported by verifiable data.
* **False immersion:** Presenting polished facades of authenticity and ground-level engagement while prioritizing networking and fund-seeking activities.
* **Erosion of purpose:** Shifting from initial genuine commitment to a focus on visibility and power. 

The author urges funders to critically assess these claims and to support authentic NGOs that prioritize genuine impact over superficial appearances.</description>

			<title>Jacks of all trades: India’s bureaucracy needs experts</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ias-indian-administrative-service-lateral-entry-indian-bureaucracy-subject-experts-civil-service-evs-semiconductors-11724788286496.html</link>
			<description>India's administrative system relies heavily on the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), a relatively small group of elite generalist bureaucrats.  Despite facing increasingly complex challenges in a rapidly growing economy, the IAS remains largely unchanged from its British colonial origins. 

The system relies on a small cadre of generalists who often lack expertise in their assigned areas and are constantly shuffled between ministries, preventing them from developing deep knowledge or experience. This creates inefficiencies and obstacles to effective governance. A recent attempt to inject much-needed expertise by hiring lateral entry officials was quickly withdrawn despite the clear need for specialized knowledge in sectors like semiconductors, batteries, and international law. 

The Indian government's reluctance to reform its bureaucratic system, even in the face of mounting challenges, suggests a failure to prioritize necessary changes for a more effective and modern governance structure.</description>

			<title>Are you a smart investor? Time for a reality check.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/stock-market-investment-performance-psychology-of-investing-luck-skill-smart-investors-nifty-11724788007776.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the common human bias of attributing investment successes to skill and failures to external factors. This self-attribution bias can lead to overconfidence and poor decisions in the future.

The author uses examples of past market performances, both positive and negative, to illustrate how investors often convince themselves of their analytical abilities during good times while blaming external factors for losses.

This bias, the author argues, is rooted in our evolutionary need to protect self-esteem, but it can be detrimental in investing.  

Recognizing this bias and acknowledging the role of luck in both successes and failures is crucial for investors to avoid overconfidence, make better decisions, and learn from their mistakes.</description>

			<title>Nepotism in politics: A South Asian bug has bitten Southeast Asian nations</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/nepotism-in-politics-jared-kushner-president-jokowi-thailand-prime-minister-paetongtarn-shinawatra-inflation-economy-11724787791745.html</link>
			<description>In recent times, nepotism in Southeast Asian politics appears to be resurging. Indonesian President Jokowi faces criticism for attempting to secure political positions for his sons before his term ends. This strategy, including trying to lower age limits for candidacy, contrasts with his early reputation built on defeating a dynasty and emphasizing humility. 

Similarly, Thailand is grappling with the repercussions of a military-backed establishment manipulating power. Former election winner Move Forward party was ousted, and though Paetongtarn Shinawatra became Prime Minister, this is seen as part of the existing political system's manipulation rather than genuine democratic progress. The Philippines exemplifies this trend with Bongbong Marcos' rise, the son of a former dictator, to the presidency. 

These examples raise concerns about backsliding democracy and highlight the detrimental impact of nepotism.</description>

			<title>Central bank rate cuts: Ask why instead of when and to what extent</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/central-banks-us-fed-rbi-monetary-policy-inflation-policy-rate-cuts-recession-jerome-powell-gdp-growth-shaktikanta-das-11724787560983.html</link>
			<description>The focus of both global markets and borrowers is now on the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) actions regarding interest rates. Market predictions suggest a high likelihood of at least a 0.25% rate cut by the Fed in September, with a growing possibility of a 0.50% cut. 

However, understanding the 'why' behind any rate cuts is crucial.  

Three key factors for the Fed's decision include: confidence in controlling inflation, concerns about a potential economic downturn, and maintaining policy consistency.  

The Fed’s narrative suggests they believe inflation is on the path to further decline without harming the economy, paving the way for a move towards a neutral rate. But, while risks around inflation are becoming more balanced, uncertainty remains high, potentially favoring a smaller rate cut. 

Another factor is the possibility of an impending economic slowdown. Although not always obvious, a decrease in economic activity can be a major concern for the Fed.  A significant drop in US job data could prompt a larger 0.50% rate cut to avoid a recession.

Maintaining consistency in its actions is also vital.

A sudden shift in policy direction without clear justification can confuse investors and damage the Fed's credibility. 

The US presidential election in November adds another layer of complexity, as the outcome could heavily influence future Fed policy.</description>

			<title>Paytm cue: Adhere to stock option rules in both letter and spirit</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/paytm-shares-vijay-shekhar-sharma-one97-communications-esops-sebi-employee-stock-options-promoters-startups-11724787393321.html</link>
			<description>One97 Communications, the owner of Paytm, saw its shares drop after reports of a possible show-cause notice from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The issue revolves around an employee stock option plan (ESOP) granted to founder CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma in 2021, which Sebi ruled may be in violation of norms by granting options to promoters.

While One97 denies any fresh scrutiny, Sharma's substantial ownership stake in the company, both directly and indirectly, raises questions about his eligibility for the ESOP. Regardless of the specific legal interpretation, the incident has damaged investor trust. 

The ESOP was intended to align the interests of employees with shareholders by incentivizing performance.  Granting it to a promoter like Sharma, who already has a large stake and powerful control, seems to undermine this spirit.  This case serves as a warning to other startups planning to go public about the importance of adhering to both the letter and spirit of regulations, especially those concerning shareholder fairness and transparency.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Resourceful IPO: Irrational exuberance?</title>

			<description>The recent IPO of Resourceful Automobile, a small New Delhi-based motorcycle dealership, was vastly oversubscribed, receiving applications worth ₹4,800 crore for a mere ₹12 crore offering. While the company's growth potential might be a factor, the intense response likely reflects broader irrational exuberance in India's stock market. Small-cap firms have witnessed soaring price-to-earnings ratios, fueling concerns that the market may be overheating. 

There are fears that the Resourceful Automobile IPO could be a signal of a "shoe shining moment," where market participants realize that excessive investment in equities as speculative bets may necessitate an exit strategy.</description>

			<title>India’s biodiversity can help it leap ahead in synthetic biology</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/synthetic-biology-biodiversity-conservation-genetic-engineering-biotechnology-sustainable-development-11724708402818.html</link>
			<description>The burgeoning field of synthetic biology is poised to revolutionize various industries by leveraging advancements in genetic engineering and bio-computing to create new biological systems for specific purposes. This discipline holds immense potential to transform fashion, food production, mining, and environmental remediation. While synthetic biology offers exciting possibilities, ethical considerations must be addressed.

 Concerns arise regarding equitable access to genetic resources, potentially disproportionate environmental and economic risks, and the control of research and benefits by wealthy nations and corporations. To ensure responsible development and equitable distribution of benefits, open communication, accountability, and diverse stakeholder engagement are crucial. Existing legal frameworks, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and Nagoya Protocol, provide a foundation for sharing benefits arising from genetic resources, with nations, particularly mega-diverse ones like India, playing a vital role in guiding this transformative technology for the global good.</description>

			<description>Despite  new laws and increased awareness, sexual violence in India remains a persistent issue. 

The article highlights a critical need for systemic change, as the deeply ingrained patriarchal norms and structures within society contribute to the problem.  

It emphasizes that addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach, including increased female representation in positions of power within government, the police force, and the corporate world. This increased representation can help to shift cultural attitudes and improve the system's response to violence against women.

The article also points to the need for police reforms, addressing the backlog in the judicial system, and creating safer public spaces for women. 


It concludes by stressing the urgency of reform, emphasizing that meaningful change is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of women in India.</description>

			<title>Think win-win to overcome the second Chinese export shock</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-imports-trade-barriers-protectionism-subsidies-industrial-policy-fta-lithium-batteries-evs-11724707859131.html</link>
			<description>China's aggressive export push, particularly in advanced manufactured goods, is stirring global trade tensions. This "second China shock" follows a previous surge in the early 2000s,  triggered by its entry into the WTO. China's strategy, once based on low-wage manufacturing, is now driven by vast production capacity, enabling them to undercut competitors on price.  

While China claims their exports are a reflection of strong domestic demand, the global community perceives this as a deliberate strategy to dominate markets. The US and other nations are responding with protectionist measures like higher tariffs and government subsidies for domestic industries.  

This situation echoes concerns raised by economist John Maynard Keynes at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. Keynes highlighted the risks of large current account surpluses, arguing that the burden of adjustment should be shared by both deficit and surplus countries.  

He advocated for a global economic system with: stable aggregate demand, mechanisms to balance current accounts, financing for developing economies, and an open international trading system. His ideas remain relevant today as the world grapples with the consequences of China's export dominance.</description>

			<title>The sky is the limit for Indian aviation, but can homegrown talent keep up?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/airlines-talent-pilots-aviation-schools-aviation-training-tata-sons-gmr-dgca-commercial-pilot-licence-ceo-coo-leadership-11724737766033.html</link>
			<description>India’s booming aviation sector is facing a significant talent shortage.  To meet the projected demand for over 10,900 pilots by 2029-30, Tata Sons plans to establish a large aviation academy in Gurugram, aiming to train 50,000 professionals including pilots, cabin crew, and engineers.  

Additionally,  taxis are opening a flying training organization (FTO) and an aircraft maintenance engineering (AME) school. GMR Group is also investing in a new AME school to address the engineer shortage.  

While these initiatives aim to bridge the gap, a crucial leadership vacuum persists.   Top management positions in Indian airlines are predominantly held by foreign nationals, highlighting a lack of homegrown leadership. The limited presence of management training programs specifically focused on aviation leadership further exacerbates the issue.</description>

			<title>Fighting food inflation isn’t a challenge for a single fighter</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/food-inflation-consumer-price-index-cpi-food-prices-core-inflation-rbi-monetary-policy-price-volatility-11724707626484.html</link>
			<description>Analysis of between  CPI-C and food inflation data from 2014 to 2024 shows two key findings.  

Firstly, food inflation significantly impacts overall inflationary expectations, even when food prices are falling. Food inflation, driven by pulses, vegetables, and cereals, often surpasses general CPI inflation.  Secondly, the relationship between food and overall inflation is complex and influenced by supply-side factors like monsoon variations, crop failures, and government-set minimum support prices.

These findings suggest that  RBI's monetary policy needs to consider food inflation when setting interest rates as it directly affects expectations and subsequent inflation. Conversely, the government should focus on reducing supply-side issues in agriculture to stabilize food prices.  Addressing both supply and demand sides is crucial to effectively manage India's persistent food inflation problem.</description>

			<description>India's stock market has witnessed a surge in individual investors, reaching 100 million registered investors in August 2023.  This boom, fueled by a largely positive market trend since 2020, has seen individual investment ownership nearly match that of foreign institutional investors. However, this influx of new, less experienced investors raises concerns. Many lack historical context and are susceptible to "new-era thinking," leading to potential overvaluation and disregard for fundamental analysis.  

The article highlights dangers such as promoters selling stakes, loss-making firms listing at inflated valuations, and a focus on nationalism over financial realities. Although predicting market crashes is impossible, historical examples suggest gradual downturns are more likely than sudden collapses. The massive investor base, coupled with a lack of experience and potentially excessive valuations, points to a potential correction, though it may not be an abrupt event.</description>

			<title>Unified Pension Scheme: Is good psychology also sound economics?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/unified-pension-scheme-ups-behavioural-economics-old-pension-scheme-ops-fiscal-cost-stock-market-retail-investors-11724707135841.html</link>
			<description>The government's newly launched Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) is poised to replace the existing National Pension System (NPS). The UPS offers assured pension benefits, a feature that appeals to individuals who prefer guaranteed returns over the market-linked uncertainties of the NPS.  Despite the NPS performing reasonably well, people's preference for assured income, as explained by Prospect Theory, contributed to the decision to shift towards the UPS.  

The UPS is a hybrid model, combining the assured payout structure of the old pension scheme with the mandatory contribution feature of the NPS. The government will contribute 18.5%, a higher percentage than the NPS, to enhance pension payouts.  

However, the long-term fiscal sustainability of the UPS remains a concern.  It depends heavily on market performance. A prolonged market slump could significantly impact the scheme's ability to meet its obligations.  To mitigate this risk, ensuring stable economic growth and market stability is crucial for the UPS's success.</description>

ULI aims to streamline credit appraisals by gathering data from various sources with borrowers' consent, leveraging India's digital infrastructure based on Aadhaar IDs and mobile connectivity. This initiative is expected to  make formal credit more accessible, particularly to underserved populations, and potentially curb reliance on exploitative moneylenders. ULI's success could serve as a model for other countries seeking to improve financial inclusion.</description>

			<title>India Inc is in a sweet spot but risks loom too</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/india-inc-credit-rating-balance-sheets-government-policy-regulation-ebitda-liquidity-transportation-telecom-reliance-11724621421071.html</link>
			<description>India Inc is experiencing robust growth driven by a solid economic climate and improving industry conditions.  Indian companies are benefiting from rising cash flows, prudent balance sheets, and falling leverage, despite increased capital expenditure and energy-transition initiatives. 

Supportive financial policies have contributed to debt reduction, with many companies undertaking asset sales. Rating agencies are observing a positive trend, with many Indian corporates achieving upward rating revisions.  Strong earnings growth, coupled with financial discipline, is enhancing credit quality. 

Several sectors are driving this positive momentum, including transportation infrastructure, utilities, commodities, telecoms, and chemicals.  

However, potential downside risks exist, such as regulatory changes, shifts in financing conditions, and global economic headwinds.</description>

			<title>Climate action: UK's Labour Party has made a blunder in greening aviation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/climate-action-labour-party-aviation-sector-airport-expansion-sustainable-aviation-fuel-carbon-emission-climate-change-11724620769163.html</link>
			<description>The UK government approved London City Airport's expansion despite recommendations from its own climate advisory body to limit airport capacity growth. While passenger numbers will rise, aircraft movements will remain capped and weekend flight interruptions will continue. Critics argue this expansion benefits wealthy frequent flyers and is incompatible with climate goals. The aviation sector globally is expanding, but sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is lagging behind. The article suggests the UK government could implement a kerosene tax to fund the transition to SAF and impose conditions on airport expansions, such as requiring zero-emission or SAF-powered planes. Reducing air travel is ultimately the best way to cut emissions in the short term.</description>

			<title>India must manage its green energy demand for a successful climate transition</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/energy-transition-fossil-fuels-data-centres-overconsumption-renewable-energy-climate-action-energy-demand-11724619982279.html</link>
			<description>This article argues that the global energy transition is more complex than simply replacing fossil fuels with renewables.  

The author highlights two key issues:

1. **Securing and integrating green energy supply:** While transitioning to green energy is crucial, it's not straightforward. There are challenges in developing and integrating these new sources, including high costs and logistical hurdles. 
 
2. **Addressing energy demand:** Simply increasing green energy supply won't solve the problem if energy demand continues to rise. The article emphasizes the need for demand management strategies, such as promoting public transport, reducing overconsumption, and implementing taxes on energy-intensive activities like crypto mining.  

The author uses India as a case study, praising its efforts to develop both supply and demand-side solutions.  The article concludes by calling for a shift in global mindset, urging developed nations to reduce their energy demand and for India to continue leading the way with a more comprehensive approach to the energy transition.</description>

			<title>India’s agenda for policy reforms must lift the quality of outcomes</title>

			<description>The article argues for a "quantity to quality" (QtoQ) transformation in India's development strategy as it aims to achieve developed country status.  Specifically, it emphasizes the importance of public health as a foundation for this transformation.

The author highlights the need to improve key health indicators like the Under Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) and the prevalence of Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies, which persist at alarmingly high levels in India compared to developed nations.  

While recognizing the progress made through vaccination campaigns, the article stresses that a long-term shift from intervention-based  approaches to creating an enabling environment for healthy living is crucial. 

This includes providing wider access to primary care, nutrition education, and addressing underlying factors  like maternal health and anemia. The author posits that a healthier population will contribute to India's overall economic growth and prosperity, creating a virtuous cycle of development.</description>

			<title>India's digital protection bill promotes competition and user interests</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/digital-personal-data-protection-bill-regulation-big-tech-competition-user-choice-digital-security-innovation-app-store-11724618437297.html</link>
			<description>The recent US court ruling against Google's monopoly has sparked global discussion on the dominance of Systematically Significant Digital Enterprises like Google, Meta, and Amazon. In India, this has significant implications for the draft digital competition law, which aims to promote user choice and competition within the digital marketplace.

The draft law targets Big Tech companies exceeding specific user and financial thresholds, allowing third-party apps on their core digital services. This is intended to break the dominance of platform giants, foster innovation by smaller developers, and enhance user choice and data portability.   

Despite concerns from Big Tech about potential security risks, the Indian government emphasizes its commitment to user data protection through legislation like the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act and the establishment of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). 

The draft law seeks to create a balance between promoting competition and ensuring user safety, reflecting the government's focus on protecting the interests of "little citizens" in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.</description>

			<title>The Federal Reserve's policy pivot poses a challenge for RBI</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-policy-shift-rbi-monetary-policy-interest-rate-cut-food-inflation-shaktikanta-das-11724617854816.html</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve has signaled a dovish turn, indicating a likely rate cut in September. This decision stems from a slowdown in inflation and concerns about rising unemployment. The anticipated rate cuts are expected to stimulate the US economy and may lead to capital outflow from the US into emerging markets like India.

A weaker dollar, a potential consequence of the Fed's policy shift, would benefit oil-importing countries like India by reducing import costs. This could help cool inflation domestically. However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) faces a challenge in managing the rupee's value amidst these global developments. While there are calls for rate cuts in India, the RBI remains cautious, considering food price inflation and the potential impact on the rupee.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Unified Pension Scheme: Old meets the New</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-unified-pension-scheme-cabinet-economics-beneficiaries-politics-retirement-old-pension-scheme-11724617339694.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has approved a Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for its employees, offering a defined benefit of 50% of the last salary. This contrasts with the existing National Pension System (NPS), which  offers a defined contribution but variable benefits. The UPS seeks to combine the guaranteed payouts of the previously existing Old Pension Scheme (OPS) with the contributory nature of NPS. 

Concerns remain about the scheme's long-term financial viability, as it's unclear if contributions will adequately fund the promised payouts.  Further, state participation could increase the number of beneficiaries, potentially straining their already fragile finances.



The decision appears to be politically motivated, as opposition parties had successfully used the demand for a return to OPS as a key campaign issue. The success of the UPS hinges on its long-term sustainability and avoidance of becoming a burden on public finances.</description>

			<title>Food vs core inflation: No, governor Das doesn’t need a new handbook for RBI’s interest rate policy</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/food-inflation-core-inflation-interest-rates-inflation-targeting-framework-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-11724588211814.html</link>
			<description>There's ongoing debate about the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) inflation targeting policy, with some arguing that food inflation should be excluded. The Economic Survey suggested this approach, and former chief statistician TCA Anant endorsed it, believing it could hinder economic recovery. However, the RBI emphasizes the need for a durable approach to inflation, as food price shocks can spill over into general inflation. 

The RBI emphasizes its commitment to aligning inflation with the 4% target sustainably.  The central bank considers forward forecasts and needs to see consistent CPI within the target range before making rate adjustments. 

Criticism from New Delhi may stem from industrial desires for lower interest rates to stimulate investment. However, the RBI argues that reduced interest rates alone may not solve underlying issues like policy uncertainty and weak consumption demand.</description>

			<title>Suspense grows over the next leg of financial reforms</title>

			<description>The Indian financial sector has come a long way since the establishment of its first banks centuries ago.  Despite significant progress, the sector needs further reforms to achieve its full potential.  

The author highlights two key areas requiring attention: the development of a robust corporate bond market and addressing regulatory arbitrage. A flourishing corporate bond market is crucial for attracting private sector investment and reducing reliance on banks. Currently, the market is limited by factors like poor recovery rates and the dominance of government bonds.

The second concern is regulatory arbitrage, where market participants exploit gaps between regulations to gain advantages.  This can destabilize the financial system and requires stronger inter-regulatory coordination, which is hampered by the secrecy surrounding the Financial Stability and Development Council's proceedings.


The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a comprehensive vision and strategy to guide the financial sector's future growth and stability.</description>

			<title>Powell ignored the elephant in the Fed’s Jackson Hole lodge</title>

			<description>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that interest rate cuts are imminent, creating a market rally. Powell emphasized  concerns over labor market risks while stating that inflation risks have diminished.

This suggests a series of interest rate reductions. While the market anticipates about 2.25 percentage points of easing, Powell's speech might trigger a shift in expectations regarding the long-run neutral interest rate, known as r-star.

This rate represents the level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity.  Although market expectations for r-star increased recently, some experts believe it may retreat. With bond yields already reflecting a neutral rate around 3.1%, further declines might be limited.  

Powell acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding r-star but states that the Fed will proceed cautiously. He believes anchoring inflation expectations will ease the process. Despite potential changes in understanding of r-star, achieving a definitive conclusion could take years.</description>

			<title>Don't just upgrade products, invent new use cases for technology</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/emerging-technology-ai-innovation-business-models-fintech-grubhub-cross-border-payments-product-development-11724575272788.html</link>
			<description>Focusing solely on upgrading existing products and processes limits the full potential of technology adoption. Businesses should strive for a "native" approach that reimagines how things are done, eliminating existing friction points and leveraging the unique power of the technology.

A skeuomorphic mindset, which simply replicates old ways using new technology, misses opportunities for disruptive innovation.  Amazon's Whole Foods innovations, like palm-scanning checkout and cashierless stores, illustrate the  difference between simply speeding up existing processes and rethinking the entire concept.

Successful technological integration requires identifying and challenging assumptions. For example, the ease of instant, global messaging should extend to cross-border money transfers, reducing the prevalent fees and delays. AI's true strength lies in pattern recognition, not truth-telling, opening possibilities beyond search engine enhancement, such as early disease detection through wearable health monitoring.  


Businesses aiming for lasting success need to go beyond incremental improvements and embrace a native mindset that drives groundbreaking change.</description>

			<title>Manu Joseph: Lessons from Donald Trump’s ‘Hillbilly’ running mate</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-donald-trump-s-running-mate-jd-vance-poor-people-obama-democrats-working-class-college-education-11724575098843.html</link>
			<description>Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir by J.D. Vance, explores the plight of White, working-class Americans in Appalachia, whom Vance calls "hillbillies." He argues that these communities are trapped in a cycle of poverty due to a combination of cultural, psychological, and socio-economic factors. Vance describes a community plagued by despair, addiction, and lack of opportunity, where the  American dream seems out of reach.  

Vance credits his grandparents for saving him from this fate through their strong values and insistence on hard work and education.  He acknowledges the historical and economic forces that have contributed to the decline of these communities, but also criticizes the perceived lack of personal responsibility and victim mentality prevalent among "hillbillies." 

The book sparked controversy for its blunt portrayal of the White working class and its suggestion that their struggles are partly self-inflicted. While some argue that Vance provides valuable insights into their world, others accuse him of offering a simplistic and judgmental perspective.   Regardless of its reception, Hillbilly Elegy has become a significant cultural touchstone, provoking discussion about the challenges faced by working-class Americans and the role of individual agency in overcoming poverty.</description>

			<title>Political thinking has become an unattractive career choice in free India</title>

			<description>The article discusses the dearth of political thinkers in independent India. Several factors contribute to this, including the lack of financial incentive in pursuing political studies compared to fields like technology or business.  

India's education system, which prioritizes rote memorization and discourages critical thinking, further stifles intellectual growth in the political realm. Additionally, the prevailing political climate is hostile to dissenting voices, with criticism often met with violence or imprisonment. 

The author argues that Indian political thought remains heavily influenced by Western paradigms and the legacies of prominent figures like Gandhi, Ambedkar, and Nehru. He suggests that instead of clinging to these grand narratives, Indian intellectuals should focus on addressing contemporary challenges, particularly the country's vast diversity and its implications for the digital age.</description>

			<title>The unravelling of a financial titan: Ravi Parthasarathy and the IL&amp;amp;FS scandal</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ravi-parthasarathy-il-fs-vijay-mallya-jet-airways-naresh-goyal-satyam-computers-adia-11724316384473.html</link>
			<description>Ravi Parthasarathy rose to prominence in the Indian financial sector during the 1980s and 1990s through his leadership at IL&amp;FS. The company, initially a public-private partnership model for infrastructure projects, grew under Parthasarathy's guidance, becoming a significant force in sectors like roads, ports, and power.  

However, IL&amp;FS's rapid expansion was fueled by short-term loans against long-term infrastructure projects, leading to a significant debt burden. Despite his reputation as a shrewd businessman, Parthasarathy's gamble on government support for his projects failed. His resignation in 2018 preceded the company's collapse, exposing a ₹91,000 crore debt pile accumulated through complex subsidiaries and questionable financial practices. His arrest in 2021 on charges of embezzlement and money laundering highlighted the depth of the scandal, ultimately resulting in the closure of the case after his death in 2022.</description>

			<title>Just outrage is useless to ensure women’s safety</title>

			<description>The Justice Hema Committee report, investigating the abduction and sexual assault of a leading actress in the Malayalam film industry, highlights the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and exploitation in the industry.  It reveals issues ranging from lack of safe work conditions to a powerful coterie of men who control opportunities.  

The report emphasizes that these issues are not unique to the film industry, but reflect broader societal issues of inequality and the lack of equal rights for women. It argues that while harsh punishments may seem like a solution, they are ineffective without addressing the root causes of violence against women, which include the persistence of patriarchal structures and cultural norms that condone and protect perpetrators. True change requires a fundamental shift in attitudes and a commitment to achieving genuine equality.</description>

			<title>Mint Quick Edit | Sovereign gold bonds on the way out? Savers would be dismayed.</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-sovereign-gold-bonds-gold-prices-investment-options-bond-market-government-exchequer-11724345007231.html</link>
			<description>There are rumors that the government might discontinue the issuance of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs) due to their high cost.  The government pays a fixed interest of 2.5% annually on these bonds, and their value is linked to gold prices, which have risen significantly since their introduction in 2015. This has resulted in a substantial financial burden for the government. 

Switching to regular bond markets, where interest rates are lower, could potentially reduce the government's interest burden, especially if gold prices continue to climb. With India's current account in a healthy position, the need for import-curbing measures like SGBs has lessened.  However, discontinuing SGBs would limit investment options for small savers seeking safe investments with market-level returns.</description>

			<title>China's industrial overcapacity problem will be harder to address this time</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-overcapacity-evs-industrial-production-lithium-batteries-byd-consumer-demand-private-businesses-11724274907625.html</link>
			<description>China is facing a new wave of industrial overcapacity, particularly in sectors like solar panels, electric vehicles, and lithium batteries. Plunging prices both domestically and internationally are hurting corporate profits, a phenomenon reminiscent of a similar situation in 2012-2016 when steel and coal industries were affected.  This time, however, the private sector dominates these booming industries, making government intervention more difficult. Some industry leaders view overcapacity as beneficial, seeing it as a way to eliminate weaker competitors.  

Further complicating the issue is the significant portion of  production that is exported. Stimulating demand domestically is challenging, especially given  geopolitical tensions with the West.  Unlike the previous instance where government investments  in redevelopment programs helped boost demand, a similar approach seems less feasible currently.  This suggests that China's overcapacity problem may persist until industry leaders themselves decide to scale back production.</description>

			<title>We need reduced government litigation to unclog the judicial system</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/judicial-reform-government-litigation-national-litigation-policy-justice-delivery-dispute-resolution-bureaucracy-11724274647370.html</link>
			<description>The author argues that excessive litigation by the Indian government is a major problem, hindering judicial efficiency and stifling business operations.  Government litigation accounts for a significant portion of cases in the Indian court system, often involving small amounts of money. This issue stems from bureaucratic risk aversion and an ingrained preference for following rules meticulously, even when it leads to unnecessary legal battles. 

Previous attempts at curbing government litigation through policies like NLP 2010 have been ineffective due to lack of clear thresholds and enforcement mechanisms. The author urges for a comprehensive national-level portal to track litigation across all government entities, coupled with a robust NLP 2024 with strict implementation, measurable targets, and penalties for noncompliance  to effectively address this longstanding challenge.</description>

			<title>Will increasing minimum wages ease the employment problem and help the economy?</title>

			<description>The article discusses the issue of stagnant wages for a significant portion of the Indian workforce, despite widespread unemployment.  

It contrasts this with the increasing minimum wages in developed countries and highlights studies showing that minimum wage increases do not negatively impact employment. The article argues that raising minimum wages, even at the MGNREGA level, would stimulate demand in the rural economy and benefit the overall economy by boosting wages for all workers. 

It emphasizes that raising minimum wages is not just economically beneficial but also a moral obligation of the government, especially when it is the largest employer.</description>

			<title>US Treasury's debt-issuances are keeping inflation above the Fed target</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/us-treasury-debt-issuances-inflation-federal-reserve-policy-rate-interest-rate-hikes-politics-us-elections-11724274084423.html</link>
			<description>The US Treasury's strategy of issuing more short-term debt than usual has been likened to "Activist Treasury Issuance" (ATI). This approach,  which has reduced coupon issuance by over $800 billion, operates similarly to Quantitative Easing (QE) by lowering interest rates and boosting asset prices. 

Essentially, ATI replaces  longer-term bonds with short-term bills, providing investors with more "money-like" assets. This has effectively counteracted the Federal Reserve's attempts to control inflation by raising interest rates. Consequently, inflation and growth have remained consistently above target. This tactic has raised concerns about a politicized business cycle, where policies are dictated by electoral cycles. 

To correct the situation, the Treasury needs to decrease excess bills, a move that would temporarily raise long-term yields but ultimately lead to a cooling effect on the economy, akin to a two-point interest rate hike.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the significance of deposit insurance in the current banking landscape. It highlights the importance of deposit insurance in maintaining public trust in the banking system, especially in light of recent bank failures globally.  

While full deposit insurance is desirable, the article acknowledges the associated moral hazards. It explores potential solutions such as risk-based premiums for banks and selective coverage for vulnerable populations.  

The article emphasizes the need for India to be prepared for potential banking crises in the future, given the increasing reliance on technology and the digitalization of financial services. It suggests that regulators must address various challenges, including coverage for digital deposit-like products and mitigating risks posed by climate change to credit quality.</description>

			<description>Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has expressed concern over e-commerce platforms using predatory pricing strategies, which he believes harm traditional retailers. Goyal stated that the significant investments made by these platforms in India are intended to cover losses incurred through such practices. He acknowledged the potential for this growth to disrupt the market and cause job losses in the retail sector. While recognizing the benefits of e-commerce, such as expanded choice and opportunities for small businesses, Goyal emphasized the need for a level playing field to ensure fair competition.</description>

			<title>KYC exists to prevent fraud and not to make people miserable</title>

			<description>This article discusses the evolution of KYC (Know Your Customer) norms in India and the challenges posed by fraudsters.  It highlights the shift from a reputation-based system to a technology-driven approach, spurred by digital advancements and government initiatives like Jan Dhan Yojana. While KYC has significantly improved financial inclusion, it has also created vulnerabilities exploited by fraudsters using stolen IDs and mule accounts. 

The article emphasizes the need for robust KYC measures to prevent identity theft and financial crimes. It suggests focusing on verification through technology, including liveness detection and fraud databases, and addressing discrepancies in regulations across different sectors. The core message is that while KYC might seem inconvenient, it is essential for protecting individuals and the financial system from fraud.</description>

			<description>Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is highly anticipated due to the current economic uncertainties and volatility. The speech comes at a time when market confidence in the Fed's guidance has been shaken. 

Powell has the opportunity to restore confidence by clearly outlining the Fed's policy stance, its objectives, and the path to achieving them. Key areas of focus should include the new equilibrium policy rate, the path towards that rate, and a realistic definition of a "sustainable" 2% inflation target. Lack of clarity could lead to renewed market volatility and further damage the Fed's credibility.</description>

			<title>India's inflation targeting: Base it on reality and not perceptions</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/retail-inflation-indian-economy-food-inflation-inflation-targeting-consumer-price-index-rbi-hces-11724182127298.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the debate surrounding India's inflation targeting regime.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor emphasizes the importance of headline inflation, which includes both food and non-food items, in influencing inflationary expectations. However, the article argues that this measure may be outdated, as the share of food expenditure in the overall consumption basket has declined since 2011-12.  

The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data reveals a significant disparity in the experienced inflation rates between different income groups, with the poorest segment facing significantly higher food inflation than the richest. The author suggests that the RBI could re-weight the existing Consumer Price Index (CPI) items to reflect these changes in consumption patterns and that the inflation target should be more directly related to the action of monetary policy. 

They also point out that monetary policy has limited impact on supply-side inflation of food and that focusing on controlling it through monetary instruments could be counterproductive.  The article ultimately calls for a re-evaluation of the inflation targeting mandate to align it with real-world economic realities rather than perceptions influenced by social media.</description>

			<title>Sovereign gold bond dilemma: How a well-intentioned scheme is draining government coffers</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sovereign-gold-bond-government-borrowing-scheme-t-bills-forex-budget-11724216545061.html</link>
			<description>The sovereign gold bond (SGB) scheme, intended to satisfy investor demand for gold and fund government borrowing, has proven more expensive than traditional Treasury instruments. Although interest rates on SGBs are lower, their price is linked to gold, exposing the government to forex risk due to the US dollar connection.  

The  recent rise in gold prices, compounded by the rupee's depreciation, has resulted in the government effectively paying 13.5-14% on redeemed SGBs. This compares to  around half the cost for T-Bills and gilts.  To attract investors, capital gains tax on SGBs is exempt, further increasing the government's cost.  

The government has recognized the financial burden and reduced its proposed SGB issuance for FY25. Recognizing the inflationary hedge benefits of gold, the government is likely to phase out the SGB scheme despite its appeal to investors.</description>

			<description>The article explores Novak Djokovic's unwavering dedication to winning an Olympic gold medal, even after already achieving numerous grand slam victories.  This relentless pursuit of a higher goal, the article argues, is a lesson for India as it strives for continued growth. 

Comparing Djokovic's drive to India's past successes, the article highlights how entrepreneurial endeavors arose from a need for survival, fueled by a strong sense of national ambition.

It acknowledges the shift in mindset among younger generations, who may not face the same immediate survival needs, and warns against complacency setting in. 

Ultimately, the article posits that India needs to identify compelling "higher order goals" that will inspire the same level of dedication and hard work seen in Djokovic, thus propelling the nation towards future triumphs in fields like technology and public digital infrastructure.</description>

			<title>India’s deposit insurer is overcharging commercial banks</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bank-deposits-rbi-cooperative-banks-insurance-premiums-digcg-insurance-companies-risk-commercial-banks-11724181520659.html</link>
			<description>The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), responsible for insuring bank deposits in India, has faced criticism for its high insurance premiums, particularly for commercial banks. Despite having significantly lower risk profiles than cooperative banks, commercial banks contribute most of the DICGC's premium revenue while experiencing a negligible share of claims.  

The article argues that this disproportionate burden unfairly penalizes well-managed commercial banks. It suggests that the DICGC should re-evaluate its premium structure, lowering the rate for commercial banks and increasing it for cooperative banks to ensure a more risk-based pricing system. The article estimates that this would save commercial banks approximately ₹20,000 crore in 2025-26 while still leaving the DICGC with a substantial surplus.  

The authors contend that this reform would benefit the economy by reducing compliance costs for banks, which often get passed on to depositors and borrowers, ultimately hindering growth. They also highlight the effectiveness of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in managing bank failures, reinforcing the argument that high insurance premiums are unnecessary.</description>

			<title>India has reason to be wary of China's economic slowdown</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-economy-steel-industry-economic-slowdown-fdi-foreign-policy-chinese-ev-import-tariffs-11724181277312.html</link>
			<description>A slowing Chinese economy is raising concerns globally, with its growth projected to fall to 3.3% by 2029. Problems within China's domestic economy, such as a real estate downturn and declining consumption, have led to a slump in its steel industry. This has resulted in a decrease in steel prices globally, impacting Indian steel manufacturers who have been experiencing strong growth. 

The slowdown also threatens to increase imports of subsidized Chinese goods, hurting Indian manufacturing and widening the already significant trade deficit with China.  While the economic survey suggests welcoming more Chinese FDI, India must carefully navigate the situation, balancing economic interests with geopolitical and security concerns.</description>

			<title>The eastern states have a big role in India's development aim</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indian-economy-bihar-economic-growth-gdp-per-capita-jharkhand-eastern-states-development-skilled-workforce-11724097646577.html</link>
			<description>The economic development of India's eastern region is crucial for the nation's goal of becoming a developed economy by 2047. Despite possessing mineral wealth and strategic advantages, these states lag behind in GDP, social progress, and skilled workforce participation. 

While the region's GDP has grown, its contribution to national GDP remains stagnant. To achieve a $30 trillion economy by 2047, the eastern region needs to grow at 9% annually, a rate significantly higher than its current average of 5.5%.  

Several challenges hinder this progress, including low social progress rankings, a high proportion of unskilled labor, and persistent socioeconomic disparities.  Addressing these issues requires focused development strategies and state government intervention, particularly in Bihar and Jharkhand.  Achieving beta convergence, where economically weaker regions grow faster than richer ones, is essential for the eastern region to contribute its full potential to India's economic future.</description>

			<description>Pro-Palestinian organizers plan to protest at the Democratic National Convention, hoping to pressure Vice President Kamala Harris on her stance toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Harris has adopted a firmer stance than President Biden, demanding Israel target Hamas rather than civilians and skipping Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to Congress.

 Despite this toughened rhetoric, the Biden administration has approved a $20 billion arms sale to Israel, a move that has alienated some pro-Palestinian supporters. Harris faces a difficult balancing act, needing to appease both allies within her own party and those who advocate for Palestinian rights. 

Organizers believe Harris's potential presidency offers a chance for positive change, while acknowledging the need to build a broader coalition to achieve their goals.  The situation remains tense, with a heavy humanitarian cost in Gaza and growing public pressure for a cease-fire.</description>

			<title>Subsidies and MSP:It makes most sense for farmers to keep growing rice and wheat</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/subsidies-msp-agriculture-rice-wheat-cultivation-oilseeds-pulses-tur-dal-crop-diversification-11724096959023.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that India's agricultural landscape is stuck in a rut, with farmers predominantly cultivating rice and wheat due to subsidies and guaranteed minimum support prices (MSP). While these policies ensure a return on investment for rice and wheat, they disincentivize the cultivation of other crops like pulses, oilseeds, and millets.   

The author contends that a purely economic standpoint suggests that farmers would benefit from diversifying their crops. Pulses like tur and urad offer higher profit margins per kilogram but have lower yields compared to rice and wheat.  Similarly, oilseeds like groundnut can be profitable but still lag behind wheat in total income.  

The article highlights the need to revamp existing agricultural policies to promote crop diversification. The current MSP system, which features open-ended procurement, is deemed inefficient and outdated. The author suggests targeting smaller farmers through a revised MSP mechanism and encouraging states to rationalize their power and water subsidies to incentivize farmers to explore alternative crops.</description>

			<title>India might already be on the path to universal basic income</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/universal-basic-income-direct-cash-transfers-retail-inflation-bjp-government-11724096210313.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the rise of cash transfer schemes in India, particularly in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Haryana. 

These programs, often introduced ahead of state elections, provide financial assistance to women or cap cooking gas prices for the poor.  While they aim to address economic distress faced by these populations and may prove effective in boosting consumer spending, the article raises concerns about their sustainability. 

It questions the source of funding for these schemes, the potential for political manipulation, and the long-term impact on public service delivery.  The article concludes by speculating if these schemes are a disguised form of universal basic income and poses fundamental questions about their efficacy and the broader implications for India's welfare system.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/abandon-prejudices-for-womens-participation-in-workforce-to-rise-11724095931780.html</link>
			<description>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) emphasizes the importance of increasing women's participation in the labor force for economic growth. 

India's female labor force participation rate (LFPR) is significantly lower than that of men and other countries, lagging behind even Bangladesh and the global average.  

This gap hinders economic potential, as closing it could boost GDP significantly.  

Beyond safety concerns, societal prejudices and traditional norms restrict women's opportunities.  

Addressing these issues requires a multi-pronged approach, including promoting urbanization, reforming attitudes, and sharing household responsibilities more equitably.</description>

			<description>Economists are revising recession predictions frequently due to global economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs recently reduced the US recession odds to 20% from 25%, citing positive retail sales data.  

However, debate continues over the potential impact of economic troubles on the US and the global economy. Investor sentiment has been volatile, with stock markets experiencing fluctuations worldwide, including India. 

While India's economy is domestically focused, its increasing global integration leaves it vulnerable to external shocks, which could affect exports and capital inflows.</description>

			<description>Quantum cryptography utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communications, offering protection against decryption even by powerful quantum computers. 

Two main methods are Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). QKD, considered more secure, involves sharing a secret key between parties using quantum particles in a way that any eavesdropping attempt alters their state, alerting the parties to the intrusion. PQC, relies on complex mathematical algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks.  

Major players like the US, China, and the EU are investing heavily in quantum cryptography research and development.  While challenges like cost and scalability of hardware remain, the field holds immense promise for revolutionizing global cybersecurity in the digital age.</description>

			<title>Break the chain: Starbucks’ new CEO could maybe escape Schultz’s long shadow</title>

			<description>Starbucks has hired Brian Niccol, former CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill, to lead the company. This appointment comes amidst ongoing concerns about the influence of Howard Schultz, Starbucks' long-time CEO and now chairman emeritus. Schultz, who remains a significant shareholder and has various ongoing ties to the company, is known to have  had a say in key decisions, even undermining his previous successors. 

Niccol, who has experience dealing with both activist investors and founders, likely demanded the chairman title, mirroring his position at Chipotle. This move further complicates Starbucks' governance structure, as dual CEO-chairman roles are increasingly uncommon in corporate America. Despite the immense success Schultz built, his prolonged presence raises questions about his potential to hinder Starbucks' future growth and succession planning.</description>

			<description>India lags significantly behind China in education, with students scoring 20 points lower on average in math, science, and reading.  This gap is reflected in lower enrollment rates in higher education and a 44% lower labor productivity in India compared to China.  A lack of foundational literacy skills, coupled with low parental engagement and teacher dissatisfaction, creates a vicious cycle that hinders learning.  Addressing this requires heightened involvement from parents, teachers, and communities through structured training, recognition programs, and clear communication about student progress.  Strategies like personalized learning, technology integration, and streamlined administrative tasks can empower teachers and improve learning outcomes.  Creating a supportive educational environment where everyone plays an active role is crucial for India to achieve its educational goals.</description>

			<description>Recent surveys on unincorporated businesses in India reveal that while the number of enterprises and employment have increased since 2021, the majority of these businesses remain unregistered. Only 2% of  micro businesses are registered for GST, highlighting a significant gap in formalization despite government initiatives. While many benefits are linked to registration, such as access to formal credit and government schemes, a lack of financial literacy and compliance complexities act as barriers. 

The data also shows a stark difference in turnover and GVA between registered and unregistered businesses, suggesting that formalization can significantly improve the economic viability of small enterprises.  The article proposes solutions such as more accessible GST helpdesks and user-friendly super-apps to address compliance challenges and promote financial inclusion, ultimately driving the formalization of India's micro-business sector.</description>

			<description>The global tech landscape is shifting with hardware, particularly semiconductors, becoming the new engine of innovation. Companies like TSMC, MediaTek, Samsung, and SK Hynix are experiencing remarkable growth in chip revenues, demonstrating this trend. Despite this, some in Silicon Valley and India cling to the belief that software will remain dominant.  

This perspective risks overlooking the crucial role of hardware in shaping the future of technology. In this new era, strategic investments in hardware companies, particularly semiconductor manufacturers, are becoming increasingly important. India, with its strong engineering talent, should leverage this opportunity by investing in hardware capabilities, forging strategic partnerships with East Asian firms, and encouraging regulatory frameworks that support hardware development. As chips are becoming the "new oil," India needs to act decisively to secure its position in this evolving technological landscape.</description>

			<description>After being under central rule since 2018, Jammu and Kashmir is set to hold elections to restore power to its people. The Election Commission announced a three-phase schedule, spanning from September 18th to October 1st. This move is welcomed as it will re-establish democratic processes in the region after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. 

While central rule has brought stability and accelerated development, it has also raised concerns about the erosion of democratic rights. The upcoming elections are expected to address these concerns and demonstrate the people's desire for self-governance.</description>

			<title>Examination coaching crisis: It’s a monster of our own creation</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/examinations-coaching-centres-exams-education-indian-colleges-tutions-anxiety-stress-11723975679834.html</link>
			<description>India's booming coaching industry, driven by societal pressure to succeed in high-stakes exams like those for engineering and medicine, has created a system where students are pushed into relentless academic pressure. This emphasis on rote learning over genuine understanding has led to a flawed education system that fails to equip graduates with the skills they need for the job market.  

The article criticizes the focus on coaching, arguing that it perpetuates a cycle of pressure and anxiety, stifling students' natural curiosity and well-being. It blames societal values that prioritize academic achievement over other forms of learning and suggests that the role of government regulation is counterproductive, as evidenced by the failings of existing regulations in the education sector. The author calls for a fundamental shift in how we value education, moving away from the pursuit of high-stakes exams and towards a system that fosters genuine learning and personal growth.</description>

			<title>China should consider setting a formal inflation target</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/chinese-central-bank-inflation-targetting-deflation-price-stability-consumer-price-increase-bond-market-rally-us-fed-11723973087978.html</link>
			<description>China is facing the challenge of low inflation, a situation prompting calls for policy intervention.  An influential advisor to the central bank has suggested adopting a 2%-3% inflation target, similar to targets set by other countries in the past.

This approach aims to provide predictability and guide policy decisions.  Advocates argue that it encourages businesses and households to adjust their behavior in anticipation of price trends.

However, implementing such a target in China presents political hurdles.  Central bank independence, often linked to inflation targets in other countries, is limited in China, where power is highly centralized.  Despite these challenges, the idea of an inflation target resonates as a potential solution to China's economic slowdown, which could also have global implications.</description>

			<title>The US elections will have a big impact on the climate change fight</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-us-elections-will-have-a-big-impact-on-the-climate-change-fight-11723971721687.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 US presidential election will have significant implications for global climate change efforts.  

Donald Trump's stance, if re-elected, would likely see the US withdraw from both the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, jeopardizing international cooperation. This could also endanger agreements with other countries like the EU and China.

In contrast, Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee,  supports ambitious climate action, including the Green New Deal. She could potentially strengthen US commitments and negotiate with other nations to address climate change.

However, Harris faces a dilemma as US tariffs on Chinese solar panels and EVs hinder the adoption of clean energy technologies. Balancing economic interests with climate goals will be a key challenge for the next president.</description>
