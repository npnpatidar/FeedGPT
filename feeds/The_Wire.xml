			<title>'Exposure to Air Pollution Changes the Way Our Airways Behave’: Surge in Respiratory Symptoms in Delhi</title>
			<link>https://thewire.in/environment/exposure-to-air-pollution-changes-the-way-our-airways-behave-surge-in-respiratory-symptoms-in-delhi</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the detrimental health impact and economic toll of air pollution in India. According to the World Economic Forum, air pollution costs the Indian economy $95 billion annually, which is equivalent to 3% of India's GDP [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/). The pollution crisis in Delhi, the national capital, is primarily attributed to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning in neighboring states. This has led to a surge in harmful pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 particles, resulting in respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and a decline in overall well-being [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).

The article mentions that intense air pollution exposure is changing the way our airways behave. Even healthy individuals have reported symptoms such as cough, breathlessness, chest tightness, fatigue, headache, eye irritation, and sneezing. These symptoms are likely related to worsening air pollution, and some individuals may develop asthma-like or allergic conditions due to the intense air pollution exposure.

The impact of air pollution on heart patients is particularly concerning. Studies have shown that air pollution increases the risk of high blood pressure, which is detrimental to heart patients.

The severity of respiratory illnesses, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has escalated due to air pollution. Patients with these conditions have reported a notable deterioration in their symptoms, including increased wheeziness, breathlessness, and a greater need for inhalers. Acute asthma attacks have also increased, leading to hospitalizations and intensified treatments [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).

The economic impact of air pollution in India is significant. The World Economic Forum estimates that if India had achieved safe air quality levels in 2019, its GDP would have increased by $95 billion, or 3%. This potential increase in GDP is equivalent to 50% of all tax collected annually or 150% of India's healthcare budget. Clean air is beneficial to the economy and businesses, leading to lower absenteeism, higher on-the-job productivity, higher consumer footfall, and lower premature mortality [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).

In summary, air pollution in India, particularly in Delhi, has detrimental effects on public health and the economy. The economic toll is estimated to be $95 billion annually, equivalent to 3% of India's GDP. The pollution crisis is primarily caused by vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning. The surge in harmful pollutants has led to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and a decline in overall well-being. Even healthy individuals are experiencing symptoms related to air pollution exposure. Heart patients and individuals with respiratory illnesses are particularly vulnerable. Reducing air pollution is crucial for improving public health and increasing economic growth in India [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).</description>
