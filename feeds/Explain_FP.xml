			<title>Can your liver heal itself once you stop drinking alcohol?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-your-liver-heal-itself-once-you-stop-drinking-alcohol-13625682.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the effects of long-term and heavy alcohol use on the liver. It explains that the liver is the largest internal organ and is responsible for breaking down toxins, including alcohol. Alcohol can cause the liver to become fatty and inflamed, leading to the production of scar tissue. If left unchecked, this can result in cirrhosis, a condition where the liver is extensively scarred. In the late stages of cirrhosis, liver failure can occur, which is a serious and potentially fatal condition. However, there is good news. If someone with a fatty liver stops drinking alcohol for two to three weeks, the liver can heal and return to normal. Even in cases of liver inflammation or mild scarring, noticeable improvements can be seen within seven days of alcohol cessation. For heavy drinkers with more severe scarring or liver failure, giving up alcohol for several years can reduce the risk of worsening liver failure and death. It's important to note that abruptly stopping alcohol consumption can cause alcohol withdrawal, so medical advice should be sought. In addition to liver health, giving up alcohol also has positive effects on sleep, brain function, blood pressure, and reduces the risk of certain types of cancer, heart disease, and stroke. However, it's essential to maintain a balanced lifestyle that includes a healthy diet and regular exercise. So, while the liver has the ability to repair itself to some extent, severe scarring cannot be completely reversed.</description>

			<title>Does cold weather make Teslas, other EVs go kaput?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/does-cold-weather-make-teslas-other-evs-go-kaput-13634552.html</link>
			<description>In extreme cold weather, Electric Vehicles (EVs) can face challenges due to their batteries, which are made from Lithium Ion. These batteries tend to fare poorly in cold temperatures, causing a decrease in driving range. Additionally, the low-voltage battery in EVs can lose its charge in extremely cold weather, similar to vehicles with combustion engines. This can result in longer charging times and reduced power. The design of EVs, which increases battery temperatures in cold weather, also contributes to these issues. It is important for EV owners to precondition the battery before charging and keep the car plugged in to maintain a 20% charge. Parking indoors, using a car cover, checking tire air pressure, and driving with ECO-mode on can also help improve EV performance in cold weather.</description>

			<description>Hmm, it seems you're asking about a trend called the 'nose cover' that is popular among Generation Z on social media. The trend involves covering the middle of their faces with their hands in photos. It allows camera-shy teens to keep their face out of the picture and avoid potential embarrassment or cyberbullying. Some parents have questioned the trend, while others understand the concerns of online bullying and support their children's decision to participate. It's an interesting phenomenon that has gained traction on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.</description>

			<title>Which country has the most gold reserves? What’s India’s rank?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/which-country-has-the-most-gold-reserves-whats-indias-rank-13628192.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with a summary of the article you shared. The World Gold Council (WGC) released estimates of gold reserves held by countries as of the third quarter of 2023. The United States has the largest gold reserves, followed by Germany, Italy, and France. India stands at the ninth rank with 800.78 tonnes of gold in its official reserves. The Reserve Bank of India has been increasing its gold holdings since 2017. Gold serves as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation for central banks. It helps diversify their total reserves and can increase a country's creditworthiness. Gold's value typically rises during economic turmoil or geopolitical tensions.</description>

			<description>Cybercriminals are targeting devotees of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya by promising them free VIP entry and free prasad through a malicious app. The scam involves tricking people into downloading an APK file and sharing it with others. Additionally, fraudsters are seeking funds for the temple's construction through fake social media pages and offering free prasad that is not authorized. It is important for devotees to exercise caution and rely on verified sources for information and services related to the temple.</description>

			<description>Indian airlines carried a record-breaking 152 million passengers in 2023, marking a significant increase in air traffic. This number was 23% higher than the previous year and over 5% more than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In December alone, the industry reached a milestone with 13.8 million passengers, surpassing the previous record set in May. However, along with the rise in travelers, there has been an increase in passenger complaints regarding facilities, delays, and other issues. The report highlights that 712 passenger-related complaints were received in December 2023, with flight problems and refunds being the main reasons. The majority of complaints have been addressed by the airlines, with SpiceJet receiving the highest number of complaints followed by Air India and IndiGo.</description>

			<title>France, China among countries seeing fewer births: Is world population declining?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/france-china-among-countries-seeing-fewer-births-is-world-population-declining-13625272.html</link>
			<description>France's birth rates reached a record low in 2023, with only 678,000 babies born, the lowest number since 1946. This decline in births has been ongoing since 2010, and last year saw a drop of 6.6%. Despite the decline in births, France's population has grown due to factors such as migration and increased life expectancy. Other European countries, as well as China, South Korea, and Japan, are also facing population decline. However, globally, the world population is projected to continue rising, reaching 10.9 billion by 2100.</description>

			<title>Scientists clone first healthy rhesus monkey. Why is this significant?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/scientists-clone-first-healthy-rhesus-monkey-why-is-this-significant-13625152.html</link>
			<description>Scientists in China have successfully cloned a healthy rhesus monkey named Retro using a modified version of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This breakthrough is significant because previous attempts to clone primates had been largely unsuccessful. The researchers replaced the cells that become the placenta with those from a healthy, non-cloned embryo, leading to the birth of Retro. The hope is that this technique can be used to create genetically uniform monkeys for medical research and disease modeling. However, the success rate of the new method is still low, and ethical concerns surrounding cloning remain.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhis-maladies-how-harsh-winters-high-pollution-are-making-people-sick-13624212.html</link>
			<description>Cases of H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu, are increasing in Delhi due to a combination of harsh winter weather and high pollution levels. The elderly and those with underlying health conditions are particularly affected, with respiratory and heart-related problems on the rise. The flu is highly contagious and spreads through coughing, sneezing, and touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms include runny nose, coughing, breathlessness, sore throat, and fever with rash. Longer hospital stays are attributed to the interaction between the flu and bacterial infections. Experts recommend getting the annual flu vaccination as the best defense against H1N1.</description>

			<title>What are ‘pajama injunctions’ that are giving Rishi Sunak sleepless nights?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-pajama-injunctions-that-are-giving-rishi-sunak-sleepless-nights-13624072.html</link>
			<description>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing opposition from the right-wing of the Conservative Party regarding his Rwanda deportation plan and his efforts to stop illegal immigration. One issue he is encountering is the issuance of "pajama injunctions" by the European Court of Human Rights, which have halted several deportation flights to Rwanda. Sunak has introduced the "Safety of Rwanda Bill" to counter these injunctions, but some members of the Conservative Party believe the proposed law doesn't go far enough and want the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Sunak recently won a vote on the legislation, but there is ongoing dissatisfaction within the party.</description>

			<title>How AI can now copy handwriting. Is it a reason to worry?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-ai-can-now-copy-handwriting-is-it-a-reason-to-worry-13621292.html</link>
			<description>Researchers at Abu Dhabi's Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) have developed a technology that can mimic someone's handwriting. They employed a transformer model, a neural network designed to study context and meaning in sequential data, which is able to replicate handwriting with just a few paragraphs of sample material. The technology could benefit people with disabilities or injuries that prevent them from writing and could also be used to improve how other AI models process handwriting. The creators are mindful of the potential for misuse and are considering public awareness and tools to combat forgery. The technology is yet to be released, and the team has had success in replicating handwriting in English and French, but not in Arabic. The university, which is described as the world's first AI university, opened in 2020 after being announced in 2019.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-us-grew-nearly-twice-the-size-of-spain-heres-how-13621792.html</link>
			<description>The United States has experienced an expansion of its continental shelf, growing by 386,000 square miles last month. The growth was determined through the analysis of data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Geological Survey since 2003. The extended continental shelf (ECS) includes vital habitats for marine life and resources such as corals and crabs. This development impacts the US's efforts to secure territorial rights in the Arctic. The US now has the largest exclusive economic zone on the planet. Territorial rights with Russia do not require future negotiations due to a 1990 agreement. Canada may have overlapping claims that can be resolved in the future.</description>

			<title>Why IndiGo is in trouble over viral video of flyers eating on Mumbai airport tarmac</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/indigo-flight-viral-video-of-flyers-eating-on-mumbai-airport-tarmac-13620582.html</link>
			<description>IndiGo Airlines and Mumbai Airport are facing criticism after a video of passengers eating on the tarmac went viral. The flight, which was diverted to Mumbai due to poor visibility, experienced delays and passengers refused to enter the terminal building. The Civil Aviation ministry has issued a show-cause notice to both IndiGo Airlines and Mumbai Airport, stating that they were not proactive in anticipating the situation and making appropriate arrangements for passengers. The notice warns of potential enforcement action, including financial penalties, if comprehensive responses are not received. IndiGo Airlines is also accused of breaching security rules by allowing passengers to board without proper checks.</description>

			<title>Forget snow, there is a water shortage in Kashmir. What is going on?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/forget-snow-there-is-a-water-shortage-in-kashmir-what-is-going-on-13619642.html</link>
			<description>Kashmir is experiencing a water shortage due to a prolonged dry spell and lack of snow and rain. The Jhelum River and other water bodies are drying up, causing concerns for agriculture and water supply. Glaciers are also shrinking, which will have long-term implications for groundwater recharge and power production. The dry weather is attributed to El Nino and the absence of a strong western disturbance. The tourism industry in Kashmir, particularly ski resorts, has been severely impacted. Relief may come with a possible rain or snowfall after January 25th.</description>

			<title>Trump wins Iowa: Does this increase his chances of becoming US president?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/donald-trump-wins-iowa-does-this-increase-his-chances-of-becoming-the-next-us-president-13619362.html</link>
			<description>Former President Donald Trump won the Iowa caucuses, solidifying his frontrunner status in the Republican primary. He secured almost three-quarters of the early vote, marking a historic victory and demonstrating his dominance among Republican voters. However, winning in Iowa does not guarantee success in the remaining race or the general election, as past winners have not always become the party's nominee or won the presidency. Iowa's caucuses are considered crucial for winnowing the field and giving candidates a springboard for the rest of the race, but they do not necessarily reflect the mood of the nation.</description>

			<description>Nine-year-old Indian-American schoolgirl, Preesha Chakraborty, has been named one of the "world's brightest" students by the prestigious Johns Hopkins Centre for Talented Youth. Preesha, a Grade 3 student at Warm Spring Elementary school in California, was selected from a pool of over 16,000 students from around the world. She achieved exceptional scores on above-grade-level tests, qualifying her for the Grand Honors. Preesha's achievement allows her to participate in over 250 advanced programs in subjects such as mathematics, computer programming, and writing. She is also a member of the Mensa Foundation, a high-IQ society. Preesha's parents describe her as passionate about learning, and the recognition from Johns Hopkins is a testament to her curiosity and capacity for learning. This is not the first time an Indian-American student has been recognized as one of the "world's brightest." In 2023, Natasha Perianayagam, a 13-year-old prodigy, was also named on the list.</description>

			<description>The Iowa caucus is an important event in the US presidential race. It is a gathering of registered party members who discuss candidates and issues before voting on a piece of paper. The winner of the caucus receives a publicity boost and can gain momentum for future contests. This year, the Republican caucus will have a binding impact on the race, while the Democratic caucus will only conduct administrative business. Iowa's importance as the first caucus state has been reinforced over the years, although its lack of diversity has been criticized. Donald Trump is favored to win the Republican caucus, while the race for second place is competitive.</description>

He is considered Palestine's most senior leader in prison and has played a significant role in Palestinian resistance and politics. Barghouti has been involved in the Fatah organization since his youth and has been imprisoned multiple times for his activism. Despite his incarceration, Barghouti has continued to be active and was instrumental in the signing of the Prisoner's Document in 2006. He is seen as a potential leader who could unite rival Palestinian political groups, but the chances of him assuming a leadership role after the current Israel-Hamas war are uncertain.</description>

			<title>Lai Ching-te wins Taiwan elections. What comes next?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lai-ching-te-wins-taiwan-elections-what-comes-next-13614002.html</link>
			<description>Taiwan's 2024 presidential election saw Vice President Lai Ching-te, also known as William Lai, win comfortably with over 40% of the vote. Despite warnings from China that his victory would bring conflict, Lai emphasized Taiwan's commitment to democracy. Experts predict that China may increase military pressure and employ "grey zone" tactics to escalate tensions with Taiwan. There may also be economic squeezes as China leans on Taiwanese semiconductor imports. Although Lai won the presidency, his party lost its majority in the legislature. However, there is consensus among the Taiwanese public on issues like national defense. Lai's win signifies the majority of Taiwanese standing behind the values of preserving democracy and a distinct Taiwanese identity.</description>

			<description>Milind Deora, a former Congress leader, has quit the party and joined the Shiv Sena. His decision comes as other young leaders have also left the Congress. Deora cited several reasons for his exit, including the party's deviation from its ideological roots and its focus on opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His departure will impact the Congress, as he was considered a strong candidate for the Mumbai South Lok Sabha seat. It is also feared that his exit may prompt other party members to switch sides.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-are-the-three-men-in-the-race-to-become-taiwan-president-13608402.html</link>
			<description>The Taiwanese election is significant due to the potential for increased military tensions between China and the United States. Beijing views the election as a choice between war and peace, as it considers Taiwan a breakaway province. The three candidates are Lai Ching-te, who supports Taiwan's independence; Hou Yu-ih, from the opposition party Kuomintang, who advocates for dialogue with China; and Ko Wen-je, who seeks a middle ground in relations with Beijing. The economy and housing costs are major concerns for Taiwanese voters. China has not publicly declared its favored candidate but has urged voters to make the "right choice" for cross-Strait harmony.</description>

			<description>The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), officially known as Atal Setu Nhava Sheva Sea Link, is India's longest sea bridge. It has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and will significantly reduce travel time between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The bridge spans 21.8 kilometers and has six lanes. It was constructed at a cost of Rs 17,840 crore. The MTHL is named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and is expected to shorten travel time to Pune, Goa, and South India. Four-wheelers, including cars, taxis, light motor vehicles, minibuses, and two-axle buses, are allowed on the bridge. However, motorcycles, mopeds, three-wheeler tempos, auto rickshaws, tractors, animal-drawn vehicles, and slow-moving vehicles are not permitted. The maximum speed limit for four-wheelers on the bridge is 100 kmph, which reduces to 40 kmph during ascent and descent. The toll for the MTHL ranges from Rs 200 to Rs 300, depending on the stretch. The MTHL is a remarkable engineering feat, with 16.50 kilometers constructed over the sea and 5.5 kilometers on land. It is made of structural steel that is 17 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower and equivalent to the weight of 500 Boeing airplanes. The concrete used is six times that of the Statue of Liberty. The MTHL is expected to bring about speedy development and attract new projects and corporations to the area. It will greatly improve connectivity and reduce traffic congestion.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-the-big-concerns-of-taiwans-voters-it-is-not-china-13605992.html</link>
			<description>Taiwan's upcoming election is expected to bring about significant changes. While China remains a concern, many voters, especially the younger generation, prioritize other issues. The struggling economy is a major concern, with low-wage workers, housing affordability, and unemployment being key issues. The cost of childcare, corruption, judicial reform, education, and minority rights are also important to voters. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Kuomintang (KMT) are the leading parties, but the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) is gaining support, particularly among the youth. The threat from China is not overlooked, but young voters are also focused on a range of other issues.</description>

			<title>Why PM chose Nashik's Panchvati to begin rituals for Ram Mandir opening</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-narendra-modi-nashik-panchvati-special-11-day-rituals-ayodhya-ram-mandir-opening-13605792.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that he will observe a special ritual called "Yama Niyama" for 11 days prior to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He will start the rituals from Panchvati in Maharashtra's Nashik. Panchvati holds significance in the Ramayana as Lord Ram, Goddess Sita, and Lord Lakshman spent part of their exile there. PM Modi will visit Panchvati and follow the rituals, including fasting, as part of his anushthan. He also offered prayers at the Kalaram temple in Nashik.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ram-mandir-what-is-the-pran-pratishtha-ceremony-why-is-it-important-13597882.html</link>
			<description>The pran pratishtha ceremony at the Ayodhya Ram temple will take place on January 22nd. This sacred Hindu ritual is performed to invoke the deity into an idol, making it sacred and capable of accepting prayers. The ceremony will be preceded by seven days of rituals, including bathing the idol in milk and applying fragrances. The idol will be placed in the temple's sanctum sanctorum facing east, and priests will sing hymns and perform rituals. The ceremony concludes with the opening of the statue's eyes. Once completed, the pran pratishtha is considered eternal. The Ram Mandir launch is expected to be a historic event, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many VVIPs in attendance.</description>

			<title>Rotten eggs, urine and more: How smelly is space?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rotten-eggs-urine-and-more-how-smelly-is-space-13603722.html</link>
			<description>In space, astronauts can encounter various smells. During the Apollo moon landings, astronauts reported a gunpowder-like smell when they returned to the lunar spacecraft and removed their helmets. Similarly, astronauts returning to the International Space Station after spacewalking have described odors such as gunpowder, ozone, and burnt steak. When the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft encountered comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it detected compounds that emitted the stench of rotten eggs, bitter almonds, and cat urine. Astronauts often compare the smell of space to hot metal, burnt meat, burnt cakes, spent gunpowder, and welding of metal. Uranus is known to have a smell of flatulence due to the presence of hydrogen sulfide. Titan, one of Saturn's moons, has an odor of gasoline or petrol due to its oil-covered surface. Sagittarius B2, a molecular gas cloud in the Milky Way, contains alcohol and chemicals responsible for the sweet fragrances of raspberries and rum. The specific reasons behind these smells vary, from the presence of oxygen and ozone to the presence of certain compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in burnt toast and barbecued meat.</description>

			<title>Why Sheikh Hasina’s record win in Bangladesh matters to India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-sheikh-hasinas-record-win-in-bangladesh-matters-to-india-13588622.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh, has won re-election for a fifth term. Her party, the Awami League, secured 224 seats out of 299, while independent candidates won 62 seats. This election was closely watched by neighboring countries India and China due to their interests in the outcome. Hasina's win is significant for India as the two countries share a border and have deep historical, cultural, and economic ties. Hasina has been cooperative in terms of national security, cracking down on anti-India elements and providing assistance to curb anti-India activity. Additionally, under Hasina's leadership, Bangladesh has become the second-largest economy in the region, and the two countries have fostered close economic ties. Hasina also maintains a supportive stance towards the Narendra Modi administration. Her ties to India go beyond the usual neighborly relationship, as India provided refuge to Hasina and her family following a tragic event in 1975.</description>

			<title>Drink Responsibly: Is it possible to be allergic to alcohol?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/drink-responsibly-is-it-possible-to-be-allergic-to-alcohol-13583682.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, alcohol allergies are rare, but some people may experience allergy-like symptoms when drinking alcohol. These symptoms can include wheezing, headaches, and skin flushing. However, these reactions are often attributed to alcohol exacerbating underlying conditions like asthma, hives, and rhinitis. It's important to note that these symptoms are not true allergies but rather alcohol intolerance, which occurs when the body lacks the necessary enzymes to digest and eliminate alcohol. The composition of the drink, including substances like histamine, congeners, sulphur dioxide, and additives, can also contribute to these reactions. Identifying triggers and avoiding them is often the best course of action.</description>

			<title>A Resolution You Need: Eat breakfast before 8 am, dinner before 8 pm. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/a-resolution-you-need-eat-breakfast-before-8-am-dinner-before-8-pm-heres-why-13571382.html</link>
			<description>Irregular meal schedules, such as skipping breakfast or eating late, have been linked to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, according to a study published in the Journal Nature Communications. Delaying the first meal of the day after 9 am is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, while eating late at night (after 9 pm) increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease, particularly in women. The study suggests that having an earlier first and last meal, along with a longer period of night-time fasting, may help reduce the risk of these diseases. It is recommended to have breakfast by 8 am and the last meal by 8 pm to align with the body's circadian rhythm and promote overall health.</description>

			<title>Is the world ready to go passport-free in 2024?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-the-world-ready-to-go-passport-free-in-2024-13579792.html</link>
			<description>The UK Home Office plans to introduce new e-gates equipped with facial recognition technology at airports, aiming to establish a "frictionless" and intelligent border. The government wants to raise the level of border security to that of other developed countries, such as Dubai. The e-gates will go through trials later this year. Additionally, the UK has already implemented electronic travel authorizations for visitors from abroad who do not require a visa. The Home Office intends to expand this program to include citizens of Europe as well. Biometric passport clearance and facial recognition technology are already being used at various airports worldwide. The trend of using biometrics for airport formalities is expected to continue, with physical passports eventually being phased out in favor of digital versions stored on mobile devices.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-a-rescue-dog-found-elderly-woman-trapped-in-house-days-after-japan-earthquake-13578842.html</link>
			<description>Japan recently experienced two major disasters—a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and a plane crash resulting in five deaths. The death toll in the Noto peninsula has risen to 92, with 250 people still missing. The search and rescue operation has been intensified, and self-defense forces have rescued 122 people, including an elderly woman found by a search dog named Jennifer. However, hopes for further successful rescues are fading as time passes. The earthquake caused significant damage, with tall buildings and homes destroyed, landslides, and tsunami waves. The affected areas are still facing challenges like power outages, lack of running water, frigid temperatures, heavy rain, and the risk of landslides.</description>

			<description>The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is facing allegations of a scam involving fake lab tests at the Mohalla Clinics in Delhi. It has been revealed that the clinics ordered and performed fake radiological and pathology tests on non-existent patients. This comes in addition to previous issues with substandard medicines in state-run hospitals and the ongoing investigation into the excise policy "scam." The alleged fraud amounts to several hundred crores of rupees. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has requested a CBI probe into the supply of substandard pharmaceuticals to government-run hospitals. The AAP has defended its welfare program and called for the resignation of the Delhi Health Secretary. The BJP has criticized the AAP government, adding to the tense political atmosphere in Delhi.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ram-temple-opening-why-has-22-january-been-picked-as-consecration-date-13577662.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on 22 January. The chosen date aligns with the auspicious Abhijit Muhurat, which signifies the removal of negative energies and the start of new ventures. The Mrigashira Nakshatra, associated with knowledge and experience, also begins on that day. The ceremony coincides with 'Amrit Siddhi Yoga' and 'Sarvartha Siddhi Yoga,' making it significant. The article highlights the importance of the event, comparing it to India's Independence Day. The construction of the temple has brought a sense of unity among the people of Ayodhya and the entire country. The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust has invited 4,000 saints to the ceremony, and preparations are being made for thousands of devotees. Enhanced security measures and logistical arrangements are being implemented to ensure a smooth experience for all.</description>

			<description>A political dispute has arisen in Maharashtra over Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's commitment to the "liberation" of the Haji Malang Dargah, a centuries-old shrine claimed by both Hindus and Muslims. Shinde's remarks have drawn reactions from various political leaders, with accusations of targeting a religious place of one particular faith. The shrine's history involves a syncretic culture, communal tensions, and claims by Hindu right-wing groups. The issue has garnered support from some BJP members while others criticize Shinde for reigniting the dispute.</description>

			<title>Pineapple on Pizza: How the fruit has become the world’s most divisive topping</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pineapple-on-pizza-how-the-fruit-has-become-the-worlds-most-divisive-topping-13576232.html</link>
			<description>Italian chef Gino Sorbillo has sparked a debate by adding pineapple as a topping to his pizza menu in Naples. He created this controversial dish to challenge food prejudice and make disputed ingredients tasty. The origins of Hawaiian pizza can be traced back to a Greek immigrant in Canada who added canned pineapple to a traditional pizza, and it gained popularity worldwide. However, pineapple on pizza remains a divisive topic, with many people expressing strong opinions against it. Some argue that the sweetness of pineapple clashes with the savory nature of pizza, while others believe the combination of pineapple and cheese is a culinary disaster. However, there are chefs who defend pineapple as a topping when prepared properly, such as roasted and paired with pork. The debate continues: pineapple lovers versus pineapple haters.</description>

			<title>It's Januhairy: Why women are forgoing waxing, shaving their body hair this month</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/its-januhairy-why-women-are-forgoing-waxing-shaving-their-body-hair-this-month-13571732.html</link>
			<description>Januhairy is a campaign where women are encouraged to grow out their body hair and refrain from waxing, threading, and laser appointments. It originated from the idea of Laura Jackson, a drama student at the University of Exeter, who grew out her body hair for a performance and realized the taboo surrounding women's body hair. She shared a picture of her unshaven underarms on Instagram and invited women from around the world to join in. Januhairy has now become a worldwide phenomenon with over 42,000 followers on its official Instagram account. The purpose of Januhairy is to promote the liberation of women's bodies and challenge societal beauty norms. It encourages individuals to think about how they treat their bodies and aims for a future where people can freely choose what they want to do with their body hair without judgment.</description>

			<title>Why junior doctors in the UK have gone on the ‘longest-ever’ NHS strike</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-junior-doctors-longest-ever-nhs-strike-british-government-pay-hike-13575392.html</link>
			<description>Junior doctors in the UK have gone on a six-day strike, marking the longest strike in the history of Britain's National Health Service (NHS). This strike, the ninth by junior doctors, is expected to impact tens of thousands of patients, particularly at a time when respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and flu are on the rise. The strikes will result in the cancellation or rescheduling of many appointments and procedures, adding to the already significant backlog of patients waiting for care. The junior doctors are protesting low pay and demanding a 35% pay hike. The British Medical Association (BMA) has stated that they are willing to end the strike if the government presents a credible offer. The UK government, on the other hand, has insisted that talks will only resume once the strike is called off.</description>

			<description>Divya Pahuja, a former model and ex-girlfriend of gangster Sandeep Gadoli, was murdered by a hotel owner and his associates in Gurugram. Pahuja was previously arrested for her alleged involvement in the fake encounter of Gadoli in Mumbai in 2016. The murder has raised suspicions of involvement by Gadoli's aides. Pahuja had filed a plea earlier, taking the blame for informing the police about Gadoli to protect her family. She was released on bail in June 2023 after serving six years in prison. Pahuja was taken to a hotel where she was shot in the head by five people. Three of the accused have been arrested, and the investigation is ongoing. The body has not been located yet.</description>

			<description>Willis Gibson, a competitive Tetris player, became the first player to officially "beat" the original Nintendo version of the game by reaching Level 157, where the game becomes unplayable due to code limits. This achievement is significant in the gaming world as Tetris is considered unbeatable. Willis used various techniques, overcoming obstacles such as faster falling blocks and color palette issues at higher levels. A Tetris-playing AI program called StackRabbit helped identify glitches that could trigger a kill screen, leading to Willis' successful attempt.</description>

			<title>Will Arvind Kejriwal be arrested today in the Delhi liquor policy case?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-arvind-kejriwal-be-arrested-today-in-the-delhi-liquor-policy-case-13574422.html</link>
			<description>Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) three times in connection with the Delhi liquor policy case. There is speculation that he may be arrested after he refused to appear before the ED for questioning. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders have expressed concerns about a possible raid and arrest. Kejriwal has skipped the previous summons, considering them illegal, and has asked for their withdrawal. The ED may issue a fourth summon to Kejriwal, and there are links between him and the alleged procedural lapses in the liquor policy case. Other AAP leaders have already been arrested in this case. The AAP and BJP are trading accusations over the situation, with AAP claiming a conspiracy by the BJP to arrest Kejriwal before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.</description>

			<title>ISIS, Israel or the US? Who is behind the twin blasts in Iran that killed 95?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/isis-israel-or-the-us-who-is-behind-the-twin-blasts-in-iran-that-killed-95-13574102.html</link>
			<description>The twin blasts in Kerman, Iran, occurred during a ceremony commemorating the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's al-Quds force. The first explosion happened near Soleimani's grave, followed by a more deadly blast 20 minutes later when other pilgrims came to help the injured. The blasts resulted in the death of at least 95 people and injured over 200 others. The responsibility for the attack has not been claimed by any specific group or entity, but Iran has labeled it as a terrorist attack and pointed fingers at Israel and the United States. However, the US has denied any involvement, and experts believe that the blasts could be the work of various jihadist or militant groups. The incident has heightened tensions in the region, especially considering the recent killing of senior Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. It is crucial for calm thinking to prevail among the leadership in the region.</description>

			<description>The article reports on twin explosions in Iran during a ceremony commemorating the death of General Qasem Soleimani, causing over 100 deaths and numerous injuries. It provides background information on Soleimani, who was the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force and a prominent figure in the country. Soleimani played a significant role in Iran's regional military activities, including supporting armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, the Palestinian territories, and Yemen. The United States held him responsible for the deaths of its soldiers in Iraq, and he was targeted and killed in a US drone strike in January 2020. The article also briefly discusses Soleimani's early years, his rise to prominence, and his involvement in various conflicts in the region.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-why-mickey-mouse-belongs-to-all-of-us-13573322.html</link>
			<description>The copyright on the earliest versions of Mickey Mouse, specifically the one seen in the 1928 cartoon short film Steamboat Willie, has expired in the United States as of January 1, 2024. This means that anyone in the US can now use this particular version of the character without infringing on Disney's copyright. However, it's important to note that Mickey Mouse is still a registered Disney trademark, so there are still restrictions on how the public can use the character's images. Additionally, modern versions of Mickey Mouse are still protected by Disney's copyright. Other works, such as Virginia Woolf's Orlando and DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, have also had their copyright protections expire in the US.</description>

			<description>Congress leader BK Hariprasad made inflammatory remarks, suggesting the possibility of a "Godhra-like incident" in Karnataka during the upcoming consecration ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The BJP has demanded his arrest and an apology. Hariprasad alleged that certain organizations have instigated BJP leaders and warned against untoward incidents. He also stated that the invitation to Congress leaders for the temple ceremony should be seen politically, not religiously. The BJP leaders have criticized Hariprasad's comments and called for immediate action against him. This is not the first time Hariprasad has caused controversy, as he previously referred to the BJP and RSS as "bootlickers of the British" during the freedom struggle.</description>

			<title>Why India is launching its GSAT-20 on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-is-launching-its-gsat-20-satellite-on-spacexs-falcon-9-rocket-heres-why-13572232.html</link>
			<description>#### Summary of India's GSAT-20 Satellite and SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Launch

India is set to launch its new satellite, GSAT-20, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The GSAT-20 is a 4,700-kilo communication satellite built by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and will be launched by ISRO's commercial arm, NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), using the Falcon 9 rocket in the second quarter of 2024. The satellite is designed to fulfill India’s growing broadband connectivity needs, providing up to 48Gbps of capacity across 32 beams covering all of India, including remote and underserved regions. Additionally, the satellite will facilitate in-flight connectivity for aeromobile services using Ka band [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSAT-20).

The Falcon 9 rocket, as per the SpaceX website, is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX to put people and payloads into Earth’s orbit and beyond dependably and safely. It is the world’s first orbital-class reusable rocket, standing 70 meters tall and 3.7 meters wide. The Falcon 9 has carried out 285 launches, 243 landings, and 217 reflights, and is powered by Merlin engines using rocket grade kerosene (RP-1) and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The rocket generates more than 1.7 million pounds of thrust at sea level.

India is using SpaceX for the launch because the GSAT-20 is too heavy for ISRO’s most powerful rocket, the Launch Vehicle Mark 3, which can only put a 4,000-kilo mass into geostationary transfer orbit. The decision to use SpaceX was also influenced by the cost-effectiveness of their services and the unavailability of other rockets in time. ISRO has been advocating for a Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) capable of putting around 10,000 kilos into orbit, but this won’t be ready for a few years. Meanwhile, ISRO is working on testing its semi-cryogenic engine, which utilizes a propellant combination of Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Kerosene, to enhance its launch capability [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSAT-20).

In conclusion, India's GSAT-20 satellite, to be launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, represents a significant step in fulfilling the country's broadband connectivity needs, especially in remote and underserved regions. The collaboration with SpaceX is driven by the satellite's weight exceeding the capacity of ISRO's most powerful rocket and the cost-effectiveness of SpaceX's services. This launch also underscores the ongoing efforts by ISRO to enhance its launch capability, including the development and testing of new technologies such as the semi-cryogenic engine [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSAT-20).</description>

			<title>What is Free Movement Regime that Centre wants to suspend at Myanmar border?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-free-movement-regime-that-centre-wants-to-suspend-at-myanmar-border-13572132.html</link>
			<description>#### Summary of "Centre to Scrap Free Movement Regime Along Indo-Myanmar Border"

The Centre has decided to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Indo-Myanmar Border (IMB), which was implemented in 2018 as part of India’s Act East policy. The FMR is a mutually agreed pact between India and Myanmar that allows tribes dwelling along the border on either side to travel up to 16 km inside the other country without a visa. The decision to suspend the FMR is aimed at stopping the influx of illegal migrants and addressing the alleged illegal activities, such as drug smuggling, by refugees from Myanmar who have crossed over to India. The move comes in the wake of ethnic conflicts and tensions in the Northeastern states of India, particularly Manipur, where the free movement regime has come under scrutiny. The Centre plans to put fencing along the entire border and issue visas for anyone entering India from Myanmar. However, there are concerns that cancelling the FMR or completely fencing the border may affect livelihoods, education, and essential travel for healthcare. The issue of managing and administering the border areas effectively is crucial for reducing drug trafficking and illegal cross-border movement on unfenced borders. The decision to end the FMR has sparked debates about the potential impact on various aspects of life in the border regions and the effectiveness of alternative approaches to address the challenges posed by the porous border and illegal activities.</description>

			<title>The Ex Factor: Did Mahua Moitra snoop on her former boyfriends?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/did-mahua-moitra-snoop-on-her-former-boyfriends-jai-anant-dehadrai-13572692.html</link>
			<description>Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra has been accused of snooping on her ex-boyfriends by one of her former partners, Jai Anant Dehadrai. Dehadrai filed a complaint with the home ministry and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), alleging that Moitra carried out "illegal surveillance" on him and another former boyfriend. He claimed that Moitra obtained call records without permission and had access to the complete call detail records (CDR) history of her ex-boyfriend. Dehadrai also mentioned that Moitra justified her actions by claiming certain rights enjoyed by a member of Parliament. He expressed concerns about his safety and alleged that Moitra is using her connections with senior Bengal police officers to conduct illegal surveillance on him. Moitra responded to the allegations, insinuating that Dehadrai is a jilted ex. The two have been in a public spat for months, including a battle over the custody of their pet rottweiler, Henry. Dehadrai is a known name in legal circles, specializing in white-collar crimes. He has fought for various causes and is currently challenging Delhi prison rules in the Supreme Court.</description>

			<description>#### Autopsy Results Confirm Homicide by Gunshot

The autopsy results issued by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner have confirmed that Teena and her daughter Arianna were victims of homicide by gunshot. Rakesh Kamal, on the other hand, died from a "gunshot wound consistent with being self-inflicted" [[1]].

#### Murder-Suicide Declaration and Investigation

The deaths of Rakesh Kamal, Teena Kamal, and their daughter Arianna have been declared as a case of murder-suicide by medical examiners in Massachusetts. Rakesh Kamal is alleged to have shot dead his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself inside their mansion in Dover, Massachusetts. District Attorney Michael Morrissey described the murders as a "domestic violence situation" and stated that there was no indication of any outside party's involvement, despite the recovery of a gun beside Rakesh's body. The incident remains under investigation by Dover and Massachusetts State Police [[1]].

#### Financial Struggles and Background of the Family

The Kamal family, who resided in a $5.45 million mansion, faced financial struggles as their estate went into foreclosure and was eventually sold for $3 million. Rakesh and Teena Kamal had run a now-defunct education systems company called EduNova, which faced financial problems in recent years. Teena had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2022, listing between $1 million and $10 million in liabilities. Their daughter, Arianna, was a student at Middlebury College, studying neuroscience. The family's financial difficulties and the dissolution of their company shed light on the challenges they were facing [[1]].

#### Conclusion

The tragic incident involving the Kamal family has been declared a murder-suicide, with Rakesh Kamal alleged to have shot his wife and daughter before taking his own life. The family's financial struggles and the dissolution of their company provide context to the challenges they were facing. The investigation into this devastating event remains ongoing [[1]].</description>

			<title>What are the new ICU admission guidelines for critical patients?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-the-new-icu-admission-guidelines-for-critical-patients-13570342.html</link>
			<description>The central government of India has released new guidelines for the admission of critically ill patients to the intensive care unit (ICU). These guidelines were produced by 24 leading physicians with expertise in critical care medicine, including doctors from Dubai and Canada, and were developed for the Union Health Ministry. The guidelines aim to improve the decision-making process for ICU admission and provide recommendations for various scenarios. According to the guidelines, critically ill patients cannot be admitted to the ICU if there is a refusal by them and their relatives. The guidelines also address the criteria for ICU admission and discharge, emphasizing the need for organ failure, the need for organ support, or the anticipation of deterioration in the patient's medical condition. The guidelines also mention the qualifications required for specialists in the ICU. The guidelines are aimed at ensuring the judicious use of ICU resources and prioritizing patients who need it the most.

It is important to note that the guidelines are not binding and leave room for the treating doctor's discretion. Dr. Sumit Ray, Secretary of the Indian College of Critical Care Medicine, stated that the guidelines provide broad criteria and rely on the wisdom of the treating doctor.

The release of these guidelines is significant as ICU admissions that are not necessary have been criticized in the past. India has a limited number of ICU beds, with the majority being in private hospitals where the cost of an ICU bed is significantly higher than a regular bed. The guidelines aim to ensure the judicious use of ICU resources and prioritize patients based on their condition.

Overall, the new guidelines for ICU admission in India provide recommendations for determining the necessity of ICU admission, criteria for admission and discharge, and qualifications for ICU specialists. These guidelines aim to improve decision-making and ensure the appropriate use of ICU resources</description>

			<title>No Indian Science Congress this year? Why it has missed its annual date</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/no-indian-science-congress-this-year-why-it-has-missed-its-annual-date-13571652.html</link>
			<description>#### Summary of the Indian Science Congress Controversy

The 109th edition of the Indian Science Congress, which was scheduled to begin today, has been called off. The event, organized by the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), has been a lightning rod for controversies in recent years. The reason for the event not being held this year is a financial dispute between the ISCA and the Union Ministry of Science and Technology’s Department of Science (DST) The DST, a key funder of the event, contributed Rs 5 crore to the Indian Science Congress in 2023. However, in September, the DST claimed there were "financial irregularities" and abruptly pulled its backing of the event. This led to a tiff over money between the ISCA and the DST, resulting in the event being put on hold.

The controversies surrounding the event have been significant. In recent years, the event has seen attendees making unscientific and ridiculous claims, which have drawn criticism. These claims include assertions about ancient aviation, surgical instruments, Pythagoras theorem, and even the ability of cows to turn food into gold The event has been criticized for promoting pseudoscience and offering a platform for advancing pseudoscientific claims, which has damaged its reputation.

Experts have noted that the event's best days are behind it and that it has been tapering off for years. Many credible scientists have avoided the event, and leading scientific institutions and laboratories have only had a token presence, if at all. The event has been described as a platform for advancing pseudoscientific claims, particularly those that dovetail with hyper-nationalist narratives in other spheres.

The controversies and decline in credibility have led to calls for a reevaluation of the event's relevance. While it hosts thousands of school and college students every year and features talks by researchers, the event's reputation has been tarnished by the promotion of pseudoscience.

The Indian Science Congress controversy highlights the challenges faced by the event due to financial disputes and the promotion of unscientific claims, leading to questions about its future relevance and credibility</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-comes-next-for-blade-runner-oscar-pistorius-after-his-release-from-jail-13570032.html</link>
			<description>Former Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius is set to be released from prison on Friday after being granted parole. Pistorius was accused of killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 by shooting her through a bathroom door in their shared home in Pretoria. He became eligible for parole in March 2023 after serving half of his 13-year and five-month sentence for murder. Pistorius will complete the remainder of his sentence in South Africa's community corrections system under the supervision of the Department of Correctional Services. He will be subjected to parole conditions until December 2029, including attending programs on gender-based violence and continuing therapy sessions on anger management. Pistorius participated in the restorative justice program, which aims to bring affected parties together to find closure, prior to his parole.

The reaction to Pistorius' early release has been mixed. The Steenkamp family lawyer stated that they were not surprised by the parole decision and lauded the parole board's efforts in involving the victims. Reeva Steenkamp's mother, June, released a statement expressing her lack of conviction in Pistorius' rehabilitation but stated that she had no objections to his release. Pistorius' lawyer and family did not comment on the matter.

Overall, Pistorius' release marks a significant moment in his life, but it also raises concerns about his future. He will be closely monitored and will have to adhere to parole conditions until his sentence expires in December 2029</description>

			<title>Hit-and-run law controversy: How Centre convinced truckers to end nationwide strike and averted a crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hit-and-run-law-how-the-centre-convinced-protesting-truckers-to-end-nationwide-strike-13569602.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent nationwide strike by truck drivers and various transport associations in India against the new provisions of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) Bill, 2023, which relates to hit-and-run cases. The strike was called off after the central government assured the truck drivers that their opinions would be taken into account before implementing the new law. The government stated that it would consult with the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) before making a decision on the law.

The truck drivers' association confirmed that they have addressed their concerns with the government and that there are no unresolved issues at the moment. The President of All India Motor Transport Congress, Amrit Lal Madan, stated that the punishment and fine imposed by the law have been put on hold, and no new laws will be implemented until further consultations are held.

The controversial law, Section 106(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita, imposes severe penalties, including a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison or a fine of Rs 7 lakh, for drivers who cause a serious traffic accident through careless driving and flee the scene without reporting it to the authorities. The law aims to address the high number of hit-and-run cases in India, which resulted in thousands of deaths in recent years.

Driver groups and activists have expressed concerns about the law, including potential unfair penalties and the ability to pay steep fines in case of accidents. They have also highlighted issues with police blaming large vehicles for accidents without conducting thorough investigations and the risk of facing violent mobs at accident scenes. The truckers have called for prior meetings and consultations with stakeholders before implementing such laws.

The strike and protests against the new hit-and-run law were witnessed in several states, including Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. The protests led to concerns about fuel shortages, with about 2,000 petrol pumps running out of fuel stocks in western and northern India.

In summary, the recent strike by truck drivers and transport associations in India was called off after the government assured them that their opinions would be considered before implementing the new hit-and-run law. The law aims to address the high number of hit-and-run cases in the country, but concerns have been raised about potential unfair penalties and the ability to pay fines. The protests resulted in fuel shortages in some parts of India</description>

			<title>Who was Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas’ deputy leader killed in Beirut?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-was-saleh-al-arouri-hamas-deputy-leader-killed-in-beirut-13569692.html</link>
			<description>#### Summary:

The deputy head of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed in a suspected Israeli drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon. The strike targeted an apartment in a Hezbollah-controlled area, killing al-Arouri and six others. Hamas confirmed his death and called it a "cowardly assassination" by Israel. Al-Arouri was a senior Hamas official who played a key role in the organization and had been on Israel's radar for a long time. He was involved in Islamist activism and helped create Hamas' military wing. He was accused by Israel of planning terrorist attacks and was designated as a global terrorist by the US. His death is seen as a significant success for Israel but raises concerns about further escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict [[1]].

#### Who was Saleh al-Arouri?

Saleh al-Arouri was the deputy chief of Hamas' political bureau and had climbed the ranks within the organization. He was born in the occupied West Bank and became involved in Islamist activism during his time at Hebron University. He joined Hamas soon after its foundation and helped create its military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam brigades. He was jailed by Israel for almost 18 years but was later released. Al-Arouri developed contacts throughout the region and served as a Hamas ambassador to Hezbollah. He was accused by Israel of planning terrorist attacks and was considered a key figure in Hamas [[1]].

#### Significance of al-Arouri's death:

Al-Arouri's death is a significant success for Israel, as he was a senior Hamas official and had been on Israel's radar for a long time. However, there are concerns that his death could lead to further escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called the targeting of al-Arouri a "serious attack on Lebanon" and vowed a response. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack and called for pressure on Israel to stop its targeting. The situation raises fears of wider conflict and the need to deter Israel's aggression [[1]].

#### Israel's response:

Israel has not officially claimed responsibility for the strike that killed al-Arouri. However, one Israeli and two US officials confirmed to Axios that Israel was behind the strike. Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev stated that whoever carried out the strike had a gripe with Hamas and that it was not an attack on the Lebanese state or Hezbollah. Israel sees the strike as a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership [[1]].

#### Conclusion:

The killing of Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy head of Hamas, in a suspected Israeli drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon, is a significant development in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Al-Arouri was a senior Hamas official who played a key role in the organization. His death raises concerns about further escalation in the conflict and has drawn condemnation from Hezbollah and the Lebanese prime minister. Israel has not officially claimed responsibility for the strike but has been confirmed by Israeli and US officials. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions and the need to deter further aggression [[1]].</description>

			<title>'Donkey flight' case: How much did Gujarat passengers pay to enter the US?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/donkey-flight-case-how-much-did-gujarat-passengers-pay-to-enter-the-us-13569682.html</link>
			<description>According to an article, more than 60 people from Gujarat, India, who were on board a Nicaragua-bound plane, had agreed to pay immigration agents between Rs 60 lakh and Rs 80 lakh to help them enter the US illegally after reaching Nicaragua via Dubai. The passengers, including some minors, were mainly from Mehsana, Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, and Anand districts. The state Crime Investigation Department (CID) has acquired the names and contact numbers of nearly 15 agents who promised to assist these individuals in crossing the US-Mexico border illegally. The agents had instructed the passengers to pay the money only after reaching the US, and they had also provided air tickets and cash to deal with any emergency situations. The CID has requested assistance from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to gather more information about the agents involved in the case.

The Nicaragua-bound aircraft, an Airbus A340, was grounded in France for four days over suspected human trafficking. The passengers had boarded the flight in Dubai, and it carried a total of 303 passengers, including 260 Indians. The French authorities launched a judicial investigation into the conditions and purpose of the trip, focusing on suspected human trafficking. Nicaragua has become a popular destination for those seeking asylum in the US, and many Indians have attempted to enter the US illegally through the Mexican land border.

On January 2, 2024, a tragic incident occurred at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, Japan, involving a collision between a Japan Airlines Airbus A350 and a smaller Japan Coast Guard aircraft. The collision resulted in a fire that engulfed the Japan Airlines plane, leading to the deaths of five Coast Guard members. Here's a closer look at the details:

			<title>It’s the time for Dry January: Why giving up alcohol for a month is a good idea</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/its-the-time-for-dry-january-why-giving-up-alcohol-for-a-month-is-a-good-idea-13567642.html</link>
			<description>Dry January is a public health initiative that encourages people to abstain from alcohol for the entire month of January. It was started in 2013 by Alcohol Change UK, a UK-based charity, with the goal of getting people to think about their drinking habits and potentially reduce their alcohol consumption. The idea behind Dry January is to give people a break from alcohol and allow them to experience the benefits of sobriety, such as improved sleep, increased energy, better mental health and concentration, weight loss, and improved skin health. Studies have shown that participating in Dry January can also lead to sustained changes in drinking habits, with many people reducing their overall alcohol intake or cutting it out completely. While Dry January has its origins in the UK, it has now become a global phenomenon, with people around the world participating in the challenge. The initiative has gained popularity due to increasing awareness of the potential dangers of alcohol and the desire for improved health and well-being. While there may be some drawbacks, such as difficulty sleeping or slight dehydration in the first few days, many people find the experience of Dry January to be rewarding and empowering. Tips for succeeding at Dry January include enlisting the support of a friend, identifying triggers and avoiding them, and considering a "Damp January" approach where alcohol is reduced to a minimum rather than completely eliminated. Overall, Dry January offers a chance for individuals to reevaluate their relationship with alcohol and experience the positive effects of sobriety.</description>

			<description>According to an article, former US President Bill Clinton is set to be named in confidential papers related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The papers are from a 2015 civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of trafficking. While there are no allegations or evidence of illegal conduct by Clinton, Giuffre claimed in her lawsuit that she met Clinton on Epstein Island. Clinton is identified as "Doe 36" in the papers and his name comes up more than 50 times in entries focused on efforts to subpoena him about his relationship with Epstein. Flight logs also show that Clinton was a frequent flier on Epstein's plane after leaving office [[1]](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/aug/18/what-we-know-about-recent-claims-linking-bill-clin/)</description>

			<title>Razorpay, Groww &amp;amp; more: Why startups want to shift base to India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/razorpay-groww-reverse-flipping-why-startups-want-to-shift-base-to-india-13568132.html</link>
			<description>Many Indian startups, including Razorpay and Groww, are considering moving their parent entity back to India from abroad. This process, known as reverse flipping, involves shifting the company's base back to its home country. The move is being considered due to the tightening regulatory environment for fintech firms and the potential benefits of tapping into the domestic market. The Indian government has been encouraging companies to consider Gujarat's GIFT City as an alternative to foreign destinations for setting up their operations. The trend of reverse flipping underscores the belief in India's potential as a global start-up hub and the long-term benefits of strengthening the start-up ecosystem in the country.</description>

			<description>#### Summary of "Ayodhya's Spiritual Tourism Boom Ahead of Ram Temple Inauguration"

India is preparing for the consecration ceremony of the under-construction Ram temple in Ayodhya, with the city undergoing significant transformation ahead of the temple's inauguration on 22 January. The initiatives are expected to result in a substantial rise in spiritual tourism, as indicated by a surge in users searching for stays in Ayodhya and the soaring hotel rates and bookings. The city is also witnessing increased investments in hotel development, with five branded hotels totaling 520 rooms in various stages of development. The inauguration is expected to draw around 7,000 people, and the Ayodhya Development Authority anticipates a significant increase in daily visitors after the temple opens. The city has also experienced a remarkable rise in tourism, with the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department recording a substantial increase in domestic and foreign tourists visiting the Ayodhya district. The improved connectivity, including the inauguration of new Amrit Bharat and Vande Bharat trains and the Maharishi Valmiki International Airport, is expected to further boost tourism. The construction of the Ram temple has already positively impacted Ayodhya's economy, creating new job opportunities and opening up new businesses. The surge in tourism is expected to benefit every business owner in the region. 

The article also highlights the padayatra from Mumbai to Ayodhya by a young Muslim woman named Shabnam Shaikh, who has strong faith in Lord Ram, and the presence of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia at the inauguration of the international airport in Ayodhya. Additionally, the article mentions the idol of 'Ram Lalla' carved by Karnataka's renowned sculptor Arun Yogiraj, which will adorn the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January at the much-anticipated consecration ceremony.

The surge in spiritual tourism, investments in hotel development, improved connectivity, and positive impact on the local economy are key highlights of the article.</description>

			<title>How will UK’s new rules for overseas students affect Indians?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-will-uks-new-rules-for-overseas-students-affect-indians-13567522.html</link>
			<description>According to an article, the UK has implemented new rules that restrict international students from bringing their families to the country. The changes were announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who stated that the majority of foreign university students can no longer bring their family members to the UK. The UK government aims to reduce migration and prevent the misuse of the visa system. The new rules will affect Indian students, who have been increasingly choosing the UK as a destination for higher education. Indian students will now face more difficulties in bringing their families to the UK. The changes are expected to prevent around 140,000 people from coming to the UK each year. The article also mentions that Indian students received a significant number of sponsored study visas in the UK in 2023, and the number of Indian students enrolling in UK universities is expected to increase in the upcoming academic year. However, the new rules may impact their decision to study in the UK and their future career prospects. Experts and student groups have expressed concerns about the negative impact of the changes, including increased financial burden, emotional isolation, and potential loss of high-quality students for UK universities. The UK government plans to work with universities to design an alternative approach that allows the brightest and best students to bring their dependants to the country while still reducing net migration.</description>

			<title>How Japan is prone to earthquakes and has learnt to be resilient</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-earthquake-prone-tsunami-preparations-13567032.html</link>
			<description>Japan recently experienced a series of earthquakes that caused significant damage and loss of life. The earthquakes, including a magnitude 7.6 quake, resulted in collapsed buildings, damaged roads, landslides, and power outages. Aftershocks continued to occur, hampering rescue efforts. While major tsunami warnings have been lifted, the Japan Meteorological Agency has warned of the possibility of more earthquakes in the coming days. Japan's susceptibility to earthquakes is due to its geographical location along the "Pacific Ring of Fire," which is the most active earthquake belt globally. The country sits on the joint of four tectonic plates, leading to frequent seismic activity. Japan has a history of devastating earthquakes, including the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, the Kobe earthquake in 1995, and the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. However, Japan has implemented strict construction regulations, frequent emergency drills, and seismic safety technology to mitigate the impact of earthquakes. The country also invests in infrastructure upgrades and disaster preparedness measures to ensure its resilience to natural disasters [[4]](https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-send-long-articles-for-summarization/205574)</description>

			<title>Why is 2024 a leap year? How did the practice of adding an extra day to February begin?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-2024-a-leap-year-how-did-the-practice-of-adding-an-extra-day-to-february-begin-13566892.html</link>
			<description>#### Summary of "2024: Why It's a Leap Year and How It Started"

**2024 is a leap year with 366 days instead of the usual 365, and February will have 29 days instead of the usual 28. Leap years occur almost every four years, with the next one falling in 2028. The practice of adding an extra day every four years began during the time of Roman emperor Julius Caesar.**

The Earth takes approximately 365.24219 days to orbit the Sun, which is why most years have 365 days. To make up for the extra time, one day is added to the calendar every four years, creating a leap year. Without leap years, the calendar would fall out of sync with the seasons, leading to confusion with crop cycles and seasonal occurrences.

The Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar, had 365 days and added the 366th day once every four years. However, this method was not error-free, leading to a discrepancy that was corrected by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. He ordered 10 days to be dropped from the calendar and introduced the Georgian calendar, coining the term "leap year" and establishing 29 February as the date to add to a leap year.

The leap year is calculated by checking if a year is divisible by four, except for years ending in 00, which must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year. Despite these calculations, the solar year is still 26 seconds shorter than the Georgian year currently.

**The choice of February for the extra day dates back to Caesar's calendar reforms in ancient Rome and has been maintained since the introduction of the Georgian calendar in 1582.**

While there have been proposals to make further corrections, such as removing a leap year once every 4,000 years or once every 3,200 years, the issue is not a pressing problem in 2024.

#### Leap Year Calculation
A leap year occurs in every year that is divisible by four, except for years ending in 00, which must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year. For example, 800, 1200, and 2000 were leap years, but 1700 and 1900 were not.

			<title>Modi's third term bid, and Trump-Biden rematch: The polls to watch for in 2024</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/modis-third-term-bid-and-trump-biden-rematch-the-polls-to-watch-for-in-2024-13521022.html</link>
			<description>#### Summary of "The Political World in 2024"

The year 2024 is set to be a record-breaking year for elections, with more than two billion voters in 50 countries, including the United States, India, Mexico, and South Africa, casting their ballots. Here's a breakdown of the key events and potential changes in the political landscape:

**January: Bangladesh Demands Change**
- Bangladesh sets off the historic election year with anti-government protests organized by the main Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which has boycotted the election due to the imprisonment or exile of its top leaders. The party demands the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

**February: Elections in Pakistan and Indonesia**
- Pakistan will hold its first general election after the resignation of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on corruption allegations. Despite not running for office, Khan remains influential in his political party. Indonesia will host the world’s largest single-day election with over 200 million voters.

**March: Vladimir Putin Eyes Six More Years**
- Russian President Vladimir Putin, energized by his troops’ success in Ukraine, is hoping to extend his 24-year rule by another six years in March elections. He announced his candidacy for a fifth term, which would keep him in power until 2030.

**April-May: Modi’s Great Power Play**
- Nearly one billion Indians will vote in an election where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP party are seeking a third term. Modi's political career and success have been based on support from India’s Hindu population, and he goes into the vote as the clear favorite.

**June: EU Test for Populists**
- The European Parliament election in June will see more than 400 million people eligible to vote. The vote will be a test of support for right-wing populists, with Poland's former European Council president, Donald Tusk, returning to power on a pro-EU platform.

**July: Leftist Ex-Mayor and Indigenous Businesswoman Compete for First Female Leader**
- In Mexico, a leftist former mayor of the capital and a businesswoman with Indigenous roots are vying to become the first woman president of the country. Claudia Sheinbaum is running on behalf of the Morena party, while Xochitl Galvez represents an Opposition coalition, the Broad Front for Mexico.

**November: Trump-Biden Rematch**
- Tens of millions of Americans will choose a president in a contest which could keep incumbent Joe Biden in power until the age of 86. Polls show that a majority of voters think Biden is too old to be commander-in-chief, despite his likely rival, ex-president Donald Trump, also facing similar concerns about age. Disinformation is expected to be a feature of the campaign, and Trump goes into the Republican party nomination contest as the clear favorite, despite multiple criminal trials hanging over him.

In the United States, Biden's reelection bid faces challenges due to concerns about his age, while Trump is positioned as a strong contender for the Republican nomination. The political landscape in 2024 is marked by significant elections and potential shifts in power across various countries.

			<description>In 2023, the world experienced a challenging year marked by ongoing wars, new conflicts, geopolitical competition, natural disasters, and gun violence in the United States. The year was characterized by a shortage of good news.

One of the major events that shaped the year was the deadly and fierce war between Israel and Hamas. The conflict resulted in thousands of lives lost and many more injured or missing [[1]](https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates). The war saw Hamas launching a daring strike on Israel, which stunned the world The toll of the war overshadowed the individual lives affected by the conflict [[1]](https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates). Palestinians sought refuge in hospitals, hoping to be spared from bombardment [[2]](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/at-least-500-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-gaza-city-hospital-health-ministry-says). Families in Gaza even resorted to writing their children's names on their bodies to ensure identification after Israeli raids [[3]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/28/so-world-knows-gaza-parents-mark-childrens-names-on-bodies-amid-bombing). The conflict escalated with Hamas militants firing rockets and sending fighters into Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip [[5]](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-rockets-airstrikes-tel-aviv-11fb98655c256d54ecb5329284fc37d2). The war had a significant impact on the lives of people in the region and drew international attention [[1]](https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates).

In addition to the Israel-Hamas conflict, other major events shaped the world in 2023. India achieved significant milestones, becoming the first country to soft land on the southern pole of the Moon and passing the historic Women's Reservation Bill in Parliament [[1]](https://apnews.com/live/israel-hamas-war-live-updates). These achievements highlighted India's progress and contributions in the fields of space exploration and gender equality.

As the year comes to a close, it is important to reflect on the major events that defined 2023. Despite the challenges faced, there is hope for a better year ahead in 2024</description>

			<title>Save the Date: Why US couples are rushing to say 'I Do' on New Year's Eve</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-couples-rushing-to-las-vegas-new-years-eve-weddings-13560742.html</link>
			<description>According to an article, several couples in the United States have chosen to get married on New Year's Eve. This is because dates like 12/31/2023, which can be written as 1-2-3-1-2-3, are considered "specialty dates" and hold significance in the Las Vegas wedding industry. Las Vegas is known for its popularity as a wedding destination, and New Year's Eve is already a popular holiday for nuptials. This year, it is expected to set a record for the busiest wedding day in Las Vegas. Couples are drawn to these "magic dates" because they are memorable and add a unique element to their anniversary celebrations. The interest in getting married on New Year's Eve has led to the opening of a temporary marriage license bureau at Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport. Wedding venues in Las Vegas have reported an increase in inquiries for New Year's Eve weddings, and some are even offering special packages to commemorate the date. However, not all couples are traveling to Las Vegas for their weddings, as some are equally excited to hold their ceremonies in other cities like Chicago. Overall, the combination of a specialty date and the celebratory atmosphere of New Year's Eve has made it an appealing choice for couples to tie the knot.</description>

			<title>Who is gangster Lakhbir Singh Landa, designated a ‘terrorist’ by MHA?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lakhbir-singh-landa-designated-terrorist-by-mha-canada-punjab-gangster-13559692.html</link>
			<description>According to an article, Lakhbir Singh Landa, a Canada-based gangster and leader of the Khalistani group Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), has been designated as an "individual terrorist" by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in India. He is the 55th individual to be identified as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Landa has been accused of various crimes, including planning a rocket attack on the Punjab Police Intelligence Headquarters in Mohali in 2022 and involvement in other terrorist activities. He has more than 30 cases registered against him in different districts of Punjab. Landa fled to Canada and is currently based in Edmonton, Alberta. He is believed to have close ties to another gangster based in Pakistan named Harwinder Singh Sandhu alias Rinda. Landa's gang remains active in his hometown of Harike, Punjab, with the gangster running it from Canada. The Ministry of Home Affairs has accused Landa of being involved in the supply of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), arms, sophisticated weapons, and explosives from across the border for carrying out terrorist activities in Punjab. He is also accused of planting an IED below the car of a police sub-inspector in Amritsar. Landa's designation as a terrorist is based on his involvement in terrorism and his role in disrupting peace, law, and order in Punjab and other parts of India [[4]](https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-send-long-articles-for-summarization/205574).

			<title>Grounded plane with Indians returns to Mumbai: What happens now?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/grounded-plane-with-indians-returns-to-mumbai-what-happens-now-13549212.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. French authorities detained a charter jet carrying around 276 passengers, mostly Indians, at Vatry airport near Paris for four days over allegations of human trafficking. The flight, originally bound for Nicaragua, was allowed to fly to Mumbai, India, after rigorous interrogation and verification of the passengers by immigration and investigation authorities. The Gujarat Police has formed teams to investigate a suspected illegal immigration network involving agents. The passengers will be questioned to gather information about the promises made by these agents. The investigation aims to uncover the agents and agencies involved in illegal immigration. Some passengers sought asylum and wished to stay in France, while others returned to India. The airline involved denied any wrongdoing. India was chosen as the destination because it expressed willingness to help and act quickly. The incident sheds light on the increasing trend of people attempting to enter the United States illegally, with Nicaragua becoming a favored destination for asylum seekers.</description>

			<title>What happens with unused gift cards each year?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-happens-with-unused-gift-cards-each-year-13544762.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the popularity of gift cards during the holiday season and highlights the issue of unused or forgotten gift cards. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans are expected to spend nearly $30 billion on gift cards this holiday season, with restaurant gift cards being the most popular choice. However, many gift cards end up unused or forgotten, with an average value of $187 per person, totaling $23 billion. 

Under federal law, gift cards cannot expire for five years from the time of purchase or the last time money was added to them. Some states have even longer expiration periods. It is still advisable to use gift cards promptly, as some cards may start accruing inactivity fees after a year of non-use, and the value of the card may decrease due to inflation. Additionally, if a retail store closes or goes bankrupt, the gift card may become worthless.

If you have a gift card that you don't want, you can consider selling it on websites like CardCash or Raise, although you may not receive the full face value. It's also worth noting that when a gift card goes unused, the retailer can use the money right away, but they also have to account for the possibility of the gift card being redeemed. Some states require retailers to work with unclaimed property programs to return money from unspent gift cards to consumers.

To claim unspent gift card money, you can check with your state's unclaimed property program. They have websites like MissingMoney.com where you can search for any unclaimed property, including cash from gift cards.</description>

			<title>Where did Santa Claus come from?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/where-did-santa-claus-come-from-13536602.html</link>
			<description>The origins of the beloved gift-giver figure, Santa Claus, can be traced back to St. Nicholas, a man who lived in the fourth century. St. Nicholas was known for his Christian faith and acts of generosity, such as providing dowries for three impoverished sisters. His legacy sparked various traditions across Europe, with December 6th becoming his feast day. Over time, the figure of St. Nicholas evolved into Santa Claus, influenced by cultural and religious shifts. The red Santa suit and related apparel that we are familiar with today are the result of modern-day marketing in the English-speaking world. Despite the transformation, the core values of generosity, compassion, and the joy of giving have remained intact in the figure of Santa Claus.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/poonch-attack-5-army-soldiers-paff-terror-group-j-k-ambush-13533982.html</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: On Thursday, heavily-armed terrorists ambushed two Indian Army vehicles in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district, resulting in the death of four soldiers and injuries to three others. The attack took place during a cordon-and-search operation. The People's Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a proxy outfit of the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), claimed responsibility for the attack. PAFF has been involved in various acts of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and has been banned by the Union Home Ministry. The Indian Army is currently conducting a search operation to apprehend the terrorists involved in the attack.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/gen-z-are-scaling-back-on-eating-out-owing-to-menu-anxiety-what-is-it-13503792.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, it seems like you're experiencing menu anxiety, which is a form of social anxiety related to feeling overwhelmed when choosing from a variety of options on a restaurant menu. Menu anxiety can make it difficult to decide what to order and may even affect your appetite. It's worth noting that menu anxiety is not an officially recognized mental health diagnosis, but it is a common issue that many people face. Factors such as the cost of the meal, not finding something appetizing, or having too many choices can contribute to menu anxiety. Some individuals also worry about being judged or feel pressured by others waiting in line. However, there are ways to cope with menu anxiety. Familiarizing yourself with the menu options in advance can help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed or rushed. It's also important to remember that there's no such thing as a wrong decision when ordering food. Opting for familiar dishes that bring comfort and satisfaction can also be helpful. Ultimately, the goal is to enjoy the dining experience and focus on the positive social interactions with your companions.</description>

			<title>What is hydrogen therapy developed by Chinese researchers that could reverse ageing?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-hydrogen-therapy-developed-by-chinese-researchers-that-could-reverse-ageing-13504722.html</link>
			<description>Chinese researchers claim to have developed a hydrogen therapy that could potentially reverse age-related changes in the body and prevent geriatric diseases like Alzheimer’s. This therapy involves delivering a high concentration of hydrogen molecules using a scaffold implant developed with nanotechnology, which is reported to be 40,000 times more effective than other delivery methods. The implant can provide a slow and consistent release of hydrogen for about a week, with initial tests showing promising results in repairing bone defects in older mice. The researchers believe that this method could have broad-spectrum anti-ageing properties and potential applications for treating other age-related conditions and diseases.</description>

			<title>In Graphics | Will COP28's UAE Consensus spell doom for fossil fuels?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-will-cop28s-uae-consensus-spell-doom-for-fossil-fuels-13504632.html</link>
			<description>The COP28 concluded in Dubai with a deal known as the UAE Consensus, spearheaded by the UAE's Sultan al-Jaber. The deal calls for transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, although it did not specifically name the main driver of planet-heating pollution. Observers view this as a major milestone but also note that significant efforts are needed to achieve global decarbonization and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The UAE Consensus, along with other deals achieved in Dubai, holds significance in addressing climate change, but there are concerns about whether it will be enough to effectively combat the rapidly-accelerating climate impacts.</description>

			<description>Former US President Donald Trump is selling pieces of the suit he wore in his mugshot after being arrested in August 2023. He is offering 2,024 pieces of the suit, each obtainable by purchasing 47 NFT digital trading cards at $99 each. Some cards come with autographs, and one piece of the suit will be given to those who purchase 47 digital cards. There is also an offer for 200 limited-edition $9,900 "VIP Tickets" for a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, which can be obtained by purchasing 100 cards at once and paying with cryptocurrencies. However, potential buyers should exercise caution, as there is a disclaimer stating that buyers may receive a limited edition Trump NFT instead of the physical suit in the event of any manufacturing, production, or delivery issues. Trump has also previously sold sets of cards, making millions of dollars from the sales.</description>

The incident led to the enforcement of stricter security measures at Parliament. Additionally, the article outlines the history and multiple amendments of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), India’s main anti-terrorism law, along with its controversial aspects, such as provisions for detention without a chargesheet and restrictions on bail.</description>

			<title>Why did the intruders breach Parliament? Was it to protest against unemployment?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-did-the-intruders-breach-parliament-was-it-to-protest-against-unemployment-13502822.html</link>
			<description>During the Winter Session proceedings at the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, two individuals, identified as Manoranjan D and Sagar Sharma, jumped into the chamber and released coloured smoke from gas canisters, while two others – Amol Shinde and Neelam Devi – were detained from the premises as they yelled slogans and released yellow-coloured gas. The motives behind the security breach have been linked to frustration over unemployment, as the individuals were reportedly highly qualified but unable to secure employment. Additionally, they expressed frustration over issues like the farmers' protest and the Manipur crisis. The group meticulously planned the incident and was connected through a club known as the 'Bhagat Singh Fan Club'. The Ministry of Home Affairs has constituted an enquiry panel to investigate the breach and recommend improvements to security at the Parliament.</description>

			<title>Why billionaires from across the world are moving businesses to Abu Dhabi</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-billionaires-from-across-the-world-are-moving-businesses-to-abu-dhabi-13495322.html</link>
			<description>Abu Dhabi has become a preferred choice for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) to park their assets. Thousands of billionaires have set up special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in Abu Dhabi, making it a top choice for billionaires. The emirate offers advantages such as tax treaties with other countries to minimize tax bills, mechanisms to protect assets from foreign interference, and long-term residency options. Other traditional havens like the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands have faced increased scrutiny, making Abu Dhabi more attractive. Additionally, Abu Dhabi's cultural attractions and business opportunities contribute to its appeal for HNWIs.</description>

			<title>Missing for 6 days: The strange case of Alexei Navalny’s disappearance from Russian jail</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-strange-case-of-alexei-navalnys-disappearance-from-russian-prison-13492552.html</link>
			<description>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's supporters have reported that he has been missing for nearly a week and his lawyers have been unable to contact him. Navalny, known for his criticism of Putin and currently serving a 30-year prison term, was last reported to be in a corrective penal colony in the Vladimir region near Moscow. His absence comes in the wake of Putin declaring his candidacy for re-election next March, raising concerns about political motives behind Navalny's disappearance. The timing of his absence is seen as linked to Putin's bid for a fifth term in power. Navalny's aides suspect political control from the Kremlin and his supporters have initiated an anti-Putin campaign. The White House has expressed concern over Navalny's disappearance, and Navalny's continued confrontation against Putin has led to multiple jail terms and allegations of fresh charges.</description>

			<description>The article discusses concerns about using ChatGPT's free edition for medical information and highlights potential risks and inaccuracies. It points out that relying on ChatGPT for medical advice, especially in drug-related inquiries, may lead to inaccurate or incomplete responses. Researchers found that the AI chatbot's accuracy was lacking, providing false information in some cases, which could potentially put users at risk.

OpenAI has emphasized that their models are not fine-tuned to provide medical information, and users should not use ChatGPT for diagnostic or treatment services.

			<title>UK sees a 230% jump in 100-day cough cases: What is this ailment that can lead to fractured ribs?</title>

			<description>The article discusses a significant increase in cases of the 100-day cough, also known as whooping cough, in the UK and Wales. It highlights the symptoms, causes, and preventive measures for this ailment. The rise in cases is attributed to missed vaccination appointments, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as social distancing and lockdown policies. It emphasizes the importance of vaccination, particularly for pregnant women and young children. If someone contracts the 100-day cough, they should consult a doctor, make lifestyle changes, and consider using a humidifier to ease breathing. Rest, increased liquid intake, and over-the-counter pain relievers may also help, and in severe cases, hospital treatment may be required.</description>

Since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, several changes have taken place in Jammu and Kashmir, including the end of Article 35A, introduction of the domicile clause, and changes in security situation, governance, and investment landscape.</description>

			<title>Could Saudi Arabia get control of London’s Heathrow Airport?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/could-saudi-arabia-get-control-of-londons-heathrow-airport-13490732.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the possibility of Saudi Arabia acquiring control of Heathrow Airport in London. The country's sovereign wealth fund recently purchased a 10% stake in the airport, and there are reports that other major investors, such as Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial, may also be considering selling their shares. However, it is still uncertain whether Saudi Arabia will end up owning Heathrow. The article mentions that Qatar, China, and Singapore's sovereign wealth funds also own stakes in the airport and are unlikely to sell. On the other hand, pension funds from Quebec, Australia, and the UK's Universities Superannuation Scheme may be considering selling their shares. The implications of this potential development are not yet clear. The article also mentions that Heathrow's passenger numbers have increased after the COVID-19 pandemic, but the airport has still faced financial losses. Please note that as GPT-3.5, I provide factual information based on the given text, and the article does not mention any specific implications of Saudi Arabia potentially acquiring control of Heathrow.</description>

If he does so, he will surpass Joseph Stalin as the longest-serving Moscow leader. The article also lists the top 10 longest-serving elected leaders in the world, giving a brief background on each leader's tenure.</description>

			<title>Mahua Moitra expelled from Lok Sabha: What next for the firebrand TMC leader?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mahua-moitra-expelled-from-lok-sabha-what-next-for-the-firebrand-tmc-leader-13483552.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha for alleged "unethical conduct" and "serious misdemeanors" based on a report from the Ethics Committee. The committee recommended an intense, legal, institutional inquiry by the Government of India. The expulsion has caused a political storm, with Moitra vowing to fight the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the next 30 years. Moitra has the option to challenge the decision by moving the Supreme Court or the High Court. She can also raise concerns about the jurisdiction and conduct of the Ethics Committee. However, it's important to note that as GPT-3.5, I cannot provide legal advice or predict the outcome of any legal proceedings.</description>

			<title>What does a net zero world look like? Here's what experts say</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-does-a-net-zero-world-look-like-heres-what-experts-say-13478302.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that there is limited research on how climate extremes might change after reaching net zero CO₂ emissions. However, the study mentioned in the text suggests that temperatures would respond differently in various parts of the world, and heat extremes might continue to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. It also mentions that regions with higher human development index, such as North America and western Europe, may experience larger reductions in heat extremes compared to regions with a lower rank, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. It is important for humanity to work towards achieving net zero CO₂ emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</description>

			<title>Why is FBI chief visiting India amid US allegations of foiled ‘plot to kill’ Pannun?</title>

			<description>The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, is planning to visit India on December 11 and 12. This visit comes after US federal prosecutors filed an indictment accusing an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, and an unnamed Indian official of being involved in a plot to assassinate Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States. The purpose of Wray's visit is to strengthen ties between the US and India on law enforcement issues. During his visit, Wray is expected to meet with National Investigation Agency chief Dinkar Gupta and other senior officials from India's intelligence agencies and Ministry of Home Affairs. Discussions will focus on topics such as Khalistan terrorism, Pakistan-sponsored terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir, and the gangster nexus. The US is waiting for the results of India's investigation into the alleged assassination attempt before taking any further action.</description>

			<title>US mass shootings have risen to a high not seen since 2006. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-mass-shootings-have-risen-to-a-high-not-seen-since-2006-heres-why-13474522.html</link>
			<description>The United States has experienced the highest number of mass shootings in 17 years, surpassing the previous record set last year. In Dallas, a 21-year-old man killed four people, including a 1-year-old boy, before fatally shooting himself. In Vancouver, Washington, a man shot his wife, their two adult daughters, and his brother before taking his own life. These incidents were recorded as the 40th and 41st mass killings in the country this year. So far, at least 211 people have died in such incidents in 2023. The majority of mass shootings occurred in private homes or shelters rather than public places. The worst attack of the year took place in Lewiston, where 18 people were killed by a US Army reservist and firearms instructor. The increase in mass shootings is attributed to easy access to firearms. Different organizations have varying definitions for mass shootings, resulting in discrepancies in reported numbers. President Joe Biden has pledged to address gun violence, but finding solutions to prevent these incidents remains a challenge.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-dmk-mp-who-made-gaumutra-states-remarks-is-a-serial-offender-13473332.html</link>
			<description>DNV Senthil Kumar, a DMK MP, caused controversy with his remarks referring to the Hindi heartland as "Gaumutra states." He stated that when the BJP is unable to win a state, they make it a Union Territory to maintain control. His comments received backlash from various parties, leading him to apologize for causing offense. This is not the first time Senthil Kumar has been involved in such controversies. In previous instances, he made bizarre remarks about gods and family planning, criticized a government official for a religious event, and faced criticism from Congress and BJP leaders.</description>

			<title>What is the 'cash-for-kidneys racket' at Apollo Hospitals?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-cash-for-kidneys-racket-at-apollo-hospitals-13473032.html</link>
			<description>The Telegraph newspaper has alleged that Apollo Hospitals, India's biggest private hospital group, is involved in an illegal "cash for kidney" racket. The investigation claims that impoverished individuals from Myanmar are lured to Apollo Hospital in Delhi to sell their kidneys to wealthy patients worldwide. The hospital group has vehemently denied the allegations and called them false. The Ministry of Health in India is also investigating the matter. The racket involves forging identity documents and creating fake family ties between donors and patients. The hospital's authorization committee is described as a facade, with minimal scrutiny of the donor-recipient relationship. Apollo denies the allegations and states that they follow strict procedures, including genetic testing, to ensure compliance with applicable laws. The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) has initiated a probe into the matter.</description>

			<title>How Pannun ‘murder’ plot dominates India, US talks</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/gurpatwant-singh-pannun-murder-plot-dominates-india-us-talks-13471692.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing tension between India and the US regarding the alleged plot to assassinate Khalistan terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on US soil. US principal deputy national security advisor Jonathan Finer met with high-ranking Indian officials to discuss the matter, acknowledging India's establishment of a committee to investigate the plot. The article also mentions Finer's participation in discussions aimed at strengthening coordination between the US and India in various areas, such as technology cooperation and regional policy alignment. The US reiterated its seriousness in the matter and stated that it will wait for the results of India's investigation. The article provides details about the alleged plot, including plans to target multiple individuals in the US and Canada. India has designated Pannun as an "individual terrorist," and his group Sikhs for Justice has been banned in India. Despite the concerns raised by the US charges, experts believe that this issue is unlikely to significantly impact the overall relationship between India and the US.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the Congress party's victory in the Telangana Assembly elections and the selection of Anumula Revanth Reddy as the new chief minister. The Congress won 65 seats, defeating Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS). Reddy played a crucial role in leading the party's campaign in the state. He has a political background and started his career with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad before joining the TRS and later the Congress. Reddy's strategic planning and charismatic leadership contributed to the party's success in increasing its seat count from 19 to 65. Despite facing some criticism within the party for his autocratic style, Reddy received support from senior party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. Ultimately, it was Rahul Gandhi's decision to select Reddy as the chief minister.</description>

			<title>Where will bankrupt Pakistan get funds to hold elections?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/where-will-bankrupt-pakistan-get-funds-to-hold-elections-13469142.html</link>
			<description>Pakistan is currently facing a severe economic crisis with high unemployment, soaring inflation, and unaffordable food and essentials. Amidst this, a general election is scheduled for February. However, there have been delays in releasing funds for the election. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) requested Rs 51 billion but agreed upon Rs 47 billion. The finance ministry assured the ECP of releasing Rs 17 billion after concerns were raised. Political parties fund their campaigns through application fees collected from candidates and donations from non-members. The cost of the upcoming elections is estimated to be significantly higher compared to previous elections. The economic situation in Pakistan is dire, with rising inflation and job losses. Despite this, millions are being spent on elections, adding to the uncertainty of the future.</description>

			<title>Why New Zealand's Maoris are protesting against the newly elected government</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-new-zealands-maoris-are-protesting-against-the-newly-elected-government-13467922.html</link>
			<description>Thousands of protesters in New Zealand demonstrated against the newly elected conservative-led coalition government, organized by the Maori Party. The protests were a response to what they perceived as "anti-Maori" policies. The demonstrations caused traffic jams and resulted in two arrests in Auckland. Maori Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi criticized Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's administration, stating that their policies would regress New Zealand back to the 1800s. The protesters called for the protection of the Treaty of Waitangi, which safeguards Indigenous rights. Luxon's government plans to review the treaty and potentially make changes to modern laws based on it. They also intend to make changes to the Maori Health Authority. Luxon defended his government's commitment to improving outcomes for both Maori and non-Maori citizens. The ACT Party leader criticized the protests, describing them as divisive and showing disrespect for equal rights. The National Party won the largest proportion of the vote in the recent elections, forming a coalition with New Zealand First and ACT parties. The Maori Party secured six seats in Parliament.</description>

			<title>US is struggling to send Ukraine money. Here’s what this means for conflict</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-is-struggling-to-send-ukraine-money-heres-what-this-means-for-conflict-13468122.html</link>
			<description>The US is warning that it may run out of money to provide weapons and equipment to Ukraine by the end of 2023. The White House's budget director, Shalanda Young, sent a letter to the US House Speaker stating that without congressional action, the flow of US weapons and equipment to Ukraine would be cut off, severely impeding Ukraine's ability to fight on the battlefield. The lack of funds for Ukraine is due to domestic US politics, with hard-right lawmakers opposing new funding for Ukraine. Despite President Joe Biden's request for $106 billion in national security funding, including support for Ukraine, Congress has been unable to secure the necessary funds. The US has already provided at least $40 billion in security aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022, but most of the money remains in the United States and has been spent on replacing military hardware sent to Kyiv. The failure to agree on more funding not only puts Ukraine's gains at risk but also increases the chance of Russian military victories.</description>

			<title>Did Hamas make millions by betting against Israel stock market before 7 Oct attack?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/did-hamas-make-millions-in-profit-by-betting-against-israel-stock-market-before-7-october-attack-13466842.html</link>
			<description>A study conducted by researchers from Columbia University and New York University suggests that some traders may have had prior knowledge of the deadly Hamas attack on Israel in October. The study, titled "Trading on Terror," found significant short-selling of shares before the attacks, indicating that traders bet against the Israeli economy and made profits by short-selling on the Israel stock exchange. The researchers found that short interest in the MSCI Israel Exchange Traded Fund spiked on October 2, and short selling of Israeli securities on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange increased dramatically just before the attack. The paper provides an example of Bank Leumi, a TASE-listed company, where millions of shares were sold short, yielding profits of millions of dollars. The study suggests that traders who were informed about the coming attacks profited from them. While it is difficult to determine who made the profits, the researchers caution against linking it back to Hamas, as there are various possibilities. The Israel Securities Authority is currently investigating the matter.</description>

			<title>Increase in minimum salary, NHS surcharge hike: How UK is planning to cut migration</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/increase-in-minimum-salary-nhs-surcharge-hike-how-uk-is-planning-to-cut-migration-13466372.html</link>
			<description>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced measures to reduce the number of migrants arriving through legal means in an effort to address record net migration figures. The move comes as official estimates reveal a record high of 745,000 net migrations to the UK in 2022, surpassing the number of individuals leaving the country. The new measures include increasing the minimum salary for skilled foreign workers applying for a visa to work in the UK. Other key measures announced include restrictions on bringing family dependents, new limitations on the Health and Care visa, an increase in the NHS surcharge, cracking down on cut-price labor, and restrictions on allowing dependents to enter the UK. These actions are being taken ahead of the upcoming general election, where immigration is expected to be a key issue. The Conservative government, led by Boris Johnson, had promised to reduce net migration numbers but has seen an increase since the UK formally left the EU in January 2020. The urgency to address this issue is heightened by pressure from MPs and lagging behind the Labour party in opinion polls.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-how-cyclones-form-and-their-devastating-impact-13465132.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of cyclonic storm 'Michaung' in Chennai, India. The storm has caused heavy rainfall and resulted in at least five deaths. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned of heavy to very heavy rainfall in north-coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Chennai experienced severe waterlogging, with areas like Wallajah Road, Mount Road, and Anna Salai being inundated. The popular Marina Beach was also flooded, causing road blockages. The Tamil Nadu government declared a public holiday in several districts. The article briefly mentions the conversation between Amit Shah and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu regarding the intense rains and the Indian Army's rescue efforts in affected areas. Cyclone Michaung is expected to make landfall in Andhra Pradesh's Bapatla, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The rainfall in Chennai is attributed to the cyclone, which is swirling in the Bay of Bengal.</description>

			<title>The COP28 chief is dead wrong. Science says we need to quickly do away with fossil fuels</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-cop28-chief-is-dead-wrong-science-says-we-need-to-quickly-do-away-with-fossil-fuels-13465232.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the claim made by the president of COP28 that there is no scientific evidence supporting the need to phase out fossil fuels to limit global heating to 1.5°C. However, the author argues that there is a wealth of scientific research demonstrating the necessity of a fossil fuel phase-out to combat climate change. The author refers to their own publication in Nature, which highlights that a significant portion of coal, oil, and gas needs to remain underground to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also emphasizes the urgency of shifting away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero CO₂ emissions by the early 2050s. Additional studies and analyses support the conclusion that a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels is essential. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of a fair and orderly transition, with developed countries phasing out fossil fuels and providing support to developing countries for the switch to cleaner technologies.</description>

			<title>Can the dodo be brought back from the dead?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-the-dodo-be-brought-back-from-the-dead-13465002.html</link>
			<description>A biotech firm called Colossal Biosciences is partnering with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation to potentially bring back the extinct dodo bird. The company has sequenced the genomes of the dodo, as well as two other birds closely related to it. They plan to use cells called primordial germ cells (PGCs) to create a chicken and rooster with the physical traits of a dodo. These altered PGCs will be placed into the embryos of the chickens, and if successful, their offspring will have the characteristics of the dodo. However, there are technical challenges to overcome, and bringing back the dodo does not address the issues that led to its extinction originally. The company believes that rewilding the animals and returning them to their natural habitat is crucial. It is important to note that de-extinction is not a solution to the present-day extinction crisis.</description>

			<title>Were 3 Palestinians shot at in US because of their scarves?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/3-palestinian-students-shot-us-vermont-keffiyeh-scarf-palestine-resistance-symbol-of-solidarity-13435622.html</link>
			<description>Three Palestinian students, Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdel Hamid, and Tahseen Ahmed, were shot and critically injured while walking home from dinner in Vermont. The Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee believes they were targeted because they were wearing traditional keffiyehs and speaking Arabic. The keffiyeh is a square-shaped cotton headdress worn by Palestinian men and has become a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity. It has a historic connection to the fishing traditions of Palestinian coastal communities. The keffiyeh gained political connotations during the Arab Revolt against the British in 1936 and became synonymous with Palestinian solidarity in the 1960s, popularized by Yasser Arafat. Over the years, it has been banned, co-opted by fashion brands, and worn in protests and demonstrations worldwide.</description>

			<description>Gunshots were fired outside the home of Punjabi actor and singer Gippy Grewal in Canada. The gang of Lawrence Bishnoi, who is accused in the murder case of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala, claimed responsibility for the attack on Facebook. They also mentioned Gippy's association with Salman Khan and threatened both of them. Gippy Grewal is a popular actor and Punjabi singer, known for his hit albums and movies. He has faced struggles early in his career but has achieved success through hard work. The attack on Gippy's home is believed to be related to his proximity to Salman Khan, who was previously threatened by Lawrence Bishnoi over the killing of a blackbuck. Salman has been given high-level security due to these threats. However, Gippy denies having any friendship with Salman and says he has only met him twice at public events.</description>

			<title>Why Russia has put Meta's spokesman on its wanted list</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-russia-has-put-metas-spokesman-on-its-wanted-list-13435042.html</link>
			<description>Russia has escalated its crackdown on social media by declaring Meta Platforms spokesperson Andy Stone a wanted figure on unspecified charges. This comes after Russia designated Meta as "extremist," which could lead to criminal investigations and fines against users. The clampdown intensified following Russia's Ukraine offensive, with Stone finding himself on the interior ministry's wanted list without explicit details. Media outlets reported that Stone was put on the list in February 2022, but no related statements were made at the time. In March, Russia's federal Investigative Committee opened a criminal investigation into Meta for allegedly inciting violence against Russians. Western social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have been blocked in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been formally barred from entering the country.</description>

			<title>Tensions in Sierra Leone: Is another African coup on cards?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-tensions-rising-in-sierra-leone-is-another-african-coup-on-cards-13435162.html</link>
			<description>Sierra Leone is currently under military curfew following an attack on the country's military barracks and detention centers. Gunmen attacked the main barracks in the capital city of Freetown, overran detention centers, and captured a police car. The identity of the attackers is unknown. President Julius Maada Bio declared a nationwide curfew in response to the attacks. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and explosions in various parts of the city. Some prisoners were released or abducted during the attack on the detention centers. Security forces have pushed the attackers to the outskirts of Freetown. President Bio assured the nation that most of the leaders of the attack had been arrested and calm was restored. The motives and identity of the attackers remain unclear. The incident is not officially referred to as an attempted coup, but the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) described it as a plot to disturb the peace and constitutional order of the country. President Bio was re-elected for a second term earlier this year amid criticism of economic conditions and allegations of election irregularities.</description>

			<title>China pneumonia outbreak: Could it spread to India?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-pneumonia-outbreak-could-it-spread-to-india-other-countries-13433772.html</link>
			<description>A spike in respiratory illness in China has raised concerns about the possibility of another pandemic. The illness, similar to pneumonia, is affecting children, particularly in Beijing and Liaoning. India has issued a health advisory and taken precautionary measures due to reports of rising cases in China. Chinese health authorities attribute the increase in infections to the end of COVID-19 restrictions, the arrival of the cold season, and the circulation of known pathogens. India is closely monitoring the situation but currently sees a low risk to its population. Doctors advise people to follow standard hygiene practices such as wearing masks, maintaining cleanliness, and washing hands. The outbreak in China is linked to mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacteria that primarily affects children. While the outbreak remains contained, experts predict a rise in respiratory illnesses worldwide during the winter months. Vaccines and treatments are available to combat the illness if it spreads to other countries. Hospitals in Beijing have been overwhelmed with patients, but Chinese health officials claim the surge is caused by common viruses and bacteria rather than a novel virus. The World Health Organization has requested information from China regarding the rise in respiratory illnesses.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the conditions and experiences of hostages who were released after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 50 days. The hostages were fed irregularly, mainly eating rice and bread, and lost weight during their captivity. They slept on rows of chairs pushed together and sometimes had to wait for hours to use the bathroom. Information about their confinement was tightly controlled, but some family members shared details about their loved ones' experiences. The article also mentions the devastation caused by Israel's offensive on Gaza and the cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel, which includes the release of hostages. Some of the released hostages appeared to have been held underground, experienced psychological tolls, and needed medical care. Despite the challenges they faced, some of the hostages displayed resilience and were able to walk, speak, and even solve puzzles shortly after their release.</description>

			<title>Uttarkashi tunnel collapse: Will vertical drilling help in rescuing the 41 labourers?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttarkashi-tunnel-collapse-vertical-drilling-rescue-trapped-labourers-13433392.html</link>
			<description>Rescue efforts are still underway to retrieve 41 workers who are trapped inside the collapsed Silkyara-Barkot tunnel in Uttarkashi district. After a drilling machine broke down, authorities have now resorted to vertical drilling as the next best approach. The rescue teams have already drilled 20 meters out of the required 86 meters. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) managing director estimates that vertical drilling will be completed by Thursday if no obstacles arise.

Vertical drilling involves creating boreholes from above to create earth shafts through which the trapped individuals can be evacuated. However, some experts have expressed concerns about this method due to the potential for vibration and falling debris.

Alongside vertical drilling, officials have developed alternative plans such as horizontal drilling and sideways drilling, with different timeframes for each. As a last resort, manual drilling may be used to remove pieces of the broken equipment from the rubble.

Inside the tunnel, efforts are being made to maintain the morale of the trapped laborers by providing them with home-cooked food, medicines, and other essentials through a small pipe. A communication system has been established, allowing families to occasionally talk to the workers. Concerns have been raised about the workers' well-being, including the possibility of insomnia, hypoxia, and post-traumatic stress disorder due to their prolonged confinement.

The article also mentions that the National Disaster Management Authority plans to start manual drilling soon with the help of Indian Army engineers, rat miners, and technicians. The Border Roads Organisation has constructed a road near the site to facilitate the rescue operation. Additionally, local officials have reached out to the trapped workers to inquire about their health and provide updates on the ongoing rescue efforts.</description>

			<title>Why Sikhs in UK town are fighting the deportation of 'kind Indian auntie'</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-sikhs-in-uk-town-are-fighting-the-deportation-of-kind-indian-auntie-13433202.html</link>
			<description>Community campaigners in the UK are fighting to prevent the deportation of Gurmit Kaur, a 78-year-old widow who has lived in the country for 14 years. Despite an internet petition with over 65,000 signatures urging her to stay, her application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK was denied. Gurmit Kaur, originally from India, has no family to return to in India and is estranged from her children in the UK. She has become an active member of the local community, volunteering at food banks and receiving support from the Sikh community in Smethwick. The decision to deport her has sparked widespread support, but the UK Home Office maintains that Kaur can re-adjust to life in India. Campaigners are calling for her status, as well as that of all undocumented migrants in the UK, to be regularized to protect them during the pandemic.</description>

			<description>The article highlights the ongoing quest for justice and healing for survivors of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, 15 years after the tragic event. Devika Rotawan, who was shot in her right leg at the age of nine, still carries the trauma with her. She vividly remembers the horrific day and continues to experience shooting pain in her leg periodically. Despite the execution of one of the attackers, she believes that true justice will only be achieved when all the masterminds behind such attacks are held accountable. Rotawan's life has been marked by hardships, including the loss of her mother prior to the attack and her own health struggles. She faced social isolation and discrimination, being called "Kasab's daughter" by classmates and experiencing a lack of support from relatives and neighbors. Her family continues to fight for a promised home from the government, and she hopes to find a job to support her family as her father faces health issues. While she once aspired to join the IPS to combat terrorism, she now focuses on finding employment and supporting her family. The struggle to survive and seek justice continues for Rotawan and other survivors of the Mumbai attacks.</description>

			<title>How an antisemitic post might cost Elon Musk $75 million</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-an-antisemitic-post-might-cost-elon-musk-75-million-13429852.html</link>
			<description>Elon Musk could face significant financial losses as dozens of major brands, such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery, have paused their marketing campaigns on his social media platform, X, following his support for an antisemitic post. According to internal documents viewed by The New York Times, over 200 ad units from companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft have either halted or considered pausing their ads on the platform. Since Musk's takeover of X in October 2022, advertisers have been leaving due to reduced content moderation, resulting in a surge of hate speech. It is estimated that the company could lose $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year. X has filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, claiming defamation after the organization reported that major corporations' ads appeared alongside antisemitic and pro-Hitler content on Musk's platform. Musk denies being antisemitic and referred to Media Matters as "evil." The lawsuit alleges that Media Matters manipulated data to falsely associate ads with extremist posts. In response to an antisemitic remark on X, Musk faced backlash for endorsing the assertion that Jewish communities incite hatred against Whites. The White House condemned his engagement with the conspiracy theory. Musk later stated that he wished only the best for humanity.</description>

			<description>Hamas has released a group of prisoners as part of a truce agreement with Israel, bringing the total number of freed hostages to 29 out of approximately 240 taken during the October 7 attack. The latest release includes six elderly people, three mothers with their four children, ten Thai hostages, and one Filipino hostage. The captives were handed over to Egyptian authorities by the Red Cross and taken to Hatzarim Airbase in Israel for further examinations. Prior to this agreement, five hostages had already been freed. The article provides information about the identities and circumstances of some of the Israeli hostages, including their ages, relationships, and medical conditions. It also mentions that Israel is expected to free three times as many Palestinian prisoners under the deal, while around 190 hostages remain in the hands of Palestinian militants.</description>

			<title>How 'Made in India' drugs will cut treatment cost of 4 rare diseases by 100 folds</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-made-in-india-drugs-will-cut-treatment-cost-of-4-rare-diseases-by-100-folds-13428332.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has taken steps to address the high cost of treating rare diseases by encouraging local pharmaceutical companies to produce medicines. Eight drugs for six rare diseases are expected to be available on the market by March 2024. The prices of these medications have dropped significantly compared to their imported counterparts, making them more affordable for patients. The diseases that will be targeted include Gaucher's disease, Wilson's disease, Tyrosinemia type 1, Dravet/Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Phenylketonuria, and Hyperammonemia. Some of these medications are off-patent, allowing for lower-cost alternatives to be developed. In addition to these rare diseases, efforts are being made to develop an oral hydroxyurea solution for treating sickle cell disease in children. The prevalence of rare diseases in India is estimated to affect 6% to 8% of the population, with around 8.4 crore to 10 crore Indians impacted.</description>

			<title>Rajasthan Elections 2023: Will BJP rely on Vasundhara Raje again if it wins?</title>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the upcoming elections in Rajasthan and the question of who will be the chief minister if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins. The BJP did not project Vasundhara Raje as its chief ministerial candidate this time, indicating a possible leadership change. However, if the party only secures a thin majority, they may fall back on Raje's leadership. The BJP has other potential candidates for the chief ministerial post, including Mahant Balaknath and several prominent leaders. The article also mentions the importance of projecting a leader for the party's electoral success. The elections in Rajasthan will take place on November 25, and the results will be announced on December 3.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with a summary of the article about the world's largest iceberg, A23a. A23a is a massive iceberg that broke away from the Antarctic coast in 1986. It has been stuck to the ocean floor for over 30 years but is now finally on the move. The iceberg is more than twice the size of Greater London, covering an area of about 4,000 square kilometers. It is predicted to be thrown towards the southern South Atlantic Ocean, close to the island of South Georgia. There is concern that it could disrupt the ecology of the island, which is home to millions of seals, penguins, and other birds. Scientists are closely monitoring its progress.</description>

			<title>It’s Good To Be King: How Charles III is secretly profiting off his dead countrymen</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/its-good-to-be-king-how-charles-iii-is-secretly-profiting-off-his-dead-countrymen-13427882.html</link>
			<description>King Charles III has received tens of millions of pounds from deceased individuals in recent years, which has been used to renovate his properties. The money comes from the estates of people who died without a will or next of kin under a feudal system called bona vacatia. The Duchy of Lancaster, which receives the funds, claims to donate the revenue to charity after deducting costs. However, only a small portion is actually used for charitable purposes, with the rest being used to refurbish the King's properties, which are then leased out. This practice has been criticized by some, as many of the deceased were living in poor conditions. Charles III's reign has so far been characterized by continuity rather than major reforms or controversy. It remains to be seen what impact this revelation will have.</description>

			<title>Will AI lead to a four-day workweek, reduce office hours?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-ai-lead-to-a-four-day-workweek-reduce-office-hours-13414542.html</link>
			<description>A new report by the Autonomy campaign group suggests that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could enable a four-day workweek without reducing pay. The study, titled GPT-4 (Day Week): Great Britain Edition, examines the potential impact of AI on lives and livelihoods in the UK. According to the report, if AI is used properly, nearly 9 million people in the UK could enjoy a four-day workweek by 2033, while an additional 28 million workers could see their hours reduced by 10%. These figures represent around 28% and 88% of the UK's labor force respectively. The study used population data, workforce information, an artificial intelligence exposure index, and productivity predictions to make these projections. It also simulated scenarios based on AI increasing productivity by 20%. The report recommends that public and private sector employers take advantage of this opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people and become leaders in adopting workplace AI. A similar study conducted in the US by Autonomy indicated that around 35 million Americans could also enjoy a four-day workweek by 2033. However, some skeptics question the unproven and speculative benefits of large language models (LLMs) like AI and highlight concerns around issues such as prejudice, racism, and data leaks.</description>

			<title>A balancing act? Why PM Modi opted out of BRICS-Plus meet on Israel-Hamas war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-modi-s-jaishankar-brics-plus-meet-israel-hamas-war-13415252.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend the virtual BRICS-plus meeting where leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa discussed the Israel-Hamas war. The meeting was called by South Africa, the current chair of the group, who accused Israel of war crimes and genocide in Gaza. While South Africa took a strong stance against Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the crisis on failed diplomacy by the United States, and Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar attended the meeting on behalf of PM Modi and emphasized the need for de-escalation, humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages. PM Modi's absence was attributed to prior commitments and ongoing political campaigning. India's abstention from the UN General Assembly vote on a ceasefire resolution was seen as a pro-Israeli stance, although India has maintained a nuanced position throughout the crisis, condemning terrorism while also supporting the socio-economic welfare of the Palestinian people.</description>

			<title>Has China established a ‘near-space’ command? Should we be worried?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/has-china-established-a-near-space-command-should-we-be-worried-13414212.html</link>
			<description>China has reportedly created its own 'near-space' command, following the establishment of the United States' Space Force in 2019. The new command operates alongside China's army, air force, navy, and rocket branches, reporting directly to the top level of the military and having access to hypersonic weapons. Researchers claim that near-space is a hotly-contested zone that can determine the outcome of future battles. The unit would focus on targeting opposing nations' rocket sites to curtail their anti-satellite missile capabilities. Experts suggest that China's investment in near-space technologies is expected given the country's military challenges. The US is concerned about China's rapid development in space and aims to establish rules and partnerships with countries like Japan to counter Chinese aggression.</description>

			<description>Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Unit 504, a secretive spy unit similar to Mossad, has played a significant role in Israel's ground offensive in Gaza. The unit focuses on military operations and has been involved in exposing how Hamas uses hospitals in Gaza for militant activities. Trained operatives carry out highly classified operations, including interrogating Palestinians, providing intelligence to the IDF, and gathering information about Hamas tunnels and weapons depots. Unit 504 has flagged numerous terrorist sites for IDF operations and developed virtual reality technology to assist soldiers. Additionally, the unit has helped in civilian evacuations by sending messages and flyers urging them to flee to safer areas. Hamas and hospital officials deny the allegations made by Israel regarding their presence inside Gaza hospitals.</description>

			<title>A Jurrasic World: Do dinosaurs still exist?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/a-jurrasic-world-do-dinosaurs-still-exist-13412352.html</link>
			<description>Scientists believe that dinosaurs may exist on another planet, despite the fact that they have been extinct on Earth for over 65 million years. A recent study suggests that a "Jurassic World" could currently exist on a different planet. By investigating materials present during the dinosaur era but not on modern Earth, scientists may be able to discover evidence of this kind of life. The study highlights the significance of oxygen levels, as Earth had higher oxygen content during the age of the dinosaurs, around 30%. Today, the percentage of oxygen has settled at 21%. Specific telescopes can detect conditions similar to those experienced by dinosaurs, indicating the potential presence of complex life on distant planets. Another indicator of complex life is whether a planet is in the Phanerozoic period, which encompasses most of Earth's history with complex life forms. Scientists hope that finding planets with increased oxygen content will make the search for intriguing life forms easier and potentially lead to the discovery of other dinosaurs.</description>

			<title>Delhi minister Atishi warns of ‘severe’ water shortage: What’s behind the recurring crisis?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-minister-atishi-warns-of-severe-water-shortage-whats-behind-the-recurring-crisis-13413142.html</link>
			<description>Delhi's water minister, Atishi, has raised concerns about an impending severe drinking water shortage in the city. She accused Delhi's chief secretary of halting funds to the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), leading to unpaid staff and a lack of funds for essential operations. Atishi warned of potential dirty water, sewer overflow, and the risk of an epidemic in many areas. Delhi requires 1,300 MGD of water, but the DJB can only provide 1,000 MGD, causing shortages in multiple areas. The city's water crisis is attributed to population growth, drought, mismanagement, and urbanization that neglected natural water resources. Unregulated extraction of water and illegal borewells worsen the situation. The government plans to divert funds to the DJB, install tube wells, recharge groundwater, and use treated wastewater for various purposes.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/north-korea-wants-to-dominate-space-heres-why-some-are-worried-13413032.html</link>
			<description>North Korea has launched six satellites since 1998, with two successfully reaching orbit. The country plans to launch another satellite, despite previous failed attempts. Japan and South Korea criticize this move, as it violates the UN ban on Pyongyang's missile development. North Korea aims to develop advanced satellites and military reconnaissance satellites, using dual-nozzle liquid-fueled engines. The United States and its allies consider these satellite tests as violations of UN resolutions. North Korea sees its space program as its sovereign right. The launch of satellites could enhance North Korea's intelligence capabilities and demonstrate its space power. It could also reduce tensions if it verifies that the US and its allies are not planning an attack.</description>

			<title>Another step to de-dollarisation: What's China, Saudi currency swap pact?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/another-step-to-de-dollarisation-whats-china-saudi-arabias-currency-swap-pact-13412122.html</link>
			<description>China and Saudi Arabia have entered into their first currency swap agreement, worth $6.93 billion, in a move to strengthen financial cooperation and promote trade and investment. The three-year agreement can be extended by mutual consent. A currency swap is a financial arrangement where two parties exchange a specified amount of one currency for another at an agreed-upon rate, aiming to reduce risk and access foreign currency. China aims to reduce its reliance on the US dollar, while Saudi Arabia seeks to increase foreign investment and diversify its economy. Experts believe that the United States should not be concerned about this agreement, as China's use of currency swap lines differs from the US, and the dollar remains crucial for global trade and monetary policy. Although the deal may not be significant in size, it holds symbolic importance due to Saudi Arabia's position as the world's leading oil exporter. China has a vast network of currency swap arrangements with around 40 countries but typically does not disclose detailed terms.</description>

			<title>Subrata Roy’s death: What happens to Sahara’s Rs 25,000 crore funds with SEBI?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/subrata-roys-death-what-happens-to-saharas-rs-25000-crore-funds-with-sebi-13411912.html</link>
			<description>Subrata Roy, the founder of Sahara Group, passed away in Mumbai at the age of 75. This has brought attention to the issue of over Rs 25,000 crore in undistributed funds that have been with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for more than a decade. The legal troubles for Sahara Group started in the early 2010s when SEBI ordered two of its firms to repay money to investors raised through illegal bonds. The Supreme Court later upheld SEBI's order, asking Sahara to deposit around Rs 24,000 crore with SEBI. Subrata Roy even served over two years in jail for failing to appear in court. SEBI has issued refunds totaling Rs 138.07 crore to some investors, but there are still unclaimed funds of over Rs 25,000 crore. The government is exploring options to transfer these funds to the Consolidated Fund of India, but it is too early to do so as new registrations for claims are still taking place. SEBI has launched a refund portal to facilitate repayment to investors, and once this process is complete, the possibility of transferring funds to the Consolidated Fund of India will be examined.</description>

			<title>The sad tale of Budhni Manjhiyain, Nehru’s ‘tribal wife’, who died in exile</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/budhni-manjhiyain-nehru-tribal-wife-who-passes-away-ostracised-life-13411532.html</link>
			<description>Budhni Manjhiyain, an 80-year-old woman from the Santhal tribe, passed away at her residence near Panchet in Jharkhand. What made her unique was her connection to Jawaharlal Nehru, the former Prime Minister of India. In 1959, Nehru visited Dhanbad in West Bengal to inaugurate a dam, and he insisted that a woman from the project be part of the ceremony. Budhni, along with another tribal member, was selected to welcome Nehru. However, when Nehru garlanded Budhni at the event, it caused controversy within the tribal community. They believed that Budhni had married Nehru by accepting the garland, which led to her excommunication from the community. Budhni then sought shelter in Panchet, where she faced numerous challenges but eventually found employment with the Damodar Valley Corporation. In 1985, Rajiv Gandhi met with her and helped reinstate her job. Budhni worked until her retirement in 2005. After her passing, there have been calls for a monument in her honor and for pension support for her daughter.</description>

			<title>Khichdi in bottle, yoga: How 41 workers are surviving in Uttarkashi tunnel</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/khichdi-in-bottle-antidepressants-yoga-how-41-trapped-men-are-surviving-inside-uttarkashi-tunnel-for-10-days-13410522.html</link>
			<description>The workers trapped inside the collapsed Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi district are facing challenges in their battle for survival. The rescue operation has been ongoing for 10 days, with various agencies working to find a way to evacuate the workers. A drilling machine broke down over the weekend, causing a temporary halt in the operation, but an alternative strategy called "top down" drilling was adopted. Meanwhile, the stranded workers are being provided with water, oxygen, and cooked meals, along with dry fruits, antidepressants, and multivitamins. The government is expanding their food supply to include items like bananas, apple slices, daliya, and khichdi. Rescuers are using a six-inch pipe to send these supplies to the workers. The trapped workers have also been encouraged to engage in activities like yoga, walking, and conversations with their loved ones to maintain high morale. Sanitation needs are being taken care of, and there is a natural water source inside the tunnel. Despite the difficulties, the workers' spirits remain resilient. The latest developments include the arrival of robotics machines from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the establishment of an alternative lifeline for evacuation.</description>

			<title>Microsoft hires Sam Altman: Tracing 7-year-partnership between OpenAI and tech giant</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/microsoft-hires-sam-altman-tracing-7-year-partnership-between-openai-and-tech-giant-13410572.html</link>
			<description>Microsoft has hired OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to lead a new advanced AI research team, marking a significant development in the partnership between the two companies. OpenAI, originally founded as a non-profit organization in 2015, later transformed into a "capped profit" company. In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI to support the commercialization of its technologies. OpenAI's most notable achievement is the launch of GPT-3, a powerful language model with 175 billion parameters. Microsoft also developed a supercomputer exclusively for training large OpenAI models and integrated GPT-4 into its consumer products. The article mentions that Altman was recently dismissed from his CEO position at OpenAI, which led to unrest among the company's staff. Despite these developments, OpenAI's planned IPO worth $90 billion may face uncertainties.</description>

			<title>Why have Yemen's Houthis hijacked an India-bound ship? How's this linked to the war?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/yemen-houthis-hijack-india-bound-ship-israel-hamas-war-13410562.html</link>
			<description>Yemen's Houthi militia group, known as the Houthis, has hijacked a cargo ship called Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea. The ship was en route to India from Turkey and had 25 crew members on board. The Houthis released a video of the hijacking, stating that all ships associated with Israel would be considered legitimate targets. The article provides background information about the Houthis, who are Zaydi Shiites and have gained power in northern Yemen since 2014. They are supported by Iran, similar to Hamas and Hezbollah. In response to the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, the Houthis declared their support for Hamas and launched several missile attacks towards Tel Aviv. The hijacking of the ship is seen as a continuation of their anti-Israel stance. The ship has been taken to a port area in Yemen, and various countries, including Japan and Israel, have called for its release. The United States also denounced the seizure, emphasizing it as a violation of international law. The hijacking has significant implications and could escalate the Israel-Palestine conflict, potentially involving the United States and Iran.</description>

			<title>Why Albanian opposition politicians lit fire and set off smoke bombs in parliament</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-albanian-opposition-politicians-lit-fire-and-set-off-smoke-bombs-in-parliament-13410372.html</link>
			<description>Opposition politicians in Albania set off smoke flares and disrupted a parliamentary session to prevent the voting on the 2024 budget. Members of the Democratic Party protested against what they see as increasing authoritarian rule by the governing Socialists. The opposition wants to establish investigation commissions to look into suspected corruption cases involving Prime Minister Edi Rama and other high-ranking officials. The Socialists argue that the opposition's demands do not meet constitutional requirements. The unrest began after former Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the Democratic Party, was charged with corruption. The opposition protests are expected to escalate further.</description>

			<title>TikTok has a problem of sexual explicit material. How children are at risk</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/tiktok-has-a-problem-of-sexual-explicit-material-how-children-are-at-risk-13409902.html</link>
			<description>The rise of TikTok has brought concerns about explicit content and the safety of young users to the forefront. Despite efforts to moderate content, TikTok's focus appears to be on maximizing user engagement and traffic rather than creating a safe environment. The platform relies on both automated and human moderation, but the automated system is not always precise, leading to the removal of beneficial content and the presence of harmful content. User tactics such as "algospeak" further complicate content moderation. TikTok's promotion of explicit and harmful content can put young users at risk, and it has been criticized for suppressing educational content related to the LGBTQ+ community while allowing harmful content to remain visible. The platform's age-verification process is easily bypassed, allowing explicit content creators to promote themselves. This content can perpetuate harmful attitudes towards sex and consent, particularly affecting young boys' mental health. The promotion of idealistic and sexualized content also harms the self-perception of young women and queer youth. While TikTok offers an opportunity to spread educational content about sex, such content may not receive the same engagement as more explicit videos. Self-regulation by social media platforms is not enough, and regulatory bodies need to step in. Parents should actively monitor their child's TikTok activity if they allow access, and efforts should be focused on equipping young users with media literacy skills.</description>

			<title>Sweet Pain: Why drinking red wine may give you a headache</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sweet-pain-why-drinking-red-wine-may-give-you-a-headache-13409722.html</link>
			<description>A recent study conducted by scientists from the University of California suggests that the compound quercetin found in red wine may be the cause of headaches experienced by some individuals. Quercetin, a compound and flavanol found in fruits and vegetables, is produced by grapes in response to sunlight. When combined with alcohol and consumed, quercetin blocks the metabolism of acetaldehyde in the body, leading to its accumulation and causing inflammation, which results in headaches. The study also plans to test their theory through a clinical trial using wines with varying levels of quercetin. If successful, this research could potentially help consumers select wines with lower levels of quercetin to avoid headaches.</description>

			<title>What are Israel’s mixed-gender units? What’s their role in Israel-Hamas war?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-israels-mixed-gender-units-whats-their-role-in-israel-hamas-war-2-13409272.html</link>
			<description>Israel's ground offensive in Gaza continues, with reports of raids on hospitals and attacks on schools. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have deployed a mixed-gender battalion called the "Shahar" Battalion, which includes both men and women combat soldiers. This is not the first time women have served in combat positions in the IDF, as they have been part of the forces since the War of Independence in 1948. The IDF currently has at least five mixed-gender battalions, including the Caracal Battalion, the Baradalas, and the Lions of Jordan Valley.

The Shahar Battalion, led by Lt Col Yarden, is involved in search-and-rescue operations in Gaza City's Shati Camp. Around 40% of the troops in this unit are women, and they undertake various tasks alongside their male counterparts, such as breaching buildings and searching for Hamas weaponry. The Caracal Battalion has previously engaged in combat, killing around 100 Hamas terrorists during an attack in October. Other mixed-gender units, like Bardelas and Caracal, are deployed along the border with Egypt, while the Lions of Jordan Valley focus on protecting the northern Jordan Valley border.

Despite their contributions and achievements, coed units in the IDF have faced criticism from some rabbis, former commanders, and conservative voices in the country. Concerns about physical strength differences and maintaining traditional notions of modesty have been raised. However, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has defended these units, stating that female and male combat soldiers are equal in the IDF.

			<title>9 days and counting: What's delaying the rescue op of 41 trapped workers in Uttarakhand tunnel?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttarakhand-tunnel-collapse-rescue-operations-delay-41-workers-13407632.html</link>
			<description>Rescue operations to save 41 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel in Uttarakhand have entered their ninth day. A five-point plan has been devised, including drilling from three sides to reach the trapped workers. The plan involves drilling a vertical hole from the top of the hill where the workers are trapped, as well as drilling a small tunnel from the Barkot side. The rescue efforts were temporarily halted when an auger machine developed a snag, but operations have since resumed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand that the workers will be evacuated safely. The rescue operation is challenging due to the non-uniform soil strata in the Himalayan region. The workers are being provided with multivitamins, antidepressants, and dry fruits to support their well-being.</description>

			<description>A study conducted by Oxfam reveals that the richest one percent of the global population, amounting to 77 million people, are responsible for 16 percent of total global CO2 emissions resulting from their consumption. This group includes billionaires, millionaires, and individuals earning over $140,000 per year. The report suggests that addressing climate change requires tailored government policies since not everyone is equally accountable. The study also highlights the alarming disparity between the carbon footprints of the rich and the poor, with the top one percent emitting more carbon than the bottom 66 percent combined. In addition, high-income countries contribute significantly more to consumption-based CO2 emissions compared to low-income nations. The report emphasizes the need for progressive climate policies that place greater responsibility on those who emit the most, including measures such as taxing frequent air travel or non-green investments. Furthermore, the study shows that marginalized communities, women, and developing countries bear a disproportionate burden in terms of economic and physical vulnerability to extreme weather events. Oxfam insists that addressing extreme wealth through taxation can provide the necessary resources to tackle inequality and the climate crisis simultaneously.</description>

			<title>Fact-check: No, India's GDP has not crossed $4 trillion. But are we close?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/fact-check-india-economy-gdp-4-trillion-how-far-away-are-we-13407282.html</link>
			<description>India's GDP crossed the $4 trillion-mark for the first time, according to an unverified screengrab from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) data. The country achieved a GDP growth of 7.8% during the April-June period of 2023-24, the highest in the past four quarters. Despite the viral news, the government remained silent, and there was no official confirmation of the milestone. Several BJP leaders and industrialists praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this achievement, while economists and analysts welcomed the reports. However, experts refuted the news, stating that India's GDP is around $3.45 trillion as of June. India aims to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025.</description>

			<title>Why Joe Biden’s birthday takes centre stage ahead of the 2024 US presidential polls</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-joe-bidens-birthday-takes-centre-stage-ahead-of-the-2024-us-presidential-polls-13406282.html</link>
			<description>Joe Biden turned 81 today, making him the oldest sitting president in American history. His age is a significant concern for American voters, especially among young voters. Despite his vigorous schedule and jokes about his age, polls consistently show that Biden's age is the greatest concern for voters. While Donald Trump is only slightly younger than Biden, voters are less concerned about his age. Biden has struggled to change public perception on his age, despite his efforts to make light of it. Polls show that a majority of people believe Biden is too old to serve a second term. However, some analysts argue that age should not matter and that there are many people in their 80s who are perfectly capable of being president. Biden's age is likely to face even more scrutiny during the 2024 election campaign. Republicans have also focused their criticism on Vice President Kamala Harris, who would assume the presidency if anything were to happen to Biden.</description>

			<title>What are halal-certified products that UP has banned?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/halal-products-uttar-pradesh-ban-certification-13405952.html</link>
			<description>The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government in India has imposed a ban on the production, storage, distribution, and sale of all halal-certified food, medicines, and cosmetic items within the state, with the exception of products intended for export. This action was taken after an FIR (First Information Report) was filed against certain organizations for allegedly issuing forged halal certificates to boost sales. Halal refers to products that are permissible according to Islamic law, while haram refers to forbidden items. The criteria for halal meat involve specific conditions for animal slaughter. The ban on halal products in UP is based on the argument that halal certification creates confusion and violates public trust, as well as the assertion that some companies were involved in a criminal conspiracy targeting a particular community. The halal certification process in India is carried out by private companies recognized by Muslim consumers and regulators in Islamic countries. The ban has received mixed reactions, with some companies denying the allegations and expressing their intention to take legal action.</description>

			<title>OMG! How TikTok Jesus, promising ‘blessing in an hour’, is a viral sensation</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/omg-how-tiktok-jesus-promising-blessing-in-an-hour-is-a-viral-sensation-13394882.html</link>
			<description>The TikTok profile Daily Believer has gained a large following by using computer-generated Jesuses to engage viewers and promise blessings in exchange for likes, comments, and shares. This approach is similar to the prosperity gospel, which teaches that faith in God will bring material wealth and happiness. The Daily Believer's content appeals to a wide range of Christian groups and has the potential to generate revenue through the TikTok Creator Fund. By framing their requests as coming from the Son of God, the Daily Believer has transformed viewer engagement into a religious act with the promise of divine reward. However, the content seems to be aimed at those who already consider themselves Christian and offers little persuasion or explanation of why someone should become a Christian. Overall, the Daily Believer represents a new expression of an ancient religious motivation – the desire for worldly health, wealth, and reward.</description>

			<title>How US is fighting Iran-backed militias in West Asia</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-the-uss-balanced-response-to-iran-backed-militias-attacking-its-forces-13401502.html</link>
			<description>Iranian-backed militias have been launching attacks on US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria since mid-October. These attacks have resulted in minor injuries to US personnel, mostly traumatic brain injuries. The US has responded with limited military strikes in an attempt to dissuade the militants without escalating the conflict. The attacks have primarily been carried out by suicide drones or rockets and have caused little damage. The militias responsible for the attacks have rebranded themselves as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and have targeted US military bases in Syria and Iraq. The Biden administration has dispatched more troops and military equipment to the region to deter further attacks. However, critics argue that the US response has been insufficient and has failed to deter the militias. The US has focused its retaliatory airstrikes in Syria rather than Iraq to avoid alienating the Iraqi government.</description>

			<description>Mira Murati has been appointed as the interim CEO of OpenAI following the departure of Sam Altman.

			<title>Shakira to go on trial in Spain for tax fraud: What is the case?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/shakira-to-go-on-trial-in-spain-for-tax-fraud-what-is-the-case-13400622.html</link>
			<description>Colombian popstar Shakira is set to go on trial in Barcelona for allegedly evading €14.5 million in taxes. Prosecutors are seeking an eight-year jail term and a fine of nearly €24 million. The case centers around where Shakira lived between 2012 and 2014, with Spanish authorities claiming she primarily resided in Spain during that time. They allege that she listed the Bahamas as her primary residence until 2015. Shakira denies any wrongdoing and asserts that she was leading a "nomadic life" until 2014, earning most of her money from international tours. She has already paid all taxes owed to the Spanish government during her claimed residency in the Bahamas. The trial is expected to run until December 14 and may include testimony from nearly 120 witnesses. Despite her presence or absence at the remaining hearings, details of her private life are likely to emerge during the proceedings. If proven guilty, Shakira could face jail time. This case follows similar instances of tax evasion involving celebrities and athletes in Spain, including soccer players Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.</description>

			<title>Dogs, robots and sponge bombs: How Israel is tracking and destroying Hamas tunnels</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hamas-terror-tunnels-dogs-robots-sponge-bombs-israel-tracking-destroying-13398122.html</link>
			<description>Israel is intensively targeting Hamas and its tunnel network in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been conducting airstrikes and raids on the Gaza Strip, including at the Al-Shifa Hospital, which they claim houses a Hamas command center. The IDF is determined to destroy the labyrinth of tunnels built by Hamas, known as the "Gaza Metro," which serve as hiding places for militants, weapons storage, and command centers.

To locate these tunnels, Israel is employing various technologies such as surveillance drones, satellites, and ground-penetrating radar. However, the rubble caused by Israeli bombardment may hinder the use of satellite data. Mapping and destroying the tunnels pose additional challenges. The IDF is using attack dogs, unmanned vehicles, and robots to map the tunnels' intricate paths and is avoiding sending troops without prior mapping due to potential booby traps left by Hamas.

To seal off and destroy the tunnels, the IDF is utilizing innovative methods such as exploding gel and sponge bombs that expand rapidly and harden to seal gaps or tunnel entrances. Additionally, the tunnels are equipped with wires and cables for electricity, internet, telephones, and military communication.

Hamas began constructing these tunnels in the mid-1990s, and they have become a vital asset for the group in Gaza, contributing to its strength compared to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The tunnels vary in size and can accommodate cars and trucks, while most are deep enough to resist bunker-busting bombs. They also likely contain observation and detection devices to aid in targeting Israeli forces.

The IDF has already destroyed 130 shafts but did not provide a specific count for demolished tunnels. The ongoing operation aims to dismantle Hamas and its extensive tunnel network in Gaza.</description>

			<title>PM Modi sounds alarm on deepfakes: How can you spot them?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-modi-sounds-alarm-on-deepfakes-how-can-you-spot-them-13399342.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently raised concerns about the growing threat of deepfake technology. Speaking at a BJP event, he mentioned seeing a deepfake video of himself singing at a garba festival, despite not having done so since school. Modi highlighted the lack of a reliable verification system for such media and emphasized the potential crisis it poses in a diverse society like India. Deepfakes are manipulated media, often videos or images, where a person's likeness is replaced with someone else's using artificial intelligence algorithms. They can be difficult to detect, but there are some signs to look for. The Indian government has issued advisories to social media companies to identify and remove deepfakes and misinformation promptly. Additionally, experts suggest staying informed about current affairs and using AI detection tools. The article also mentions instances where deepfakes have been used maliciously, including conning people out of money and targeting women with revenge porn. The government aims to protect citizens, especially women and children, from the harms of deepfakes and calls upon online platforms to take decisive actions against their spread.</description>

			<description>The Cambridge Dictionary has named "hallucinate" as its Word of the Year for 2023. The word gained an additional meaning this year due to its increasing use in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). The new definition refers to when AI systems produce false information, resembling human-like hallucinations. The decision to choose this word reflects the growing interest in AI and the need to understand its limitations. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT often generate convincing but misleading or false information, which is referred to as AI hallucinations. The article emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and human expertise when using these tools. Real-world effects of AI hallucinations have already been observed, such as fictional instances being cited in court and factual errors made by AI tools. The selection of "hallucinate" as the Word of the Year signifies the anthropomorphization of AI technology and our readiness to attribute human-like attributes to it. The dictionary also introduced new entries related to artificial intelligence, such as large language model, generative AI, and GPT.</description>

			<title>Why Osama bin Laden’s ‘Letter to America’ is being endorsed by young Americans on TikTok</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-has-osama-bin-laden-letter-to-america-resurfaced-on-tiktok-why-are-young-americans-backing-it-13398282.html</link>
			<description>An old letter written by Osama bin Laden, titled "Letter to America," has gone viral on social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter. The letter, written a year after the 9/11 attacks, attempts to justify the targeting and killing of American civilians and criticizes the US government's support of Israel. The resurfacing of the letter has sparked a debate about America's support for Israel amidst the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Many young Americans, who make up a significant portion of TikTok users, have posted videos sympathizing with bin Laden's views and expressing how the letter has impacted their perspective on geopolitical matters. TikTok has taken down videos promoting the letter, citing violations of its rules against supporting terrorism. The US government has condemned the trend, considering it an insult to the victims of the 9/11 attacks and denouncing the antisemitic content in bin Laden's letter.</description>

			<title>Different balls, DRS, coin toss: Pakistan’s bizarre conspiracies about India’s World Cup wins</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/different-balls-drs-coin-toss-pakistans-bizarre-conspiracies-about-indias-world-cup-wins-13397622.html</link>
			<description>India has achieved 10 consecutive victories in the 2023 Cricket World Cup, leading up to the final against Australia. This winning streak has sparked conspiracy theories, particularly in Pakistan. Retired Pakistani cricketer Hasan Raza suggested that Indian bowlers might be given different balls by the ICC, resulting in more swing and seam. He also questioned the Decision Review System, claiming that it favored India. Other Pakistani players and journalists echoed these sentiments, with some even bringing up fixed matches. Another conspiracy theory emerged regarding Indian captain Rohit Sharma's coin tosses, suggesting that he threw the coin far away to prevent opposition captains from verifying the call. However, these theories were dismissed by former Pakistani captain Wasim Akram, who deemed them unfounded. Pakistan failed to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, needing a significant victory over England to secure a spot.</description>

			<title>Who is Nimisha Priya, the nurse from Kerala sentenced to death in Yemen?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-nimisha-priya-the-nurse-from-kerala-sentenced-to-death-in-yemen-13396842.html</link>
			<description>Indian nurse Nimisha Priya, who is currently in Yemen, has been sentenced to death for killing a Yemeni national named Talal Abdo Mahdi. The Yemeni Supreme Court has rejected appeals against her death sentence, making it unlikely that she will be able to avoid prison. Priya had asked Mahdi for assistance in opening a clinic in Yemen, but their relationship deteriorated over time. In 2017, Priya gave Mahdi a sedative injection to retrieve her passport, but he died from a drug overdose. She then sought help from another nurse to dispose of his body. Priya and the other nurse were arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 2017, and Priya was later given a death sentence in 2018. Priya's mother and a domestic help from Kerala have appealed to the Delhi High Court to allow them to visit Yemen and negotiate with the deceased's relatives using blood money, which could potentially commute Priya's sentence. However, Priya claims she is unable to pay the required amount. The Indian government is offering consular support but has limited power in the legal matter.</description>

			<title>Why Myanmar’s violence is worrying India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/myanmar-clashes-operation-1027-junta-rebels-india-concern-13397372.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing violence in Myanmar between the military and anti-junta forces. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, made up of ethnic armed groups, launched Operation 1027 to demand the restoration of democracy. They have captured several towns, leading to martial law being declared in certain areas. The Myanmar military has responded with counter-attacks, including shelling towns and using helicopters. This conflict has led to casualties on both sides and the displacement of over 200,000 people. India is concerned about this situation as the rebels are fighting close to the Indian border, and they have captured towns that are important for India's trade routes. Additionally, the rebellion in Chin state has caused an influx of people seeking shelter in Mizoram, a state in India, leading to worries about changing dynamics and potential refugee crises.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the ongoing raids by Israel on Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest hospital, claiming that it housed an underground command center for Hamas. Israel suspected that hostages taken from Israel were hidden in tunnels under the facility. However, after the raid, no hostages were found inside the hospital. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that there were indications of hostages being held at Al-Shifa but claimed they were no longer there when the ground operation was launched. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) discovered the bodies of an Israeli woman, Yehudit Weiss, and a teenage girl, Noa Marciano, near the hospital. Yehudit Weiss was a 65-year-old woman who was kidnapped by Hamas, and Noa Marciano was a 19-year-old woman abducted and murdered by Hamas terrorists. The IDF also uncovered a Hamas tunnel within the hospital complex and found a booby-trapped car with weapons and ammunition nearby. Israel also discovered similar findings in other hospitals in Gaza. Doctors and health officials denied these accusations, while thousands remain trapped inside Al-Shifa Hospital. The situation inside the hospital is worsening, with displaced children lacking basic necessities like water and milk.</description>

			<title>Uttarkashi tunnel collapse: Will 40 trapped workers be rescued in 12-15 hours?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttarkashi-tunnel-collapse-40-trapped-workers-rescue-operations-auger-drilling-machine-time-13396312.html</link>
			<description>A portion of a tunnel under construction in Uttarkashi, India, collapsed, leaving 40 laborers trapped inside for six days. Rescue operations have been underway to find a way through the debris and rescue the workers. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been working tirelessly to establish communication and provide food and oxygen to the trapped workers. A new high-powered auger drilling machine has been brought in to create a passage for the workers to come out. The rescue teams are using the 'trenchless' technique with wide steel pipes. As of the latest report, the machine had drilled 21 meters through the rubble. The NDRF chief expressed hope that the workers would be brought out within the next 12 to 15 hours. However, government officials anticipate the rescue operation could take an additional two to three days. The trapped workers have been supplied with essential provisions but may require physical and mental rehabilitation upon rescue. Doctors are concerned about their well-being due to prolonged confinement and potential health risks. A makeshift health facility and ambulances with doctors have been set up outside the tunnel to provide immediate medical care.</description>

			<title>Why are the polls in Argentina being called the ‘first ever AI election?’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-the-polls-in-argentina-being-called-the-first-ever-ai-election-13394202.html</link>
			<description>Argentina is witnessing its first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered election as the country's presidential candidates, Javier Milei and Sergio Massa, leverage AI technology to promote themselves and attack their opponents. Both candidates are using AI-generated campaign posters to appeal to voters. Massa's team has used AI to depict Milei as unstable by placing his face on characters from movies like Clockwork Orange and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. They have also created a deepfake video showing Milei discussing the concept of a human organ market. Concerns have been raised about the extensive use of AI in elections, with experts warning about the potential for spreading misinformation and the lack of regulations in place. While Argentina is at the forefront of using AI in politics, other countries like the US and India have also seen instances of AI manipulation during elections. Tech giants like Google and Meta are taking steps to curb the spread of AI-generated misinformation by implementing policies that require disclosure of AI-generated content in political ads.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.US President Joe Biden announced that China has agreed to take action to curb the influx of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid responsible for over 70,000 deaths in the previous year. During a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, they discussed various topics including high-level military communication, artificial intelligence, and Taiwan. Fentanyl is a highly potent opioid that is 100 times stronger than morphine and 50 times stronger than heroin. It is commonly used for pain relief and can be prescribed as pills, patches, or injections. Illegally produced fentanyl, often sold as fake prescription medications, has played a major role in overdose deaths in the US. China has been a significant source of fentanyl, but the government banned its production and sale in 2019. However, Chinese vendors have adapted by using online networks and sophisticated shipping methods to continue selling fentanyl analogues and precursor chemicals. Following the meeting, China agreed to crack down on companies producing fentanyl precursors. The agreement aims to combat the global illicit drug trade and establish a working group for ongoing coordination on counter-narcotics issues.</description>

			<title>Will pandas return to the US following Xi Jinping and Joe Biden's talks?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-pandas-return-to-the-us-following-xi-jinping-and-joe-bidens-talks-13393322.html</link>
			<description>During a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit, the two leaders discussed various matters, including the restoration of military communications and the reduction of fentanyl manufacturing. In addition to these topics, President Xi also mentioned China's plan to send new pandas to the United States, referring to them as "envoys of friendship." Pandas have long been used as a diplomatic tool by China to strengthen relationships and foster goodwill. The gesture of sending pandas to the US is seen as a symbol of the friendship between the two countries. The article traces the history of panda diplomacy, starting from when China gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington in 1972. It also highlights how panda exchanges with other countries have coincided with trade agreements and partnerships. The number of pandas in the United States has declined over the years due to worsening US-China relations, but efforts to renew the panda conservation program with the National Zoo are underway.</description>

Cramping has become a common occurrence in the World Cup, with players like Glenn Maxwell also suffering from it. The article explores the causes of cramps, including dehydration, weather conditions, neuromuscular fatigue, and reduced blood flow. Experts suggest preventive measures such as staying hydrated, stretching properly, massage, and taking magnesium or calcium supplements.

			<title>Uttarakhand tunnel collapse: How safe are trapped workers, as rescue op enters Day 5?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-safe-are-workers-trapped-inside-uttarkashi-tunnel-as-rescue-op-enters-day-5-13392242.html</link>
			<description>Rescue and relief operations are underway in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, after a tunnel under construction on the Char Dham Pilgrimage route collapsed, trapping 40 workers inside. The rescue operation has been ongoing for more than 100 hours, with difficulties arising due to an auger machine struggling to clear the debris. The trapped workers are receiving essential supplies through a six-inch pipe, but health problems have started to surface. Workers have complained of headaches and nausea, possibly due to lack of oxygen and the confined space. Concerns have also been raised about mental challenges such as stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depression. Family members of the trapped workers protested against the delay in evacuation. Rescue efforts have been hindered by landslides and technical challenges, but a specialized drilling machine has been brought in to expedite the operation. Indian authorities have sought advice from the Thai company that rescued children from a flooded cave in 2018.</description>

			<title>Personal or political? What’s the reason behind Sonia Gandhi’s temporary shift to Rajasthan?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sonia-gandhi-jaipur-visit-rajasthan-assembly-election-delhi-air-pollution-13393242.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi is currently in Jaipur, Rajasthan for a personal visit. The Congress party has stated that she has shifted base to avoid the deteriorating air quality in Delhi. However, her visit carries political implications as Rajasthan is going to polls on 25 November. The state has a tradition of ousting the incumbent government since the Assembly elections in 1993. Sonia Gandhi's visit is seen as an attempt to fortify Congress' prospects in the state, especially considering their recent decline in opinion polls. Her presence is expected to energize the party cadre and signal to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Deputy Sachin Pilot to give their best. In return, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi will join Sonia for roadshows and public meetings to attract voters. Overall, Sonia's visit aims to boost Congress' chances in Rajasthan, with the party not wanting to be blamed for not trying hard to retain the state.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/al-shifa-hospital-raid-what-has-israel-military-found-are-patients-safe-13392912.html</link>
			<description>Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has been the focus of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israeli forces raided the hospital, claiming that it is being used by Hamas for military purposes. Civilians, including patients, health workers, and displaced people seeking refuge, remain trapped inside the hospital. The Israeli soldiers entered the hospital with tanks and other military vehicles, preventing anyone from leaving. Inside the hospital, Israeli troops reportedly engaged with Hamas members and found an operational command center and weapons belonging to Hamas. The IDF spokesperson stated that Hamas had systematically used the hospital for military operations. Hamas denies these claims and describes them as lies and propaganda. The safety of the patients in the hospital is at risk, as they are without power, water, and oxygen. Doctors have been forced to perform surgeries without proper anesthesia. International organizations have condemned Israel's actions and called for the protection of medical staff and patients. The World Health Organization has deemed the Israeli incursion into the hospital as totally unacceptable.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Houthi movement in Yemen has fired a US drone, raising concerns of a regional escalation after formally declaring war on Israel. The Iran-linked militia, controlling parts of Yemen, vowed to continue assaulting Israel, potentially targeting Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The attacks are seen as a show of support for Hamas and reflect the Houthis' anti-Western sentiment. While most of their attacks have been intercepted by Israeli air defenses, they pose a threat due to the Houthi's growing arsenal of long-range ballistic missiles, smaller cruise missiles, and suicide drones. The strikes could complicate peace talks between the Houthis and the Saudi government.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Subrata Roy, the founder of the Sahara Group, has passed away at the age of 75. He built a massive financial empire starting with a small loan in 1978, but faced numerous legal challenges as the business grew. Despite battling court cases and regulators, Roy continued to expand his empire. The Sahara Group's portfolio included financial services, real estate, hotels, an IPL cricket team, and a Formula One racing team. However, allegations were made that the funds collected by Sahara actually belonged to politicians, cricketers, and Bollywood stars. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) launched a probe into Sahara's activities after receiving complaints about undisclosed convertible bonds. The legal battle between Sahara and SEBI became protracted, eventually leading to Roy being sent to Tihar jail. While the case was ongoing, Sahara continued to collect funds, claiming that all investors received their money back with returns. Eventually, Sahara deposited over ₹24,000 crore with SEBI. Currently, SEBI has managed to refund only about ₹138 crore, while the remaining corpus in SEBI's account exceeds ₹25,000 crore.</description>

			<title>What’s causing a delay in the rescue of 40 trapped labourers in Uttarkashi tunnel?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttarkashi-tunnel-delay-rescue-operations-trapped-labourers-13390012.html</link>
			<description>Forty labourers have been trapped inside a tunnel in Uttarkashi, India for five days. Fellow workers staged a protest at the site of the accident due to the slow pace of rescue operations. The delay in rescuing the trapped labourers is attributed to landslides, loose rocks, and technical problems. The hilly terrain and soft rocks in the region have made digging difficult. The use of an auger machine to install steel pipes failed, prompting the arrival of a new machine from Delhi. Despite the challenges, efforts are being made to provide the trapped workers with food and oxygen through a pipe. Family members remain skeptical about the progress of the rescue operation. Experts question the cause of the tunnel collapse and suggest inadequate investigations and faulty construction practices as potential reasons. Uttarakhand is constructing the 4.5-km tunnel as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Char Dham project.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hamas-headquarters-israel-operation-gaza-al-shifa-hospital-patients-medical-staff-13389412.html</link>
			<description>The Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the largest and most advanced hospital in the Gaza Strip, has ceased functioning due to a lack of power and water supply. Israeli troops from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recently raided the hospital, claiming that Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, was using it as a command center for military operations and hostages. The hospital officials and the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry have denied these allegations. The IDF stated that they are conducting a targeted operation against Hamas inside the hospital based on intelligence information. The raids have put the patients, staff, and displaced civilians seeking shelter at the hospital at risk. The IDF spokesperson referred to the hospital as the "beating heart" of Hamas. Israel claims that Hamas is using hospitals to conceal weapons and operate command centers, while Hamas denies these accusations. The legality of the raids is being questioned, as hospitals are afforded special protections during times of war unless they are being used by combatants to hide fighters or store weapons.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Cyprus Confidential is an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and involved more than 270 journalists from 69 global media outlets. The investigation analyzed 3.6 million leaked documents from six offshore service providers in Cyprus, revealing how the country became a hub for Russian money-laundering and helped Russian billionaires avoid Western sanctions. The investigation highlighted the use of financial services firms on the island by 67 out of 105 Russian billionaires on Forbes' World's Billionaires List to conceal their wealth. The probe also shed light on the financial activities of individuals like Roman Abramovich, who denied his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Alexey Mordashov, a steel magnate who allegedly received assistance from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in transferring assets despite being under EU sanctions. The investigation also uncovered connections between German journalist Hubert Seipel and an oligarch close to Putin, raising concerns about a conflict of interest.

			<description>Chinese experts have issued an alert about a potential increase in COVID-19 infections during the winter season. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported 209 new severe COVID-19 cases and 24 deaths in October, with the prevalent strains being XBB variants. Leading respiratory illness expert Zhong Nanshan warned of a minor COVID-19 surge in the winter and advised vulnerable and elderly populations to get vaccinated. The virus is mutating, and people's ability to fight off the disease is declining. There may also be a rise in COVID-19 cases during the winter, along with high influenza rates. However, there is no need to be overly concerned, and prevention and control measures should still be implemented.</description>

			<title>What does David Cameron’s return mean for British politics?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-david-cameron-return-mean-for-british-politics-pm-rishi-sunak-brexit-foreign-policy-13387482.html</link>
			<description>Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has made a surprising political comeback as the country's new foreign secretary. The move by current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is seen as a risky gamble, as his ruling Conservative Party trails behind the Opposition Labour Party in the opinion polls. Sunak's decision to bring back Cameron is viewed as a desperate attempt to unite the Conservative Party and appeal to moderates. However, critics argue that it may give the impression that Sunak couldn't find enough competent people within his own party. Cameron's return has been labeled as bizarre and desperate by Scotland's political party, the Scottish Greens. The article also highlights that Cameron's appointment comes at a critical time, with looming Brexit challenges, tensions with China, Russia's war in Ukraine, and Israel's conflict with Hamas. Overall, Cameron's political comeback raises questions about the direction of UK politics and the effectiveness of Sunak's leadership.</description>

			<title>Will India become a part of the 19-country club that allows transgenders in the military?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-transgenders-armed-forces-countries-military-action-us-uk-canada-israel-lgbtq-rights-13386082.html</link>
			<description>India is considering allowing the recruitment of transgender individuals into the Armed Forces, joining 19 other countries that already permit trans soldiers. While India has made progress in providing equal rights to the LGBTQ+ community, including allowing women in the military, transgenders are currently not permitted to serve. A study group has been formed to examine the implications and potential challenges of this move. Some concerns include housing, administrative issues, and the impact on opportunities for others. Various countries around the world, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Canada, Israel, the UK, and New Zealand, have already accepted transgender soldiers into their armed forces. The United States has had a complex history with transgender service members, with a ban imposed by former President Donald Trump later reversed by President Joe Biden.</description>

			<title>World Diabetes Day 2023: Is air pollution behind spike in diabetes in India?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/world-diabetes-day-2023-air-pollution-type-2-diabetes-risk-india-13386422.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the link between air pollution and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. After Diwali, air pollution levels spiked in several cities in India, including Delhi and Mumbai. These cities continue to rank among the most polluted in the world. The World Health Organization estimates that over 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, with a significant number in low- and middle-income countries like India. A researcher explains that Indians' susceptibility to diabetes is due to their low body mass index but high proportion of fat. Type 2 diabetes occurs when blood glucose levels are too high, and it is the most common type of diabetes. A study conducted in India found that inhaling polluted air, specifically fine particulate matter (PM2.5), increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. The study analyzed data from over 12,000 adults in Delhi and Chennai from 2010 to 2017 and found that exposure to PM2.5 led to elevated blood sugar levels and a higher risk of diabetes. Experts suggest that air pollution heightens the risk of diabetes through increased oxidative stress and damage to the pancreas's beta cells, which decrease insulin production. Additionally, air pollution has been linked to insulin resistance and inflammation, impacting glucose metabolism and cardiovascular health. The article also mentions the indirect link between air pollution and diabetes, as pollution levels often lead to a sedentary lifestyle due to limited outdoor activities.</description>

			<title>Two uteri, two pregnancies: The very rare case of an American woman</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/two-uteri-two-pregnancies-the-very-rare-case-of-an-american-woman-13385962.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Kelsey Hatcher, a woman from Alabama, has a rare medical condition where she has two uteri and two cervixes. She is currently 34 weeks pregnant and is expecting twins, with one baby in each uterus. This unique pregnancy has attracted attention and has become the focus of a case study. The likelihood of having twins in each uterus is extremely rare, and the pregnancy is considered high risk. A team of experts will be involved in monitoring the delivery procedure, as each uterus may contract at different times. The classification of the newborns is still debated in medicine. Despite the excitement of having two new family members, Kelsey and her husband have decided that this will be their last pregnancy. A double uterus, also known as a double cervix, is a rare condition where the two small tubes that normally unite to create the uterus do not join completely, resulting in separate organs.</description>

			<title>Babies dying, bodies rotting: Inside Gaza’s largest hospital which has stopped functioning</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/babies-dying-bodies-rotting-inside-al-shifa-gaza-largest-hospital-which-has-stopped-functioning-13386142.html</link>
			<description>The situation at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza is dire as Israel's ongoing attack on the Hamas-controlled enclave has led to a healthcare crisis. The hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility, has stopped functioning and essential units have collapsed. Tanks and armored vehicles are positioned near the hospital, trapping thousands of displaced individuals inside. With power cuts and a lack of fuel, the hospital is struggling to save lives. At least 32 patients, including three newborn babies, have died due to the siege and power outage. Babies requiring intensive care are at great risk as incubators are shut off, and doctors resort to wrapping them in foil and keeping them next to hot water for warmth. The lack of electricity, food, water, and equipment further complicates efforts to save newborns. The hospital is overwhelmed, with infants transmitting viruses to each other due to inadequate infection control measures. The dire conditions have left doctors and nurses emotionally and physically exhausted. Alongside the infants, there are around 7,000 people sheltering at the hospital, including patients and medical staff. Bodies are piling up, and dogs have resorted to eating corpses. The World Health Organization warns that the hospital is nearly a cemetery. Israel has accused Hamas of operating a command center under the hospital, but these claims have been denied by Hamas and Gaza health ministry officials who believe it is propaganda to justify attacks on health facilities. Despite international calls for protection, the Israeli onslaught continues.</description>

			<description>A tunnel that was under construction in Uttarkashi district, India, collapsed, leaving 40 laborers trapped inside. The rescue operation is underway, with authorities coordinating efforts to save the workers. Medical experts have highlighted the physical and psychological challenges faced by the trapped laborers. The tunnel, being constructed as part of the Char Dham all-weather road project, aims to shorten the distance between Uttarkashi and Yamunotri town. Past incidents of collapse in the same section caused delays in construction. An investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the collapse. Rescue teams are facing difficulties due to falling debris but have established communication with the trapped workers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami have been monitoring the rescue efforts and assured the availability of resources and technical assistance.

			<title>Why David Cameron is a surprising choice as new UK foreign policy chief</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-david-cameron-is-a-surprising-choice-as-new-uk-foreign-policy-chief-13385332.html</link>
			<description>Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has been named as the foreign secretary, a highly unusual move for a former leader and non-lawmaker. Cameron resigned in 2016 after advocating for Britain to remain in the European Union during the Brexit referendum. He will be appointed to the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament. While Cameron's return to government is not unprecedented, it has raised concerns about accountability. During his tenure, Cameron implemented austerity measures and held the Brexit vote, both of which continue to have a significant impact on the UK. He also fostered closer ties with China, which has since been criticized. Cameron was recently embroiled in a lobbying scandal, prompting calls for tighter regulations. The appointment of Cameron as foreign secretary has been seen as a gamble by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, with some questioning Cameron's accountability as he serves as an appointed Lord rather than an elected lawmaker.</description>

			<title>World Diabetes Day 2023: Does too much salt really enhance the risk of type 2 diabetes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/does-too-much-salt-really-enhance-the-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-13356012.html</link>
			<description>A new study conducted by researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that there may be a link between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study, which followed around 400,000 adults for nearly twelve years, found that approximately 13,000 participants developed type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to note that this study only suggests an association between salt use and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and further research is needed to establish a causal relationship. The study also faced limitations in terms of data quality, as the assessment of salt use was based on a simple question that did not provide detailed information about the amount of salt associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. While reducing salt intake is generally recommended for overall health, it is important to focus on known factors that reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan, China’s naval exercises in Arabian Sea are a security concern for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pakistan-china-naval-exercises-sea-guardian-3-arabian-sea-security-concern-india-13385312.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.China and Pakistan are conducting a joint naval exercise in the northern Arabian Sea called Sea Guardian-3, which is the largest-ever joint exercise between the two countries. The exercise aims to enhance their strategic partnership and defense cooperation. It will involve training courses such as formation maneuvering, search and seizure operations, joint search and rescue, and anti-submarine warfare. Experts believe that China and Pakistan's common interests lie in safeguarding strategic sea lanes and contributing to peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region. The Chinese navy has deployed several assets including a destroyer, frigates, a submarine, and a supply ship, while Pakistan has contributed nine vessels, helicopters, fighter jets, and marines. India has expressed concern about China's increased naval activity in the Indian Ocean and its growing closeness with Pakistan. China's ability to project naval power in distant waters and its establishment of ports in the Indian Ocean region have raised alarm bells for India. Furthermore, China's support in modernizing Pakistan's navy is seen as an attempt to challenge India's naval strength and change the status quo in the region.</description>

			<title>How Britain’s ex-PM David Cameron has returned from political wilderness</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/britain-ex-pm-david-cameron-foreign-secretary-political-wilderness-rishi-sunak-conservative-party-13383982.html</link>
			<description>British prime minister Rishi Sunak surprised the country by appointing former prime minister David Cameron as the new Foreign Secretary. This decision was part of a Cabinet reshuffle that also saw Home Secretary Suella Braverman being replaced by James Cleverly. Cameron, who kept a low profile since his resignation in 2016, returns to politics after working in business and writing his memoirs.

David Cameron rose through the ranks of the Conservative party and became the youngest prime minister in 200 years in 2010, leading a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His tenure was marked by issues such as spending cuts and the divisive Brexit referendum. He campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU but ultimately lost the vote and resigned, handing over power to Theresa May.

The significance of Cameron's return lies in the rarity of a non-lawmaker taking on a senior government post and a former prime minister holding a Cabinet job. Despite previous differences between Cameron and Sunak, the new foreign secretary expressed his support for the prime minister and his desire to be part of a strong team. This unexpected appointment is seen as an opportunity for Sunak to gain attention and bridge divides within the Conservative political family.

While moderates in the party welcome Cameron's inclusion, the Labour party criticized Sunak, calling the move a "last gasp act of desperation." They argue that Cameron's appointment shows a lack of talent and ideas within the government. Overall, Cameron's return is expected to have an impact on the upcoming general election and help Sunak focus on international challenges, given his experience and relationships with world leaders.</description>

			<title>UK PM fires Suella Braverman: The many controversies of the ex-home secretary</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-fires-suella-braverman-controversies-ex-home-secretary-13383762.html</link>
			<description>UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has fired Home Secretary Suella Braverman due to her controversial remarks on the police's handling of pro-Palestinian protesters. Braverman had accused the police of bias and claimed that they were going easy on pro-Palestinian demonstrators while being stern with right-wing protesters. She also faced backlash for defending a proposal to stop charities from providing tents to the homeless, calling homelessness a "lifestyle choice." Additionally, Braverman made comments about asylum seekers pretending to be homosexual or transgender to receive special treatment and stay in the UK, drawing criticism from human rights activists. She also stoked controversy by claiming that child grooming gangs in the UK were mostly British-Pakistani men, which was found to be significantly misleading. Braverman had previously lost her job as home secretary for breaching the ministerial code but was reappointed by Sunak shortly afterward. She also made remarks on Indian immigrants that almost derailed trade deal talks between India and the UK. Braverman is known for her controversial stance on immigration and asylum seekers, including supporting the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda. She has used strong language, referring to the arrival of asylum seekers as an "invasion."</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-did-rishi-sunak-sack-suella-braverman-as-uk-home-secretary-13383882.html</link>
			<description>Suella Braverman, the home secretary of the United Kingdom, has been sacked by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak due to controversial comments she made about the police's handling of a pro-Palestine march. In an article published in The Times, Braverman accused the police of bias and leniency towards pro-Palestinian demonstrators. This led to anger from opposition lawmakers and members of the Conservative Party, prompting Sunak to ask her to leave government. This decision came as part of a major Cabinet reshuffle, with James Cleverly confirmed as the new home secretary and former PM David Cameron returning as foreign secretary. This is not the first time Braverman has been asked to step down from the same position. She had previously resigned in October last year for sending confidential information through a private email address. Braverman's sacking has been welcomed by rivals, while supporters express sadness at her departure. The government hopes that this cabinet reshuffle, including the return of Cameron, will improve the prospects of the Conservative Party.</description>

			<title>What is APEC? What to expect from the summit happening in San Francisco?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-apec-what-to-expect-from-the-summit-happening-in-san-francisco-13382942.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United States is hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco. The main focus of the summit is a meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping, with expectations for announcements and agreements to be made. While Biden aims to manage economic competition and reopen military communication, China wants assurances that the US will not support Taiwan independence. APEC is a forum to promote trade and economic development among nations around the Pacific Ocean. It has been effective in reducing tariffs and easing business relations. However, the trade landscape has changed, with the US focusing on economic competition with China. The summit may face tensions due to the Israel-Hamas war, and there could be political participation intrigue involving Taiwan and Hong Kong. The leaders may not have matching outfits for the traditional "family photo" this year.</description>

			<title>International law protects hospitals during war. Then why is Israel attacking them?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-gaza-hospitals-international-law-al-shifa-al-quds-geneva-conventions-13382722.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The main hospitals in the Gaza Strip, Al Shifa Hospital and Al-Quds, have been forced to shut down due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Shifa has been without water for three days and is no longer functioning as a hospital. This adds to the already dire situation, as 20 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are said to be "no longer functioning." Hospitals in Gaza have become targets of Israeli forces, and the entry of aid has been restricted. Despite Israel offering fuel to Al-Shifa hospital, it was not enough to sustain its operations. The lack of power has caused multiple deaths, with patients in intensive care unable to receive the necessary care. Both Al-Shifa and Al Quds hospitals have run out of power, putting patients' lives at risk. Israel claims that Hamas has military assets under hospitals, justifying their attacks, but international laws state that hospitals should be protected and respected in times of conflict. The Geneva Conventions provide special protection to civilian hospitals, but this protection can be lost if armed groups use the hospital for hostile activities. Israel has faced criticism and pressure to comply with international laws and stop attacking hospitals.</description>

			<title>Keep the burger down: Why has Colombia brought ‘junk food law’?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/colombia-junk-food-law-health-tax-sugary-drinks-obesity-lifestyle-diseases-13382442.html</link>
			<description>Colombia has implemented a "junk food law" that imposes taxes on ultra-processed foods and sugary drinks. The tax will be gradually increased from 10% to 20% by 2025. The law targets ready-to-eat foods high in salt and saturated fat, as well as beverages with high sugar content. Health warnings will also be added to unhealthy products. The aim is to address the country's rising obesity rates, high salt consumption, and non-communicable diseases linked to diet and obesity such as diabetes. While the law is seen as a significant public health measure, there are concerns about its impact on inflation and small businesses. Junk food has been associated with various health risks, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and early death. Studies have also shown links between fast food consumption and conditions like fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome. The article highlights the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle and reducing the consumption of junk food for better overall health.</description>

			<description>Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) are once again battling pollution as residents violated the Supreme Court's firecracker ban during Diwali. As a result, there has been a significant increase in pollutants and the Air Quality Index (AQI) is now at "poor" levels. Delhi recorded a massive 140% jump in PM2.5, the major pollutant affecting lungs and causing health issues. The PM10 levels also rose, with some stations reporting levels 15 to 16 times higher than the 24-hour standard. The AQI remained in the "poor" category on average, but certain areas like Anand Vihar recorded a "hazardous" level of pollution. Despite the ban, firecrackers were burst in various places, and shops openly sold banned fireworks. Authorities are reviewing the pollution situation, but concerns remain about Delhi's air quality.</description>

			<title>How San Francisco is cleaning up its image for the APEC summit</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-san-francisco-is-cleaning-up-its-image-for-the-apec-summit-13381122.html</link>
			<description>San Francisco is preparing to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference, a major meeting of international leaders. The city is making significant efforts to clean up its downtown areas that have been affected by issues such as drug use, homelessness, litter, and crime. Streets are being cleaned, potholes repaired, and police officers deployed to ensure safety during the summit. San Francisco hopes to project an image of being a place for business and investment, aiming to counter the negative perceptions that have arisen in recent years. However, while some areas appear pristine, the underlying problems of drug use and mental illness still persist in certain parts of the city. San Francisco has faced criticism from conservative media outlets and Chinese language media, labeling it as a "mecca of crime" and a "ghost town." City officials view the APEC summit as an opportunity to reshape the narrative about San Francisco and showcase its efforts to address issues like homelessness and drug addiction. They hope that visitors will experience the positive aspects of the city and tell the whole story. The city has also implemented initiatives such as opening a nighttime shelter for homeless people and offering free or reduced rent on empty retail space to encourage business growth. Despite ongoing criticisms, San Francisco's restaurant scene remains vibrant, with numerous upscale eateries attracting customers. Mayor London Breed emphasizes the beauty and activation happening in various neighborhoods and hopes that the true story of San Francisco will be recognized.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In the Erode district of Tamil Nadu, seven villages have been celebrating Diwali without bursting firecrackers for the past 22 years. These villages, located near a bird sanctuary, decided to mark the festival with only lights and no sound to avoid scaring off the winged inhabitants. The sanctuary attracts thousands of local and migratory birds between October and January for breeding. To protect the birds, the more than 900 families living in these villages buy new clothes for their children and only allow them to burn sparklers during Deepavali. This year, the tradition continued, ensuring the safety and tranquility of the birds, with no incidents reported.</description>

			<title>It’s OK if you don’t get 8 hours of sleep every day. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/its-ok-if-you-dont-get-8-hours-of-sleep-every-day-heres-why-13369232.html</link>
			<description>Recent studies have shown that sleep regularity, rather than sleep duration, is crucial for longevity and overall health. Getting six hours of sleep regularly was found to be better for reducing the risk of premature death compared to getting irregular eight hours of sleep. Inconsistent sleep patterns have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other health problems. Individual sleep requirements vary, and while health authorities provide guidelines, each person's unique needs should be taken into account. Quality of sleep is just as important as duration for brain function. Instead of strictly following the eight-hour rule, experts suggest listening to one's body and prioritizing quality sleep.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-week-in-explainers-why-wework-did-not-work-13375502.html</link>
			<description>In this article roundup, several key global stories from the past week are summarized. Here are the main highlights:

2. WeWork, a US startup backed by SoftBank Group Corp, filed for bankruptcy protection. The company's fall was attributed to reduced demand for office space and increasing debt.

3. A new COVID-19 variant called JN.1, a strain of Omicron, has been detected in the US, England, France, Iceland, and Luxembourg.

4. Israel has accused four global media outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, Associated Press, and Reuters, of having prior knowledge of Hamas' October attack. The media organizations have strongly rejected these allegations.

5. The European Union's executive commission has recommended starting formal talks on Ukraine and Moldova becoming member states next year, along with granting candidate country status to Georgia.

6. An Indian man was sentenced to life in prison in Florida for the murder of his wife in 2020.

7. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has stated that Israel would maintain indefinite "overall security responsibility" in Gaza even after crushing Hamas. This could potentially fuel tensions in the region.

8. Japan has acquired a new island due to an underwater volcanic eruption off the coast of Iwo Jima.

These are just the highlights of the article, providing a brief summary of the various news stories covered.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of rules that govern marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and other personal issues applicable to all Indian residents regardless of religious beliefs. A committee led by retired Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai is expected to submit a comprehensive report on the UCC to Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. The state government is considering calling a special session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly to enact the UCC bill. The committee's report emphasizes equal rights for daughters living on ancestral properties and gender equality but does not advocate for raising the age at which women can get married. The proposed laws focus on consistency in personal laws, including child custody, maintenance, divorce, property rights, and inter-state property rights. The draft bill also seeks to ban polygamy and allows live-in couples to register their relationship. The Union government may use the report as a model when developing the UCC Bill for nationwide implementation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made the UCC a prime focus for upcoming elections and aims to promote uniformity and law reform. Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, two other BJP-ruled states, have also initiated the process of implementing the UCC.</description>

			<title>Why brand boycotts won't significantly affect the Israel-Hamas war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-brand-boycotts-wont-significantly-affect-the-israel-hamas-war-13370392.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the boycotts faced by McDonald's, Starbucks, and other western companies over the Gaza conflict. McDonald's faced backlash for providing free meals to the Israel Defense Forces, while Starbucks received boycott calls after expressing solidarity with Palestine. Several American companies, including KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Wix, Puma, Google, and Amazon, are also being targeted for their support of Israel. UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer faced similar calls for running a commercial that resembled the Palestinian flag. Brands with Jewish roots like Danone, Dunkin Donuts, and Netflix have been targeted as well. The article also mentions historical boycotts related to the Middle East and highlights instances of successful and unsuccessful boycotts. It concludes that while the boycotts against American companies have raised awareness about Israel's treatment of Palestinians, they may not have a significant economic impact without coordinated international sanctions.</description>

			<title>How world’s oldest Christian community in Gaza is on brink of extinction</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-worlds-oldest-christian-community-in-gaza-is-on-brink-of-extinction-13376282.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the plight of Gaza's Christian community amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The oldest Christian community in the world, dating back to the first century, is facing the risk of extinction due to the bombing of churches and significant locations. The article highlights the history of Christianity in Gaza and the forced displacement of Palestinians, which led to an influx of Palestinian Christians in the region. It also mentions the recent Israeli airstrike on the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrius, causing the families to seek shelter in the Holy Family Church. Pope Francis has been offering support and condolences to those affected. The article points out that the number of Christians in Gaza has significantly declined over the years, with many leaving for better opportunities elsewhere due to difficulties caused by the conflict. The West Bank's Christian community, although safer, also faces violence and attacks on clergy and churches. The overall threat to the Christian presence in Gaza is emphasized, with some believing that Christianity will cease to exist in the region within this generation.</description>

			<title>How the Michelin Star became the ‘Oscars’ of the culinary world</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-the-michelin-star-became-the-oscars-of-the-culinary-world-13374592.html</link>
			<description>Three Indian chefs have been awarded Michelin Stars for their culinary achievements. Vijaya Kumar of Semma restaurant in New York City, Chetan Shetty of Rania in Washington DC, and Sujan S of Indienne in Chicago were celebrated by renowned chef Vikas Khanna. The Michelin Star is considered the highest level of achievement in the food world, with one star indicating success, two stars signifying excellence, and three stars meaning the restaurant is worth traveling to. The rating is based solely on the quality of the food, as judged by undercover inspectors trained by the Michelin Guide. The Michelin Guide originated as a promotional tool by the Michelin tire company in 1900, evolving into a comprehensive guide to fine dining. While the Michelin Star has its critics, it remains highly regarded in the culinary industry. Although there are no Michelin-starred restaurants in India, several Indian chefs, including Vikas Khanna and Garima Arora, have received this prestigious accolade.</description>

			<title>In graphics | Can artificial rain help reduce Delhi’s air pollution?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-can-artificial-rain-help-reduce-delhis-air-pollution-13376112.html</link>
			<description>The Kejriwal government in Delhi plans to induce artificial rain through cloud seeding to combat air pollution. The air quality in Delhi is still classified as "poor" despite light showers improving the air quality somewhat. The city was the most polluted in the world last week, with dangerous particle levels up to 100 times the acceptable limit. The Delhi government is considering artificial rain as a solution and has agreed to cover the entire cost. IIT-Kanpur is reportedly ready to produce artificial rain through cloud seeding by spraying particles of salts on clouds. The declining air quality in Delhi is due to crop residue burning in neighboring states.</description>

			<title>Is flexible work hours good for your heart health?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-flexible-work-hours-good-for-your-heart-health-13375612.html</link>
			<description>A new study conducted by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Penn State University has found that flexible working can have positive effects on heart health and reduce the risk of cardiac events. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at the impact of work environment on heart health and surveyed employees from an IT company and a long-term care company. The researchers assigned each employee a cardiometabolic risk score (CRS) and found that while flexible work did not improve the employees' CRS overall, it did show reductions in those who started with a higher baseline CRS. Older employees, especially those over 45, were more likely to see a reduction in their heart risk profiles. The study highlights the importance of working conditions and their impact on health, particularly for low- and middle-wage workers who have less control over their schedules and job demands. Overall, the study suggests that implementing flexible work policies could be beneficial for employees' heart health.</description>

			<title>What is 'Fried Rice Syndrome', a condition that food experts warn about?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-fried-rice-syndrome-a-condition-that-food-experts-warn-about-13374052.html</link>
			<description>"Fried rice syndrome," a type of food poisoning caused by the bacteria Bacillus cereus, has returned to public attention after an incident involving the death of a student who consumed noodles left unattended for five days. The bacteria can multiply when food is left unrefrigerated for long periods of time. The term "fried rice syndrome" originated from the first documented cases connected to cooked white rice that wasn't refrigerated and was subsequently used to make fried rice dishes at restaurants. The bacteria thrives in pre-cooked starchy foods like rice and pasta, and its ideal growth temperature range is between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The symptoms of the syndrome resemble other gastrointestinal disorders, and treatment usually involves hydration and rest. To prevent food poisoning, it is advised to avoid eating leftovers and to ensure proper storage and cooling of cooked food.</description>

			<title>Diwali 2023: Are green crackers really ‘eco-friendly’?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/diwali-2023-green-crackers-eco-friendly-supreme-court-order-fireworks-air-pollution-13374482.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has allowed the use of "green crackers" during the Diwali festival to address concerns about air pollution. Green crackers are considered eco-friendly and cause less air and noise pollution compared to traditional fireworks. They were developed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and have smaller shells, no ash, and reduced usage of raw materials. These crackers also release water vapor, which acts as a dust suppressant. There are three types of green crackers: SWAS, SAFAL, and STAR. Experts, however, are skeptical about their environmental friendliness, as even with a 30% reduction in particulate matter levels, the pollution caused by these crackers would still be high. Some manufacturers claim that green crackers cannot function without barium, which contradicts the requirements set by NEERI. The effectiveness of the restrictions on firecrackers and the clarity on the production of green crackers remain questionable. It is advisable to celebrate Diwali with candles and diyas instead of fireworks if unsure about the green credentials of the crackers.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Singles' Day, the world's largest shopping festival in China, is losing its shine as consumers plan to spend less this year. The event originated in 1993 at Nanjing University and has since become a weeks-long online shopping bonanza. Last year, the total value of goods sold during Singles' Day reached $157.97 billion, surpassing American shoppers' spending during Cyber Week. However, the festival's popularity has waned due to the nation's economic challenges and complicated terms and discounts. This year, e-commerce sites are offering extremely low pricing to attract consumers. Despite the decline, industry experts expect a rebound in sales due to improving economic conditions and robust livestream sales.</description>

			<description>Starting next month, Google will delete millions of Gmail accounts to prevent security threats. The accounts that are at risk are those that have not been opened in two years. Google has been sending notifications to inactive accounts, and users can prevent their accounts from being deleted by logging in once every two years. Users can also save their data by downloading and exporting it through Google's Takeout feature. This action by Google is similar to Twitter, which is also removing inactive accounts. Elon Musk's company, X, is reportedly preparing to sell old and defunct Twitter handles.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-qatar-has-become-indispensable-in-the-israel-hamas-war-13373052.html</link>
			<description>The United States and Israel are working with Qatar to negotiate a potential humanitarian pause in the Israel-Hamas war. The CIA director, Mossad head, and Qatar officials are discussing a three-day pause to release civilian hostages held by Hamas and allow more aid into the besieged Gaza Strip. Qatar has played a significant role in securing the release of hostages and facilitating the passage of foreigners and injured individuals out of Gaza. Qatar's position as a mediator is due to its close relationship with Hamas and its ability to communicate with the group. Qatar has also provided financial support to Palestinians in Gaza and has been involved in previous negotiations, such as the release of prisoners and hosting peace talks. Despite the challenges, Qatar aims to establish itself as a diplomatic player and promote peace in the region.</description>

			<title>Breather from Toxic Air: How the rain in Delhi improved its AQI</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/breather-from-toxic-air-how-the-rain-in-delhi-improved-its-aqi-13371832.html</link>
			<description>Light to moderate rain showers were observed in Delhi and surrounding regions, providing some relief from the severe air pollution. The timing of the rainfall is significant as the city government plans to use cloud seeding for artificial rain. The air quality index (AQI) improved in various areas after the rain, with some locations moving from the severe category to the moderate or satisfactory categories. Rain is known to help cleanse the air by capturing and removing pollutants like particulate matter. However, its impact on pollution is more significant for larger particles. The Delhi government aims to implement artificial rain through cloud seeding technology to address air pollution. Factors such as wind speed and temperature also play a role in improving AQI. Wind can aid in dispersing particulate matter, while temperature inversion can trap pollutants near the ground. Efforts are being made to tackle air pollution in different regions of India, including addressing stubble burning and implementing measures to curb pollution in Mumbai.</description>

			<title>How Israel is using birds in their search for Hamas attack victims</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-israel-is-using-birds-in-their-search-for-hamas-attack-victims-13372102.html</link>
			<description>An environmentalist in Israel is using birds of prey, such as eagles and vultures, to assist the army in locating dead bodies. Ohad Hatzofe of Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority tracks the migration patterns of these birds using GPS devices. The data collected by Hatzofe has helped locate four corpses so far. Birds of prey have a strong sense of smell and can detect dead bodies from a distance. The idea to involve these birds in the search for human remains came from a unit within the Israeli army responsible for locating missing soldiers. The program led by Hatzofe tracks endangered griffon vultures, eagles, and other birds of prey to study their migratory patterns, feeding habits, and environmental challenges. One of the tracked birds, a sea eagle, was found near Beeri, just outside the Gaza Strip, and its data led to the recovery of four bodies. Dozens of people are still missing after a Hamas attack on Beeri, which resulted in numerous casualties. The use of birds of prey has aided in locating bodies and providing closure for families affected by the conflict.</description>

			<title>Ethics panel recommends Mahua Moitra’s Lok Sabha expulsion: What happens next?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mahua-moitra-lok-sabha-ethics-committee-expulsion-future-cash-for-query-scam-13371812.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recommendation of the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee to expel Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra from Parliament in the cash-for-query scam. The report was approved in a split verdict, with six members voting in favor and four members against the recommendation. Moitra and the dissenting members of the committee criticized the probe for being conducted hastily and lacking propriety. Moitra denied the allegations and called the committee a "kangaroo court." The report condemned Moitra for unethical conduct and sharing her Lok Sabha log-in credentials with businessman Darshan Hiranandani. The panel recommended severe punishment and urged the government to conduct an institutional inquiry. Moitra argued that she was not given a fair chance to defend herself and criticized the leak of the report to the media. The next steps involve presenting the report to the Speaker, who will table it in the House. A debate may take place, and if a motion for voting on Moitra's expulsion is passed, she will be expelled from the House. Moitra can challenge this decision in court. The incident has also prompted the Ethics Committee to recommend the framing of new rules to check unruly conduct of MPs. This is the first instance of the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee recommending the expulsion of an MP.</description>

			<title>Why people in Pakistan are unable to get new passports</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-people-in-pakistan-are-unable-to-get-new-passports-13371822.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the ongoing shortage of lamination papers in Pakistan, which has resulted in significant delays in passport issuance. Despite being warned about the shortage, passport offices continue to receive applications, causing a backlog of unprinted passports. The shortage is affecting thousands of Pakistanis who are unable to obtain new passports, jeopardizing their plans to travel abroad for study, work, or vacation. The Directorate General of Immigration and Passports has extended the delivery period for passports due to the increase in applications. The backlog of unprinted passports is estimated to be around seven lakh. The shortage is primarily attributed to economic woes faced by citizens, leading them to seek job opportunities abroad. Additionally, the relaxation of travel restrictions has encouraged more people to travel for religious or tourism purposes. The inefficiency of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports has frustrated applicants, with some having to cancel their plans due to the unavailability of passports. The government is working to resolve the issue and minimize the backlog, but there is uncertainty about when the situation will improve.</description>

			<title>Can smartwatch save lives by detecting heart attacks?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-smartwatch-save-lives-by-detecting-heart-attacks-13370832.html</link>
			<description>A 42-year-old man in the UK, Paul Wapham, used his smartwatch to call his wife when he experienced chest pain during a run. His wife rushed him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a heart attack caused by a blocked artery. This incident highlights how smartphones and smartwatches can play a role in saving lives and improving users' health by monitoring heart rate and detecting irregularities. Other incidents include a woman in the US whose Apple Watch warned her about an increased heart rate, leading to the diagnosis of a severe condition, and a Reddit user whose mother's Apple Watch automatically called emergency services after she collapsed from a ruptured aorta. Smartwatches from companies like Apple, Samsung, Withings, Fitbit, and AliveCor are equipped with features to record heart rate, physical activity, and even perform electrocardiograms (ECG). While they are not as accurate as hospital ECG machines, they can detect fluctuations in heartbeat and prompt users to seek medical care. Studies have shown that ECG monitors on smartwatches are 93% - 95% accurate at identifying different types of heart attacks. However, experts caution that more research is needed before fully relying on smartwatches for early detection of heart attacks. There are concerns that people may be unnecessarily worried about minor heart arrhythmias and seek unnecessary testing and treatment. Smartwatches should be seen as supplementary devices and not replacements for medical tests conducted in healthcare settings.</description>

			<title>In Bihar, reservation now at 75%. What about Supreme Court's 50% cap?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-bihar-reservation-now-at-75-what-about-supreme-courts-50-cap-13370892.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar Assembly recently passed a bill increasing reservation for deprived castes from 50 to 60 percent in government jobs and educational institutions, bringing the total reservation in Bihar to 75 percent. This decision by the Bihar government goes beyond the 50 percent cap on reservation set by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1992 judgment in the Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case, also known as the Mandal Commission verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that reservation for the backward class should be capped at 50 percent and that economic backwardness alone cannot be a criteria for reservation. Since the 1992 verdict, several states, including Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and now Bihar, have passed laws to exceed the 50 percent cap. In 2019, the Centre also introduced a 10 percent reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) over and above the existing 50 percent reservation for SCs, STs, and OBCs. The Supreme Court upheld the 103rd Constitution Amendment of 2019, which introduced the EWS reservation, in a ruling in November 2022. The Bihar government's decision to increase reservation to 75 percent is based on a comprehensive caste survey conducted by the Nitish Kumar government. The survey provided data that will be used to introduce more measures for the upliftment of socially, educationally, and economically backward sections of society in Bihar.</description>

			<title>Shrinking waists, not pockets: Dangerous growth of weight-loss drug market</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ozempic-wegovy-zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-dangerous-growth-obesity-world-problem-13369852.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the approval of a new weight-loss drug called Zepbound by the FDA. The drug is developed by Eli Lilly and contains the same active ingredient as their diabetes treatment, Mounjaro. Zepbound works by activating hormones in the body that slow down stomach emptying, making people feel full for longer and suppressing appetite. However, it carries risks such as gastrointestinal issues. Zepbound will join other weight-loss drugs in the market, including Ozempic and Wegovy, which have seen high demand and sales. The obesity drug market is expected to grow significantly, with predictions of it becoming a $100 billion industry by 2030. The rise of these drugs may also impact the food and pharmaceutical industries, as consumers make more nutritious choices and opt for weight-loss drugs instead of certain medications.</description>

The attacker, Jordan Andrade, claimed that he found Pucha "a little weird" and considered him a threat. Andrade attacked Pucha with a knife, stating that he reacted in self-defense. Pucha was taken to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries. The incident has raised concerns about hate crimes in the US. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported an increase in hate crime incidents motivated by bias in 2022 compared to the previous year. Anti-Black and anti-African-American hate crimes topped the list, followed by incidents against Jews. The university where Pucha studied offered condolences to his family and pledged support during this difficult time.</description>

			<title>India has most number of TB cases in world: What’s going wrong?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-has-most-number-of-tb-cases-in-world-whats-going-wrong-13370232.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the findings of the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2023 Global Tuberculosis (TB) report, with a focus on the situation in India. The report reveals that around 7.5 million people were diagnosed with TB worldwide in 2022, and the number of people falling sick with TB increased to 10.6 million. However, there has been a "significant worldwide recovery" in the scale-up of TB diagnosis and treatment services in 2022. India, along with Indonesia and the Philippines, accounted for over 60% of the global reductions in newly diagnosed TB cases in 2020 and 2021. The report also highlights that multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis. In India, MDR-TB accounts for 2.5% of new cases and 13% of previously treated cases. The article mentions that India has made progress in improving case detection and reducing TB mortality, but it still has a long way to go in achieving the goals set by the WHO. The cost of treatment and the detection of MDR-TB are identified as challenges in India's fight against TB.</description>

			<title>What happens once Israel dismantles Hamas in Gaza? The possibilities explained</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-happens-once-israel-dismantles-hamas-in-gaza-the-possibilities-explained-13369762.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the evolving plans for Israel's security role in the Gaza Strip following its intensified campaign against Hamas militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed the intention to maintain overall security responsibility in Gaza once Hamas is removed from power. However, the article highlights that this could be seen as a form of military occupation by the Palestinians and the international community, potentially complicating efforts to hand governing responsibility to the Palestinian Authority or friendly Arab states.

The presence of Israeli forces in Gaza is likely to fuel an insurgency, similar to the period from 1967 to 2005 when two Palestinian uprisings occurred, leading to the rise of Hamas. The United States, Israel's biggest ally, acknowledges these consequences but suggests that Israel might control the territory for a transition period.

There is currently no long-term plan for Gaza, according to Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's War Cabinet. Any plan would have to address Israel's security needs and aim to replace the Hamas regime while ensuring security superiority for Israel.

The article also provides historical context, mentioning that Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War. After decades of military rule, the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority as an autonomous government in the West Bank and Gaza. However, the Palestinian Authority lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, leaving it with administrative powers and Israel with overall security control.

Various suggestions are discussed, including maintaining an over-the-horizon presence with moderate Palestinians handling security inside Gaza and Israeli intervention only when necessary. Another option is creating a buffer zone along the border or considering the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. The article references the lessons learned from Israel's experiences in Lebanon and the challenges it faced after withdrawing its forces.

Ultimately, the future of Gaza and its residents remains uncertain, with mixed messages from Israel about its plans for the region.</description>

			<title>Why do Indians like buying gold? Should you invest this Dhanteras?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-do-indians-like-buying-gold-should-you-invest-this-dhanteras-13368802.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the tradition of Indians buying gold on Dhanteras, a Hindu festival. Indians have a strong affinity for gold, considering it a safe investment and a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. Gold has historically performed well and provided good returns over the years. It is also seen as a fashion statement, a status symbol, and a way to preserve sentimental value associated with happy occasions. Dhanteras is considered an auspicious day to buy gold because it is believed that Goddess Lakshmi blesses people with wealth and well-being on this day. Jewellers often offer discounts during Dhanteras. However, experts recommend that gold should not make up more than 10 to 15 percent of an investor's portfolio.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Mumbai continues to suffer from bad air quality, ranking among the top 10 most polluted cities worldwide. After light rains, the air quality improved to a moderate level, but some areas still experienced very poor air quality. Several factors contribute to Mumbai's air pollution crisis, including slow coastal winds that trap pollutants, ongoing construction, high vehicular emissions, and lingering monsoon conditions. This decline in air quality has led to an increase in respiratory issues, especially among vulnerable groups. The authorities have taken steps to address the problem by cracking down on violators of air pollution norms and urging citizens to refrain from bursting firecrackers during Diwali.</description>

			<title>How the world’s newest island was formed in Japan this October</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-the-worlds-newest-island-was-formed-in-japan-this-october-13368632.html</link>
			<description>A new island has emerged in the Pacific Ocean near Japan's Iwo Jima island. The island was formed by an underwater volcanic eruption, according to Japan's Meteorological Agency. The island is located about 1,200 kilometers south of mainland Japan and is part of the Ogasawara Island group. Volcanic tremors and eruptions have been occurring since October, with the formation of the new island observed on November 1st. Experts believe that the island formed as a result of multiple eruptions, with magma building up beneath the surface before breaking through. It is uncertain whether the eruption will continue or if the new island will merge with Iwo Jima. Similar geological events have occurred in the past, with new islands forming but eventually eroding away due to erosion.</description>

			<title>How Japanese gangs are using social media for recruitment</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-japanese-gangs-are-using-social-media-for-recruitment-13368332.html</link>
			<description>Japan's criminal underworld is utilizing social media platforms to recruit individuals, including teenagers and retirees, for illegal activities. These recruits, often low-income citizens, are enticed by the promise of financial gain. One such individual, Risa Yamada, stumbled upon a job listing on social media and was hired to impersonate a police officer. She successfully obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars from Japan's elderly population through phone scams. The proliferation of online platforms, including encrypted messaging apps like Telegram and Signal, allows criminal gangs to connect with potential recruits anonymously. Damage caused by these illegal operations has increased by 30% in 2022, amounting to over 37 billion yen. The anonymity offered by social media platforms enables criminals to assemble groups for robberies and fraud schemes effortlessly. Recruits receive instructions via messaging apps and are rewarded for their work without feeling guilty because they don't physically interact with anyone. The consequences of these crimes became evident when a 90-year-old woman was assaulted and killed by individuals hired through online advertisements. These criminal organizations exploit and dispose of their recruits, using them as pawns. Police have been working to remove criminal ads from social media platforms and have offered rewards for information on these gangs. Only a small percentage of those arrested for organized fraud held high-ranking gang positions. The article highlights personal accounts of individuals who engaged in criminal activities for financial gain and the subsequent consequences they faced.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-gaza-civilians-are-holding-white-flags-as-they-flee-israeli-assault-13368442.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israel has intensified its ground campaign and airstrikes on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, forcing thousands of Palestinians to flee. Videos show civilians carrying luggage and waving white flags as they walk to the south of Gaza for safety. The white flag has historically been associated with surrender in times of conflict. In recent times, it has been used by Iraqi soldiers in the 2003 Iraq war when surrendering to US troops. However, waving white flags has not always guaranteed safety, as Israeli soldiers reportedly killed Palestinian civilians waving white flags during Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009. The IDF has urged Gazans to move south for weeks, but Hamas claims that Israeli airstrikes have hit both the north and south of Gaza. The UNRWA has warned that relief operations may cease due to a lack of fuel supplies, putting thousands at risk.</description>

			<title>What is regenerative agriculture? Is it the answer to stubble burning?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-regenerative-agriculture-is-it-the-answer-to-stubble-burning-13366942.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the issue of declining air quality in Delhi, primarily due to stubble burning and vehicle emissions. Businessman Anand Mahindra has highlighted the importance of regenerative agriculture as a solution to tackle pollution. Regenerative agriculture focuses on improving soil health, mitigating negative environmental effects, and increasing farm productivity and profitability. It involves practices like limiting ploughing, using compost and animal dung, and crop rotation. By adopting regenerative farming methods, farmers can reduce the need for stubble burning, enhance soil fertility, and combat pollution. The article also mentions that regenerative agriculture can address the looming food crisis and help multinational companies achieve their sustainability goals. Additionally, it explains how soil health is linked to pollution and the significance of restoring agricultural land through regenerative farming. The severity of Delhi's pollution is highlighted, with the air quality index reaching the "severe" category.</description>

			<title>How the abortion vote in Ohio may affect Joe Biden's 2024 campaign</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-the-abortion-vote-in-ohio-may-affect-joe-bidens-2024-campaign-13367172.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Ohio residents have voted in favor of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution, with 56.1% voting in favor and 43.9% against. This comes after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade last year. The inclusion of abortion rights in the constitution means that the state's proposed restriction on abortions after six weeks cannot be implemented. Advocates for abortion access are now focusing on the 2024 election and whether the issue can help President Joe Biden overcome likely opponent Donald Trump. The wins for Democrats and abortion-rights campaigners in Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia were seen as a boost for Biden's re-election campaign. However, recent polls have shown Biden trailing Trump, and concerns about his age and inflation persist among voters. Democrats hope to use the highly emotional issue of abortion as a central weapon in their strategy for the 2024 election.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra is facing possible expulsion from the Lok Sabha, as the Ethics Committee has labeled her conduct in the cash-for-query scandal as "unethical" and "heinous." The committee has recommended her disqualification from the House. The 500-page report accuses Moitra of sharing parliamentary credentials with unauthorized individuals and accepting cash and amenities from businessman Darshan Hiranandani. The panel also suggests that the government should investigate the money trail between Moitra and Hiranandani. While the committee's findings will be presented to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, there may be a dissent note from Congress members of the panel. Moitra has denied any wrongdoing and criticized the line of questioning during the hearing. The Speaker will ultimately decide whether to expel Moitra. If expelled, it could lead to further confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition, and Moitra may pursue legal action.</description>

			<title>No online classes and more... The new rules for foreign universities in India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/no-online-classes-and-more-the-new-rules-for-foreign-universities-in-india-13366742.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The University Grants Commission (UGC) in India has announced regulations for foreign universities to establish and operate campuses in the country. These rules grant autonomy to foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) in terms of their admission processes and fee structures, while the UGC retains the authority to monitor their operations. The aim is to bring an international dimension to higher education in India and ensure that the education provided by these campuses is on par with the main campuses of the respective universities. Foreign institutions seeking to establish campuses in India should meet certain criteria, including securing a position within the top 500 in global rankings and possessing expertise in a particular area. The regulations also state that foreign universities cannot offer programs online or in open and distance learning modes, but they can provide up to 10% of lectures in online mode. Collaboration between multiple universities to set up campuses in India is allowed, and foreign institutions are not required to pay annual fees to the UGC. They can provide scholarships and fee concessions to Indian students. Prior approval from the UGC is necessary for starting new courses, and campuses have autonomy in recruiting faculty and staff.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article discusses the increasing trend of aging political leaders in the United States. It highlights that both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are among the oldest individuals to have served as president. The average ages in the House of Representatives and Senate are also quite high, leading to the term "gerontocracy" being used to describe the governing class. Various reasons for this trend are explored, including financial security, denial of mortality, identity tied to their jobs, and ego. The article suggests the possibility of imposing age limits or mandatory mental competency tests for elected leaders. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of electing younger leaders and passing the torch to a new generation.</description>

			<title>Are Ukraine, Moldova a step closer to becoming European Union members?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-ukraine-moldova-a-step-closer-to-becoming-european-union-members-13366292.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The European Union's executive commission has recommended that detailed negotiations for Ukraine and Moldova to join the bloc can begin next year, and has proposed offering candidate status to Georgia. The recommendation comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his country's desire to join the EU. The European Commission stated that Ukraine should satisfy remaining conditions related to fighting corruption, adopting lobbying laws in line with EU standards, and strengthening national minority safeguards before formal accession talks can begin. The EU has also endorsed the formation of an "accession fund" worth €6 billion, which would provide payments to countries in line for membership twice a year, contingent on carrying out reforms. Georgia must also meet several conditions, including aligning with EU foreign policy sanctions against Russia, pushing back against disinformation and political polarization, and ensuring a free and fair election in 2024. The recommendation for Moldova to join the EU has also been made, with the country being described as a "frontrunner" for membership. The commission has also suggested that membership talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina should begin once certain conditions are met. The final decision on these recommendations will be made by the 27 national EU leaders in mid-December, with unanimity required. The process of joining the EU can take up to a decade, and the countries must fulfill various conditions related to reforms and alignment with EU standards.

**Key Points:**
- The European Union's executive commission has recommended that detailed negotiations for Ukraine and Moldova to join the EU can begin next year.

			<title>Hate returning to the office? This new workplace trend, coffee badging, is for you</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/coffee-badging-workplace-trend-return-to-office-hr-managers-hybrid-working-13364712.html</link>
			<description>The latest work trend called "coffee badging" is gaining attention, but not for positive reasons. Coffee badging involves employees showing up at the office, grabbing a coffee, socializing briefly with colleagues, and then leaving. It is a form of presenteeism where employees make a brief appearance at the office to earn recognition without actually being productive. A recent report found that 58% of hybrid workers in the US have engaged in coffee badging. The practice is seen as a subtle form of protest against returning to the office and can create a toxic work culture. Employees may feel pressured to be physically present in order to be noticed and rewarded. Coffee badging can also lead to reduced collaboration and undermine work culture. Managers are concerned about the impact of this trend on productivity and employee engagement. To address coffee badging, companies should offer more flexible work models and encourage open communication between employees and employers.</description>

			<title>From Starbucks to Google: How big brands are caught in the Israel-Hamas war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-starbucks-row-google-employees-big-brands-response-gaza-attack-13365292.html</link>
			<description>The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has led to companies facing backlash and being caught in the politics of the war. Luxury fashion brand Dior received criticism on social media after reports emerged that it replaced Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid with Israeli model May Tager in its latest ad campaign. Turkey's Parliament reportedly removed Coca-Cola and Nestle products from menus due to their alleged support for Israel, marking the first time a government or major organization has targeted global brands over the conflict. UK-based retail brand Marks and Spencer faced outrage for posting a photo on Instagram of Christmas party hats in the colors of the Palestinian flag burning in a fireplace, leading to an apology and removal of the post. Starbucks faced calls for boycotts after its union expressed solidarity with Palestinians, leading to a lawsuit between the company and the union. McDonald's also faced criticism after one of its Israel-based franchises offered free food to personnel of the Israeli military, while McDonald's Malaysia donated funds for humanitarian aid in Gaza. Companies in the United States have been pressured to respond to the conflict, with employees at Google and Amazon calling on their bosses to take a public stand. The conflict has evoked divisions among employees, with Arab and Muslim workers feeling dismissed while Jewish employees worry about rising antisemitism. Companies are struggling to find a stance that is accepted by both sides, as they face criticism for being either too pro-Israeli or sympathetic towards Palestinians. This article also mentions how companies responded during the Russia-Ukraine war, with many suspending sales or closing operations in Russia due to pressure and sanctions.</description>

			<title>Trump leading Biden in polls: Could the Republican return to the White House?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/trump-leading-biden-in-polls-could-the-republican-return-to-the-white-house-13365172.html</link>
			<description>According to a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll, President Joe Biden is trailing former President Donald Trump in nearly every swing state, raising concerns among Democrats about the possibility of Trump being re-elected in 2024. The swing states in question include Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan, which account for a significant number of electoral votes. The poll shows that Biden is leading only in Wisconsin, while Trump has an average lead of 48% to 44% in the other states [[SOURCE 1]].

The polls also indicate that registered voters have concerns about Biden's age and his handling of the economy. A majority of those polled, including 71% of registered voters and 54% of Biden's own supporters, believe that Biden is "too old." Additionally, swing state voters favor Trump over Biden when it comes to handling the economy, with a 59% to 37% margin [[SOURCE 1]].

Furthermore, the polls suggest that Biden's multiracial and multigenerational coalition may be weakening. Young voters, who heavily supported Biden in the 2020 election, now only favor him by a slim margin of one percent. Biden's advantage with Hispanic voters has also decreased to single digits. In addition, black voters, a core demographic for Biden, are registering 22% support for Trump in these swing states, which is unprecedented for a Republican candidate [[SOURCE 1]].

Despite these poll results, it is important to note that the 2024 election is still a year away, and predictions made at this stage may not accurately reflect the final outcome. Experts caution against panicking based on early polls and emphasize that the economy and other factors can significantly influence voter perceptions over time. The Biden camp remains confident and points to past examples where polls underestimated the eventual outcome, such as Barack Obama's victory in 2012 [[SOURCE 1]].

In conclusion, while recent polls show Biden trailing Trump in swing states and raise concerns about his age and handling of the economy, it is too early to make definitive predictions about the 2024 election. The polls serve as a warning to Democrats about the work they need to do to maintain support and address concerns among key voter groups. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the state of the economy and how voters perceive the candidates in the coming months [[SOURCE 1]].</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure about the specific details of Chen Shaojie's disappearance or the investigation into DouYu. For more information, you may need to refer to reliable news sources or official statements.Chen Shaojie, the CEO of Chinese livestreaming service DouYu, has gone missing for several weeks. DouYu, which is backed by Tencent and has a market capitalization of $268 million, is often compared to Amazon's Twitch. Chen founded DouYu in 2014, and the platform has around 50 million monthly users. The company went public in 2019 with a $4 billion valuation but has since seen its value shrink to under $300 million. Tencent owns 38 percent of DouYu. Chen's disappearance was first reported by state-owned Cover News, stating that he has been detained in relation to an inquiry into porn and gambling on DouYu, both of which are illegal in China. There has been no official confirmation of his detention. This incident is one among many high-profile businessmen going missing in China as President Xi Jinping tightens his grip on power. Livestreaming platforms in China have faced scrutiny from authorities over concerns about immoral content, leading to investigations and crackdowns.</description>

			<title>AQI at Delhi’s Anand Vihar touches 999 again. How hazardous is this for health?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-anand-vihar-aqi-999-hazardous-for-health-air-pollution-13364102.html</link>
			<description>Delhi is once again experiencing severe air pollution as the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached the 'severe' level. The situation is particularly critical in Anand Vihar, where the AQI recorded a staggering 999. This level of pollution poses significant health risks to residents, with even healthy individuals vulnerable to respiratory issues. Experts compare the current air quality to smoking 25-30 cigarettes a day. An AQI of 500 indicates the worst air quality and has severe health impacts. However, some stations in Delhi cannot report beyond 999 on the pollution measurement metric. Anand Vihar's high pollution levels can be attributed to factors such as vehicular pollution, dust, emissions from nearby industries, and the Ghazipur landfill. The primary pollutant in the area is PM10. The hazardous particulate matter PM2.5 and other pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone further increase the risk of respiratory problems and other health issues. The situation calls for immediate action to address this ongoing environmental crisis.</description>

This variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant, also called 'Pirola,' which originated from Omicron. JN.1 has undergone a mutation that allows it to bind more strongly to human cells and increase transmissibility. It was first detected in Luxembourg and has since been found in several other countries. While JN.1 currently accounts for less than 0.1% of COVID-19 cases, experts believe it could become more prevalent, especially during the upcoming winter season. However, current vaccines are expected to be effective against this variant, as they target the spike protein that JN.1 possesses. Scientists emphasize the importance of a layered approach, including vaccination and mitigation strategies, to combat evolving variants. The emergence of JN.1 before winter has raised concerns due to historical surges in COVID-19 cases during colder months. The World Health Organization has warned of concerning trends and urged increased vaccinations and surveillance. Overall, while JN.1 presents some risks, experts believe that existing measures can help protect against severe disease.</description>

			<title>What is ptosis, the eye condition that Zeenat Aman has been battling for decades?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-ptosis-the-eye-condition-that-zeenat-aman-has-been-battling-for-decades-13362952.html</link>
			<description>Veteran actor Zeenat Aman recently shared her struggle with a health condition called ptosis. She explained that the condition is a result of an injury she sustained many decades ago, which damaged the muscles around her right eye. Ptosis, also known as "droopy eyelid" or "blepharoptosis," is characterized by the sagging or drooping of the upper eyelid, potentially obstructing vision. It can affect one or both eyelids and vary in severity. The causes of ptosis can include age-related changes, muscle weakness, nerve damage, or congenital factors. Treatment options depend on the cause and severity and may include medication, plastic surgery, or the use of glasses or eyedrops. While there is no way to prevent ptosis, regular eye exams are recommended.</description>

			<title>Can deepfakes be regulated? Which countries have laws to curb such content?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rashmika-mandanna-katrina-kaif-deepfakes-laws-india-us-china-europe-13363342.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has issued an advisory to social media platforms regarding deepfake content after a video featuring actress Rashmika Mandanna went viral. The government has highlighted the legal provisions that cover such content, including Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, which covers punishment for cheating by personation using computer resources. India's laws for copyright protection can also be used against individuals creating deepfakes using copyrighted works. However, there is a growing need for specific legislation to tackle the challenges posed by deepfakes, especially in cases related to pornography.

China has introduced regulations around deepfakes, requiring users' consent for the use of their images and prohibiting the dissemination of fake news. South Korea has made it illegal to distribute deepfakes that could cause harm to public interest, with offenders facing imprisonment or fines. In the United States, there is no national legislation specifically addressing deepfakes, but a bill called the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act has been introduced to protect individuals from deceptive political messages and deepfake pornography. The UK, Australia, France, and the European Union are also considering or implementing laws to combat deepfake content.

The recent incidents of deepfake videos have highlighted the dangers of synthetic media, particularly in the context of adult content featuring Indian actresses. India is ranked as the sixth most vulnerable country to deepfake pornography according to a State of Deepfakes report.</description>

			<title>How Mumbai's air pollution is sending people to respiratory ICU</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-mumbais-air-pollution-is-sending-people-to-respiratory-icu-13362242.html</link>
			<description>The air quality in Mumbai has been deteriorating and is now ranked among the world's most polluted cities. The city's air quality index (AQI) was in the "moderate" category with a reading of 149, according to SAFAR. The pollution is causing respiratory problems such as COPD, asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia across all age groups. A hospital in Mumbai has set up a special Intensive Respiratory Care Unit (IRCU) to treat patients with respiratory illnesses. Nearly 50% of patients visiting the hospital with respiratory symptoms need to be admitted, and 30% require ICU admission. The IRCU facility is equipped with advanced technology to manage complex respiratory conditions. The Maharashtra health department has initiated a "health action plan" to monitor air pollution-related conditions and ensure prompt treatment. In Delhi, RML Hospital has established a weekly "pollution" OPD to address illnesses caused by pollution.</description>

			<description>Teetar Singh, a 78-year-old MGNREGS employee from Rajasthan, has filed his nomination to contest the upcoming legislative Assembly elections in the state. Despite never winning in the past, Singh is motivated by the fight for rights and demands that the government allot land to the landless and poor laborers. He has contested every election from panchayat to Lok Sabha polls but has faced defeat every time. Singh works as a daily wage laborer under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) but shifts focus to campaigning during elections. He has filed his nomination for the Assembly election later this month.</description>

			<title>No, Supreme Court has not banned all firecrackers: What's allowed, what's not?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/no-supreme-court-has-not-banned-all-firecrackers-whats-allowed-whats-not-13362282.html</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has extended the ban on polluting firecrackers to all states in India, not just the Delhi-NCR region. However, the court clarified that green crackers are allowed. These green crackers were developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in 2018 to reduce pollution levels. Green crackers have a smaller carbon footprint and contain fewer harmful chemicals compared to traditional crackers. They cause 30% less air pollution and emit less noise. The court's decision means that all states, including Rajasthan, must take steps to minimize air and noise pollution during the festival season and beyond. Some states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, and West Bengal have already imposed restrictions on the sale and use of firecrackers, with some allowing only green crackers.</description>

			<title>How Delhi, Punjab airports have increased security after Gurpatwant Pannun's Air India bombing threat</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-delhi-punjab-airports-have-increased-security-after-gurpatwant-pannuns-air-india-bombing-threat-13362072.html</link>
			<description>Air India passengers at Delhi and Punjab airports will undergo additional security checks following a threat issued by the separatist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ). Designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun warned Sikhs not to fly Air India after November 19. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has ordered a "secondary ladder point check," where airline staff will frisk passengers and inspect their hand luggage just before boarding. Entry of visitors to the airports has also been banned. Pannun's threat, although lacking the means to carry it out, has been taken seriously, and heightened security measures have been implemented. Pannun, who has dual citizenship in Canada and the United States, is known for using social media to make threats against India. He has been designated a "proclaimed offender" by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and his assets have been seized. The Indian High Commission in Ottawa is seeking increased security for Air India flights originating and terminating in Canada.</description>

			<title>How Sweden is set to become Europe’s first smoke-free country</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-sweden-is-set-to-become-europes-first-smoke-free-country-13361372.html</link>
			<description>Sweden is on track to become Europe's first smoke-free nation, with less than 5% of its population smoking every day. This achievement is attributed to a combination of factors, including strict anti-smoking laws, public health campaigns, and the use of a product called snus. The smoking rate in Sweden has steadily declined over the years, thanks to measures such as smoking bans in restaurants and public places. The Swedish government has also implemented high taxes on cigarettes while reducing taxes on snus, which is a smokeless tobacco product. Snus is a highly addictive nicotine product that is placed under the upper lip. It has been popular in Sweden for over 200 years and is considered a part of Swedish culture. While snus is seen as a less harmful alternative to smoking, health authorities remain cautious about its potential risks, including cardiovascular issues and harm to pregnant women. Overall, Sweden's success in reducing smoking rates can be attributed to a combination of tobacco control measures and public awareness campaigns [[2]](https://www.scholarcy.com/)</description>

			<title>Small joys: Why you need you find your glimmer</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/glimmers-calm-joy-triggers-mental-health-trauma-13361402.html</link>
			<description>The concept of "glimmers" is gaining popularity on social media, particularly TikTok. Coined by Deb Dana in her book "The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy," glimmers refer to small moments that bring feelings of connection, calmness, and joy. They serve as the opposite of triggers, which can send our bodies into fight, flight, or freeze mode. Glimmers have a soothing effect on our nervous system, promoting a sense of safety and relaxation. Recognizing and seeking out glimmers regularly can be beneficial, especially for those who have experienced trauma, as it helps in managing triggers. There are two types of glimmers: self-regulating (activities like reading or walking in nature) and co-regulating (interactions with others like laughing with friends or talking to a therapist). Glimmers offer a sense of safety and connectedness, allowing us to cope during challenging times. Sharing glimmers with someone else can deepen acceptance and connection. It is important not to shy away from acknowledging and embracing feel-good emotions, as they contribute to overall well-being. Exploring and cultivating glimmers is worth a try for everyone.</description>

			<title>Weed is NOT the remedy: Why marijuana is bad for your heart health</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/weed-is-not-the-remedy-why-marijuana-is-bad-for-your-heart-health-13359782.html</link>
			<description>Two recent studies have found a link between regular marijuana use and an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. The first study presented by the American Heart Association (AHA) found that regular marijuana users had a 34% higher risk of developing heart failure compared to non-users. The study also found that the risk decreased when participants had coronary artery disease. The second study assessed marijuana users with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes and found that 20% experienced a serious cardiac or neurological event while receiving medical attention. Additionally, marijuana users with cardiovascular risk factors had a higher rate of heart attacks compared to non-users. The use of marijuana among senior citizens is on the rise, with a 2020 study showing an increase in usage between 2015 and 2018. The American Heart Association advises against smoking or vaping any chemical, including cannabis products, due to potential risks to the heart, lungs, and blood vessels.</description>

			<title>First Rashmika, now Katrina deepfake: How big is the problem in India and beyond</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rashmika-mandanna-katrina-kaif-deepfakes-how-big-is-the-problem-in-india-world-13360732.html</link>
			<description>A deepfake video of Indian actor Rashmika Mandanna wearing a low-cut top in a lift has caused concern in India. The manipulated video, created using Artificial Intelligence (AI), has led to calls for legal action against those responsible. This incident highlights the growing problem of deepfakes, particularly their use to harm women. Deepfakes use AI to create or alter media in a way that makes it difficult to determine authenticity. While deepfakes can have positive applications, such as realistic visual effects in movies, they are predominantly used for non-consensual pornographic content. Reports indicate that 98% of all online deepfake videos target women, and there has been a significant increase in their numbers. Deepfake technology poses risks beyond pornography, including crimes, scams, and influencing key events like elections. A company called DeepMedia predicts that 500,000 video and audio deepfakes will be shared on social media this year. India is ranked as the sixth most vulnerable country to deepfake pornography. Although India currently lacks specific laws addressing deepfakes, there are legal provisions that can address the issue. The government has issued an advisory to social media platforms, citing the Information Technology Act, 2000. The United States is ranked as the second most susceptible nation to deepfake adult content, with concerns rising ahead of the presidential elections. Other countries, such as China, Japan, the UK, and South Korea, have taken steps to regulate or criminalize deepfakes. Tech companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft are also developing tools to detect AI-generated content.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-are-green-crackers-all-that-theyre-cracked-up-to-be-13356222.html</link>
			<description>Scientists at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) have developed "green crackers" as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional firecrackers. These green crackers emit about 30% less pollution and do not contain barium compounds, which are known to pollute the air and cause noise. There are three types of green firecrackers: safe water releaser, safe thermite cracker, and safe minimal aluminium cracker. Green crackers are also cheaper and make less noise than conventional firecrackers. They can be recognized by a QR code and green logo indicating certification from NEERI.</description>

			<title>Will handle Gaza for 'indefinite period', says Netanyahu. Will it go West Bank way?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-handle-gaza-for-indefinite-period-says-netanyahu-will-it-go-west-bank-way-13359522.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly hinted at the possibility of Israel occupying Gaza in an interview with ABC News. He stated that Israel would have an indefinite security responsibility for Gaza, as they have witnessed the eruption of Hamas terror when they haven't had that responsibility. Netanyahu also rejected calls for a ceasefire without the release of over 200 hostages taken by Hamas.

In terms of the West Bank, it is a parcel of land east of Israel that borders Jerusalem. Israel captured the West Bank during the 1967 war and has since built settlements there, which are considered illegal by the United Nations and much of the international community. The West Bank is home to millions of Palestinians who view it as their spiritual home and the capital of a Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank, while Israeli settlers argue that the settlements enhance Israel's national security.

The article raises questions about what will happen in Gaza once Israel gains complete control. Experts suggest that this remains uncertain, and replacing Hamas with another governing body poses challenges. The leaked plan from the Israeli government mentioned options such as handing over control to the Palestinian Authority or establishing a local regime. However, these options were discarded due to their inability to deter further attacks. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has indicated that assuming power in Gaza would require a comprehensive political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

It is yet to be seen if Netanyahu will pursue a similar settlement policy in Gaza as he has in the West Bank. The article concludes by mentioning the potential cessation of relief operations in the Gaza Strip by the UNRWA due to the lack of fuel supplies, putting thousands at risk. Additionally, there is scrutiny on Netanyahu's role in the intelligence failure preceding the Hamas attack, which resulted in significant casualties in Israel.</description>

			<title>What is artificial rain and could it be the answer to Delhi’s pollution woes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-air-quality-pollution-what-is-artificial-rain-iit-kanpur-cloud-seeding-13358812.html</link>
			<description>The air quality in Delhi, India continues to be poor, causing respiratory problems among the residents. To address this issue, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has been working on a technique to induce artificial rains and reduce pollutants and dust in the city. The institute successfully carried out a test for producing artificial rain through cloud seeding and has obtained the necessary permissions from government authorities. Artificial rain can provide relief from air pollution for up to a week, but specific meteorological conditions are required for the process to work. IIT Kanpur needs permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and Special Protection Group (SPG) to fly an aircraft over the National Capital. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique that involves adding chemicals to clouds to increase precipitation, either by causing ice crystals to grow or by making particles larger to fall faster. It has been used for various purposes, such as mitigating droughts, hail damage, forest fires, and improving air quality. However, the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still debated among scientists. In addition to these efforts, the Delhi government plans to implement an odd-even scheme for private vehicles between November 13 and 20, where vehicles with odd registration numbers will be allowed on odd dates and vice versa. The Supreme Court has also directed states neighboring Delhi to take immediate measures to halt stubble burning by farmers, which contributes to the worsening air quality.</description>

			<title>China cracks down on ‘pig butchering’ scam. It has nothing to with the animals</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-cracks-down-on-pig-butchering-scam-it-has-nothing-to-with-the-animals-13358252.html</link>
			<description>China has been cracking down on a cyber scam known as "pig butchering," which involves con artists luring victims into fake romantic relationships and then convincing them to invest in fraudulent bitcoin schemes. These scams are operated by strong Chinese syndicates based in Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar. The scams can be lengthy, with the con artists courting their victims for months before convincing them to make large investments. Many of these con artists are also victims of human trafficking, having been tricked into false job ads and imprisoned in prison-like complexes. Investment fraud is the fastest-growing scam globally, with Chinese citizens losing billions of dollars each year. In response, Chinese authorities have conducted mass arrests and launched joint operations with neighboring countries to catch suspects. Despite these efforts, experts warn that these criminal groups will continue to exploit vulnerable areas around the world.</description>

			<title>How a spinal implant has helped a patient with Parkinson's disease to walk again</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-a-spinal-implant-has-helped-a-patient-with-parkinsons-disease-to-walk-again-13358482.html</link>
			<description>Swiss researchers have achieved a medical first by implanting electrodes in the spinal cord of a patient with advanced Parkinson's disease. The breakthrough allows the patient, Marc Gauthier, to walk and perform daily tasks without difficulty. The procedure is invasive and more research is needed, but it shows potential for restoring movement in people with Parkinson's disease. The researchers had previously pioneered similar breakthroughs to help paraplegic people walk again. The neuroprosthesis, a complex system of electrodes, stimulates movement by replacing the impaired communication between the brain and spinal cord. The treatment could be expensive and is being further tested on a group of six Parkinson's patients. Overall, the achievement represents a major advance in Parkinson's treatment.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-office-sharing-firm-wework-is-going-out-of-business-12976512.html</link>
			<description>WeWork, the American office-sharing start-up, has filed for bankruptcy in New Jersey federal court. The company's CEO, David Tolley, expressed gratitude for the support of financial stakeholders and stated that WeWork remains committed to investing in its products, services, and employees. Co-founder Adam Neumann called the bankruptcy filing "disappointing" and expressed belief that a reorganization could lead to success. WeWork was valued at $47 billion in 2019 but faced skepticism from investors and a failed IPO. The COVID-19 pandemic further impacted the company's occupancy rates and financial stability. WeWork India stated that it operates independently from WeWork Global and will not be affected by the bankruptcy filing. WeWork China also announced that it will not participate in the strategic reorganization in the US and Canada.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-bharat-atta-sold-by-the-centre-how-much-does-it-cost-where-can-you-get-it-13357042.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has launched a new wheat flour scheme called "Bharat Atta" ahead of the Diwali festival. The scheme aims to reduce food inflation and provide reasonably priced wheat flour to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. Bharat Atta is a fortified wheat flour made with a blend of rice, wheat, and pulses. It will be sold through various retail outlets, including Mother Dairy, NAFED, and NCCF, as well as 800 mobile vans and 2,000 outlets run by these agencies. The initiative follows a pilot sale of 18,000 tonnes of wheat flour at Rs 29.50 per kilo, which has now been reduced to combat inflation. India continues to face high cereal inflation, with the rate of cereal inflation still in double digits. The government plans to limit exports of wheat and rice to ensure adequate supply and reasonably priced access for its population of 1.4 billion people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also announced plans to introduce a free food grains program to protect consumers from rising food inflation.</description>

			<title>Israel open to ‘tactical pauses’ in Gaza: How is it different from a ceasefire?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-open-to-tactical-pauses-in-gaza-how-is-it-different-from-a-ceasefire-13357552.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel-Hamas war has been ongoing for over a month, with Israel intensifying its airstrikes in Gaza and making advances with tanks and soldiers. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, over 10,000 people have died, including 4,104 children. There are growing calls for Israel to stop, with the Arab world and the United States pressing for a ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has mentioned considering "tactical little pauses" for aid entry or hostage release but rejected a general ceasefire during an interview with ABC News.

A humanitarian pause is a temporary halt in fighting for humanitarian reasons, allowing for the passage of aid or displaced people. It can promote obligations under international humanitarian law, such as evacuating the wounded or facilitating the passage of relief. On the other hand, a ceasefire is a general suspension of hostilities agreed upon by both sides involved in the conflict, often leading to a permanent settlement. In the case of the Israel-Hamas war, a ceasefire would involve the withdrawal of tanks and troops from Gaza and the release of hostages by Hamas.

Several countries, including Russia and major United Nations bodies, have called for a ceasefire in Gaza due to the dire situation. However, the US has rejected these calls, stating that a ceasefire would leave Hamas in place to regroup and repeat attacks. Instead, the US supports humanitarian pauses to protect civilians, deliver aid, and enable the defeat of Hamas. The UK and the European Union have also not backed a ceasefire, focusing on advocating for humanitarian pauses.

Netanyahu has consistently refused a ceasefire until Hamas releases its captives in Gaza. He expressed willingness to consider humanitarian pauses for aid and hostage movements but ruled out a general ceasefire.

Overall, the article discusses the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the difference between humanitarian pauses and ceasefires, and the positions of various countries regarding a cessation of hostilities.</description>

			<title>Israel-Hamas war: How many jobs have been lost in Gaza?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-how-many-jobs-have-been-lost-in-gaza-13357362.html</link>
			<description>The recent Israeli-Hamas conflict has had a devastating impact on the employment situation in Gaza, with over 60% of jobs lost since the conflict began. This amounts to a total of 182,000 jobs lost in the small Palestinian territory. The occupied West Bank has also lost an estimated 24% of its employment, or 208,000 jobs, as a result of the war's spillover effects. The International Labour Organisation warns that if the conflict continues, the repercussions on the Palestinian labour market will worsen and reverberate for many years to come. In addition to job losses, rising poverty is a major concern in Gaza, where more than 80% of the population already lives below the poverty level. The UN agency estimates that job losses in Gaza and the West Bank result in a daily income loss of $16 million. The economic future for Gaza was already bleak before the war, and the recent fighting has only worsened the situation. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts a short but steep recession followed by a hesitant rebound and a return to normal economic performance by 2025.</description>

			<title>Is Delhi’s odd-even scheme to battle air pollution even effective?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-odd-even-car-scheme-air-pollution-effective-13357202.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the implementation of the odd-even rule in Delhi as a measure to combat air pollution. The rule allows cars with either odd or even number plates to ply on alternate days. The scheme was first introduced in Delhi in 2016 and is applied only to private vehicles, with some exemptions for certain categories. While reducing the number of vehicles can help reduce pollution levels, experts have differing opinions on the effectiveness of the scheme. Some studies have shown a reduction in particulate matter levels, while others argue that the scheme has been ineffective due to people changing their travel schedules and increased exempted vehicle activity. The severity of air pollution in Delhi has led to the implementation of various measures, including the odd-even scheme, but a long-term holistic approach is needed. Doctors have reported an increase in respiratory problems among residents, highlighting the need for immediate action.</description>

			<title>Want to boost productivity? Try getting angry at work</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/anger-boost-productivity-study-workplace-motivator-goals-13355892.html</link>
			<description>A new study has found that anger can actually be a powerful motivator for productivity and meeting goals. The American Psychological Association conducted a survey of over 1,000 people and found that anger usually evoked the best performance compared to other emotions. The study also examined surveys from the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections and found that people who said they would be angry if their preferred candidate lost were more likely to vote. Experts say that the findings are important, especially for women in the workplace who are often conditioned to believe they cannot be "emotional." The study suggests that anger and frustration with the status quo can be tools for innovation and creativity. However, it is important to note that excess anger can be detrimental to cognitive functioning. Overall, the study adds to the growing evidence that a mix of positive and negative emotions promotes well-being, and using negative emotions as tools can be effective in certain situations.</description>

			<title>Rashmika Mandanna deepfake controversy: What are these AI-generated pictures, videos?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-a-deepfake-fraud-how-can-we-stay-safe-from-it-12882832.html</link>
			<description>A deepfake video featuring actor Rashmika Mandanna has gone viral on social media, prompting concerns about the spread of misinformation and the role of AI. The video, which was doctored to replace the face of another individual with Mandanna's, has garnered strong reactions from Mandanna herself, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, and superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Chandrasekhar reminded social media platforms of their legal obligations to combat misinformation, while Bachchan called for strong legal action against deepfakes. Deepfakes are realistic but fake images, voices, or videos created using AI and deep learning algorithms. They have been a growing concern, with numerous instances involving celebrities going viral in the past. Deepfake fraud is when scamsters use AI to duplicate the sound or faces of an intended victim's friends or family to manipulate them into transferring money. Indians, in particular, are falling victim to deepfake scams, with many unable to distinguish between real and AI voices. To protect oneself from such scams, establishing a codeword with close friends and family, being cautious of unknown calls, and verifying information through alternative means are recommended.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-may-bring-national-security-strategy-what-is-it-why-is-it-needed-13353632.html</link>
			<description>India is in the process of formulating its National Security Strategy (NSS) after years of discussion and no progress. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) has started collecting inputs from various ministries and departments to draft the strategy, which will then be presented to the Cabinet for approval. The NSS will outline India's security objectives, identify internal and external challenges, and provide guidance on how to achieve national goals. It will address traditional and non-traditional challenges such as economic security, information warfare, and environmental concerns. The need for an NSS has been emphasized by military and strategic circles, who believe it will provide a comprehensive framework for addressing security-related matters and guide defense reforms. However, there have been hesitations in releasing an NSS document due to concerns about revealing India's stance to potential adversaries. Countries like the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, and Pakistan have already formulated their own national security strategies.</description>

Somnath has stated that there has been some misinterpretation and clarified that he did not target any particular individual. He also mentioned in his book the lack of clarity regarding the failure of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, stating that it was a software glitch, not a communication failure as Sivan had described it.

			<description>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping today, marking the first visit by an Australian leader to China since 2016. The visit is aimed at improving relations between the two countries, which have been strained in recent years due to disputes over issues such as Huawei, espionage, and COVID-19. Albanese will raise concerns about rising tensions in the South China Sea during his meeting with Xi. In other news, a parliamentary committee in India will meet today to discuss three bills that aim to replace existing criminal laws. The committee is expected to recommend amendments to the bills but will face opposition from members who are demanding English names for the proposed laws. Additionally, despite the Supreme Court reserving its verdict on electoral bonds, the Indian government has approved the issuance of the 29th tranche of electoral bonds starting today. Electoral bonds are seen as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties and are intended to bring transparency to political funding. Today is also the last day for nominations for the Rajasthan Assembly elections in India, with polling scheduled for November 25th. The India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in Kerala over the next few days, starting today. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, will host its first-ever developer conference today, featuring keynote addresses and breakout sessions led by technical staff. However, it is unlikely that any news about GPT-5, OpenAI's next generative AI model, will be revealed at the event. Finally, on this day in 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the United States, becoming the first Republican to win the presidency and later credited with ending slavery in the country.</description>

			<title>Discrimination is Bad for Business: How it destroys motivation at work</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/discrimination-is-bad-for-business-how-it-destroys-motivation-at-work-13331092.html</link>
			<description>A new study published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour suggests that workplace discrimination can lead to reduced effort and productivity among employees. The study involved nearly 1,200 participants who were placed in experiments designed to mimic work settings. Participants were told that their manager would award a bonus based on their performance, and some were informed that there were two types of employees: blue and red. One-third of the participants were told that the manager had a bias against blue employees, another third were told the manager was biased in their favor, and the rest received no information about bias. The study found that participants who knew their managers discriminated against them or favored them completed fewer tasks than those in the control group. The researchers also found that discrimination can worsen over time, with disadvantaged workers showing the largest decline in effort. Additionally, the study showed that discrimination can lead to behavior by employees that strengthens negative stereotypes or spreads discriminatory stereotypes to new managers. The findings suggest that workplace discrimination can have negative effects on productivity and may hurt firms' bottom lines more than previously assumed. Future research is needed to understand how bias operates in different contexts, such as race, gender, sexuality, or parental status.</description>

			<description>A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck a remote region in northwestern Nepal, resulting in at least 128 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The death toll is expected to rise as communication has been cut off in many areas. Nepal is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the boundary of two tectonic plates, the Asian and Indo-Australian plates. The collision of these plates created the Himalayan Mountains and causes frequent earthquakes. Nepal's flimsy buildings and growing population contribute to the vulnerability of the country. Some of the deadliest earthquakes in Nepal's history include a 8.2 magnitude earthquake in 1934 that killed over 10,000 people and a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 that killed around 9,000 people.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-admiral-lisa-franchetti-the-first-woman-to-lead-us-navy-13344122.html</link>
			<description>The US Senate has approved Admiral Lisa Franchetti as the chief of naval operations, making her the first woman to join the joint chiefs of staff. Franchetti has been serving in an acting capacity since August due to a delay caused by a Republican senator's opposition to Pentagon abortion access policy. Franchetti has held various command positions and was promoted to the second-highest rank in the Navy, vice chief of naval operations, in September 2022. The Senate also approved the nomination of General David Allvin as head of the US Air Force. Senator Tommy Tuberville has been stalling the nominations to protest Pentagon policies on reproductive health care. The delay is negatively impacting military readiness and affecting officers' families.</description>

			<title>Living in ‘gas chambers’: What is making Delhi’s air so toxic?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-pollution-aqi-severe-toxic-air-stubble-burning-emissions-construction-13342142.html</link>
			<description>Delhi-NCR is currently experiencing severe pollution, with the capital being the most polluted major city in the world. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi stood at 346, which is considered severe. The pollution is caused by various factors, including farm fires in north-west India, vehicular emissions, and industrial and construction activities. Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has seen a significant increase this year, contributing to the high levels of pollution. The lack of strong winds and rainfall exacerbates the situation as pollutants accumulate in the air. To tackle the pollution, emergency measures have been implemented, including school closures and bans on polluting vehicles and construction activity. The next 15 days are critical for Delhi as experts warn that there will be no respite from pollution during this period.</description>

			<title>What are the huge mysterious blobs near Earth’s core?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-the-huge-mysterious-blobs-near-earths-core-13342672.html</link>
			<description>A new study suggests that the two continent-sized blobs of strange material discovered deep near the Earth's center in the 1980s may be the remains of a prototype planet that had a massive influence on Earth billions of years ago. These blobs, known as Large Velocity Provinces (LLVPs), have a higher density than the surrounding areas and are estimated to be slightly denser than the surrounding mantle rock. The theory proposes that the blobs were formed by a severe collision between the early Earth and a smaller planet called Theia, which also resulted in the formation of the moon. However, scientists are still looking for evidence to support this theory and suggest that studying moon rocks could provide further insights.</description>

			<title>Why are prices of olive oil rising in Europe? Can it impact India?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-prices-of-olive-oil-rising-in-europe-can-it-impact-india-13342082.html</link>
			<description>The price of olive oil has seen a significant increase, with prices rising by about 75% since January 2021. This rise in price is due to factors such as drought and harsh weather damaging olive crops in major producing countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal. As a result, the cost of olive oil has reached record levels, making it more expensive for consumers. In addition to olive oil, potato prices have also seen a staggering rise. These increases in food prices have put a burden on poorer families who are struggling to keep up with inflation. The European Trade Union Confederation has noted that wages are failing to keep up with the rising costs of basic food items, forcing more people to rely on food banks. Despite falling annual inflation rates, food inflation remains high at 7.5%. The olive oil sector is facing its own challenges, including drought, higher temperatures affecting flowering, and inflation affecting fertilizer prices. The shortage of supply is impacting markets and households globally, including India where the cost of imported olive oil has increased by 22%. Consumers in India are reconsidering their choices and opting for alternative cooking oils due to the surging costs of olive oil. The high prices are expected to continue until at least June 2024.</description>

			<title>Japan last in global employees' well-being survey. Where does India stand?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-last-in-global-employees-well-being-survey-where-does-india-stand-13341132.html</link>
			<description>Japan ranked lowest for employees' well-being in a recent global survey, while Turkey topped the list. The survey, conducted by the McKinsey Health Institute, evaluated workers' physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being. Japanese respondents reported low scores in all categories, with 30% reporting social health, 74% reporting physical health, 24% reporting spiritual health, and 42% reporting mental health. The report suggests that Japan's high levels of stress and lack of workplace satisfaction contribute to its low ranking. India ranked second in the survey but reported high rates of burnout symptoms. Over 50% of workers worldwide exhibit signs of burnout, which increases their likelihood of quitting their jobs. The survey also found that demands at work, such as dealing with toxic behaviors or role ambiguity, are more predictive of burnout symptoms than enablers. Employers are encouraged to prioritize their employees' overall health to improve workforce performance and work-life balance.</description>

			<title>Curbs imposed to tackle Delhi’s ‘severe’ pollution: What’s banned, what’s not?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/curbs-imposed-to-tackle-delhis-severe-pollution-whats-banned-whats-not-13340182.html</link>
			<description>The air quality in Delhi and its surrounding areas has reached the "severe plus" category, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency. The current PM2.5 concentration in New Delhi is 23.3 times above the recommended limit by the WHO. The air quality is expected to worsen in the next two weeks due to an increase in stubble burning and unfavorable weather patterns. Emergency measures have been announced, including a ban on construction and polluting vehicles. The air quality index (AQI) in various areas of Delhi and NCR has reached alarming levels, with some areas recording over 500 AQI. The spike in farm fires and poor weather conditions have contributed to the smoky haze enveloping the region. Steps taken by authorities include issuing orders to curb air pollution, closing schools for two days, providing online courses for students, and implementing Graded Action Response Plan-III (GRAP). The eight-point plan includes measures such as road sweeping, water sprinkling, promoting public transport, and imposing fines on offenders. Stubble burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana is also contributing to the declining air quality in Delhi and NCR.</description>

			<title>Why US drones are flying over Gaza</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-us-drones-are-flying-over-gaza-13339862.html</link>
			<description>The United States is increasing its involvement in the search for hostages taken by Hamas after the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel. US officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, revealed that the US has been flying surveillance drones over Gaza to assist with hostage rescue efforts for over a week. This development comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to visit Israel and meet with Israeli leaders to secure the release of all hostages in Gaza. The MQ-9 Reaper drones operated by US Special Operations Forces have been active in the area since the days following Hamas's attack. The drones are being used for surveillance missions to help locate hostages and provide leads to the Israeli military. This marks the first time US drones have undertaken operations over Gaza. The US military has also provided support to Israel through the supply of bombs, artillery rounds, and the deployment of troops.</description>

			<title>Some airplanes are now being pushed to ‘speed of sound’. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/some-airplanes-are-now-being-pushed-to-speed-of-sound-heres-why-13338362.html</link>
			<description>A powerful jet stream over the Atlantic is causing planes to travel faster from the United States to Europe. Jet streams are bands of strong wind that influence weather, air travel, and the atmosphere. They are created when warm and cold air masses collide, creating an air current. Jet streams can reach speeds of up to 442 kilometers per hour. When an airplane flies in the same direction as a jet stream, it gets an extra push and travels faster. Airlines have been using jet streams to reduce flight times, with some flights arriving at their destinations earlier than expected. However, jet streams can also cause turbulence and require extensive planning for arrival times. The current jet stream over the Atlantic is expected to strengthen a potential storm called Storm Ciaran.</description>

			<title>How ‘white hydrogen’ deposits found in France could save Earth</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-white-hydrogen-deposits-found-in-france-could-save-earth-13327552.html</link>
			<description>Scientists have discovered a large supply of hydrogen, known as "white hydrogen," in northeastern France. White hydrogen is a greener energy source than solar or wind power, as it only produces water when burned. It can be used as a substitute for steel, shipping, and aviation. The discovery was made when methane concentrations in the earth's crust were being evaluated, and hydrogen concentrations increased as scientists dug deeper. This discovery is significant because it shows that large amounts of hydrogen can naturally occur without requiring energy-consuming procedures. White hydrogen is predicted to be more affordable than green hydrogen, costing around one US dollar per kilogramme. It has the potential to help combat the climate crisis and transform the clean energy market. Organizations are currently drilling to find hydrogen resources, and startups are exploring the possibility of selling white hydrogen.</description>

			<title>How a simple blood test could help diagnose bipolar disorder</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-a-simple-blood-test-could-help-diagnose-bipolar-disorder-13323932.html</link>
			<description>Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK have developed a blood test that, when combined with a digital mental health assessment, can provide an improved diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The blood test alone can diagnose up to 30% of patients with bipolar disorder, but it is even more effective when used in conjunction with the online assessment. This combination can help differentiate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which have similar symptoms but require different treatments. The blood test is still in the proof of concept stage, but it has the potential to be a valuable complement to existing psychiatric diagnosis methods. Up to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder, and the blood test could help ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment. The research team used samples and data from the delta study, conducted in the UK between 2018 and 2020, to identify bipolar disorder in patients previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The blood test and online assessment combination significantly improved diagnostic outcomes for people with bipolar disorder, especially in cases where the diagnosis was not obvious.</description>

			<description>Halloween, observed on October 31st, has evolved from its origins as the Samhain festival of the ancient Celts. It is now a widely celebrated non-religious holiday in Europe and North America. The festival originally involved lighting fires and dressing up in costumes to repel ghosts and spirits. In the eighth century, the church incorporated some of Samhain's rituals into its own practices and repositioned November 1st as All Saints Day. The day before All Saints Day became known as Halloween, and traditions such as dressing up, trick-or-treating, and carving jack-o-lanterns were gradually added over time.</description>

			<description>Today is Kojagari Lakshmi Puja, a day dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. After Durga Puja, several states in India celebrate this day with fervor, including West Bengal, Assam, and Odisha. It is believed that on this day, Lakshmi revolves around the Earth's orbit to relieve the sorrows and pains of her devotees. Sharad Purnima, another name for this auspicious day, is observed in other parts of the country as well. Farmers pray to Lakshmi for good harvests, and in some regions, it is believed that Lakshmi was born on this day. Devotees decorate their homes with lights and rangolis and prepare sweets and sattvik food for the goddess.</description>

			<title>In graphics | NASA issues warning as farm fires return to Delhi, NCR</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-nasa-issues-warning-as-farm-fires-return-to-delhi-ncr-13307762.html</link>
			<description>The air quality in Delhi is expected to fluctuate between the "poor" and "very poor" categories for the next four to five days. This is due to crop residue burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana. Stubble burning in Punjab has been listed as one of the biggest contributors to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, there has been a decrease in stubble burning incidents in Haryana this year. Data from NASA shows that farm fires have been at a low level this year, possibly due to a delayed burning season and excess rainfall. The air quality situation in Delhi is monitored by NASA, and it deteriorates every year during late October and November.</description>

			<title>Before death penalty, how 8 Navy veterans languished in solitary confinement in Qatar</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/death-penalty-indian-navy-veterans-solitary-confinement-qatar-prison-13305192.html</link>
			<description>Eight former Indian Navy veterans have been sentenced to death in Qatar after being arrested last August. The Ministry of External Affairs has expressed shock at the verdict and is exploring all legal options. The charges against the veterans have not been revealed, but media reports suggest they have been accused of spying for Israel on Qatar's submarines. The veterans were working for a defence services provider company in Qatar after retiring from the Indian Navy. They were kept in solitary confinement until August 4th of this year. The Indian government has provided aid and legal assistance to the veterans, and talks may already be underway with Qatari authorities. The case will test Indian diplomacy as it seeks to secure the release of the veterans. India has a good relationship with Qatar, with strong bilateral trade and defence cooperation between the two nations.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/malaysias-royals-to-pick-next-king-why-does-the-country-have-rotational-monarchy-13302642.html</link>
			<description>Malaysia's royal heads will be electing the country's next king on Friday, as per state news agency Bernama. The conference of rulers, consisting of nine Malay states, will vote for a new monarch to replace King Abdullah Sultan Ahmad. Malaysia has a rotational monarchy system, where the position of king and his deputy are shifted among the rulers of the nine states. The king's role is largely ceremonial but has gained prominence due to political instability. The monarch acts as the custodian of Islam and has the power to appoint a prime minister. Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar is next in line to be the monarch after King Abdullah's term ends in January.</description>

			<title>Who is Mamata's trusted aide Jyotipriya Mallick arrested in the Bengal ration scam?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mamata-trusted-aide-jyotipriya-mallick-arrested-west-bengal-ration-scam-13303872.html</link>
			<description>West Bengal forest minister Jyotipriya Mallick, a trusted lieutenant of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the 'ration scam'. The ED conducted raids at Mallick's residences and arrested him after questioning him for over 20 hours. The scam involves alleged irregularities in the public distribution system and distribution of food grains during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The arrest is seen as a blow to Banerjee as Mallick is a key leader with significant influence over the state's Matua community, which can impact poll results in about 50 constituencies. This comes as several other TMC leaders have been arrested or investigated for corruption.</description>

			<title>Who is Baap of Chart owner Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari? Why has SEBI banned him from the markets?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/baap-of-chart-owner-mohammad-nasiruddin-ansari-sebi-crackdown-securities-market-13301392.html</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari, the owner of 'Baap of Chart', from the securities market. SEBI claims that Ansari misled investors and influenced them to deal in securities, making Rs 17.2 crore in the process. Ansari, who presents himself as a stock market expert on social media, offered educational courses and conducted workshops to train investors. SEBI alleges that he made buying/selling recommendations under the guise of educational courses and promised guaranteed returns. The regulator also accused Ansari of using theatrics and showmanship to induce investors to trade in securities. Additionally, SEBI found that Ansari incurred losses in stock trading despite claiming to provide strategies for high profits. Along with Ansari, four other directors of Golden Syndicate Ventures were also involved in non-registered investment advisory services, according to SEBI. The regulator has ordered Ansari and others to cease acting as investment advisors and deposit the Rs 17.2 crore within 15 days.</description>

			<title>Why are ‘free’ seats on flights in India so hard to find?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/centre-airlines-free-paid-seats-flights-india-dgca-rules-13299942.html</link>
			<description>The Ministry of Consumer Affairs in India has warned domestic airlines and online travel aggregators for engaging in "unfair" trade practices. The ministry highlighted issues such as misleading claims of "free mandatory web check-in" and not allowing customers to board with confirmed tickets. A survey found that 47% of respondents had to pay for a seat of their choice in the last year, and 51% did not get any free seat and were charged an additional fee for seat allocation. The ministry has called for a meeting with CEOs of airlines and travel portals to address these concerns. Airlines in India charge passengers for seat selection, with fees ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 1,000 depending on the location of the seat. In 2013, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation allowed airlines to charge consumers for extra services, including preferential seats, but this norm was struck down in 2015. Last March, a Parliamentary panel criticized airlines for charging different fares for seat allocation and asked the government to monitor fare pricing. Despite an increase in consumer complaints, the Indian government does not intend to intervene in the pricing mechanism of airlines.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/america-gun-problem-mass-shooting-2023-becoming-dangerous-year-13299792.html</link>
			<description>Maine is currently experiencing a manhunt for an armed gunman after two mass shootings occurred in Lewiston, leaving at least 22 people dead and many injured. The suspect, Robert Card, has been identified as a person of interest and is considered armed and dangerous. While the motive for the shootings is still unknown, Card has previously reported mental health issues. The incident adds to the growing number of mass shootings in the US, with data showing that there have been 565 mass shootings so far this year. Gun violence in America has become a significant problem, with an average of 43,375 deaths per year attributed to guns. Despite efforts to implement gun reform, including a recent gun safety package signed by President Joe Biden, gun ownership remains a contentious issue in the country. Many argue in favor of owning firearms, leading to laws that expand gun ownership in several states.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rajasthan-assembly-elections-2023-key-issues-seats-candidates-congress-bjp-13296962.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming Assembly elections in Rajasthan will see a battle between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for political power in the state. The Congress has fielded Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot as key candidates, while the BJP has given a ticket to former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje. The election is set to take place on 25 November, with results announced on 3 December. Key issues in the election include crime against women, youth unemployment, and paper leaks in government recruitment exams. Both parties are also dealing with factionalism within their ranks. Farmers' issues, including protests against the Centre's farm laws, may impact the BJP's electoral prospects in north Rajasthan districts. The Congress is likely to focus on the Old Pension Scheme and demand 'national project' status for the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project.</description>

			<description>The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee is holding its first meeting to address the "cash for query" allegation against Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra.

The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee oversees the moral and ethical conduct of parliamentarians and will examine the complaint. The committee functions by evaluating complaints, conducting inquiries, and making recommendations. The current committee is headed by BJP's Vinod Kumar Sonkar.

			<title>Why Israel has heeded to US' request of delaying its Gaza invasion</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-israel-has-heeded-to-us-request-of-delaying-its-gaza-invasion-13298582.html</link>
			<description>Israel has reportedly agreed to delay its planned invasion of Gaza in order to allow the United States to deploy missile defenses to protect US troops in the region. Both Israel and the Biden administration are focused on trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The US is rushing nearly a dozen air-defense systems to the area, and has also advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault as it works to free more hostages and prepare for a potential wider conflict. Israel is taking into account the need for humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages. The threat to US troops is a top concern, as they are expected to be targeted by militant groups once an invasion begins. Israeli officials acknowledge that some hostages may have already been killed in retaliatory air raids, and they believe a solution for the hostages will become practically impossible once a ground invasion takes place. Egypt has been urged to pressure Hamas to release all detained women and children if they want to reach a solution. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas in response to the recent attack on civilians by militants. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has warned Hamas, stating that modern Jews have different capabilities than in the past.</description>

			<title>What is the nuclear test ban treaty that Russia is withdrawing from?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-nuclear-test-ban-treaty-that-russia-is-withdrawing-from-13297992.html</link>
			<description>Russia has passed legislation to withdraw from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a landmark accord that prohibits nuclear weapons tests. The CTBT, agreed upon in 1996, aims to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons by banning any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion worldwide. Currently, 187 states have signed the treaty, with 178 ratifying it in their parliaments. Of the nine countries with nuclear weapons, Britain and France have both signed and ratified the treaty, while the United States, Israel, and China have signed but not ratified it. Russia had previously signed and ratified the treaty but is now withdrawing its ratification. The treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests, with no country conducting such a test since the 1990s except for North Korea. The treaty also established a global network of observation posts to detect signs of nuclear explosions. While Russia claims it does not plan to conduct a test unless the US does so first, some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now. A resumption of nuclear testing could prompt other countries to follow suit and potentially lead to a new arms race.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-israel-attacking-south-gaza-after-ordering-civilians-to-go-there-13297702.html</link>
			<description>Israel has intensified its bombing campaign in southern Gaza, causing fear among the Palestinians who had evacuated there. The Israeli military claims that Hamas has entrenched itself among the civilian population, making it difficult to avoid civilian casualties. Since October 7th, over 6,500 Palestinians have died as a result of Israeli strikes. Israel ordered the evacuation of Gazans to the south in order to move civilians away from Hamas targets concentrated in the north. However, many Palestinians feel betrayed and angry as they are still being targeted in the south. The international community has called for a pause in the fighting to allow for humanitarian aid and the opening of humanitarian corridors.</description>

			<title>Meta sued in the US: How Instagram is particularly harmful to adolescents</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/meta-sued-in-the-us-how-instagram-is-particularly-harmful-to-adolescents-13296072.html</link>
			<description>A recent article discusses the impact of social media, particularly Instagram, on teenagers. The article highlights a lawsuit filed against Meta (formerly Facebook) by 41 states and the District of Columbia, alleging that the company intentionally designed Facebook and Instagram with features that harm teens and young users. Internal research from Meta in March 2020 showed that Instagram is harmful to teen girls' body image and well-being, but the company ignored these findings. Numerous studies have shown that the more often teens use Instagram, the worse their overall well-being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, mood, and body image. Two key features of Instagram make it particularly risky for teens: the ability to follow celebrities and peers who present unrealistic body images and curated impressions of a perfect life, and the emphasis on pictures of the body, leading users to focus on how they look to others. These factors contribute to negative social comparisons, envy, lowered self-esteem, and increased body dissatisfaction among teens. Body dissatisfaction during the teen years is a predictor of later eating disorder symptoms. The article suggests that parents can help by talking to their teens about appearance versus reality, encouraging face-to-face interactions with peers, and promoting active engagement with their bodies instead of focusing on selfies. The article raises concerns about how Meta will handle these damaging results and compares their approach to Big Tobacco's denial of the harmful effects of its products.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bird-flu-reaches-antarctica-for-the-first-time-why-this-could-be-devastating-13294282.html</link>
			<description>Experts are concerned that thousands of penguins and seals in Antarctica could be wiped out by a deadly variant of bird flu known as avian flu. British scientists discovered the virus in brown skuas, a scavenger bird, on Bird Island, part of the British overseas possession of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The virus is believed to have been brought to Antarctica by birds migrating from South America, where it has already caused significant deaths among seabirds and sea lions. The H5N1 strain of avian flu is highly pathogenic and causes significant mortality in poultry. While the virus is difficult to spread from animals to humans, there are concerns that if a person with the flu contracts this bird flu, it could lead to serious consequences. Researchers fear that the disease could result in catastrophic breeding failure and have a devastating impact on many wildlife species in Antarctica. Ongoing disease surveillance programs are recommended to identify new and emerging pathogens.</description>

			<description>Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly in Miami, Florida while Israel is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza. Yair's absence has caused anger among reservists who are serving on the front lines. Yair, who is currently eligible for reserve duty in Israel, has been photographed enjoying the beaches and sunshine in Miami. He hosts a right-wing podcast in Florida and has a history of posting incendiary messages on social media. In August, he was ordered to pay compensation to a woman he defamed on social media. Yair has also been involved in several defamation cases and has been temporarily banned from Facebook for hate speech.</description>

			<title>Israel-Hamas war: Why the UN may stop all aid operations in Gaza</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-united-nations-aid-operations-gaza-strip-fuel-supplies-13295502.html</link>
			<description>The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening as Israel continues its attacks on the region, and a United Nations agency may be forced to stop aid operations due to a shortage of fuel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) currently provides aid to 600,000 displaced Gazans and has called for a humanitarian "pause" in fighting. Hospitals are on the verge of shutting down due to the lack of fuel supplies, and the healthcare system is at its worst stage in history. The World Health Organization warns that patients dependent on dialysis and premature babies are at risk of dying without a stable supply of electricity. Israel has ruled out allowing fuel into Gaza, claiming that Hamas would use it for its operational infrastructure and rocket attacks. Israel suggests that the UN ask Hamas for fuel supplies, as they claim Hamas has stored fuel in advance. Israel is also in a diplomatic row with the UN after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments about the attack by Hamas on Israel not happening in a vacuum. Israel has asked Guterres to resign and plans to deny visas to UN officials.</description>

			<description>Hezbollah, a significant force in Lebanon with political and military power, has been trading fire with Israel along the Israel-Lebanon border since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began its attacks on the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah has been supporting Hamas in the conflict and has expressed its readiness to take action. The group has a history of tense relations with Israel and is committed to its destruction. Experts fear that Hezbollah's involvement in the Israel-Hamas war could escalate the conflict and destabilize the region.</description>

			<description>Heman Bekele, a 14-year-old boy, has been crowned America's Top Young Scientist for his creation of an inexpensive bar of soap that heals skin cancer. He competed against nine other finalists in the 2023 3M Young Scientists Challenge and won the $25,000 grand prize. Heman plans to use the prize money to pay for college and obtain a patent for his invention. His soap, called Melanoma Treating Soap (MTS), combines three chemicals with medicinal soap to reactivate dendritic cells, which help trigger an immune response to fight cancer. The cost of each bar of soap is only $0.50, significantly less than the $40,000 typically required for medical treatments. Over the next five years, Heman plans to improve his invention and establish a non-profit organization to make it accessible to underserved areas.</description>

			<title>How cybercriminals are scamming people who want to donate to Israel, Gaza victims</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-cybercrime-fake-donations-charities-fraud-13293872.html</link>
			<description>Scammers are taking advantage of the Israel-Hamas war by sending deceptive emails and creating fraudulent websites to solicit donations. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has identified over 500 scam emails and fake websites that exploit people's willingness to help those affected by the conflict. The scammers pose as charitable organizations and use emotive language to entice people to click on a fake website link and make donations. They even offer options like using cryptocurrencies for transactions. Additionally, there are suspicious accounts on social media platforms asking for donations, but these are likely scams as well. To avoid getting scammed, it is important to thoroughly scrutinize donation pages, check the legitimacy of charitable organizations, and cross-check names to avoid mistaken identity.</description>

			<title>Is India planning to take action against Canada on terror funding?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-canada-row-fatf-terror-funding-khalistani-terrorists-13293542.html</link>
			<description>India is reportedly considering moving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) against Canada for its soft stance towards Khalistani terrorists. The FATF is a global watchdog that combats money laundering and terror financing. India has accused Canada of providing safe space to terrorists despite sharing evidence. The FATF conducts regular evaluations of countries' performance on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, and countries that do not meet the standards can be placed on the grey or black lists. India may present evidence of terror funding and financing emanating from Canada to the FATF. The India-Canada diplomatic row has escalated, with Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats from India and India suspending visa services to Canadians.</description>

			<description>A man in India, inspired by the Bollywood film "Drishyam," planned and executed the murder of his two unmarried sisters. Ganesh Mohite fed his sisters rat poison, making it appear as if a relative had poisoned them. He had brainwashed his mother and surviving sister into believing the relative was responsible. However, police investigation revealed the truth, and they discovered evidence on Mohite's phone and in his car that pointed to his guilt.

			<title>Why melting of West Antarctic ice shelves cannot be avoided despite carbon emissions cuts</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-melting-of-west-antarctic-ice-shelves-cannot-be-avoided-despite-carbon-emissions-cuts-13291192.html</link>
			<description>A new study suggests that regardless of efforts to reduce emissions, a significant portion of Antarctica will be lost in the future. The research indicates that the rate at which the warming Southern Ocean melts the West Antarctic ice sheet will accelerate over the course of this century, leading to increased sea-level rise and potential consequences for coastal communities worldwide. The study used a regional ocean model to predict ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea, the most vulnerable sector of the ice sheet. The results show a rapid increase in ocean warming and ice-shelf melting, even under the best-case scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5°C. The findings suggest that rapid ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea is now inevitable until at least 2100, regardless of international policies on fossil fuels. Melting ice shelves contribute significantly to sea-level rise, and while it is difficult to determine exact figures without considering other factors such as glacier flow and snow accumulation, increased ice-shelf melting is expected to accelerate sea-level rise. The West Antarctic ice sheet is already losing about 80 billion tonnes of ice per year and has enough ice to cause up to 5 meters of sea-level rise. However, there is still hope for the longer term, as simulations show that under the 1.5°C scenario, ice-shelf melting may start to plateau by the end of the century, suggesting that further changes in the 22nd century could still be preventable. The article emphasizes the need for courage and adaptation in facing climate change and protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels.</description>

			<title>Are tensions between Netanyahu and military delaying Israel's invasion?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-tensions-between-netanyahu-and-military-delaying-israels-ground-invasion-13292532.html</link>
			<description>Israel has not yet launched a ground invasion on Gaza, despite announcing its urgency. The reasons for the delay include talks on the release of hostages held by Hamas, international pressure, and political-military differences. The Biden administration is urging Israel to postpone a ground conflict in Gaza and is sending military assets to express support for Israel and prevent others from joining the conflict. Hamas has held over 200 captives since attacking Israel on October 7th. Israeli authorities believe that a deal for hostages will be impossible once a ground invasion occurs. There are tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF (army), with disagreements and accusations of failing to prevent the attack by Hamas militants. The presence of US military personnel in Israel aims to prevent any move that could endanger the hostages, including Americans. International leaders are urging caution and fear that a ground operation could escalate the conflict and involve other countries like Iran-backed Hezbollah.</description>

			<description>Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old Israeli grandmother, was held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza. After being released, she shared her abduction ordeal and shed light on the treatment of captives by Hamas. Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released after being held captive for 16 days. Lifshitz described being beaten during the journey into Gaza and being tied to a motorcycle. Once in captivity, she and the other hostages were provided with mattresses, food, access to medical care, and were treated well overall. Lifshitz praised the militants for their treatment, stating that they took care of their needs and were concerned about hygiene. She also criticized the Israeli government for security lapses. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are gathering intelligence from Lifshitz's account as they prepare to respond to the Hamas attack. The decision to put Lifshitz in front of the cameras has received criticism, with some viewing it as a propaganda win for Hamas. Hamas claims to have over 200 hostages, and the release of Lifshitz and Cooper follows the release of two Israeli-American women. The US has reportedly asked Israel to delay its ground invasion to facilitate the release of more hostages.</description>

			<title>How Israel is trying to get information on hostages held by Hamas</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-israel-is-trying-to-get-information-on-hostages-held-by-hamas-13292112.html</link>
			<description>The Israeli army is urging residents of the Gaza Strip to provide information about hostages held by Hamas in exchange for financial rewards. The army dropped leaflets containing the message from aircraft during airstrikes. The leaflets also provided contact information for sending information about the hostages. So far, four female hostages have been released through negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Israeli military is using various methods, including surveillance and interrogating captured Hamas militants, to determine the whereabouts of the captives. Israel is preparing for a potential ground invasion to free the hostages and eliminate Hamas. The exact location of the hostages is unknown, and it's unclear whether they are all held by Hamas or other extremist groups. The presence of dual nationals among the hostages further complicates the situation. Over 220 people were kidnapped by Hamas militants during an attack on southern Israel in early October.</description>

			<title>China, Bhutan to end boundary talks at earliest: Why this is a worry for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-bhutan-boundary-talks-india-doklam-worry-lac-13290302.html</link>
			<description>China and Bhutan have pledged to resolve their boundary dispute, which could have implications for India. The dispute between China and Bhutan dates back to 1950 when China occupied Tibet and refused to recognize the dividing line between Tibet and Bhutan. The two countries have been engaged in boundary talks since 1984, focusing on three disputed areas. In 2017, India and China had a standoff over the Doklam plateau, which is considered an undisputed territory of Bhutan by India. The region holds great security importance for India as it threatens the Siliguri Corridor, a vital stretch connecting the Indian mainland to the Northeast. There are concerns in New Delhi that a deal between Bhutan and China could involve swapping Doklam for disputed territories in the north. India believes that China's claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is a way to pressure Bhutan into handing over Doklam. Tensions remain high between India and China over the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with no agreement reached on troop disengagement at key friction points. Resolving the dispute over Doklam is linked to the conflict on China and India's shared border, particularly regarding Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as an extension of South Tibet.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/where-taiwans-four-president-hopefuls-stand-on-china-13290062.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming presidential election in Taiwan, scheduled for January 13, 2023, has put a spotlight on each candidate's stance on China. Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT) oppose Chinese domination but differ in their approach to dealing with China. Lai Ching-te, the candidate for the DPP, and Taiwan's current Vice President, has offered talks with China but has been rejected as Beijing views him as a separatist. Hou Yu-ih, the candidate for the KMT, aims to restart talks with Beijing and favors close ties with China. Ko Wen-je, the candidate for the Taiwan People's Party, supports China proposing a new framework for engagement and explaining what it has to offer. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, is running as an independent and accuses the ruling DPP of pushing Taiwan towards war with China through hostile policies. The article also mentions tensions between Taiwan and China, as well as the sovereignty dispute over Taiwan between China and the United States.</description>

			<title>How China is targeting Canadian lawmakers through ‘spamouflage'</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-china-is-targeting-canadian-lawmakers-through-spamouflage-13288882.html</link>
			<description>A bot network linked to China has been accused of launching a "spamouflage" misinformation campaign targeting Canadian lawmakers. The network used thousands of messages on social media accounts to accuse members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of criminal and ethical infractions. The campaign involved the dissemination of propaganda across various platforms, combining spam-like content with more ordinary, human-interest style posts. The bot network also circulated misinformation about other events, such as the Hawaiian wildfires and Japan's Fukushima water release. The goal of the campaign was to discredit and denigrate targeted MPs and silence criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. China has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and called the accusations a "blatant smear campaign." Canada has expressed concern that the campaign could discourage MPs from carrying out their duties and speaking out on important issues.</description>

			<title>How Hezbollah will decide whether Lebanon enters the war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-hezbollah-will-decide-whether-lebanon-enters-the-israel-hamas-war-13287972.html</link>
			<description>The Israeli military conducted airstrikes on two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were preparing to launch rockets and anti-tank missiles against Israel. As tensions between Israel and Hamas continue to escalate, there is a risk that Lebanon, already on the brink of economic and political collapse, could be drawn into the conflict. Hezbollah has been preparing to join the fight since Hamas launched a surprise assault, resulting in increased attacks by the Shiite militant group. Israel is evacuating residents along the border with Lebanon in anticipation of a ground invasion of Gaza, and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate if Israeli forces enter Gaza. The decision of whether Hezbollah fully joins the war will shed light on its priorities: the well-being of Lebanon or acting as a proxy for Iran. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has spilled into Lebanon since 1948, with the displacement of Palestinians leading to tensions and conflict. The rise of Hezbollah, which formed in 1982 with Iranian and Syrian support, has significantly impacted Lebanon's political landscape. Despite the fractured political system and weak state, Lebanon managed to retain some stability until it experienced a severe economic crisis in 2019, followed by the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The political system remains in gridlock, and Hezbollah has emerged as a defender of the current political system. The decision of whether Lebanon enters the war rests with Hezbollah and, by extension, Iran. If Hezbollah joins the war, it could lead to further regional conflict and push Lebanon closer to collapse.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iron-sting-israels-new-weapon-in-the-war-against-hamas-13287862.html</link>
			<description>The Israeli Defense Forces' Maglan Unit recently used a new guided munitions system called the 'Iron Sting' against Hamas rocket launchers in the Gaza strip. Developed by the Israeli military in collaboration with Elbit Systems, the Iron Sting is a precision laser and GPS-guided mortar munition. It fires off 120mm mortar rounds with maximum accuracy and has a range of 1 to 12 kilometers, depending on the ammunition used. The system is designed for use in both urban and open terrain and can even penetrate double-reinforced concrete. The Iron Sting has been in development for a decade and is hailed as a groundbreaking weapon that provides infantry with a level of accuracy previously only available from missiles and airborne weaponry. Its use in the recent conflict has been praised for its precision and effectiveness in targeting enemy rocket launchers.</description>

			<title>10 die of heart attacks in 24 hours during Garba in Gujarat: What's ailing revellers?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/10-die-of-heart-attacks-in-24-hours-during-garba-in-gujarat-whats-ailing-revellers-13284752.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In Gujarat, at least 10 people have died while participating in Garba, a traditional dance performed during the Navratri celebrations. The victims ranged from teenagers to middle-aged individuals, with the youngest being a 13-year-old boy. The cause of these deaths is believed to be heart attacks, possibly due to pre-existing medical conditions, prolonged fasting, poor eating habits, and a lack of awareness about heart health issues in India. Some experts also speculate that COVID-19 may be a contributing factor, although this has been refuted by former chief minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel. Similar incidents have been reported in the past, highlighting the need for individuals to be aware of their health and not push their physical limits during such celebrations. It is important to stay hydrated and take breaks to prevent cardiac strain. COVID-19 has been linked to increased risks of blood clotting, heart failure, and other heart-related issues. An analysis of these deaths is necessary to determine the exact causes and prevent future incidents.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nawaz-sharif-returns-pakistan-politics-imran-khan-2024-elections-13280552.html</link>
			<description>Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has returned to Pakistan after four years of self-imposed exile in London. He will be addressing a massive rally in Lahore, his hometown. Sharif's return comes at a time when Pakistan is facing economic and political crises. He was convicted on corruption charges and barred from politics for life in 2017. His return symbolizes the possibility of political normalcy returning to Pakistan, as the country has been in turmoil since his main rival, Imran Khan, was ousted from the prime minister post. However, Sharif faces challenges in regaining support and addressing the country's economic plight. There are speculations that his return was possible with the support of the military establishment. Sharif's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, has said he will seek to overturn his conviction sentence and lead the party in the upcoming general elections.</description>

			<title>Hold. Delay. Go: How ISRO launched Gaganyaan's first test flight after 'anomaly'</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/isro-gaganyaan-mission-first-test-flight-launch-delay-anomaly-13279482.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the first test flight for India's Gaganyaan mission on 21 October. The Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission was initially delayed due to weather conditions and was later halted just seconds before lift-off due to an anomaly detected by the ground support computer. The issue was quickly resolved, and the launch took place at 10 am. The objective of the test flight was to showcase the performance of the crew escape system, and it lasted a total of 532 seconds. The crew module successfully separated from the rocket and descended through parachutes, landing in the Bay of Bengal. This test flight is significant for India's first human spaceflight project as it tests the safety mechanisms for the Gaganyaan crew in case of an emergency. The successful separation of the crew module ensures that astronauts can escape during a mid-flight emergency. The ISRO is prioritizing astronaut safety and is building environmental control and life support systems for the crew module. India aims to send a manned Gaganyaan mission to space by 2025.</description>

			<description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched a test flight for the upcoming Gaganyaan mission. The test vehicle, called TV-D1, aimed to demonstrate the performance of the crew escape system. The launch was initially delayed due to an ignition problem but was successful after the issue was identified and corrected. In addition to space achievements, India also inaugurated a rapid rail transport system, with the aim of faster travel between Sahibabad and Duhai depot. However, there was disappointment as the Supreme Court refused to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriages, stating that it should be decided by parliament. There was some political drama involving TMC MP Mahua Moitra, who was accused of granting parliamentary access in exchange for cash and gifts, allegations she denied. The article also mentions the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and worsening air pollution in Mumbai.</description>

			<title>Were Hamas militants high on Captagon during Israel attack?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hamas-militants-captagon-israel-attack-syria-drug-west-asia-13278102.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Captagon pills, a counterfeit version of a medicine first produced in Germany in the 1960s, are widely smuggled across West Asia and have been found on the bodies of Hamas militants killed on Israeli soil. The drug is an amphetamine-type stimulant that provides a boost of energy, enhances focus, and produces a feeling of euphoria. It is dubbed "the poor man's cocaine" and has been linked to militants in Iraq and Syria. Captagon has serious side effects, including psychosis and brain damage, and can lead to addiction. Syria has become a major producer and consumer of amphetamines, with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad and his associates profit from the sale of these drugs. Efforts have been made by several West Asian countries to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, but experts warn that smugglers may find new routes and markets, posing a threat to Europe and the rest of the world.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-splits-from-partner-andrea-giambruno-controversies-13276922.html</link>
			<description>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced her separation from her partner, Andrea Giambruno. The couple, who have a seven-year-old daughter, had been together for nearly a decade. Meloni's decision comes after Giambruno made sexist comments both on and off air in recent weeks. Giambruno is an Italian journalist and TV presenter for Mediaset, which is owned by the heirs of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. He joined TV at the age of 22 and met Meloni in 2015 while working on a TV program. Giambruno's controversial remarks include victim-blaming statements about rape and downplaying the effects of climate change. Prior to Meloni's announcement, Giambruno was in the spotlight for lewd remarks made on a satirical TV program. Meloni thanked Giambruno for their relationship and their daughter in her statement announcing the split. She also criticized media coverage leading up to her announcement.</description>
