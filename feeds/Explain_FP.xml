			<title>Who was Aruna Shanbaug mentioned by the Supreme Court during Kolkata rape-murder case hearing?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/supreme-court-kolkata-rape-murder-case-hearing-aruna-shanbaug-euthanasia-13806612.html</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court referred to the case of Aruna Shanbaug, a Mumbai nurse who was brutally sexually assaulted and left in a persistent vegetative state for 42 years. 

The attack occurred in 1973 when Shanbaug was  working at KEM Hospital.  The perpetrator, a ward boy, sodomized and strangled her. While convicted, he received a lenient sentence as "sodomy" was not considered rape under Indian law at the time. 

Shanbaug's case sparked a national discussion on euthanasia and violence against women in healthcare settings. A petition seeking legal euthanasia was filed on her behalf, ultimately leading the Supreme Court to legalize passive euthanasia in specific circumstances. Shanbaug sadly passed away in 2015.</description>

			<title>Why is Switzerland offering Rs 49 lakh to pull ammunition from its lakes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/switzerland-rs-49-lakh-ammunition-lakes-13806561.html</link>
			<description>Switzerland is tackling the problem of thousands of tonnes of military munitions dumped in its lakes between 1918 and 1964. The Swiss federal office for defence procurement, Armasuisse, has launched a competition offering 50,000 Swiss francs to find safe and environmentally friendly methods to remove the explosives.  The munitions pose risks of explosions and environmental contamination, with some estimations suggesting over 3,300 tonnes in Lake Lucerne alone.  The competition invites ideas from various sectors, with the winning proposals potentially serving as a basis for future research and removal projects.</description>

			<title>Can Taylor Swift sue Donald Trump for sharing AI-generated endorsement? What does the law say?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-taylor-swift-sue-donald-trump-for-sharing-ai-generated-endorsement-what-does-the-law-say-13806602.html</link>
			<description>Donald Trump posted AI-generated images of Taylor Swift endorsing him for the 2024 election. Swift, who previously criticized Trump, has not endorsed any candidate this year.  Legal experts believe Swift could sue Trump for using her likeness without permission, potentially violating her right of publicity.  

The NO FAKES Act and Tennessee's ELVIS Act are two potential legal avenues Swift could explore. While experts agree she likely has a strong case, they question whether the cost and effort of a lawsuit outweigh the potential benefits.</description>

			<title>Excessive screen time can cause ‘digital dementia’. What is this condition?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/excessive-screen-time-can-cause-digital-dementia-what-is-this-condition-13806465.html</link>
			<description>The term "digital dementia" describes potential cognitive decline linked to excessive technology use. While not an official diagnosis, research suggests a correlation between increased screen time and negative impacts on cognitive function, including memory loss, attention difficulties, and reduced learning capacity. 

Studies highlight the link between excessive screen time and heightened risks of dementia,  especially vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This is potentially due to the constant multitasking and rapid information processing that digital devices demand, overwhelming the brain and disrupting sleep patterns.  
  
Efforts to manage screen time, engage in cognitively stimulating activities, and prioritize real-world interactions can help mitigate these risks and protect cognitive health in the digital age.</description>

			<title>Fashion faux pas: Why Zara has pulled its ‘perfect snack’ T-shirt off shelves</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/zara-perfect-snack-t-shirt-controversy-13806475.html</link>
			<description>Zara has faced backlash for a T-shirt marketed towards young girls that read "the perfect snack" and featured a strawberry with the words "take a bite" and "a burst of sweet delight."  

Critics, including mothers on TikTok, called the design sexually suggestive, particularly due to the slang use of "snack" to describe someone attractive. Zara apologized for the "misunderstanding," removed the shirt from its stores and website, stating there was no intention to imply anything other than the traditional meaning of "snack." This incident is not the first controversy Zara has faced, with past issues including an ad campaign criticized for its resemblance to imagery from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a  "White is the New Black" t-shirt deemed as racially insensitive.</description>

			<title>Mpox outbreak: Why has the world reacted so slowly?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/mpox-outbreak-why-has-the-world-reacted-so-slowly-13806537.html</link>
			<description>Congo's mpox outbreak, fueled by a potentially more infectious strain, highlights the world's slow response to the disease.  Though the 2022 global outbreak was largely contained in wealthy nations, few vaccine doses were sent to Africa. The current variant is affecting young people disproportionately and has spread to 13 African countries. Despite alarming statistics, Congo initially did not request vaccines, and access remains a major issue. Experts warn that the current situation mirrors the early stages of the HIV pandemic and urge immediate global intervention to prevent further spread.</description>

			<title>How pro-Trump supporters are spreading rumours about Kamala Harris’ ‘drinking problem’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pro-trump-supporters-spread-rumours-about-kamala-harris-drinking-problem-13806361.html</link>
			<description>Trump supporters have begun circulating videos of Kamala Harris, alleging she has a drinking problem. These videos, which show Harris speaking at rallies and events, have been interpreted by some as evidence of her alleged intoxication. Critics point to her speech patterns and occasional laughter as proof, while supporters dismiss these claims as baseless.  

This latest attack comes amidst a broader effort by Trump and his allies to undermine Harris, employing derogatory nicknames, sexist remarks, and personal attacks on her character and capabilities. 


They hope to weaken her standing and divert attention from policy discussions.</description>

			<title>What led to the sinking of the Bayesian superyacht off Italy’s coast?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-led-to-the-sinking-of-the-bayesian-superyacht-off-italy-sicily-coast-13806409.html</link>
			<description>The superyacht Bayesian sank off the coast of Sicily after being caught in a violent storm.  The yacht, owned by British entrepreneur Mike Lynch, capsized with 22 people onboard. One person was found dead, the chef, while 15 were rescued, including Lynch's wife. Lynch and six others remain missing. 

The storm, characterized by high winds and waterspouts, struck the anchored yacht, leading to its rapid sinking.  The yacht's tall mast and a potentially raised lifting keel may have contributed to its instability. The incident raises concerns about yacht safety in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather events in the Mediterranean, possibly exacerbated by climate change.</description>

			<title>How Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, a fugitive in India, became Malaysia's guest</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-islamic-preacher-zakir-naik-a-fugitive-in-india-became-malaysias-guest-13806439.html</link>
			<description>Zakir Naik, a controversial Indian preacher, is a source of tension in the India-Malaysia relationship. Naik, known for his radical Salafi views and inflammatory remarks, fled India in 2016 following accusations of inciting terror and hate speech. He was granted permanent residency in Malaysia, a decision that has drawn criticism from India.

India has repeatedly requested Naik's extradition, but Malaysia has so far refused. Naik's controversial speeches in Malaysia, targeting local Hindus and Chinese, have further strained ties. Both countries have expressed concerns about Naik's influence and his potential to incite violence. The extradition issue remains a significant obstacle in deepening bilateral relations.</description>

			<title>Centre’s U-turn on lateral entry into bureaucracy: How it snowballed into a political row</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/centre-upsc-ad-lateral-entry-into-bureaucracy-politcial-row-nda-india-bloc-13806415.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has cancelled its recent advertisement seeking lateral entry into the bureaucracy following widespread opposition.  The opposition raised concerns about the lack of reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes in the recruitment process.  

Several NDA allies, including the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the Janata Dal (United), criticised the move, with Jitan Ram Manjhi even threatening to escalate the issue within the cabinet. The Telugu Desam Party, however, supported the lateral entry scheme. 

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged the move was an attack on social justice and constitutionally disadvantaged groups.  
BJP Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal defended the lateral entry scheme, pointing out that Manmohan Singh was also appointed through a similar process and questioning the opposition's hypocrisy.</description>

			<title>From Joe Biden’s exit to Hillary Clinton’s boost to Kamala Harris: Key takeaways from DNC on Day 1</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-presidential-election-from-joe-biden-to-hillary-clinton-to-kamala-harris-key-takeaways-from-democratic-national-convention-day-1-13806328.html</link>
			<description>The first night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) marked President Biden's emotional farewell and a symbolic passing of the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden, delivering a speech highlighting his administration's achievements, expressed confidence in Harris's leadership and pledged to be her "best volunteer." 

Harris, in a surprise appearance, paid tribute to Biden's service, while Hillary Clinton evoked the "glass ceiling" metaphor, urging a victory for Harris and shattering that ceiling by becoming the first female president.

The DNC also served as a platform to criticize former President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and labor rights. Speakers shared personal stories of loss due to the pandemic and attacked Trump's policies. 

The convention honored civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson and emphasized the importance of representation and diversity within the Democratic Party. The night culminated with Biden's assertion that the party must "save democracy" again in 2024.</description>

			<title>Who is Mike Lynch, UK’s ‘Bill Gates’ missing in superyacht sinking?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bayesian-superyacht-sinking-mike-lynch-uk-bill-gates-missing-13806311.html</link>
			<description>Mike Lynch, a British tech entrepreneur nicknamed "UK's Bill Gates," was among those missing after his superyacht, the Bayesian, sank off the coast of Italy.  The yacht, owned by Lynch's family, went down during a severe storm, killing one person and leaving six missing. Lynch's wife and an 18-year-old daughter are among those unaccounted for.

Lynch made headlines in 2011 when he sold his company, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion. He was later accused of fraud by HP, leading to a lengthy legal battle. Lynch maintained his innocence and was ultimately acquitted in June.  He was reportedly celebrating his acquittal with friends and family aboard the Bayesian when disaster struck.</description>

			<title>Top Gear: How Ethiopia has seen a rapid transition to electric vehicles</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ethiopia-rapid-transition-electric-vehicles-13806101.html</link>
			<description>Ethiopia is leading Africa's transition to electric vehicles. The country banned gas-powered car imports in 2023 and aims to have 500,000 EVs on the road by 2030.  This initiative is driven by Ethiopia's abundant hydropower and a desire to reduce fuel costs. The government has implemented policies to make EVs more accessible, including reducing import tariffs and supporting local manufacturing. Despite progress, economic challenges and the high cost of EVs pose hurdles to widespread adoption. Expanding charging infrastructure and making EVs more affordable for all income levels are crucial for sustaining this green revolution.</description>

This technique has gained popularity due to concerns about men exaggerating their height to attract more matches.  While AI can be helpful, experts warn against gamifying dating and urge users to remember the human aspect of online interactions.</description>

			<title>How the Bangladesh crisis has affected tourism in India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-the-bangladesh-crisis-has-affected-tourism-in-india-13806189.html</link>
			<description>The political instability in Bangladesh has resulted in a significant decline in tourist arrivals to India.

Outbound tourism from Bangladesh has plummeted by 90%, with many flights and visas suspended except for medical reasons. 

Although medical tourism from Bangladesh saw a surge in 2023, reaching 449,570 patients, experts predict a potential 10-15% drop in 2024 due to the current turmoil. This decrease is already affecting various sectors in India, including hotels, restaurants, and healthcare facilities that rely on Bangladeshi tourists.</description>

			<description>Approximately 40,000 protesters are expected to converge on Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, demanding an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and protesting the Biden administration's stance on Israel. 

Activists, including students and members of groups like the Coalition to March on the DNC and the Poor People's Army, plan to stage marches, rallies, and demonstrations, some focusing on issues like abortion rights and economic justice.  

While the city has granted permits for protests near the United Center, some activists remain critical of restrictions on demonstration areas and are concerned about potential violence or arrests.  Governor Pritzker and Mayor Johnson have pledged to protect First Amendment rights while ensuring safety and order during the convention.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder case: Why doctors in India are in urgent need for a central protection law</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-india-doctors-central-protection-act-13806125.html</link>
			<description>The recent rape and murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata has renewed calls for a central law to protect healthcare professionals in India.  While several states have their own legislation, the absence of a nationwide law has led to a patchwork of inconsistent protections.  

A study by the Indian Medical Association revealed that over 75% of doctors have experienced violence in their workplaces, often perpetrated by patients' relatives. Factors contributing to this violence include underfunding of the public healthcare system, expensive treatment costs, and a lack of trust in the healthcare delivery system. 

Various initiatives, including a proposed central bill and recent directives from the Union health ministry, are aimed at addressing this pressing issue and ensuring safer working conditions for healthcare workers.</description>

			<title>Anwar Ibrahim to meet PM Modi: How palm oil has played a role in India-Malaysia ties</title>

			<description>Malaysia and India share a significant trade relationship, particularly in palm oil. India is the world's largest importer of palm oil, with Malaysia being the second-largest producer. Palm oil imports from Malaysia constitute a major portion of India's vegetable oil imports. 

Historically, the relationship faced a setback in 2019 due to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's critical remarks on India's policies in Kashmir. This led to India implementing measures to curb Malaysian palm oil imports. 

However, the situation normalized after Mahathir's departure and India resumed purchases.  Both countries are now working together to counter anti-palm oil campaigns and increase cooperation in the palm oil sector.</description>

			<description>The 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago marks a significant moment as Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are nominated for President and Vice President, respectively. 

This convention serves as a platform for Harris to introduce herself to the nation, highlighting her background and policies aimed at lowering costs for everyday Americans. Walz, described as a "joyful warrior,"  complements Harris' message of hope and optimism. 

Notable speakers throughout the convention include President Biden, former President Barack Obama, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  While Biden delivers his final address on the national stage,  the platform emphasizes Democratic priorities like addressing healthcare costs, investing in clean energy, and restoring reproductive rights.  Harris will face the challenge of broadening her appeal beyond the Democratic base and addressing concerns about her policy agenda as she campaigns against Donald Trump.</description>

			<title>Are there vaccines against mpox? How effective are they?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mpox-outbreak-who-vaccines-effectiveness-13806048.html</link>
			<description>Mpox, a viral infection formerly known as monkeypox,  has been declared a global health emergency by the WHO due to a surge in cases, especially those caused by a new and potentially more transmissible strain. While there is no vaccine specifically for mpox, existing vaccines against smallpox, such as Jynneos and ACAM2000, offer cross-protection because the viruses share genetic similarities.  

These vaccines have shown about 85% efficacy against mpox, potentially preventing infection or reducing its severity. The WHO and CDC recommend two doses of these vaccines for maximum protection.  While the antiviral drug tecovirimat (TPOXX) is commonly used to treat mpox, recent clinical trials have shown it doesn't accelerate healing for infections with the new strain.</description>

			<title>Why is a rail strike looming large over Canada? How could it hurt the economy?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/canada-rail-strike-canadian-national-railway-canadian-pacific-kansas-city-teamsters-union-economy-13806034.html</link>
			<description>A potential strike looms on Canada's railways as contract negotiations between Teamsters Canada Rail Conference and the major railway companies CN and CPKC have reached an impasse. The union, representing 9,300 workers, accuses the companies of seeking concessions that could compromise worker safety and scheduling.  

CN and CPKC deny these accusations, stating their proposals align with government regulations and maintain the current safety standards. The companies and the union have traded accusations of bad faith bargaining. 

A strike could cripple Canada's freight rail system, impacting supply chains and causing billions of dollars in economic damage, particularly for farmers in the Prairies heading into harvest season.  While the federal government has the power to impose binding arbitration, it has not shown interest in doing so, leaving negotiations as the primary avenue to avert a potential strike.</description>

			<description>Ukrainian forces have intensified their offensive in Russia's Kursk region, destroying two key bridges vital for Russian logistics. This strategy aims to cripple supply lines and establish a buffer zone within Russian territory, as articulated by President Zelenskyy. The operation has yielded significant territorial gains for Ukraine and boosted morale, but it also carries risks of escalation.

Zelenskyy has called on Western allies to lift restrictions on long-range weapons, enabling Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory. Russia has responded with ballistic missile attacks on Kyiv but largely remains reactive. 

Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has amassed troops on its border with Ukraine and warned of potential nuclear consequences if the conflict escalates further.</description>

			<description>The alleged rape and murder of a postgraduate doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College has triggered nationwide protests and questions about women's safety under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The victim's parents have accused Banerjee of stifling protests and attempting to "hush up" the case, alleging that their daughter's body was cremated hurriedly. They claim the police inquiry was inadequate and suspect involvement from individuals within the hospital department. The primary suspect, Sanjoy Roy, a Kolkata Police volunteer, reportedly confessed to the crime. 

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is now investigating the case, has questioned over 20 individuals, including former hospital principal Sandip Ghosh, and is examining call logs and conversations related to the incident. Meanwhile, the victim's mother, Nirbhaya's mother, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have demanded Banerjee's resignation, citing concerns over women's safety in the state.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/malaysian-pm-anwar-ibrahim-india-countries-ties-relationship-pm-modi-13805357.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to India signifies a continuation of the strong ties between the two nations.  Although Malaysia and India established diplomatic relations in 1957, the relationship reached a new level during Modi's visit in 2015, elevating it to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership. 

India is Malaysia's 13th largest trading partner, and Malaysian investments in India are substantial, particularly in the renewable energy sector.  Both countries engage in robust military cooperation, with three joint exercises conducted in 2022. Recognizing their economic and cultural links, both nations are keen on promoting tourism.

Despite some past tensions, including Kuala Lumpur's criticism of India's actions in Kashmir, experts believe Ibrahim's visit will pave the way for a stronger and more comprehensive bilateral relationship.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/is-it-safe-for-children-to-lift-weights-does-it-stunt-growth-13804927.html</link>
			<description>There are many misconceptions surrounding weight training for children. Research shows that supervised resistance training is safe and does not stunt growth. Concerns about growth plate injuries, often stemming from  impact activities, are unfounded. 

Weight training benefits children's physical fitness, including strength, power, speed, agility and endurance.  It can also positively impact their mental health and academic performance.

Children as young as those ready for sports can benefit from resistance training. Starting light, focusing on proper technique, and gradually increasing weight and intensity is key.</description>

			<description>The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency due to a rapidly spreading virulent strain. 

The virus, typically found in central and west Africa, has now reached 16 countries, with over 15,000 confirmed cases.  

While mpox has existed for a long time, recent genetic changes have increased its severity and transmissibility. The clade I strain, which is more dangerous, is spreading quickly, posing a high threat to vulnerable populations like children and women. 

Unlike previous strains, clade I has no previous exposure to human hosts, making it harder to predict its behavior. There is a shortage of vaccines, highlighting the need for increased testing, public awareness campaigns, and expedited vaccine development to prevent a global pandemic.</description>

			<description>Since the 2022 devastating floods in Pakistan, a worrying trend of "monsoon brides" has emerged. Faced with economic hardship and displacement, parents in rural Sindh are marrying off their teenage daughters to older men in exchange for money. This desperate practice has surged in areas severely impacted by the floods, where livelihoods were destroyed and families struggle to survive.

Young girls like Shamila and Najma, married at 14 and 16 respectively, find themselves trapped in arranged marriages, often to men twice their age. While their parents see it as a means to alleviate poverty, the girls are left with little hope for education or a better future. Concern grows that "monsoon brides" will set back years of progress made in combating child marriage in Pakistan.</description>

			<title>This Week in Explainers: Why mpox is now a global health emergency</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-week-in-explainers-mpox-who-global-health-emergency-13805394.html</link>
			<description>The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global health emergency, citing over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa. Cases have been reported in Sweden and Pakistan, raising concerns about further spread. 

In a surprise move, Ukraine launched a major incursion into Russia's Kursk region, seizing control of 74 towns and settlements. 

Thailand's new prime minister is Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra. She faces the challenge of a struggling economy and potential scrutiny over her own popularity.  

Meanwhile, Japan's PM Fumio Kishida announced his resignation next month, aiming to revitalize the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) but leaving questions about Japan's political future.</description>

			<title>IMA doctors' 24-hour-long nationwide strike: What are their 5 demands?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ima-doctors-24-hour-long-nationwide-strike-what-are-their-5-demands-13805580.html</link>
			<description>Following the rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata, doctors across India are participating in a nationwide strike, halting non-emergency medical services. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) demands government action to ensure the safety of medical professionals. 

Their key demands include a central law addressing violence against healthcare workers, improved working and living conditions for residents, upgraded hospital security, fair compensation for the victim's family, and a thorough investigation into the culprits.

 The Union Health Ministry has responded by convening a meeting with doctor representatives and promising to constitute a committee to suggest measures for enhancing healthcare professional security.  They have also requested the striking doctors to resume duties to address the rising cases of dengue and malaria.</description>

			<title>Who is Tahawwur Rana, the 26/11 Mumbai attacks accused, who can now be extradited to India from the US?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-tahawwur-rana-the-26-11-mumbai-attacks-accused-who-can-now-be-extradited-to-india-from-the-us-13805525.html</link>
			<description>Tahawwur Rana, a former Pakistani army doctor and key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is eligible for extradition to India. A US appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Rana's habeas corpus petition.  The court found India had provided sufficient evidence to support the probability of Rana's involvement in the attacks which resulted in 166 deaths and over 300 injuries.

Rana helped David Headley, a US citizen and LeT operative, in setting up a fake immigration office in Mumbai to facilitate the attacks. He also allegedly provided financial aid and logistical support to Headley.  


Although Rana has been convicted in the US for a separate conspiracy to attack a Danish newspaper, the recent ruling paves the way for his extradition to India to face charges related to the Mumbai attacks. 

Rana retains the option to appeal the decision though.</description>

			<title>Is India prepared for mpox after it being declared a global health emergency?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-india-prepared-for-mpox-after-it-being-declared-a-global-health-emergency-13805475.html</link>
			<description>India is taking steps to prepare for a potential mpox outbreak following the WHO's declaration of a global health emergency. The government is holding high-level meetings and issuing guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus.  The Directorate of Public Health in Tamil Nadu has increased alertness at airports and seaports, focusing on passengers arriving from affected countries. 

India has previously reported mpox cases, with the last reported case in March 2023. While the risk of a significant surge is currently low, experts are monitoring the situation closely.  The Indian Council of Medical Research is conducting a serosurvey to assess mpox exposure and the Serum Institute of India is working on developing an mpox vaccine.</description>

			<title>Sunita Williams, Barry Wilmore stuck in space: How six months in space alters one’s perception of time</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-stuck-in-space-how-six-months-in-space-alters-ones-perception-of-time-13805377.html</link>
			<description>Astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams are currently awaiting a return trip to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) after their spacecraft, the Boeing Starliner, experienced technical issues.  A decision regarding their return, which could be imminent or delayed for six months, is pending. 

Waiting, particularly in high-stakes situations, can significantly distort our perception of time. It occupies more of our mental space, increasing feelings of boredom and frustration. Studies suggest that constant activity and purpose can help time pass more quickly, which may be beneficial for astronauts on the ISS, given their demanding work schedules.  However, the uncertainty surrounding their return date adds another layer of complexity to their experience.  Clear communication and information about the situation could help alleviate some of the stress associated with the wait.</description>

			<title>Jammu and Kashmir to hold polls after a decade. What happened in the last elections?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/jammu-and-kashmir-to-hold-polls-after-a-decade-what-happened-in-the-last-elections-13805405.html</link>
			<description>Jammu and Kashmir will hold Assembly elections in three phases, starting September 18, 2024, following a Supreme Court order. 

The elections are the first since 2014 when the People's Democratic Party (PDP) emerged as the single-largest party, forming a coalition government with the BJP. This government collapsed in 2018 after the BJP withdrew support, leading to President's Rule.  

In 2019, the central government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories,  Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.   
Results of the 2024 elections are expected on October 4.</description>

			<title>US records 300,000 child marriages from 2000: Why is it still legal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-records-300000-child-marriages-from-2000-why-is-it-still-legal-13805227.html</link>
			<description>Child marriage remains a prevalent issue in the United States, with over 300,000 cases recorded since 2000. Despite global efforts to eradicate this harmful practice, 37 states still allow it under certain conditions, such as parental consent or judicial approval.  

This legal inconsistency allows child marriage to persist, particularly impacting young girls who marry adult men, leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.  The lack of comprehensive federal legislation sets a minimum age for marriage, allowing loopholes that endanger minors. 

While thirteen states have banned child marriage outright, advocates argue for a nationwide ban without exceptions to ensure the safety and well-being of all minors. Child marriage has detrimental consequences, including increased risk of poverty, school dropout, and limited opportunities. Ending this practice is crucial for protecting the rights and future of children in the US.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/what-is-slapped-cheek-virus-the-contagious-disease-on-the-rise-in-the-us-13805262.html</link>
			<description>Parvovirus B19, commonly known as "fifth disease," is experiencing a surge in the US, with laboratory data indicating that 10% of the population and 40% of children aged 5 to 9 have antibodies suggesting recent infection. 

This resurgence follows similar trends reported in Europe.  Parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory droplets and causes symptoms like fever, rash (known as "slapped cheek" rash), and joint pain. While most people recover without complications, pregnant individuals, those with weakened immune systems, and individuals with blood disorders are at increased risk for severe outcomes.  


Currently, the CDC recommends preventive measures like handwashing and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.</description>

			<title>Double whammy for Indian graduates: How IIMs are hiking fees but first pay drops</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iim-graudates-median-salary-jobs-bsuiness-school-fees-13805333.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 batch of Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) graduates are facing a challenging job market. Median salaries at several IIMs have stagnated or even decreased compared to previous years. This slowdown is attributed to global economic uncertainty and a predicted slowdown, impacting recruiting behaviour, particularly from consulting firms. 

Despite the stagnant salaries, IIMs have increased fees for the incoming batches citing rising operational costs.  Though placements improved in the later phases of the placement season, recruiters offered lower salaries compared to previous years, leaving students with a challenging financial situation.  The economic climate has also impacted top engineering colleges, with a significant number of IIT graduates still seeking placements.</description>

			<title>Where did the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs come from? We have the answer</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/asteroid-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs-66-years-ago-13805321.html</link>
			<description>A new study published in the journal 'Science' sheds light on the origin of the asteroid that caused the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Researchers analyzed sediment samples and found high levels of ruthenium isotopes, a rare element on Earth but common on asteroids.  

The isotope analysis revealed that the asteroid was a C-type, originating from beyond Jupiter's orbit, confirming earlier hypotheses with greater certainty. This finding is significant because most meteorites recovered on Earth are S-types,  originating closer to the sun.  The study also refutes the theory that the impactor was a comet. 


The research highlights the importance of understanding asteroid origins for assessing future threats and for learning about the history of water on Earth.</description>

			<description>A recent survey by the National Medical Commission (NMC) in India revealed alarming rates of mental health issues among medical students.  

Nearly 28% of undergraduate students and 31% of postgraduate students reported experiencing suicidal ideation.  The survey also found 4.4% of postgraduate students had attempted suicide in the past year.  Significant factors contributing to these issues include  stress from heavy workloads,  concerns about privacy while seeking help, and the stigma surrounding mental health. 

The NMC report recommended numerous solutions, including increased access to mental health services, improved living and working conditions,  addressing financial instability, and abolishing the mandatory rural service bond. The report emphasized the urgency of implementing these recommendations to ensure the well-being of future healthcare professionals.</description>

			<description>Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, has become Thailand's youngest Prime Minister.  She takes on the role after the Constitutional Court ousted the previous Prime Minister and dissolved the most popular party. 

Paetongtarn, known as "Ung Ing" in Thailand, grew up immersed in politics and worked in her family's business before entering politics herself.  She is now facing significant challenges, including a struggling economy, declining popularity of her party, Pheu Thai, and pressure from political rivals and a powerful military establishment. 

While her father remains a key political figure, Paetongtarn aims to establish her own path, but experts question her ability to break free from his influence and navigate the turbulent Thai political landscape.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder: How RG Kar incident has spurred a political blame game in Bengal</title>

			<description>Following the rape and murder of a young doctor in Kolkata, West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) party has accused opposition parties BJP and CPI(M) of trying to instigate trouble and politicize the incident. 

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee blames outsiders and political rivals for the violence at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where the victim's body was found. She has called for justice with the death penalty for the accused and accused the opposition of attempting to defame the state. 

The opposition, however, has countered these claims, demanding Banerjee's resignation and alleging a cover-up by the TMC.  BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari accused TMC "goons" of vandalizing the hospital and destroying evidence, while CPI(M) leaders called for a probe into Banerjee's alleged role in the incident. .  

As protests continue in the state, all parties vow to seek justice for the victim.</description>

			<title>From Africa to Sweden and now Pakistan, how mpox is spreading across the globe</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/mpox-africa-spreading-across-the-globe-sweden-pakistan-13805159.html</link>
			<description>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency due to a concerning surge in cases, primarily in Africa.  

Mpox, a viral disease related to smallpox, causes symptoms like fever, headache, and a characteristic rash. It spreads through close contact with infected animals or individuals and can be fatal in rare cases. 

A new and more transmissible variant, clade Ib, is driving the current outbreak, particularly affecting children in displacement camps. While cases outside Africa have been rare, a recent case in Sweden and others in Pakistan signal potential for wider spread. 

The WHO is urging international cooperation and funding to contain the outbreak and prevent further global transmission. Two years ago, the WHO declared mpox a global emergency during a similar outbreak. That outbreak was controlled through vaccination and behavioral changes, but the new variant poses a different challenge.</description>

			<title>How UK’s Challenger 2 tanks are helping Ukraine in Kursk incursion</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-uk-challenger-2-tanks-are-helping-ukraine-in-kursk-incursion-13805171.html</link>
			<description>The deployment of British Challenger 2 tanks in Ukraine's cross-border raid into Russia's Kursk Oblast marks a significant escalation in the conflict.  

While the tanks demonstrate Ukraine's growing military capabilities, their performance has been hindered by operational challenges. These include mobility issues due to the tank's weight and the challenging terrain, as well as logistical constraints related to specialized ammunition and maintenance. The tanks' effectiveness as a primary combat asset is also questioned due to their limited firepower and vulnerability. Despite these challenges, the symbolic impact of the Challenger 2's presence on Russian soil is considerable, demonstrating Ukraine's resolve and tactical advancements.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/matthew-perry-death-who-is-the-ketamine-queen-charged-in-friends-star-demise-13805131.html</link>
			<description>The death of Matthew Perry, known for his role in the popular sitcom "FRIENDS," has led to a criminal investigation uncovering the involvement of his assistant, two doctors, and a drug dealer, leading to the unravelling of a drug distribution ring. Authorities have charged these individuals for their role in supplying Perry with ketamine, a powerful anesthetic often misused recreationally.  At the center of the case is Jasveen Sangha, nicknamed the "Ketamine Queen," who allegedly supplied Perry's assistant with large quantities of ketamine.  Perry's autopsy revealed a lethal level of ketamine in his system, contributing to his death. Several individuals involved in the case have pleaded guilty to various charges, with the "Ketamine Queen" facing the most serious charges and potential life imprisonment.  The investigation sheds light on the dangers of unregulated ketamine distribution and the exploitation of individuals struggling with addiction.</description>

			<title>Isro successfully launches SSLV-D3: Why is this mission significant for India’s space sector?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/isro-sslv-d3-mission-india-space-sector-13805145.html</link>
			<description>ISRO successfully launched its third developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) on August 16, 2024, placing the 175-kilogramme  Earth Observation Satellite-8 (EOS-08) into orbit.  The SSLV-D3 mission marks the completion of the SSLV development project.  

This three-stage rocket, measuring just 34 meters in length and capable of carrying up to 500 kg satellites, is designed for commercial use due to its affordability and rapid deployment capabilities.  ISRO aims to transfer this technology to private companies, with New Space India Limited (NSIL) already signing an agreement for a commercial launch with an Australian firm.


The EOS-08 satellite, equipped with advanced payloads, will contribute to environmental monitoring, disaster management, and support for India's Gaganyaan mission.  

ISRO has successfully completed two previous developmental flights of SSLV in 2022 and 2023, demonstrating its commitment to cost-effective and reliable small satellite launch services.</description>

			<title>Can ousted PM Sheikh Hasina be extradited from India to Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-ousted-pm-sheikh-hasina-extradition-treaty-india-13805102.html</link>
			<description>Following Bangladesh's political turmoil, the interim government is considering extraditing former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina  based on several charges including murder and enforced disappearance. 

 
Hasina fled to India after protests forced her resignation. Bangladesh and India have an extradition treaty since 2013, which allows for the exchange of convicts. However, the treaty may not apply in Hasina's case as it excludes political asylum seekers. 

India faces a delicate situation. While it has historical ties with Hasina, it also needs to maintain good relations with the current Bangladesh government. Extradition could strain relations and ignite anti-India sentiment. India must carefully weigh its options and consider the implications of its decision.</description>

			<description>Violence erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, sparked by nationwide protests against the rape and murder of a 31-year-old junior doctor at the facility. A mob damaged the emergency building, overturning furniture, breaking medical equipment, and ransacking rooms. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, and several officers sustained injuries. The mob did not reach the seminar room where the doctor's body was found. Nine people have been arrested in connection with the violence.

The opposition BJP has accused the ruling TMC government of being responsible for the violence, while the TMC has called for swift action against those involved. The Kolkata Police Commissioner defended the force, blaming a "malicious media campaign" for inciting the violence.</description>

			<title>Who is Oleksandr Syrski, Ukraine’s ‘butcher’, in-charge of the Kursk incursion in Russia?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraine-incursion-russia-kursk-general-oleksandr-syrski-butcher-13804903.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine has made a significant incursion into Russia's Kursk region, capturing over 1,000 square kilometers and 74 towns and settlements. This success is attributed to Ukraine's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, who earned the nickname "the butcher" for his decisive tactics. 

Syrskyi, a veteran of Ukrainian conflicts, led the defence of Kyiv in 2022 and the counteroffensive that retook territory in the Kharkiv region. He is credited with strategizing the Kursk operation, marking a significant shift in the war's dynamics. 

Russia, responding with anger, has redeployed troops to Kursk and threatened a "worthy response".  While the incursion is seen as a symbolic blow to Putin's authority, its long-term strategic implications remain to be seen.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-why-pm-modi-did-away-with-tradition-of-bullet-proof-glass-for-red-fort-speech-13804657.html</link>
			<description>Following Indira Gandhi's assassination in 1984, Prime Ministers of India for the next three decades used bullet-proof glass during their Independence Day speeches at the Red Fort.  The protective measure escalated over time, from a half enclosure to a full 360-degree shield. In 2014,  Narendra Modi, deviating from this tradition, delivered his address without the glass. He aimed to create a more direct connection with the people, despite concerns raised by security officials and intelligence agencies. Additional security measures were implemented to mitigate the risks, including heightened surveillance and the deployment of snipers.</description>

			<title>Who is Alexei Dyumin, Putin's ex-bodyguard, tapped to turn the tide against Ukraine's incursion in Kursk?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-alexei-dyumin-putins-ex-bodyguard-tapped-to-turn-the-tide-against-ukraines-incursion-in-kursk-13804613.html</link>
			<description>Facing a significant incursion into Russia's Kursk region,  President Putin has appointed Alexei Dyumin, a trusted confidant and former bodyguard, to lead the response. Dyumin, with a background in the military and intelligence services, rose through the ranks and played a key role in the annexation of Crimea.  

Ukrainian forces have seized control of a substantial portion of the region, forcing thousands to flee their homes. This marks the largest military operation on Russian soil since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Dyumin's appointment is seen as a sign of the Kremlin's determination to reclaim the territory.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder: Was the trainee doctor gang-raped at RG Kar Medical College?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-trainee-doctor-gangraped-at-rg-kar-medical-college-13804560.html</link>
			<description>The post-mortem report revealed a significant amount of semen in the 31-year-old doctor's body, suggesting gangrape. The report confirmed strangulation as the cause of death and detailed injuries including genital torture, bite marks on her neck, head injuries, and internal bleeding.  Scratch marks on her face indicated she tried to defend herself. 

The victim's family expressed outrage over the alleged lack of action against other potential culprits, raising concerns about a hurried autopsy and attempts to conceal evidence.  


As a result of the high court's ruling, the case has been transferred to the CBI, with the accused, Sanjoy Roy, currently in their custody.</description>

			<title>How Tamil Nadu’s M Karunanidhi championed rights of CMs to hoist Tricolour on I-Day</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-independence-day-tamil-nadu-m-karunanidhi-cms-hoist-national-flag-13804579.html</link>
			<description>India celebrates its 78th Independence Day, a day marked by the hoisting of the national flag.  While Prime Minister hoists the flag at the Red Fort, this privilege was extended to Chief Ministers in 1974 thanks to the efforts of late DMK leader M Karunanidhi. 

He campaigned for greater state autonomy and questioned why Chief Ministers were excluded from this tradition, considering the President and Prime Minister's involvement. Karunanidhi wrote to then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,  leading to a change in practice where Governors unfurl the flag on Republic Day, and Chief Ministers on Independence Day.  This move marked a significant step in recognizing the authority and role of democratically elected state leaders.</description>

			<title>Thai court removes PM Srettha Thavisin over ethics breach. What happens next?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/thai-court-removes-pm-srettha-thavisin-over-ethics-breach-what-happens-next-13804566.html</link>
			<description>Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been removed from office by the Constitutional Court for an ethics violation. The court ruled that Srettha's appointment of a Cabinet member with a past conviction for bribery was dishonest and breached ethical standards. Srettha maintains that he was unaware of the full extent of the appointee's past and respects the court's decision.  

Parliament will now convene to choose a new prime minister.  Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, is considered a strong contender, along with other prominent figures within the ruling coalition.   Experts believe the Pheu Thai party retains an advantage in this process.</description>

			<title>Iran promised a 'harsh punishment' against Israel: What is behind the delayed attack?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iran-promised-a-harsh-punishment-against-israel-what-is-behind-the-delayed-attack-13804449.html</link>
			<description>The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr has heightened tensions between Iran and Israel. Although Iran has vowed revenge, a delayed response suggests a calculated strategy.  Internal deliberation within Iran's new government, balancing strength with diplomacy and economic interests, likely contributes to the restraint. 

Additionally, Iranian officials are mindful of the risks associated with a hasty military action, potentially escalating the conflict into a broader war. 

Iran's response could involve its network of proxy forces, potentially mirroring the missile and drone strikes launched in April in response to an Israeli embassy attack.  

The international community, particularly the US, monitors the situation closely, urging de-escalation while bolstering its military presence in the region.  Ceasefire efforts and diplomatic avenues remain, but the threat of a swift escalation persists.</description>

			<title>Independence Day 2024: Why India’s diaspora is its big gift to the developed world</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-why-indias-diaspora-is-its-big-gift-to-the-developed-world-13804511.html</link>
			<description>The Indian diaspora, the largest globally since 2010,  significantly contributes to the world economy, culture, science, and technology, particularly in the US and UK. Indians in the US are highly educated, have a high median household income, and own a significant percentage of businesses, hotels, and convenience stores.  They are also making strides in politics, with prominent figures like VP Kamala Harris and numerous members of Congress. 

In the UK, Indians are the most educated ethnic group with high home ownership and representation in professional fields. Their economic impact is also growing in Germany, where they are top earners and contributing to the stock market. Experts predict a continued rise in the economic and soft power influence of the Indian diaspora, especially with successful individuals promoting a positive image of India globally.</description>

			<title>Why Starbucks fired Indian-origin CEO Laxman Narasimhan months after appointment</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-starbucks-fired-indian-origin-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-months-after-appointment-13804446.html</link>
			<description>Starbucks has abruptly replaced CEO Laxman Narasimhan after just 18 months. Narasimhan, who joined from Reckitt in March 2023,  was tasked with reinvigorating the coffee giant.  Brian Niccol, CEO of Chipotle, will take over on September 9th.  

The sudden change comes amid underwhelming global performance, including two consecutive quarters of declining sales, and  controversies surrounding Starbucks's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.  Observers point to pressure from activist investors and internal conflicts over labor issues as contributing factors. Narasimhan's strict adherence to a 6pm work-life balance may have also been a point of contention. Starbucks hopes Niccol's experience in driving growth and innovation will lead to a more promising future.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape &amp; murder: How Dr Sandip Ghosh, the ex-principal of RG Kar Medical College, keeps getting hired</title>

			<description>The tragic rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital has triggered a massive outcry.  Former principal Dr Sandip Ghosh faces intense scrutiny for his handling of the case, initially dismissing the death as suicide and allegedly downplaying the seriousness of the incident.  Despite resigning under pressure, he was reinstated and transferred to another institution.

The Calcutta High Court has criticized Dr Ghosh's inaction, calling it a "dereliction of duty," and transferred the case to the CBI. The court also questioned the West Bengal government's quick reinstatement of Dr Ghosh, who is accused by students and doctors of mismanagement, intimidation, and  corruption.  Protests erupted at both RG Kar and the new institution, with students demanding his removal.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swat-teams-ai-powered-systems-what-goes-into-securing-new-delhi-independence-day-13804416.html</link>
			<description>Ahead of India's 78th Independence Day, Delhi has implemented extensive security measures with tens of thousands of police personnel and paramilitary forces deployed across the city.  

Sniper teams, SWAT commandos, and kite catchers are positioned at strategic locations, particularly around the Red Fort where PM Modi will address the nation.

The Delhi Metro has a two-step frisking process, and areas near the Red Fort are designated as "no kite flying zones". Traffic restrictions and diversions are also in place.

High-tech security measures include 700 AI-powered CCTV cameras with features like facial and number plate recognition, abandoned object detection, and live video feeds monitored from a control centre.</description>

			<title>What are MQ-9B drones that India is pushing to buy from US? How soon before New Delhi gets them?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mq-9b-drones-india-us-deal-game-changer-defence-boost-13804435.html</link>
			<description>India is accelerating negotiations to acquire 31 MQ-9B SeaGuardian and SkyGuardian drones from the US.  The estimated $3.99 billion deal, likely finalized by December, aims to bolster India's defense capabilities against perceived threats from China and Pakistan. The MQ-9B is a versatile drone capable of long-endurance surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strikes. 

India's forces will use the drones for intelligence gathering and target engagement both in the Indian Ocean Region and along land borders. The drones' stealth capabilities, long operational range, and ability to function in various weather conditions make them a significant asset for India's military strategies.</description>

			<title>Will a new round of Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks culminate in a deal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-a-new-round-of-israel-hamas-ceasefire-talks-culminate-in-a-deal-13804408.html</link>
			<description>Renewed ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to begin, aiming to end the 10-month conflict and secure the release of 110 hostages.  Despite an initial proposal by the US, key issues remain unresolved.

Israel is concerned about Hamas' potential to prolong negotiations indefinitely, while Hamas fears a renewed Israeli offensive after the release of vulnerable hostages.  Further complicating matters, Israel seeks to maintain control over border areas and veto power over prisoner releases, demands Hamas rejects.

The killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, blamed on Israel, and a subsequent strike on Hezbollah have heightened regional tensions, diverting attention from the ceasefire efforts.  Both Netanyahu and Hamas' new leader, Yahya Sinwar, face political pressures that may incentivize them to prolong the war.</description>

			<description>Apolitical dispute erupted in Delhi regarding the flag hoisting ceremony for Independence Day.  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, currently in jail, proposed Education Minister Atishi to unfurl the flag on his behalf. However, the Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, rejecting the proposal, nominated Home Minister Kailash Gahlot for the task. AAP termed the LG's decision an attempt to sabotage the elected government, while the LG's office maintained that Kejriwal's direction was "legally invalid"  under prison rules. This incident is likely to exacerbate the ongoing power struggle between the AAP and the LG.</description>

			<description>Facing low approval ratings, political scandals and economic challenges, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has announced he will not seek re-election as the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).  This decision opens the way for a leadership contest to determine Japan's next prime minister. Several prominent figures, including former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Digital Transformation Minister Taro Kono, LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi, Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, are seen as potential successors. The outcome of the LDP leadership race will significantly impact Japan's political future at a time of increasing regional security threats and economic instability.</description>

			<title>Why is August 15 National Mourning Day in Bangladesh? Why has interim government scrapped the holiday?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-crisis-sheikh-hasina-august-15-national-mourning-day-holiday-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-assassination-13804370.html</link>
			<description>Following her resignation and fleeing to India, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a statement urging the nation to observe August 15 as 'National Mourning Day' to commemorate the assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  This call comes shortly after the interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, decided to cancel the national holiday.

The decision to scrap the holiday has been attributed to public anger towards Hasina, fueled by recent protests that saw the looting and burning of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and the toppling of Rahman's statue. The move is also seen as an attempt to appease various political parties, with some supporting the cancellation and others advocating for the holiday to be retained.  


Hasina's appeal for observance despite the government's directive raises concerns about potential further unrest and instability in the country.</description>

			<title>Independence Day 2024: Why Pakistan celebrates freedom a day before India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-pakistan-august-14-day-freedom-india-13803847.html</link>
			<description>Despite Indian Independence Day being on August 15, Pakistan celebrates it on August 14. The Indian Independence Act of 1947  set the date as August 15 for both nations. 

Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder, acknowledged August 15 as their Independence Day in his historic address. 

In 1948, Pakistan shifted its Independence Day to August 14. Theories suggest this was to differentiate their celebration from India's, although some historians believe Pakistan's leaders sought to establish a distinct national identity.</description>

			<title>Why is New Zealand seeing a record number of its citizens leaving?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-new-zealand-seeing-a-record-number-of-its-citizens-leaving-13804290.html</link>
			<description>Record numbers of New Zealand citizens are leaving the country, with over 80,000 departing from January to June 2024. This figure is nearly double pre-pandemic levels, driven by factors like high unemployment, persistent high interest rates, and sluggish economic growth. A significant proportion, 38%, of those departing are aged 18-30, seeking better opportunities in countries like Australia, the UK, and elsewhere. The decline in outward migration coincides with a decrease in new arrivals to New Zealand,  possibly indicating a softening economy and reduced attractiveness for foreign nationals.</description>

			<title>Why is there a crackdown on air-conditioners in Italy's Portofino?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-there-a-crackdown-on-air-conditioners-in-italys-portofino-13804243.html</link>
			<description>Portofino, a picturesque Italian Riviera town, is facing a heatwave challenge. Despite its affluence, the town has a ban on visible air conditioning units to preserve its aesthetic charm, being part of a national park. As temperatures soar, residents have discreetly installed ACs, leading to neighborly tension fueled by reporting each other. Mayor Matteo Viacava, while acknowledging the need for ACs, emphasizes the importance of protecting Portofino's beauty. Violators face hefty fines, forcing residents to navigate a heated debate between comfort and conservation. This crackdown, part of a broader effort to maintain Portofino's picturesque appearance, also targets satellite dishes, highlighting the ongoing tension between modernization and preservation.</description>

			<title>YouTuber stays awake for almost 250 hours. What sleep deprivation can do to the body</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/youtuber-no-sleep-livestream-sleep-deprivation-effects-on-body-13804160.html</link>
			<description>Popular YouTuber Norme, aiming for a "world record" of no sleep for 12 days, was shut down by YouTube after over 250 hours. 

His stream, which showed him displaying concerning signs of sleep deprivation like hallucinations and incoherence, was removed 12 hours before his target, violating YouTube's Community Guidelines against harmful and dangerous content. Despite the ban, Norme continued his attempt on the platform Kick. This record,  previously set in 1986 at 18 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes,  is not recognized by Guinness World Records due to the severe health risks associated with prolonged sleep deprivation.</description>

			<title>From the sepoy mutiny to Quit India, the key movements that shaped India’s freedom struggle</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/from-the-sepoy-mutiny-to-quit-india-the-key-movements-that-shaped-indias-freedom-struggle-13804095.html</link>
			<description>India's journey to independence was marked by numerous pivotal movements. The 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, though unsuccessful, ignited the spirit of independence.  The Swadeshi Movement, sparked by the partition of Bengal, promoted Indian goods and national pride.  Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha led the way in non-violent resistance, which gained momentum with the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920-22, despite ending abruptly after the Chauri Chaura incident.  The Civil Disobedience Movement, protesting the salt tax , further consolidated the movement towards independence. The Quit India Movement in 1942, with its powerful "Do or Die" slogan, brought the nation closer to its goal, finally achieved on August 15th, 1947.</description>

			<title>How are Yemen's Houthi rebels driving up coffee prices in Europe?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-yemens-houthi-rebels-driving-up-coffee-prices-in-europe-13804191.html</link>
			<description>Coffee prices in Europe have risen sharply due to a combination of factors. Geopolitical instability, with Yemen's Houthi rebels disrupting shipping routes in the Red Sea, has significantly increased transportation costs.  Adverse weather conditions and conflict in Ukraine have also impacted coffee production and fertilizer supplies.  

New EU regulations aimed at tackling deforestation require extensive certification processes for coffee producers, adding further costs. While increased production may moderate prices in the short term, long-term concerns remain due to climate change threats to coffee cultivation.</description>

			<description>India is about to celebrate its 78th Independence Day on August 15, commemorating the sacrifices made during the freedom struggle.  Britain granted India independence in 1947, after nearly 200 years of rule, but the process resulted in the partition of India and Pakistan. Interestingly, Pakistan also gained independence on August 15th. However, Lord Mountbatten,  to be present at both nations' power transfer ceremonies,  shifted Pakistan's independence day celebration to August 14th.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraines-incursion-into-russia-why-are-ukrainian-vehicles-marked-with-white-triangles-13804213.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border incursion into Russia's Kursk region, marking a significant escalation in the war.  Ukrainian forces, displaying white triangles on their vehicles, have established control over a significant area and are engaging in fierce fighting with Russian troops.  The incursion aims to stretch and deplete Russian resources, inflict losses, and destabilize the situation within Russia. While the exact goals remain unclear, the attack highlights Ukraine's continued offensive capabilities and its determination to challenge Russia on its own soil.  The international community remains largely silent on the operation, but experts believe it sends a powerful message of Ukrainian resolve and emphasizes that the war is now directly impacting Russian territory.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-case-doctors-strike-patients-suffer-opd-services-admission-surgeries-13804149.html</link>
			<description>Junior doctors across India are on strike following the brutal rape and murder of a colleague in Kolkata.  Their demands include better security measures and expedited justice in the case. The strike has caused disruptions to OPD services and elective surgeries at government hospitals, leaving patients stranded.  

Doctors are protesting against inadequate safety measures, highlighting the systemic lack of protection for medical professionals, particularly women. They are demanding a fast-track judicial inquiry into the Kolkata incident and the resignation of several hospital authorities.  The strike has resulted in significant inconvenience for patients, many of whom are forced to return home without consultations or delayed surgeries.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-why-are-multinational-corporations-fleeing-pakistan-13804087.html</link>
			<description>Pakistan is experiencing a decline in multinational corporations (MNCs) due to several factors.

Companies like TotalEnergies, Telenor, and Shell Oil have exited the market, citing regulatory instability, economic challenges, and political turmoil. 

High taxation, complex regulations, and limited profit repatriation have deterred investment. Political instability and ineffective governance have further worsened the situation, leading to a loss of confidence in Pakistan's business environment.

Experts urge Pakistan to implement reforms to create a stable and transparent business climate to attract new investment and reverse the trend of MNC departures.</description>

			<title>Iran is set to attack Israel. Here’s how it could go down</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iran-is-set-to-attack-israel-heres-how-it-could-go-down-13804112.html</link>
			<description>With heightened tensions in the Middle East, Iran is preparing a response to the recent assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh. While the exact timing and scale of the attack remain unclear, experts believe Iran will likely launch a missile and drone assault, similar to the one in April that was largely neutralized by Israel's defense systems. 

Experts suggest Iran's response will be calculated to avoid escalating into a full-scale war, potentially coordinating with Hezbollah. Despite reassurances from Iran that its actions won't jeopardize the Gaza ceasefire, Israel remains on high alert, vowing to inflict a heavy price on any aggressor. International efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation and prevent a wider regional conflict.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-and-murder-how-hospital-misled-doctors-family-13804031.html</link>
			<description>A trainee doctor was found murdered at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in India.  The victim, a 31-year-old, was found semi-naked in a lecture hall with injuries. Initial reports suggested she died by suicide, but her family claimed they were not allowed to see her body initially and later discovered evidence of sexual assault.  

The autopsy report revealed she suffered a severe beating, strangulation, and injuries to her face, private parts, and other parts of her body. Police have arrested Sanjay Roy, a community volunteer, and charged him with rape and murder.  

The incident sparked outrage and protests, leading to the resignation of the hospital principal and the superintendent. Resident doctors across India have gone on strike, demanding justice and safety in hospitals.</description>

			<description>Due to record-breaking temperatures in China, protective films on car paints are inflating, making the vehicles appear "pregnant." This phenomenon is caused by the extreme heat compromising the adhesive backing of the car wraps, leading to bubbling and swelling.  

Experts recommend using high-quality wraps with strong adhesives and parking in shaded areas to minimize sun exposure. While the sight may seem humorous, it highlights the increasing impact of climate change on everyday life in China.</description>

			<title>As the Olympic flame extinguishes, what awaits Macron in France’s political quagmire?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/as-the-olympic-flame-extinguishes-what-awaits-macron-in-france-political-quagmire-13804019.html</link>
			<description>The success of the Paris 2024 Olympics provided French President Emmanuel Macron with a brief political reprieve.  However, the aftermath of the Games presents significant challenges.   

Macron faces the task of appointing a prime minister who can navigate a fractured parliament resulting from the recent legislative elections. This appointment is crucial as France must present a budget plan to meet the European Commission's deficit reduction demands by September 20.  The need for consensus-building in a divided parliament complicates this task.  


Despite the Olympic triumph, deep-seated political issues and Macron's low approval ratings persist. 
The coming months will be crucial for Macron as he attempts to address these challenges and secure his political future.</description>

			<title>Liquid water found on Mars: Does this mean there could be life on the Red Planet?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/liquid-water-mars-nasa-insight-lander-13804052.html</link>
			<description>Seismic data from NASA's InSight Lander revealed evidence of a vast reservoir of liquid water within Mars' midcrust, potentially exceeding the volume of ancient Martian oceans. This water, estimated to be seven to twelve miles deep, is believed to have seeped from the surface billions of years ago when Mars was wetter. While this discovery doesn't confirm the existence of life on Mars, it suggests potentially habitable environments in the planet's subsurface. 

Accessing this water would be incredibly challenging, but it provides valuable insights into Mars' history and the planet's potential for harboring life.</description>

			<description>Lt General Faiz Hameed, former chief of Pakistan's ISI, has been arrested and faces court martial proceedings. This unprecedented move stems from allegations of misconduct related to a housing scheme scandal known as the Top City case. Hameed is accused of extorting money from a housing development company owner and violating army regulations after his retirement. 

The army's action is seen as a crackdown on allies of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, with whom Hameed had close ties. The arrest is viewed as a warning to both serving and retired military personnel against challenging army authority. It also sends a message to the public, amidst growing anti-army sentiment, that the military will hold its members accountable.</description>

			<title>What is DDOS attack that delayed Donald Trump’s interview with Elon Musk?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ddos-attack-delayed-donald-trumps-interview-elon-musk-13803985.html</link>
			<description>Elon Musk announced that a major DDoS attack targeted X, preventing his scheduled interview with former US President Donald Trump from airing on time. While Musk mentioned the possibility of a limited live audience and a later online posting, the attack significantly disrupted the event. DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a target's systems with traffic, rendering them inaccessible to legitimate users.  Musk acknowledged the significant impact of the attack, which showcased the vulnerability of online platforms to cyber disruptions.</description>

			<title>The Trump-Musk chat on X needed a fact-check: What were the false claims the former US president made?</title>

			<description>During a highly publicized interview on X, former President Donald Trump made numerous claims about various topics that, upon closer inspection, proved to be inaccurate or misleading. He exaggerated border crossing numbers, misrepresented VP Kamala Harris's role regarding immigration, and provided false figures about inflation and  impending sea-level rise. 

Trump also presented a skewed view of his economic record, unsupported claims about China's role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and made incorrect statements about the number of countries possessing nuclear weapons. He persisted in his false assertion that the 2020 election was rigged and inaccurately claimed that European nations were not contributing their fair share to Ukraine's aid.  The interview highlighted a pattern of unsubstantiated assertions and mischaracterizations of facts.</description>

			<title>‘Why is he lisping?’: How the Trump-Musk chat has raised questions about ex-US president’s health</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/donald-trump-elon-musk-interview-lisping-voice-slurring-health-concerns-us-presidential-elections-13803976.html</link>
			<description>During his two-hour interview with Elon Musk on X, Donald Trump's voice drew significant attention. Many viewers commented on a noticeable lisp, leading to speculation about the former president's health. The incident reignited concerns about Trump's fitness for office at age 78, coinciding with polls that suggest a growing number of Americans believe he's too old to serve. While Trump's campaign dismissed the concerns, questions remain about his health status given a lack of transparency regarding his medical records and condition updates.</description>

			<description>The much-anticipated conversation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk,  intended for independent voters,  was delayed due to technical issues attributed to a cyber attack.  

The dialogue, while friendly,  provided little insight into Trump's plans for a potential second term. Notable points include Trump's  suggestion that Musk could join his administration, his proposal to disband the Department of Education,  and his praise for leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un.

Trump's speech drew attention for its occasional lisp, sparking comparisons to President Biden's stutter.  The former president also expressed interest in establishing an Iron Dome missile defense system in the US,  modeled after Israel's system.  
 
Trump made a return to X (formerly Twitter) prior to the interview, marking his first posts on the platform in a year.</description>

			<title>Greece wildfires spread: What's behind the deadly blazes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/greece-wildfires-spread-whats-behind-the-deadly-blazes-13803881.html</link>
			<description>A massive 30-kilometre wildfire is raging near Athens, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate.  The fire, fueled by Greece's hottest June and July on record, has burned homes and caused power outages in the capital.  Scorching winds hampered firefighting efforts, prompting Greece to seek assistance from other European countries. Although wildfires are common in Greece due to its climate, experts say climate change is exacerbating the situation, making the Mediterranean a hot spot for such disasters. 

Temperatures are expected to remain high, raising concerns about further fires. Greece's vulnerability to climate change, coupled with its geography, makes the country particularly susceptible to the devastating effects of wildfires.</description>

			<title>Red, yellow, green and white? Why traffic lights could be getting a new colour</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/red-yellow-green-and-white-why-traffic-lights-could-be-getting-a-new-colour-13803832.html</link>
			<description>Experts propose adding a fourth colour, white, to traffic lights to accommodate driverless cars. This system would improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency.  While human drivers rely on red, yellow, and green lights, autonomous vehicles would respond to a single white light, acting as an instruction to  continue unless directed otherwise.  Dr. Ali Hajbabaie, an engineering professor at North Carolina State University, conducted simulations suggesting a decrease of over 25% in intersection delays with widespread adoption of driverless cars.  

Though years away from implementation, the idea is gaining traction as artificial intelligence and self-driving technology advance.</description>

			<title>After the Paris Games, comes the ‘Olympic comedown’ for athletes. What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/after-the-paris-games-comes-the-olympic-comedown-for-athletes-what-is-it-13803793.html</link>
			<description>The end of the Olympic Games can trigger a sense of emptiness and disorientation in athletes, known as "Olympic comedown." This feeling stems from the abrupt shift from a high-pressure, highly-structured environment back to ordinary life. 

The "high" experienced during the Games, linked to adrenaline release, can lead to a similar feeling of withdrawal as drug use. The intense media attention and public adulation also contribute to the emotional shift.  

Many athletes struggle with finding their identity and purpose after the Games end.  Strategies for coping include accepting the completion of the goal, celebrating achievements, reflecting on the experience, and engaging in pleasurable activities missed during training.</description>

			<title>Why has Kamala Harris’ laugh become a subject of debate in US election?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-has-kamala-harris-laugh-become-a-subject-of-debate-in-us-election-13803790.html</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris's distinctive laughter has become a target for Republican attacks, with Donald Trump and his allies attempting to portray it as evidence of her being "crazy" or "inappropriate." This strategy echoes past attempts to undermine female politicians by criticizing their expressions of emotion, such as Hillary Clinton's "cackle." 

Experts suggest that voters are more aware of such misogynistic and racist tactics and are unlikely to be swayed by them.  They argue that Harris's laughter, often described as genuine and uninhibited, reflects her strength and refusal to conform to traditional expectations of female leaders.</description>

			<title>Was statue of Pakistan army’s surrender in 1971 Liberation War in Bangladesh vandalised?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pakistan-army-1971-surrender-1971-bangladesh-liberation-war-statue-vandalised-truth-13803788.html</link>
			<description>Congress MP Shashi Tharoor claimed that statues at the 1971 Shaheed Memorial Complex in Bangladesh depicting the surrender of Pakistani soldiers to Indian forces had been destroyed by "anti-India vandals." Tharoor’s claim was based on images showing figures on the ground, which he interpreted as broken statues.  

However, this claim has been challenged by others who point out that the statues are intentionally designed in a state of prostration, meant to depict the surrender and atrocities committed during the Liberation War.  Pictures from 2018 show similar depictions at the memorial, and the Bangladesh Army maintains custody of the site.</description>

			<title>Independence Day 2024: How India and Pakistan divided money, military and an elephant amid partition</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-india-pakistan-assets-partition-13803755.html</link>
			<description>Following India's independence in 1947, the monumental task of dividing assets between India and Pakistan commenced. A committee, the Partition Council, was formed, comprised of representatives from both the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League. 

The division of the military proved particularly complex, with approximately two-thirds staying with India and one-third allocated to Pakistan.  The financial division saw Pakistan receiving 17.5% of British India's assets and liabilities.  

Besides military and financial assets, movable assets were divided in an 80-20 ratio, encompassing everything from furniture to stationery. Even antiquities and animals, such as the elephant Joymoni, were subject to this division process.  Despite the immense challenges, India and Pakistan successfully completed this intricate task of asset division, albeit amidst diplomatic disputes and lingering financial claims between the two nations.</description>

			<title>All that glitters is not gold: What’s the real value of an Olympic medal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/all-that-glitters-is-not-gold-whats-the-real-value-of-an-olympic-medal-13803664.html</link>
			<description>Olympic medals, despite their prestige, hold relatively low intrinsic value due to their composition. The Paris 2024 gold medal, for example, contains only 6 grams of gold and is worth approximately $1,027.  The value increases due to the history and achievements associated with them. Examples include medals from the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and the 1936 Berlin Olympics, which have fetched millions at auction.  

The 2024 Paris medals are unique for incorporating iron from the Eiffel Tower, adding cultural significance.</description>

			<title>World Elephant Day: How railway tracks have become graveyards for jumbos in India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/world-elephant-day-indian-railway-tracks-jumbos-death-13803684.html</link>
			<description>India has a significant population of Asiatic elephants, which are unfortunately threatened by collisions with trains. Over 200 elephants have lost their lives in these accidents in the past decade.  

To address this issue, authorities are implementing various measures. These include deploying AI-based surveillance systems, like "Gajraj," to detect elephant movement near tracks and alert drivers. Additionally, states are constructing "animal flyovers" and utilizing drones for monitoring elephant movement.

While these efforts are crucial, challenges remain.  Vast railway networks, elephant corridors intersecting tracks, and prioritizing development over conservation pose ongoing issues. Suggestions include restricting train operations at night, regulating train speeds in forested areas, and providing adequate food and water within forests to reduce elephant movement near tracks.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/protests-in-us-uk-over-attacks-on-hindus-how-it-became-an-international-issue-13803688.html</link>
			<description>Tensions have erupted in Bangladesh following the ousting of the Sheikh Hasina government, with reports of widespread violence and attacks targeting the country's Hindu population. 

Protests demanding an end to the violence have taken place both in Bangladesh and internationally, with rallies held in the US and UK. In Bangladesh, crowds have gathered in cities like Dhaka and Chittagong, demanding the government protect religious minorities.  The US and India have expressed concern over the situation, calling for an investigation into the attacks and the protection of all citizens. 
 
The interim government has acknowledged the attacks and pledged to address the issue, promising to provide medical aid to the injured and compensation to the families of those who have died. However, the situation remains volatile, with calls for the apprehension of those responsible for the violence and demands for greater protections for minorities.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-ukraine-incursion-of-kursk-has-left-putin-humiliated-13803631.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine launched a large-scale incursion into Russia's Kursk region, marking a major escalation in the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces, supported by tanks and artillery, advanced deep into Russian territory, capturing strategic points and forcing mass evacuations. This audacious operation has significantly embarrassed the Kremlin and exposed vulnerabilities in Russia's defenses. Despite claiming victories against Ukrainian columns, the Kremlin faces growing pressure as Ukrainian troops remain entrenched in Russian territory.  The incursion has boosted Ukrainian morale, challenged Russia's narrative of invincibility, and forced Russia to divert resources from other fronts.</description>

			<title>What are the new allegations Hindenburg has levelled against Sebi chief and Adani?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hindenburg-research-sebi-chief-madhabi-puri-buch-allegations-adani-group-13803652.html</link>
			<description>Hindenburg Research, a US-based investor-activist firm, has made fresh allegations against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch, claiming they held stakes in offshore entities linked to Adani Group. These accusations stem from Hindenburg's revisiting of its earlier report on the Adani Group, which alleged wrongdoing and stock manipulation. 

The Buchs deny the allegations, stating their finances are transparent and the investment in the offshore fund was made in 2015,  before Madhabi Buch's appointment to Sebi. They claim it was based on trust in the fund manager, Anil Ahuja, a childhood friend of Dhaval Buch.

Hindenburg, however, questions the Sebi chief's handling of Adani-related investigations given her previous investments.  The company also highlights inconsistencies in the Buchs' statement regarding the status of one of their consulting companies.

Despite denials from both the Buchs and Adani Group, the allegations have shaken investor confidence, leading to a significant drop in Adani group stocks. This has resulted in considerable market capitalisation losses for the conglomerate.</description>

			<title>Mahmoud Abbas to visit Russia today: What do we know about the relationship between Moscow and Palestine?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mahmoud-abbas-russia-visit-relationship-between-moscow-and-palestine-13802956.html</link>
			<description>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will visit Russia from August 12 to 14, marking his first trip to the country since 2021.  The relationship between Palestine and Russia dates back to 1974, with Russia consistently supporting the "two-state solution" and Palestinian statehood.

While Russia positions itself as a neutral mediator, its ties with Hamas and its recent actions in the UN Security Council have complicated its role. Abbas aims to discuss international developments, coordinate positions, and strengthen bilateral relations during his visit.   Experts, however, remain skeptical about Russia's ability to deliver a breakthrough on the Palestinian issue, given its limited influence and the ongoing complexities in the region.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh crisis: What could the US gain from acquiring St. Martin's Island?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-crisis-what-could-the-us-gain-from-acquiring-st-martins-island-13803587.html</link>
			<description>St. Martin's Island, a small Bangladeshi coral island, has become a geopolitical focal point due to its strategic location near vital maritime trade routes. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina claimed that the US sought to acquire the island in exchange for political support, an allegation denied by her son and the US State Department. 

The island's strategic importance stems from its potential to provide oversight of the Bay of Bengal, offering valuable surveillance capabilities for global powers like the US and China.  While Bangladesh asserts its sovereignty over the island, its proximity to Myanmar and the Rohingya crisis have added to regional tensions and maritime boundary disputes.  The potential for a US military presence on the island raises concerns for neighboring countries like India and China, adding another layer to the complex geopolitical dynamics in the region.</description>

			<title>Civic volunteer, history of drinking, had porn on phone: Inside details about the accused in Kolkata hospital rape-murder case</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-hospital-rape-murder-civic-volunteer-accused-sanjay-roy-crime-13803590.html</link>
			<description>A 31-year-old trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata was found murdered on the hospital premises after she was sexually assaulted. The accused, Sanjay Roy, was a civic volunteer with access to the hospital and had a history of alcohol abuse and alleged misconduct.

Roy was arrested after CCTV footage showed him entering the building around 4 am and leaving 40 minutes later, without his bluetooth device which was found near the crime scene.  

He allegedly went to sleep after the crime and attempted to destroy evidence by washing his clothes, but bloodstains were found on his shoes. The autopsy confirmed sexual assault and multiple injury marks on the victim's body.  West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has vowed to seek the death penalty for Roy and has opened the possibility of a CBI investigation.</description>

			<title>Explained: How USA's Jordan Chiles lost bronze medal for floor exercise at Paris Olympics</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/sports/olympics-2024-how-usas-jordan-chiles-lost-bronze-medal-for-floor-exercise-13803479.html</link>
			<description>A scoring controversy dominated the women's floor exercise at the Paris Olympics, involving Jordan Chiles, Ana Barbosu, and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea. Initially, Chiles earned bronze after a successful appeal by her coach, which boosted her score. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) voided the appeal due to procedural errors, resulting in Barbosu regaining the bronze medal. 

The decision sparked debate, with some criticizing the judging and others defending Chiles. Maneca-Voinea, who finished fourth after a disputed penalty, also expressed her dissatisfaction with the scoring. Ultimately, the FIG reallocated the medals, awarding Barbosu bronze, while the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee will work to return the medal to Chiles.</description>

			<title>Gen X and millennials at greater risk of cancer than older generations. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/gen-x-and-millennials-at-greater-risk-of-cancer-than-older-generations-heres-why-13802867.html</link>
			<description>A new study by the American Cancer Society reveals an alarming increase in cancer incidence among Gen X and millennials.  The study, analyzing 24 million American cancer patients over a 20-year period, identified 17 types of cancer, including small intestine, kidney, and pancreatic cancer, as becoming more common in younger generations.  Researchers link this trend to lifestyle factors like obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and increased consumption of ultra-processed foods.  

While some cancers, like lung and melanoma, are declining, the rise of other cancers highlights the need for further research to understand the causes and develop effective prevention strategies.</description>

			<title>Is Mercury retrograde really to blame for life's chaos? What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-mercury-retrograde-really-to-blame-for-lifes-chaos-what-is-it-13802094.html</link>
			<description>Mercury retrograde, an astrological phenomenon observed when the planet Mercury appears to move backward in its orbit, is believed by some to cause disruptions in communication, technology, and travel.  This illusion occurs due to Mercury's faster orbit around the sun.

During retrograde periods, astrologers advise caution in decision-making, as miscommunications and technical difficulties are more prevalent. Travel plans may face delays or complications, and relationships can experience strain. 

Although scientifically unsupported, many believe Mercury retrograde coincides with increased chaos and challenges, prompting strategies like double-checking communications, avoiding major decisions, and remaining flexible.</description>

			<title>Cats vs toddlers: Are Chinese youth choosing pets over kids?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-pet-population-young-children-report-13802532.html</link>
			<description>A Goldman Sachs report predicts that China's urban pet population will surpass its young child population by 2030.  The report attributes this trend to declining birth rates and increased pet ownership among younger generations. 

By 2030, the urban pet population is projected to reach 70 million, nearly double the number of children under four years old. This surge in pet ownership is expected to fuel the pet food market, with Goldman Sachs estimating it to reach $12 billion by 2030. Cat ownership is predicted to outpace dog ownership due to space constraints.  


China's demographic crisis, marked by a shrinking population and low birth rates, is a key factor driving this shift.  Experts cite economic concerns, high living costs, and changing societal norms as contributing factors to the decline in childbearing.</description>

			<description>Bangladesh ousted its long-serving prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, following weeks of protests culminating in an army coup. Hasina fled to India, which has accepted her request for refuge. 

A caretaker government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is now in charge. The situation remains uncertain regarding the future of Bangladeshi politics and if Hasina will return to power. The UK is dealing with escalating tensions and far-right violence after a series of child stabbings triggered anti-immigrant riots. Anti-racism protesters have countered the extremist demonstrations, but the situation remains volatile.</description>

			<title>6 murals in 7 days. What's street artist Banksy up to in the UK?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/6-murals-in-7-days-whats-street-artist-banksy-up-to-in-the-uk-13803176.html</link>
			<description>Across London, Banksy has created a series of six animal murals in silhouette, sparking widespread speculation about their meaning.  From a precarious goat to elephants peering from bricked-up windows, the artworks have generated intense public interest. 

These recent creations deviate from Banksy's usual practice of releasing work in staggered intervals, leading to theories about their potential connection to ongoing social and political issues, including global conflict, climate change, and domestic unrest. While Banksy remains silent on the intended message, art critics have offered various interpretations, with some suggesting the murals reflect concerns about environmental crises and others viewing them as commentary on social chaos.</description>

			<description>A Voepass flight tragically crashed in Vinhedo, Brazil, killing all 61 people on board. The ATR-72 aircraft was en route from Cascavel to Sao Paulo when it exhibited erratic descent, plummeting 17,000 feet in a minute before crashing into a residential area. 

Preliminary investigations suggest possible causes such as ice buildup, engine failure, or a malfunction in the flight control systems.  The plane's black boxes have been recovered, and experts will analyze them to determine the exact cause of the crash. Brazilian authorities, including the Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos (CENIPA), are leading the investigation.</description>

			<title>Your microwave is full of bacteria. Does it make it a health hazard?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/your-microwave-is-full-of-bacteria-does-it-make-it-a-health-hazard-13802936.html</link>
			<description>A study found a surprising diversity of bacteria in microwaves from homes, offices, and laboratories. While most were common kitchen bacteria, some genera like Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas, pose potential health risks.  These resilient microbes  adapted to the extreme conditions within microwaves,  including temperature fluctuations, radiation, and dryness. 

Research revealed that microwaves harbor similar bacterial populations to kitchen surfaces, suggesting they  require no special adaptations to survive. The study recommends regular disinfecting with bleach or a disinfectant spray, along with wiping down surfaces after each use, to minimize bacterial growth and potential health risks.</description>

			<description>The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, introduced by the Centre, proposes over 30 changes to the 1995 Waqf Act, sparking controversy and opposition accusations of an attack on the Constitution.

Meanwhile, ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina sought asylum in the UK but faced roadblocks. Her stay in India, initially intended as a stopover, may be extended due to this. 

In legal news, Manish Sisodia, former Delhi deputy chief minister, was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the Delhi liquor policy scam case after spending over a year and a half in jail. 

Lastly, wrestler Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the Paris Olympics due to weight concerns led to criticism and a subsequent decision to retire.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/america-is-facing-a-major-blood-shortage-heres-why-heat-is-to-blame-13802979.html</link>
			<description>The US blood supply has dropped by over 25% since July 1, primarily due to a record heatwave that caused the cancellation or low turnout at blood drives. The Red Cross, which provides 40% of the nation's blood, estimates a deficit of 19,000 donations in July. This shortage is particularly critical for type O blood, as it is the most common and universal donor. 

Experts warn that the situation could worsen as hurricane season intensifies, potentially disrupting further donations. The Red Cross encourages people to donate blood, offering a $20 Amazon gift card as an incentive.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-netherlands-has-prisons-that-are-too-empty-heres-why-13802844.html</link>
			<description>The Netherlands faces an unexpected challenge: overcrowded prisons are a thing of the past, replaced by a declining prison population. This trend is attributed to shorter sentences, particularly for non-violent crimes, and a strong emphasis on rehabilitation over punishment.  

The Dutch justice system prioritizes alternatives to incarceration, such as electronic tagging and specialized treatment programs for individuals with mental health issues. This innovative approach has led to a significant reduction in prison sentences and the repurposing of former correctional facilities for other social needs.</description>

			<title>Can mayonnaise hold the key to unlocking nuclear fusion? Scientists think so...</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-mayonnaise-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-nuclear-fusion-scientists-think-so-13802920.html</link>
			<description>Researchers at Lehigh University are using mayonnaise to study the challenges of nuclear fusion. Mayonnaise, behaving like a solid under normal conditions but flowing under pressure,  mimics the behavior of plasma, the state of matter needed for fusion. They are specifically investigating Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which can hinder the efficiency of fusion reactions.  

By observing how mayonnaise flows under pressure and the instabilities it develops, the researchers aim to understand and potentially control these instabilities in real fusion capsules. This could lead to more efficient fusion energy production.</description>

			<title>Mirabai Chanu says she lost Olympic medal due to periods. Here’s how athletes manage menstruation</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mirabai-chanu-paris-olympic-medal-periods-how-athletes-manage-menstruation-13802890.html</link>
			<description>Several athletes, including Indian weightlifter Mirabai Chanu, have spoken about how menstruation impacts their performance.  Menstrual cycles can bring on symptoms like pain, cramps, weakness, and sleeplessness, which can affect an athlete's training and competition. 

Fluctuations in hormones can also contribute to muscle injuries and changes in body composition.  Studies have shown that female athletes are more prone to injuries during certain phases of their cycle, particularly those involving ovulation and menstruation. 

To manage these challenges, some athletes use period tracking apps, modify their training regimes, and consider hormonal contraceptives. However, these methods also come with potential side effects. 

Experts emphasize the importance of rest, proper nutrition, and open communication between athletes and coaches to ensure optimal performance and well-being.</description>

			<title>Why is S Jaishankar's Male visit significant for India-Maldives ties?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-s-jaishankars-male-visit-significant-for-india-maldives-ties-13802884.html</link>
			<description>Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is on a three-day visit to the Maldives, marking the first high-level visit since President Mohamed Muizzu took office.  The visit aims to strengthen bilateral ties and explore avenues for further cooperation.  

Previous tense relations arising from Muizzu's pro-China stance and his campaign on an ‘India out’ platform appear to be easing. The visit follows Muizzu's trip to India for the swearing-in of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and coincides with positive developments such as India extending a $50 million interest-free loan to the Maldives and lifting export restrictions on essential goods. 


Observers suggest Muizzu may adopt a more balanced foreign policy approach given the Maldives' economic challenges.</description>

			<title>Is a megaquake coming to Japan? How ready is the country for it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-megaquake-nankai-trough-tremors-asia-scientists-warning-13802822.html</link>
			<description>Following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake off Kyushu, Japan's Meteorological Agency issued its first-ever "megaquake" warning.  

The warning indicates a heightened risk of a major earthquake near the Nankai Trough, with the potential for widespread damage and high tsunami waves. 

While no immediate evacuation is advised, authorities urge residents to review quake preparedness plans. Japan's reputation for resilience stems from strict building codes enforced after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. 

Structures are designed to withstand significant shaking, incorporating reinforcing techniques and shock-absorbing materials.   Despite these measures, experts acknowledge  uncertainty about the country's preparedness for a major quake, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of such events.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/terror-threat-at-taylor-swifts-vienna-concerts-who-are-the-isis-inspired-teen-suspects-13802739.html</link>
			<description>Three teenage suspects were arrested in Austria for plotting a terror attack at Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. The 19-year-old suspect, described as being radicalized by Islamic State ideology, confessed to planning an attack using explosives and knives.  Austrian authorities seized a trove of materials from his residence including chemicals, explosives, knives, and counterfeit money.  

Two other suspects, aged 17 and 15, were also detained. The 17-year-old had allegedly secured a job at the concert venue and was found to have Islamic State and Al Qaeda material at his home. The 15-year-old was in contact with both suspects and is being questioned.  The concerts were canceled as a result of the threat.</description>

			<title>NYT calls violence against Hindus in Bangladesh ‘revenge attacks’: How Western media gets the India story wrong</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nyt-violence-against-hindus-bangladesh-revenge-attacks-how-western-media-gets-the-india-story-wrong-13802799.html</link>
			<description>The New York Times faced criticism for its headline on violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, which initially labeled the attacks as "revenge attacks" following the exit of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 

The headline was widely condemned on social media, with many accusing the NYT of implying that the Hindu community provoked the violence. The newspaper later revised the headline, removing the word "revenge." 

This is not the first time the NYT has sparked controversy with its coverage of India. Past incidents include publishing a cartoon deemed racist in 2014 and facing accusations of bias in articles about press freedom in Kashmir and the 2016 JNU protests.</description>

			<title>What does Manish Sisodia's bail in excise policy case mean for AAP?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-does-manish-sisodias-bail-in-excise-policy-case-mean-for-aap-13802804.html</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to AAP leader Manish Sisodia, who had been in custody for 17 months in connection with the Delhi excise policy case. 

The court  ruled that Sisodia's right to a speedy trial had been violated and that keeping him incarcerated for an extended period without trial was unjust.  

Sisodia's release is seen as a significant victory for the AAP, particularly as it faces challenges in governing Delhi and prepares for upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi and Haryana.  

The BJP, however, maintains that the bail does not exonerate Sisodia and that the case against him remains strong.</description>

			<title>Ukraine's bold incursion into Russia: Could Kursk hold the key to Kyiv’s strategic advantage?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraines-bold-incursion-into-russia-could-kursk-hold-the-key-to-kyivs-strategic-advantage-13802718.html</link>
			<description>Ukrainian forces launched a major cross-border attack into Russia's Kursk region, marking the largest incursion since the war began.  The operation, supported by Western military equipment, involved elite Ukrainian brigades advancing deep into Russian territory, seizing villages and parts of the town of Sudzha.  While the Ukrainian government has remained tight-lipped, the incursion appears aimed at weakening Russian military resources and gaining leverage in potential future negotiations.

The attack has drawn condemnation from Russia, which has responded with airstrikes, missile, and artillery fire.   The situation is volatile, with concerns about potential disruptions to European energy security due to the fighting's proximity to critical infrastructure. Some analysts believe the move could be a strategy by Ukraine to destabilize Russia's economy and gain leverage in negotiations, especially given the upcoming US elections.</description>

			<description>Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate known as the "banker to the poor," has been sworn in as the head of Bangladesh's interim government. This comes after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India amidst political turmoil. Yunus faces the challenging task of restoring peace and stability to the nation, which has been grappling with protests, violence, and economic hardship. 

He has pledged to rebuild trust in the government, address corruption, and ensure justice for crimes committed during the recent unrest. The interim government also has the responsibility of preparing for new elections, although the timeline remains uncertain. With Hasina's son suggesting she will return to Bangladesh when the election is imminent, the political landscape remains dynamic and complex.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/harish-salve-vinesh-phogat-cas-hearing-olympic-disqualification-13802686.html</link>
			<description>Vinesh Phogat, an Indian wrestler, is appealing her disqualification from the Paris Olympics due to being overweight.  She will be represented by renowned lawyer Harish Salve before the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS).  

Phogat was disqualified just hours before her gold medal match, prompting her to announce her retirement. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has filed an appeal to the CAS, requesting a joint silver medal for Phogat, as she had qualified for it with a proper weigh-in. 

Her appeal argues that the 100-gram excess weight was negligible and likely due to factors like summer heat and post-competition recovery procedures. The CAS will deliberate on the appeal and announce a verdict, which may take several days.</description>

			<title>Why Bangladesh’s Muhammad Yunus won a Nobel Peace Prize</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-nobel-peace-prize-grameen-bank-success-13802459.html</link>
			<description>Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate known as the "banker of the poor," has been appointed head of Bangladesh's interim government following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Yunus, 84, gained prominence for founding the Grameen Bank, a micro-finance institution that provides small loans to impoverished individuals, particularly women. The bank's innovative approach, which focuses on trust and solidarity lending rather than collateral, has empowered millions in Bangladesh and inspired similar institutions worldwide. 

Yunus' previous experience tackling poverty and his commitment to social upliftment fuel hope for stability in Bangladesh, which has been grappling with student-led unrest. However, questions remain about his ability to effectively navigate the complex political landscape.</description>

			<title>Who is Carles Puigdemont? Why is his return to Barcelona causing such a tumult?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-carles-puigdemont-why-is-his-return-to-barcelona-causing-such-a-tumult-13802569.html</link>
			<description>Carles Puigdemont, the exiled former leader of Catalonia, returned to Barcelona after seven years.  He fled Spain in 2017 after leading a failed secessionist bid and faces charges of embezzlement. 

His return is controversial as it coincides with the formation of a new Catalan government dependent on support from Puigdemont's Junts party. A potential amnesty bill could clear Puigdemont of charges, but faces legal challenges.  

Puigdemont's return aims to solidify his position as the head of the Catalan independence movement and pressure authorities on the amnesty bill.    Some experts believe it may be his final attempt to influence the movement, while others see it as a catalyst for further political instability. His parliamentary immunity could complicate any potential arrest.</description>

			<title>How a melting glacier is worsening floods in Alaska's capital Juneau</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-a-melting-glacier-is-worsening-floods-in-alaskas-capital-juneau-13802464.html</link>
			<description>Flooding in Juneau, Alaska, was triggered by a glacial lake outburst. A smaller glacier near the Mendenhall Glacier retreated, creating a basin that filled with rainwater and snowmelt. The resulting overflowing water surged into Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River, causing unprecedented flooding. 

Over 100 homes were damaged, and the water levels exceeded those of last year’s destructive flood. Authorities attribute this increase in glacial flooding to climate change, which causes glaciers to melt faster, destabilizing glacial lakes and increasing the risk of outbursts.</description>

			<title>Waqf bill in Lok Sabha: What changes is govt proposing? Why has it triggered such outrage?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/waqf-bill-in-lok-sabha-what-changes-is-govt-proposing-why-has-it-triggered-such-outrage-13802502.html</link>
			<description>The Waqf (Amendment) Bill seeks to make 44 changes to the Waqf Act of 1995. Some key proposed changes include establishing a separate board for Boharas and Aghakhanis, allowing representation of various Muslim groups in Waqf bodies, and mandating  the use of specific wording for Waqf property designation. 

The Bill removes the power of Waqf boards to designate properties as Waqf and instead grants this authority to district collectors. This change has sparked controversy, with some Waqf officials and Muslim leaders arguing that it weakens the autonomy of Waqf boards and increases government control over religious endowments. 

The Bill also proposes including women on Waqf boards and stipulating that a portion of Waqf funds be used for the welfare of widows, divorcees, and orphans.  

While the government defends the changes as necessary for efficiency and transparency, opposition parties have criticized the Bill as an "attack" on the constitution and federalism, alleging that it discriminates against Muslims and undermines religious freedom.</description>

			<title>Kerala reports surge in amoebic brain fever cases: How dangerous is the disease?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kerala-amoebic-brain-fever-cases-surge-how-dangerous-is-the-disease-13802465.html</link>
			<description>Kerala is experiencing a rise in cases of amoebic meningoencephalitis, also known as amoebic brain fever, caused by the amoeba Naegleria fowleri. This rare and deadly infection, with a 97% mortality rate, is contracted through contaminated water entering the nose, typically while swimming.  

Symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, confusion, and seizures. While there is no standard treatment, a combination of drugs is used.  

The Kerala health department has issued advisories warning the public about the dangers of stagnant water, emphasizing the need to avoid bathing or washing in contaminated water bodies. The government is conducting a study to determine the reasons behind the surge in cases and is planning public awareness campaigns.</description>

			<title>What is Iraq's proposed law that may allow girls to marry at 9?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-iraqs-proposed-law-that-may-allow-girls-to-marry-at-9-13802417.html</link>
			<description>Shia Islamist parties in Iraq are proposing amendments to the country's 1959 Personal Status Law which would allow girls as young as nine to be married. This has sparked outrage from women's rights groups who highlight that the existing law is considered one of the most progressive in the region, setting 18 as the legal age for marriage for both men and women. 

The proposed changes are being pushed by the Coordination Framework, a bloc of conservative Shia Islamist parties, and would see Shia and Sunni endowments taking over the sanctioning of marriages, instead of courts. They argue that the changes are in line with the constitution and Sharia law. However, critics contend that the amendments are a step backward for women's rights and will have a detrimental impact on the lives of children. 
 
Globally, child marriage remains a serious issue, with over one in five girls married before the age of 18.  Nigeria has the highest rate, followed by the Central African Republic, Chad, and Mali.</description>

			<title>US presidential election: Why are Republicans calling Kamala Harris' VP pick 'Tampon Tim'?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-presidential-election-why-are-republicans-calling-kamala-harris-vp-pick-tampon-tim-13802398.html</link>
			<description>Republican critics have dubbed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, chosen by Kamala Harris as her running mate, “Tampon Tim” due to a law he signed requiring free menstrual products in public schools. The nickname stems from the law’s inclusive language, which provides products to all menstruating students, not just females.  

This has sparked controversy, with conservative commentators attacking Walz and equating the policy to radical liberal agendas. However, many Democrats and progressives have embraced the “Tampon Tim” moniker, viewing it as a positive and highlighting Walz's commitment to menstrual equity and progressive values.  The debate underscores the ongoing conversation about menstrual equity in the US,  with 30 states having already eliminated sales tax on menstrual products.</description>

			<title>60 days and counting: Why Sunita Williams might not return to Earth until next year</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sunita-williams-barry-butch-wilmore-boeing-starliner-iss-nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-13802426.html</link>
			<description>Astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, who launched on Boeing Starliner for a test mission to the International Space Station in June, are facing an extended stay due to technical issues with the spacecraft.  

Five helium leaks and the failure of several maneuvering thrusters have raised safety concerns, prompting NASA to consider a return flight on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is deemed unsafe.  This would result in an eight-month stay for the astronauts. While Williams and Wilmore continue to perform experiments and maintain a busy schedule on the ISS, NASA prioritizes their safe return. The future of the Starliner mission remains uncertain, with an uncrewed return now a possibility.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/taylor-swift-eras-tour-vienna-shows-terror-threat-concert-terrorism-13802390.html</link>
			<description>Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna were canceled due to an alleged terror plot targeting Ernst Happel Stadium, where the shows were scheduled. Austrian authorities arrested two men, one of whom pledged allegiance to ISIS online, in connection with the plot.  "Chemical substances" were found during a raid at the 19-year-old suspect's home. The Austrian Interior Department stated that both suspects had become radicalized online and taken steps towards a terrorist attack.  

While the target was assumed to be events in Vienna, the concert promoter, Barracuda Music, canceled the Eras Tour shows as a safety precaution.</description>

			<title>Why Vinesh Phogat’s disqualification from the Olympics became a political dangal</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/vinesh-phogat-paris-olympics-2024-disqualification-wrestling-dangal-bjp-opposition-13802363.html</link>
			<description>Vinesh Phogat, an Indian wrestler, has retired after being disqualified from the Paris Olympics for being overweight by just 100 grams. The disqualification has sparked controversy in India, with opposition parties alleging a conspiracy  and blaming the government, specifically mentioning Vinesh's past involvement in protests against sexual exploitation within the Wrestling Federation of India.  

Vinesh had been a vocal protestor, even returning her Khel Ratna and Arjuna awards. 

Her disqualification came shortly before her gold medal bout, leading to widespread disappointment and accusations of foul play. While PM Modi and Sports Minister Mandaviya expressed support for Phogat and stated that the IOA was lodging a protest, the opposition demanded a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding her disqualification.  The incident has raised questions about the level playing field in sports and whether medals truly represent a hero.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/cosmic-magic-what-is-the-8-8-lions-gate-portal-that-everyone-is-talking-about-13802335.html</link>
			<description>The Lion's Gate Portal, an astrological event occurring from July 28th to August 12th,  peaks on August 8th. It marks the alignment of the Sun with Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, and the Orion constellation.  

This celestial event is believed to amplify cosmic energy, making it a favorable time for manifestation, spiritual growth, and achieving goals. Rooted in ancient Egyptian mythology, Sirius was revered for its association with the goddess Sopdet, who symbolized the harvest, new year, and the Nile's flood cycle.  The Lion's Gate Portal's significance is heightened this year due to the numerical value of 8/8, representing luck, wealth, and infinite energy.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-jamaat-e-islami-the-pakistan-backed-group-that-fuelled-the-bangladesh-crisis-13802285.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is facing a political crisis triggered by protests that have led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Jamaat-e-Islami, a major Islamist party with historical ties to militancy and a goal of establishing an Islamic state, is a key player in the unrest. 

The organization has a controversial past, being implicated in atrocities during Bangladesh's liberation war in 1971. While banned for a period, Jamaat-e-Islami has continued to wield political influence, aligning with various parties over the years. Its student wing, Chhatra Shibir, is accused of instigating recent violent protests. 

The government has responded with a crackdown, declaring Jamaat-e-Islami and Chhatra Shibir terrorist organizations. Despite this, the group continues to stage protests, highlighting the ongoing political instability and the challenge of countering its influence.</description>

			<description>Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, will head Bangladesh's interim government following student protests and the army’s refusal to suppress them. Despite army support, Yunus faces significant challenges. These include uncertainties surrounding the army’s role, concerns over rising security risks, and potential economic fallout due to unrest impacting the garment industry.  Building public trust and ensuring credible elections are crucial for stabilizing the situation.  Investigations into the deaths and violence during the protests, and potential legal consequences for those responsible, are also critical for restoring faith in the justice system.</description>

			<title>After far-right riots in the UK, come anti-racist protests: Is calm returning to the country?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-far-right-riots-anti-racist-counter-protests-southport-stabbing-keir-starmer-13802281.html</link>
			<description>Violence and riots swept across the UK, fueled by false claims that an asylum seeker was responsible for the stabbing of three young girls.  

Protests, many with anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments, targeted mosques and hostels for asylum seekers despite the real suspect being a British-born teenager. Social media and figures like Tommy Robinson and Andrew Tate further fanned the flames of hate.

The violence spread to various cities, with incidents including arson, assaults, and racist attacks. Over 400 people have been arrested.

In response, thousands of counter-protesters took to the streets, voicing messages of unity and opposing racism. They gathered outside targeted institutions, forming human shields and carrying banners against hate speech. 

While there is cautious optimism that the situation may be stabilizing, the potential for further unrest persists.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh youth forced Sheikh Hasina’s ouster. Can they now bring about lasting change?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-youth-forced-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-can-they-now-bring-about-lasting-change-13801644.html</link>
			<description>Protests in Bangladesh led to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years in power. The initial trigger was a quota system reserving government jobs for war veterans' relatives, but the demonstrations evolved into a wider movement against political repression, economic inequality, and lack of opportunities for youth.  The protests were primarily youth-led, utilizing social media despite government attempts to restrict access. 

The violent government response further fueled public anger, ultimately forcing Hasina's departure. Now, with a fragile power vacuum, the opportunity exists for a bottom-up democratic transition where youth voices can be heard and policies address their concerns. However, the participation of young people in the new interim government and the inclusivity of the upcoming elections remain crucial to ensure  lasting change.</description>

			<title>How Thailand found, and then banned, its most popular politician</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-thailand-found-and-then-banned-its-most-popular-politician-13802143.html</link>
			<description>The Constitutional Court in Thailand has dissolved the Move Forward Party (MFP) and banned its leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, from politics for 10 years. This decision stems from the party's pledge to reform the country's strict lese-majeste law, which criminalizes defamation of the monarchy. 

The MFP, led by Pita, had won the most votes in last year's general election, but his bid to become prime minister was thwarted by conservative senators.  The court's ruling is seen by many as a blow to pro-democracy forces in Thailand, which has a history of military intervention and suppression of dissent.  Supporters of Pita and the MFP express concern that the judiciary is being used to stifle political opposition and criticize the monarchy.</description>

			<title>Awami League leaders killed and detained: Is this the end of Sheikh Hasina’s party?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-ouster-awami-league-future-13802050.html</link>
			<description>Following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and flight to India, Bangladesh is experiencing widespread violence. Protesters have targeted Awami League properties, resulting in the deaths of 29 party members and their families. 

The Awami League faces a significant challenge as its institutions are being ransacked and key leaders either detained, fled, or remain missing.  The party lacks a clear leadership structure and public figures like Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, lack the legitimacy to assume a prominent role.  Experts believe it will be difficult for the Awami League, once the country's most dominant force, to recover in the near future.</description>

			<description>Following riots sparked by misinformation about the murder of three girls in Southport, several countries have issued travel advisories for their citizens in the UK. India, the UAE, Nigeria, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Australia have urged their nationals to exercise caution, avoid protests, and stay vigilant due to the heightened threat of violence. 

The riots, which have targeted mosques and businesses, have spread to numerous cities including Birmingham, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bristol and Manchester.  Hundreds have been arrested, and police have reported numerous injuries. The British government is working to restore order and is considering bringing Parliament back from its summer recess to address the issue.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/you-are-old-if-you-are-wearing-heels-to-the-club-heres-why-13802068.html</link>
			<description>A recent viral video showing Gen Z  women sporting jeans, tops, and sneakers at a bar has sparked debate about evolving fashion norms. While some lament the perceived demise of traditional going-out attire, others applaud the comfort and practicality of the trend. 

This preference for comfort over style is reflected in global data showing increased sales of flats and low-heels, coupled with a decline in high-heel interest.  
However, some style experts predict that high heels will eventually make a comeback, citing their enduring power to boost confidence and elongate the silhouette.  
This shift towards comfortable clothing, like pajamas worn to work in China, signifies a broader societal trend where functionality and personal expression are prioritized over rigid fashion rules.</description>

			<description>Following violent unrest in Bangladesh, India repatriated 190 non-essential embassy staff and their families.  Around 20 to 30 senior staff remain at the Dhaka High Commission.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that there are approximately 19,000 Indians in Bangladesh, with the majority being students who have since returned. While emphasizing that the situation is not dire enough for a full evacuation, Jaishankar expressed expectations that Bangladesh will ensure the safety and security of Indian diplomatic missions. 

The recent violence has raised concerns over the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh, with reports of attacks on temples and homes.</description>

			<title>Dirty politics: Why did Tim Walz joke about JD Vance and couch sex?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/tim-walz-joke-about-jd-vance-couch-sex-13802009.html</link>
			<description>Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee,  made headlines with a joke targeting JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee. Walz alluded to a widely circulated online joke alleging that Vance's memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy," contained a passage about having sex with a couch.  

This incident stems from a since-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter)  that claimed Vance's memoir included such a scene, complete with a fabricated page reference.  While the claim was false, it sparked widespread memes and attention, even prompting a fact-check article from the Associated Press which was later retracted.

Walz's joke capitalized on the existing online discourse, drawing laughter from his supporters and energizing the narrative surrounding Vance.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-elon-musk-be-held-accountable-for-misinformation-on-x-amid-uk-riots-13802020.html</link>
			<description>Violent unrest has gripped the UK, sparked by a knife attack at a Taylor Swift event.  Misinformation spread on social media platforms, wrongly identifying the attacker as an asylum seeker and fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. Elon Musk, owner of X (formerly Twitter), has faced criticism for incendiary comments, including declaring "civil war is inevitable" in the UK. 

Musk's statements have been condemned by UK officials, who accuse him of irresponsible use of his platform.  He has also been criticized for his actions regarding  content moderation, with some Labour MPs calling for his questioning.

The government has responded with arrests and legal action, while emphasizing the need to combat misinformation and online hate.   There are ongoing concerns about the impact of Musk's rhetoric on social stability and calls for increased platform accountability.</description>

			<title>How is Sheikh Hasina's ouster hurting India-Bangladesh trade already?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-is-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-hurting-india-bangladesh-trade-already-13802007.html</link>
			<description>Trade between India and Bangladesh is experiencing disruptions following the political turmoil in Bangladesh and the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.   Exports from India to Bangladesh have stalled due to Bangladesh's severe dollar shortage, rising inflation, and the closure of border checkposts. 

The situation is impacting perishable goods exports particularly hard.  While India is a diversified exporter, this disruption could affect the overall trade relationship. A potential Free Trade Agreement, which could have significantly boosted bilateral trade, is also now in jeopardy.</description>

			<title>Why the ‘world’s largest diamond firm’ in Surat has sent 50,000 workers on temporary leave</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-the-worlds-largest-diamond-firm-in-surat-has-sent-50000-workers-on-temporary-leave-13801951.html</link>
			<description>Kiran Gems has announced a 10-day vacation for its 50,000 employees in Surat, India.  This unprecedented move is a response to the declining global demand for polished diamonds, worsened by the global economic downturn and geopolitical tensions. The chairman of Kiran Gems, Vallabhbhai Lakhani, stated that the decrease in polished diamond prices is impacting the industry.  The company, a major buyer of rough diamonds from De Beers, has experienced a 15 percent drop in rough diamond production in the second quarter of the fiscal year.  

The Surat Diamond Association president, Jagdish Khunt, echoed these concerns, noting that the decline in global demand, influenced by conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions on Russian diamonds, has severely affected the local industry.</description>

			<description>Following Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure, Bangladesh has witnessed an increase in violence against its Hindu minority. Cases of vandalism targeting Hindu homes, businesses, and temples have been reported.  This unrest brings attention to the country's religious landscape and General Hussain Muhammad Ershad's role in making Islam the state religion in 1988, reversing the previously secular constitution. 
Although Sheikh Hasina reinstated secularism in 2011, the current situation raises concerns about the fragility of religious tolerance in Bangladesh.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/namal-rajapaksa-sri-lanka-presidential-election-13801924.html</link>
			<description>The Sri Lankan presidential election, scheduled for September 21st, will see the controversial Rajapaksa clan attempting a political comeback.  Namal Rajapaksa, 38, the eldest son of former President and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and nephew of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has been named the candidate for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).  
 
Namal, who served as the Minister of Youth and Sports, has been previously embroiled in controversies surrounding allegations of money laundering and receiving payoffs from international firms. This election marks a further fracturing of the  nation's political landscape following the economic crisis of 2022 that forced Gotabaya Rajapaksa into exile.  The race is expected to be closely contested between Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Dissanayake.</description>

			<description>Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate due to his strong track record in areas like reproductive health and paid leave, which align with her platform.  His relatable background as a teacher, coach, and veteran, along with his plain-spoken communication style, were also key factors. While Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly were strong contenders, they faced challenges such as criticism from progressive groups and concerns about their ability to energize voters. Ultimately, Harris was drawn to Walz's experience, governing achievements, and personal connection. The selection has been widely praised by Democrats across the political spectrum.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-stay-in-india-new-delhi-extended-13801933.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister, is staying in India longer than anticipated after her asylum request in the UK was rejected.  India is preparing for the possibility of hosting her for an extended period,  providing her with security and safe accommodation.

India, a trusted ally of Hasina, does not have a formal asylum policy but is offering her refuge. While this strengthens ties with the deposed leader, it presents a diplomatic challenge for New Delhi as it needs to balance its relationship with Hasina and the potential new government in Bangladesh.   

The situation is further complicated by heightened anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh.</description>

			<description>A US judge, Amit Mehta, ruled that Google has been illegally using its dominant position in the search engine market to stifle competition.  The ruling, described as seismic,  concludes that Google is a monopolist and has acted accordingly to maintain its market dominance.  The decision stems from a trial brought by the US Justice Department, the country's biggest antitrust case in 25 years.  Judge Mehta's 277-page ruling focused on  Google's billions of dollars spent securing its search engine as the default option on various devices. Google intends to appeal the decision.</description>

			<title>Centre modifies rule on capital gains tax on real estate: Why this is a relief for homeowners</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/centre-long-term-capital-gains-tax-indexation-benefit-real-estate-homeowners-relief-13801893.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has amended its Budget 2024 proposal regarding long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on property sales.  Originally, the proposal aimed to reduce the LTCG tax rate to 12.5% but remove indexation benefits, a move that faced criticism. 

The amended proposal allows taxpayers to choose between the old system (20% tax with indexation benefits) or the new system (12.5% tax without indexation benefits) for properties acquired before July 23, 2024. This provides flexibility and addresses concerns that the removal of indexation would disproportionately affect middle-class homeowners. The government's decision to offer this choice is seen as a way to balance the desire for tax simplification with the need to protect the interests of property owners.</description>

			<title>Earth could have 25 hours a day. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/earth-25-hours-a-day-moon-13801009.html</link>
			<description>The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at a rate of 3.82 centimeters per year.  This is primarily due to tidal forces caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. As the Moon recedes, it causes Earth's rotation to slow down, resulting in the gradual lengthening of a day. Over the next 200 million years, Earth's days are predicted to extend to 25 hours.  This constant gravitational tug-of-war shapes Earth's geological features and has significant implications for the planet's rotation and relationship with its moon.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/firstup-bangladesh-unrest-continues-harris-campaigns-in-key-battleground-states-13801635.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing political turmoil as President Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament, paving the way for an interim government and fresh elections following a student-led uprising. Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris continues her campaign, having secured the majority of delegate votes and chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.   President Droupadi Murmu is on a three-nation visit, starting with New Zealand, where she will meet with dignitaries and interact with the Indian community. 

Several crucial court hearings are scheduled, including cases concerning Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena faction, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's aide, and Salman Rushdie attack suspect Hadi Matar.</description>

			<title>Who is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' running mate for 2024 US presidential election?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-kamala-harris-running-mate-for-2024-us-presidential-election-13801759.html</link>
			<description>Tim Walz, the newly chosen running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris, is a 60-year-old former teacher and National Guard veteran. He served in the US Congress for twelve years representing a rural Minnesota district before becoming governor in 2018. 

Walz is known for his bipartisan approach and championing issues like veterans' affairs. As governor, he faced the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and navigated divided government. He has also supported progressive initiatives such as free school meals and abortion rights. 

Walz's selection is seen as strategic, as Minnesota is a reliably Democratic state neighboring key battleground states, and his ability to connect with rural voters may help the campaign in the Midwest.</description>

			<title>Amid UK’s reluctance for asylum, has US revoked Sheikh Hasina’s visa?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-visa-uk-asylum-request-13801735.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's ousted prime minister, is seeking asylum in the UK while in India. This request has not been approved due to UK immigration laws that don't allow asylum applications from outside the country.  

The US has reportedly revoked Hasina's visa, citing strained relations stemming from concerns over the January elections and allegations of a military base plot.  

While her sister and niece hold UK citizenship and she previously sought permission to travel there, the UK is hesitant due to potential pressure from Hasina's rivals and accusations of human rights violations during her tenure.</description>

			<title>Hindus attacked in Bangladesh: Should India brace itself for an influx of refugees?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hindus-attacked-in-bangladesh-should-india-brace-itself-for-an-influx-of-refugees-13801677.html</link>
			<description>Recent political turmoil in Bangladesh has led to a surge in violence against Hindus, resulting in deaths, destruction of homes and places of worship.  

This escalation of violence, following student protests against a job quota scheme, has fueled concerns of a refugee crisis in India, given the close proximity of the two countries and shared border. 

The possibility of a BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government further exacerbates these worries, as their past stance is seen as potentially less favourable to the Hindu population.  The Indian government has advised its citizens in Bangladesh to exercise extreme caution and restrict their movements.

			<title>1975 and 2024: The story of Sheikh Hasina’s two stays in India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-india-exile-1975-13801627.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has fled her country following a recent military coup and is seeking refuge in India. This is not her first time seeking refuge in India; in 1975, she and her sister Rehana found safety in India after the assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's founding father. 

Hasina, along with her sister, landed in Ghaziabad on Monday and was received by Indian officials. While reports suggest she is seeking asylum in the UK, the UK government has stated that individuals must seek asylum in the first safe country they reach.  India's External Affairs Minister has confirmed that Hasina is in a state of shock and the Indian government is providing her with time and support before discussing her future plans.</description>

			<title>A23a: World's largest iceberg that refuses to melt. What's holding it back?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/a23a-worlds-largest-iceberg-that-refuses-to-melt-whats-holding-it-back-13801688.html</link>
			<description>A23a, the world’s largest iceberg, is trapped in a rotating oceanic vortex called a Taylor Column.  This unusual phenomenon occurs when a current meets an obstruction on the seafloor, creating a spinning cylinder of water.  A23a, which detached from Antarctica in 1986, has been rotating counterclockwise by 15 degrees daily since coming free from the seabed in 2020.

This strange stillness has delayed the iceberg's expected melting and disintegration as it remains above warmer waters. It was predicted that A23a would be carried north by the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current, but the Taylor Column has kept it in place.  Its unpredictable movements highlight the significant influence of underwater topography on ocean currents and iceberg behaviour.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-bangladesh-iran-israel-lebanon-countries-not-to-travel-to-unrest-violence-13801682.html</link>
			<description>Several countries have issued travel advisories due to heightened tensions and unrest. 

The UK has seen violent clashes sparked by misinformation and anti-immigrant sentiment, prompting advisories from India, Nigeria Australia, Indonesia and Kenya. 

Bangladesh faces internal turmoil with student protests leading to deaths and advisories from the US and India urging citizens to avoid travel until further notice.

Israel and Hamas continue to clash following the October 2023 attack, with India urging its citizens in Israel to exercise caution and Air India suspending flights. International concern has grown with the US placing Iran on its highest level travel warning due to the assassination of a senior Hamas leader on Iranian soil and the threat of retaliation.

Lebanon has also seen escalated tensions following the rocket attack on Israelis and the killing of a Hezbollah commander, prompting advisories and evacuation calls from various countries including India.</description>

			<title>Why Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s Rs 9,000 dog perfume is raising a stink</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-dolce-gabbanas-rs-9000-dog-perfume-is-raising-a-stink-13801597.html</link>
			<description>Dolce and Gabbana have launched a dog perfume called 'Fefé', priced at €99. Inspired by co-founder Domenico Dolce's love for his dog, the fragrance features notes of Ylang, Musk, and Sandalwood.  

While marketed as a luxurious product, the perfume has faced criticism from animal welfare organizations like the RSPCA. They argue that it interferes with a dog's sensitive sense of smell, which is crucial for their perception and well-being. Experts warn that the strong scents can cause confusion, anxiety, and even hinder a dog's ability to function effectively.  Additionally, there are concerns that owners may use the perfume to mask underlying health issues instead of seeking veterinary care.</description>

			<title>Who is Nahid Islam, student who led protests that ousted Sheikh Hasina and is part of interim Bangladesh govt?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nahid-islam-26-year-old-student-who-led-protests-to-oust-bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-13801546.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh has a new interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. This follows the resignation and departure of former PM Sheikh Hasina after widespread protests. Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old sociology student and key figure in the anti-quota and anti-government demonstrations, is now part of the 16-member council advising the interim government. 

Islam, known for his human rights activism, drew national attention during the protests that turned violent, leading to his arrest and allegations of torture. His movement demanded an end to a job quota system perceived as discriminatory and benefited the Awami League party. 
The protests, which began in July, were widely supported and highlighted economic distress and a lack of job opportunities for young graduates.</description>

			<title>How long will Sheikh Hasina remain in India? What happens if the UK says no to her asylum request?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-india-uk-asylum-request-options-countries-13801614.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the recently ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, fled her country and arrived in India seeking temporary refuge. She plans to apply for asylum in the UK, but her request has been met with obstacles as UK immigration rules require asylum seekers to remain in the first safe country they reach.  Hasina's stay in India is uncertain, with the Indian government offering her time to decide her future plans.  

Granting Hasina asylum could strain India's relationship with the new Bangladeshi government, while denying it could portray India as abandoning an ally. This creates a diplomatic dilemma for New Delhi. 


Hasina is also reportedly exploring options in Scandinavian countries.</description>

			<title>UK PM Keir Starmer's 'standing army' to quell far-right rioting: What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-pm-keir-starmer-standing-army-to-quell-far-right-rioting-what-is-it-13801526.html</link>
			<description>In the wake of widespread riots and far-right violence across the UK,  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a "standing army" of specialist police officers. This rapid response unit will be deployed to affected areas, bolstering local forces struggling to contain the violence. The unrest, fueled by misinformation circulating on social media, ignited after a deadly stabbing at a Taylor Swift dance class falsely attributed to an immigrant.

Starmer condemned the violence, emphasizing swift justice for those responsible. While acknowledging the strain on the UK's legal system, the government committed to expediting court proceedings. Addressing the role of social media, the government criticized platforms for failing to curb the spread of harmful content, hinting at potential stricter regulations.</description>

			<title>Are China and Pakistan behind Sheikh Hasina’s ouster in Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-china-and-pakistan-behind-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-in-bangladesh-13801562.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the long-time prime minister of Bangladesh,

resigned and fled the country following unrest and violence over a controversial quota system.

Intelligence agencies suggest that Pakistan's ISI and China may be involved in orchestrating Hasina's removal.

Reports indicate that the ISI has been supporting student groups, particularly the Islami Chhatra Shibir, to incite protests and pressure the government.

The aim is allegedly to install an anti-India government sympathetic to Pakistan and China's interests.

China, meanwhile, is believed to be seeking a more pliable government in Bangladesh to benefit its strategic goals. 

There are concerns that Pakistan and China are exploiting the situation to destabilize the region and weaken India's influence.</description>

			<title>Begum is free: Who is Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s rival, released amid Bangladesh turmoil?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/begum-khaleda-zia-release-bangladesh-turmoil-sheikh-hasina-13801519.html</link>
			<description>Begum Khaleda Zia, former prime minister of Bangladesh, has been released from house arrest after over three years. Zia, a prominent opposition figure, had been jailed on corruption charges in 2018, which her supporters claim were politically motivated.  

Her release comes amidst political turmoil following the resignation and flight of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who faced protests over the quota system for government jobs. Zia, the chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has urged for calm and peace.  Her return to politics could benefit the BNP, which has seen a decline in popularity, especially in the absence of its leader. This development presents an opportunity for the opposition to capitalize on the current political situation and potentially gain public support.</description>

			<title>Is it a looming recession or are markets simply spooked? What’s going on with the US economy?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-it-a-looming-recession-or-are-markets-simply-spooked-whats-going-on-with-us-economy-13801428.html</link>
			<description>The US economy is facing heightened recession fears due to a weak July jobs report and global market volatility. The report showed only 114,000 new jobs added, below expectations, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. This, coupled with the Federal Reserve's cautious stance on interest rates, has fueled concerns. 

While some economists warn of a potential recession, others point to positive indicators like continued private-sector demand and cooling inflation. The mixed signals have led to divided opinions within the expert community. 


The political landscape has also been impacted, with the opposition seizing on the economic data to criticize the incumbent administration. Ultimately, the trajectory of the US economy remains uncertain.</description>

			<title>Why Sheikh Hasina’s ouster from Bangladesh is bad news for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sheikh-hasina-bangladesh-resigns-india-trade-defence-security-infrastructure-china-13801455.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh's prime minister presents a significant challenge for India.  Hasina was a strong ally, fostering closer ties in trade, defence, and security. 

With her departure, India faces uncertainties regarding these collaborations. The new interim government, potentially influenced by the army, may adopt a less pro-India stance, impacting defence ties and security cooperation.  India's concerns include the potential rise of anti-India sentiment,  the rise of  Jamaat-e-Islami, and the possibility of Bangladesh being used as a base by insurgent groups.  The future of the proposed India-Bangladesh Free Trade Agreement and ongoing infrastructure projects are also in question.  China could exploit the political vacuum to increase its influence in the region, further complicating India's strategic position.</description>

			<title>From travel to trade and border security, how former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s exit is affecting India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-exit-affecting-india-13801422.html</link>
			<description>Political turmoil in Bangladesh, culminating in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has repercussions for neighboring India. India has canceled all flights to and from Bangladesh, suspended train services, and heightened security along the shared border. 

The Border Security Force (BSF) is on high alert, restricting entry into India without proper documentation. Meghalaya has imposed a night curfew near its border with Bangladesh. The situation in Bangladesh is also impacting trade, with uncertainty likely to shift garment orders from Bangladesh to India.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-india-hindon-airbase-safe-house-iaf-13801407.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's former prime minister, was forced to resign and flee the country after a military coup.  She was aided by India, a trusted ally, who ensured her safe passage.  Indian Air Force personnel tracked her flight and two Rafale fighter jets were on standby for assistance.  Hasina landed at Hindon Airbase in Uttar Pradesh, greeted by NSA Ajit Doval, and taken to a secure location.

Discussions with Indian officials focused on the situation in Bangladesh and her next steps. Hasina is reportedly seeking asylum in the UK and is likely to stay in India temporarily. India has heightened security along the Bangladesh border and is preparing for potential evacuations of Indian nationals.</description>

			<description>Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate known for founding the Grameen Bank, has agreed to head Bangladesh's interim government.  The decision comes after protests from the Students Against Discrimination movement who pushed for Yunus's appointment.

Yunus, who has remained a prominent figure despite strained relations with former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and allegations of political persecution, expressed reluctance to enter politics but accepted the role. His selection has significant implications for Bangladesh's future political direction.</description>

			<title>Stock markets crashed and people started talking about the ‘Sahm Rule’. What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/stock-markets-crashed-and-people-started-talking-about-the-sahm-rule-what-is-it-13801377.html</link>
			<description>The Sahm Rule, a strong recession indicator based on US unemployment data, was triggered by a recent jobs report showing a higher-than-expected unemployment rate. 

Despite this, some economists argue the rule is purely empirical and not necessarily indicative of a recession.  They point to other positive economic indicators such as strong consumer spending and business investment.  However, the rule's activation has heightened investor concerns and increased pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than anticipated to mitigate potential market decline.</description>

Nepal faces persistent instability marked by frequent changes in government and a strategic balancing act between India and China. 

Myanmar's military junta faces increasing pressure from an armed resistance movement, highlighting a weakening grip on power.

			<title>Sheikh Hasina is in India: Why Bangladesh’s embattled leader turned to New Delhi in her moment of crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sheikh-hasina-resigns-india-travel-bangladesh-new-delhi-relations-13801168.html</link>
			<description>Amidst mounting political turmoil in Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned and fled the country, landing in India's Ghaziabad.  This comes after widespread protests demanding change, triggered by a job quota system dispute that has turned violent.  Bangladesh's army chief announced the formation of an interim government. 

Hasina's flight to India, a country with a longstanding, close relationship with her family, is significant.  Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, shared a deep bond with Indian leaders, particularly Indira Gandhi. Having found refuge in India after her father's assassination in 1975, Hasina has maintained strong ties with India throughout her political career.</description>

			<title>The rise and fall of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's 'Iron Lady'</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-rise-and-fall-of-sheikh-hasina-bangladeshs-iron-lady-13801176.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been a dominant figure in Bangladeshi politics for decades. 

She rose to power after her father's assassination in 1975, leading the Awami League party against military dictatorships. Her premiership, beginning in 2009, saw significant economic growth, driven by the garment industry, and Bangladesh's impressive poverty reduction.  Hasina also gained international recognition for her handling of the Rohingya refugee crisis. 

However, her tenure has been marked by accusations of authoritarianism, cracking down on dissent, and manipulating the judicial system.  Controversial war crimes tribunals and bans on opposition parties sparked protests and international condemnation. 

Recently, widespread protests against a controversial quota system led to her resignation after serving four consecutive terms as prime minister. Bangladesh now faces an uncertain future, with both major political figures, Hasina and Khaleda Zia (leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party), weakened and facing significant challenges.</description>

			<title>US presidential election: Who is Josh Shapiro, the frontrunner to be Kamala Harris’s VP?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-presidential-election-who-is-josh-shapiro-pennsylvania-governor-kamala-harris-vp-13801073.html</link>
			<description>Josh Shapiro, the Governor of Pennsylvania, is considered a strong contender for Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 US election. Known for his bipartisan appeal and pragmatic approach, Shapiro boasts a successful political career marked by achievements like leading a grand jury investigation into Catholic clergy abuse and effectively responding to state crises.  He has also faced criticism within his own party for positions on issues like school vouchers, Israel, and environmental policies.  Select by Harris would likely be seen as a strategic move to appeal to moderate and independent voters.</description>
