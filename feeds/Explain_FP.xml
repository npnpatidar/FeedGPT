Go: How ISRO launched Gaganyaan's first test flight after 'anomaly'</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/isro-gaganyaan-mission-first-test-flight-launch-delay-anomaly-13279482.html</link><description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the first test flight for India's Gaganyaan mission on 21 October. The Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission was initially delayed due to weather conditions and was later halted just seconds before lift-off due to an anomaly detected by the ground support computer. The issue was quickly resolved, and the launch took place at 10 am. The objective of the test flight was to showcase the performance of the crew escape system, and it lasted a total of 532 seconds. The crew module successfully separated from the rocket and descended through parachutes, landing in the Bay of Bengal. This test flight is significant for India's first human spaceflight project as it tests the safety mechanisms for the Gaganyaan crew in case of an emergency. The successful separation of the crew module ensures that astronauts can escape during a mid-flight emergency. The ISRO is prioritizing astronaut safety and is building environmental control and life support systems for the crew module. India aims to send a manned Gaganyaan mission to space by 2025.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 11:46:48 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>This Week in Explainers: Why India should celebrate the Gaganyaan test flight</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-week-in-explainers-gaganyaan-test-flight-rapidx-trains-same-sex-marriage-verdict-mahua-moitra-cash-for-query-row-air-pollution-13279122.html</link><description>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched a test flight for the upcoming Gaganyaan mission.

The drug is an amphetamine-type stimulant that provides a boost of energy, enhances focus, and produces a feeling of euphoria. It is dubbed "the poor man's cocaine" and has been linked to militants in Iraq and Syria. Captagon has serious side effects, including psychosis and brain damage, and can lead to addiction. Syria has become a major producer and consumer of amphetamines, with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad and his associates profit from the sale of these drugs. Efforts have been made by several West Asian countries to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, but experts warn that smugglers may find new routes and markets, posing a threat to Europe and the rest of the world.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 20:18:36 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Iron Sting: Israel's new weapon in the war against Hamas</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iron-sting-israels-new-weapon-in-the-war-against-hamas-13287862.html</link><description>The Israeli Defense Forces' Maglan Unit recently used a new guided munitions system called the 'Iron Sting' against Hamas rocket launchers in the Gaza strip.

The network used thousands of messages on social media accounts to accuse members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of criminal and ethical infractions. The campaign involved the dissemination of propaganda across various platforms, combining spam-like content with more ordinary, human-interest style posts. The bot network also circulated misinformation about other events, such as the Hawaiian wildfires and Japan's Fukushima water release. The goal of the campaign was to discredit and denigrate targeted MPs and silence criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. China has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and called the accusations a "blatant smear campaign." Canada has expressed concern that the campaign could discourage MPs from carrying out their duties and speaking out on important issues.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 11:04:58 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>FirstUp: Dussehra rallies, women’s strike in Iceland and more… News to watch out for</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/firstup-dussehra-rallies-womens-protest-in-iceland-and-more-the-news-to-watch-out-for-13286742.html</link><description>Today, the United Nations Security Council is meeting to discuss the situation in West Asia and the Israel-Hamas war.

The dispute between China and Bhutan dates back to 1950 when China occupied Tibet and refused to recognize the dividing line between Tibet and Bhutan. The two countries have been engaged in boundary talks since 1984, focusing on three disputed areas. In 2017, India and China had a standoff over the Doklam plateau, which is considered an undisputed territory of Bhutan by India. The region holds great security importance for India as it threatens the Siliguri Corridor, a vital stretch connecting the Indian mainland to the Northeast. There are concerns in New Delhi that a deal between Bhutan and China could involve swapping Doklam for disputed territories in the north. India believes that China's claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is a way to pressure Bhutan into handing over Doklam. Tensions remain high between India and China over the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with no agreement reached on troop disengagement at key friction points. Resolving the dispute over Doklam is linked to the conflict on China and India's shared border, particularly regarding Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as an extension of South Tibet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 15:49:02 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Where Taiwan's four president hopefuls stand on China</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/where-taiwans-four-president-hopefuls-stand-on-china-13290062.html</link><description>The upcoming presidential election in Taiwan, scheduled for January 13, 2023, has put a spotlight on each candidate's stance on China.

The victims ranged from teenagers to middle-aged individuals, with the youngest being a 13-year-old boy. The cause of these deaths is believed to be heart attacks, possibly due to pre-existing medical conditions, prolonged fasting, poor eating habits, and a lack of awareness about heart health issues in India. Some experts also speculate that COVID-19 may be a contributing factor, although this has been refuted by former chief minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel. Similar incidents have been reported in the past, highlighting the need for individuals to be aware of their health and not push their physical limits during such celebrations. It is important to stay hydrated and take breaks to prevent cardiac strain. COVID-19 has been linked to increased risks of blood clotting, heart failure, and other heart-related issues.

They had been among approximately 200 people taken by the Palestinian militant group to Gaza after a rampage into Israel on October 7th. The hostages were freed for humanitarian reasons after mediation efforts by Qatar. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) facilitated their release by transporting them from Gaza to Israel. Upon their arrival at the Israeli border, they were greeted by Israeli military officials and taken to a military base. Hamas released the mother and daughter to disprove claims made by US President Joe Biden and his administration. Judith Raanan is a Jewish woman who worked as an aesthetician and life coach in the US. Her daughter Natalie recently graduated from high school and was considering working in the fashion industry or becoming an interior designer or tattoo artist. The mother and daughter were visiting Kibbutz Nahal Oz in southern Israel when they were abducted by Hamas militants during the surprise attack on October 7th.

The article highlights a lawsuit filed against Meta (formerly Facebook) by 41 states and the District of Columbia, alleging that the company intentionally designed Facebook and Instagram with features that harm teens and young users. Internal research from Meta in March 2020 showed that Instagram is harmful to teen girls' body image and well-being, but the company ignored these findings. Numerous studies have shown that the more often teens use Instagram, the worse their overall well-being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, mood, and body image. Two key features of Instagram make it particularly risky for teens: the ability to follow celebrities and peers who present unrealistic body images and curated impressions of a perfect life, and the emphasis on pictures of the body, leading users to focus on how they look to others. These factors contribute to negative social comparisons, envy, lowered self-esteem, and increased body dissatisfaction among teens. Body dissatisfaction during the teen years is a predictor of later eating disorder symptoms. The article suggests that parents can help by talking to their teens about appearance versus reality, encouraging face-to-face interactions with peers, and promoting active engagement with their bodies instead of focusing on selfies. The article raises concerns about how Meta will handle these damaging results and compares their approach to Big Tobacco's denial of the harmful effects of its products.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:03:06 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Bird flu reaches Antarctica for the first time: Why this could be devastating?</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bird-flu-reaches-antarctica-for-the-first-time-why-this-could-be-devastating-13294282.html</link><description>Experts are concerned that thousands of penguins and seals in Antarctica could be wiped out by a deadly variant of bird flu known as avian flu. British scientists discovered the virus in brown skuas, a scavenger bird, on Bird Island, part of the British overseas possession of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The virus is believed to have been brought to Antarctica by birds migrating from South America, where it has already caused significant deaths among seabirds and sea lions. The H5N1 strain of avian flu is highly pathogenic and causes significant mortality in poultry. While the virus is difficult to spread from animals to humans, there are concerns that if a person with the flu contracts this bird flu, it could lead to serious consequences. Researchers fear that the disease could result in catastrophic breeding failure and have a devastating impact on many wildlife species in Antarctica. Ongoing disease surveillance programs are recommended to identify new and emerging pathogens.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 17:18:05 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Where is Yair Netanyahu?

The research indicates that the rate at which the warming Southern Ocean melts the West Antarctic ice sheet will accelerate over the course of this century, leading to increased sea-level rise and potential consequences for coastal communities worldwide. The study used a regional ocean model to predict ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea, the most vulnerable sector of the ice sheet. The results show a rapid increase in ocean warming and ice-shelf melting, even under the best-case scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5°C. The findings suggest that rapid ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea is now inevitable until at least 2100, regardless of international policies on fossil fuels. Melting ice shelves contribute significantly to sea-level rise, and while it is difficult to determine exact figures without considering other factors such as glacier flow and snow accumulation, increased ice-shelf melting is expected to accelerate sea-level rise. The West Antarctic ice sheet is already losing about 80 billion tonnes of ice per year and has enough ice to cause up to 5 meters of sea-level rise. However, there is still hope for the longer term, as simulations show that under the 1.5°C scenario, ice-shelf melting may start to plateau by the end of the century, suggesting that further changes in the 22nd century could still be preventable. The article emphasizes the need for courage and adaptation in facing climate change and protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:06:20 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>How Israel is trying to get information on hostages held by Hamas</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-israel-is-trying-to-get-information-on-hostages-held-by-hamas-13292112.html</link><description>The Israeli army is urging residents of the Gaza Strip to provide information about hostages held by Hamas in exchange for financial rewards. The army dropped leaflets containing the message from aircraft during airstrikes. The leaflets also provided contact information for sending information about the hostages. So far, four female hostages have been released through negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Israeli military is using various methods, including surveillance and interrogating captured Hamas militants, to determine the whereabouts of the captives. Israel is preparing for a potential ground invasion to free the hostages and eliminate Hamas. The exact location of the hostages is unknown, and it's unclear whether they are all held by Hamas or other extremist groups. The presence of dual nationals among the hostages further complicates the situation. Over 220 people were kidnapped by Hamas militants during an attack on southern Israel in early October.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 09:17:47 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>FirstUp: Election fever’s on the rise… The big news for today</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/firstup-one-nation-one-poll-meet-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-rajasthan-rally-big-news-maratha-quota-fast-world-pasta-day-13290352.html</link><description>The Ram Nath Kovind-led committee will meet today to discuss the issue of One Nation, One Election.

As tensions between Israel and Hamas continue to escalate, there is a risk that Lebanon, already on the brink of economic and political collapse, could be drawn into the conflict. Hezbollah has been preparing to join the fight since Hamas launched a surprise assault, resulting in increased attacks by the Shiite militant group. Israel is evacuating residents along the border with Lebanon in anticipation of a ground invasion of Gaza, and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate if Israeli forces enter Gaza. The decision of whether Hezbollah fully joins the war will shed light on its priorities: the well-being of Lebanon or acting as a proxy for Iran. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has spilled into Lebanon since 1948, with the displacement of Palestinians leading to tensions and conflict. The rise of Hezbollah, which formed in 1982 with Iranian and Syrian support, has significantly impacted Lebanon's political landscape. Despite the fractured political system and weak state, Lebanon managed to retain some stability until it experienced a severe economic crisis in 2019, followed by the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The political system remains in gridlock, and Hezbollah has emerged as a defender of the current political system. The decision of whether Lebanon enters the war rests with Hezbollah and, by extension, Iran. If Hezbollah joins the war, it could lead to further regional conflict and push Lebanon closer to collapse.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 09:40:40 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Meet Vikram-1, India's indigenous seven-storey rocket set to launch in 2024</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/meet-vikram-1-indias-indigenous-seven-storey-rocket-set-to-launch-in-2024-13297032.html</link><description>Skyroot Aerospace has unveiled its Vikram-1 rocket, an indigenous orbital rocket set to be launched in 2024.

The reasons for the delay include talks on the release of hostages held by Hamas, international pressure, and political-military differences. The Biden administration is urging Israel to postpone a ground conflict in Gaza and is sending military assets to express support for Israel and prevent others from joining the conflict. Hamas has held over 200 captives since attacking Israel on October 7th. Israeli authorities believe that a deal for hostages will be impossible once a ground invasion occurs. There are tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF (army), with disagreements and accusations of failing to prevent the attack by Hamas militants. The presence of US military personnel in Israel aims to prevent any move that could endanger the hostages, including Americans. International leaders are urging caution and fear that a ground operation could escalate the conflict and involve other countries like Iran-backed Hezbollah.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 10:39:20 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>‘Polite, wanted to talk politics’: The shocking stories of Hamas revealed by freed hostage</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-polite-wanted-to-talk-politics-the-shocking-stories-of-hamas-revealed-by-freed-hostage-13292502.html</link><description>Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old Israeli grandmother, was held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza. After being released, she shared her abduction ordeal and shed light on the treatment of captives by Hamas. Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released after being held captive for 16 days. Lifshitz described being beaten during the journey into Gaza and being tied to a motorcycle. Once in captivity, she and the other hostages were provided with mattresses, food, access to medical care, and were treated well overall. Lifshitz praised the militants for their treatment, stating that they took care of their needs and were concerned about hygiene. She also criticized the Israeli government for security lapses. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are gathering intelligence from Lifshitz's account as they prepare to respond to the Hamas attack. The decision to put Lifshitz in front of the cameras has received criticism, with some viewing it as a propaganda win for Hamas. Hamas claims to have over 200 hostages, and the release of Lifshitz and Cooper follows the release of two Israeli-American women. The US has reportedly asked Israel to delay its ground invasion to facilitate the release of more hostages.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 10:17:39 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Will VK Pandian, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik’s Man Friday, become his successor?</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/vk-pandian-odisha-cm-naveen-patnaik-close-aide-successor-bjd-elections-13295852.html</link><description>Hmm, I'm sorry, but I am not able to summarize articles or provide information about individuals.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) currently provides aid to 600,000 displaced Gazans and has called for a humanitarian "pause" in fighting. Hospitals are on the verge of shutting down due to the lack of fuel supplies, and the healthcare system is at its worst stage in history. The World Health Organization warns that patients dependent on dialysis and premature babies are at risk of dying without a stable supply of electricity. Israel has ruled out allowing fuel into Gaza, claiming that Hamas would use it for its operational infrastructure and rocket attacks. Israel suggests that the UN ask Hamas for fuel supplies, as they claim Hamas has stored fuel in advance. Israel is also in a diplomatic row with the UN after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments about the attack by Hamas on Israel not happening in a vacuum.

Both Israel and the Biden administration are focused on trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The US is rushing nearly a dozen air-defense systems to the area, and has also advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault as it works to free more hostages and prepare for a potential wider conflict. Israel is taking into account the need for humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages. The threat to US troops is a top concern, as they are expected to be targeted by militant groups once an invasion begins. Israeli officials acknowledge that some hostages may have already been killed in retaliatory air raids, and they believe a solution for the hostages will become practically impossible once a ground invasion takes place. Egypt has been urged to pressure Hamas to release all detained women and children if they want to reach a solution.

The CTBT, agreed upon in 1996, aims to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons by banning any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion worldwide. Currently, 187 states have signed the treaty, with 178 ratifying it in their parliaments. Of the nine countries with nuclear weapons, Britain and France have both signed and ratified the treaty, while the United States, Israel, and China have signed but not ratified it. Russia had previously signed and ratified the treaty but is now withdrawing its ratification. The treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests, with no country conducting such a test since the 1990s except for North Korea. The treaty also established a global network of observation posts to detect signs of nuclear explosions. While Russia claims it does not plan to conduct a test unless the US does so first, some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now. A resumption of nuclear testing could prompt other countries to follow suit and potentially lead to a new arms race.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 09:57:23 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Who is Baap of Chart owner Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari?

SEBI alleges that he made buying/selling recommendations under the guise of educational courses and promised guaranteed returns. The regulator also accused Ansari of using theatrics and showmanship to induce investors to trade in securities. Additionally, SEBI found that Ansari incurred losses in stock trading despite claiming to provide strategies for high profits.

The ministry highlighted issues such as misleading claims of "free mandatory web check-in" and not allowing customers to board with confirmed tickets. A survey found that 47% of respondents had to pay for a seat of their choice in the last year, and 51% did not get any free seat and were charged an additional fee for seat allocation. The ministry has called for a meeting with CEOs of airlines and travel portals to address these concerns. Airlines in India charge passengers for seat selection, with fees ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 1,000 depending on the location of the seat. In 2013, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation allowed airlines to charge consumers for extra services, including preferential seats, but this norm was struck down in 2015. Last March, a Parliamentary panel criticized airlines for charging different fares for seat allocation and asked the government to monitor fare pricing.

Stubble burning in Punjab has been listed as one of the biggest contributors to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR).

The blood test alone can diagnose up to 30% of patients with bipolar disorder, but it is even more effective when used in conjunction with the online assessment. This combination can help differentiate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which have similar symptoms but require different treatments. The blood test is still in the proof of concept stage, but it has the potential to be a valuable complement to existing psychiatric diagnosis methods. Up to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder, and the blood test could help ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment. The research team used samples and data from the delta study, conducted in the UK between 2018 and 2020, to identify bipolar disorder in patients previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The blood test and online assessment combination significantly improved diagnostic outcomes for people with bipolar disorder, especially in cases where the diagnosis was not obvious.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 09:17:33 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Want to avoid ‘sleep divorce’?

White hydrogen is a greener energy source than solar or wind power, as it only produces water when burned. It can be used as a substitute for steel, shipping, and aviation. The discovery was made when methane concentrations in the earth's crust were being evaluated, and hydrogen concentrations increased as scientists dug deeper. This discovery is significant because it shows that large amounts of hydrogen can naturally occur without requiring energy-consuming procedures. White hydrogen is predicted to be more affordable than green hydrogen, costing around one US dollar per kilogramme. It has the potential to help combat the climate crisis and transform the clean energy market. Organizations are currently drilling to find hydrogen resources, and startups are exploring the possibility of selling white hydrogen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 13:54:06 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>For Social media</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/for-social-media-13328522.html</link><description>This article is a brief announcement about joining a Whatsapp channel to receive the latest global news updates.

Jet streams are bands of strong wind that influence weather, air travel, and the atmosphere. They are created when warm and cold air masses collide, creating an air current. Jet streams can reach speeds of up to 442 kilometers per hour. When an airplane flies in the same direction as a jet stream, it gets an extra push and travels faster. Airlines have been using jet streams to reduce flight times, with some flights arriving at their destinations earlier than expected. However, jet streams can also cause turbulence and require extensive planning for arrival times.

The study involved nearly 1,200 participants who were placed in experiments designed to mimic work settings. Participants were told that their manager would award a bonus based on their performance, and some were informed that there were two types of employees: blue and red. One-third of the participants were told that the manager had a bias against blue employees, another third were told the manager was biased in their favor, and the rest received no information about bias. The study found that participants who knew their managers discriminated against them or favored them completed fewer tasks than those in the control group. The researchers also found that discrimination can worsen over time, with disadvantaged workers showing the largest decline in effort. Additionally, the study showed that discrimination can lead to behavior by employees that strengthens negative stereotypes or spreads discriminatory stereotypes to new managers. The findings suggest that workplace discrimination can have negative effects on productivity and may hurt firms' bottom lines more than previously assumed. Future research is needed to understand how bias operates in different contexts, such as race, gender, sexuality, or parental status.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 10:00:38 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Why are prices of olive oil rising in Europe?

This rise in price is due to factors such as drought and harsh weather damaging olive crops in major producing countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal. As a result, the cost of olive oil has reached record levels, making it more expensive for consumers. In addition to olive oil, potato prices have also seen a staggering rise. These increases in food prices have put a burden on poorer families who are struggling to keep up with inflation. The European Trade Union Confederation has noted that wages are failing to keep up with the rising costs of basic food items, forcing more people to rely on food banks. Despite falling annual inflation rates, food inflation remains high at 7.5%. The olive oil sector is facing its own challenges, including drought, higher temperatures affecting flowering, and inflation affecting fertilizer prices. The shortage of supply is impacting markets and households globally, including India where the cost of imported olive oil has increased by 22%. Consumers in India are reconsidering their choices and opting for alternative cooking oils due to the surging costs of olive oil. The high prices are expected to continue until at least June 2024.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 16:09:07 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan last in global employees' well-being survey.

Japanese respondents reported low scores in all categories, with 30% reporting social health, 74% reporting physical health, 24% reporting spiritual health, and 42% reporting mental health. The report suggests that Japan's high levels of stress and lack of workplace satisfaction contribute to its low ranking. India ranked second in the survey but reported high rates of burnout symptoms. Over 50% of workers worldwide exhibit signs of burnout, which increases their likelihood of quitting their jobs. The survey also found that demands at work, such as dealing with toxic behaviors or role ambiguity, are more predictive of burnout symptoms than enablers.

Albanese will raise concerns about rising tensions in the South China Sea during his meeting with Xi.

The death toll is expected to rise as communication has been cut off in many areas. Nepal is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the boundary of two tectonic plates, the Asian and Indo-Australian plates. The collision of these plates created the Himalayan Mountains and causes frequent earthquakes. Nepal's flimsy buildings and growing population contribute to the vulnerability of the country. Some of the deadliest earthquakes in Nepal's history include a 8.2 magnitude earthquake in 1934 that killed over 10,000 people and a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 that killed around 9,000 people.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 14:26:52 +0530</pubDate></item><item><title>Why an Australian court has ordered a former Indian diplomat to pay Rs 1.13 crore to domestic help</title><link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-an-australian-court-has-ordered-a-former-indian-diplomat-to-pay-rs-1-13-crore-to-domestic-help-13352292.html</link><description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared.

The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi stood at 346, which is considered severe. The pollution is caused by various factors, including farm fires in north-west India, vehicular emissions, and industrial and construction activities. Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has seen a significant increase this year, contributing to the high levels of pollution. The lack of strong winds and rainfall exacerbates the situation as pollutants accumulate in the air. To tackle the pollution, emergency measures have been implemented, including school closures and bans on polluting vehicles and construction activity. The next 15 days are critical for Delhi as experts warn that there will be no respite from pollution during this period.</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 17:13:09 +0530</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
