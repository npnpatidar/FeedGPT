			<title>SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission: Who are the astronauts embarking on history's first private spacewalk?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-who-are-the-astronauts-embarking-on-history-first-private-spacewalk-13813817.html</link>
			<description>The Polaris Dawn mission, led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, launched four astronauts into space on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.  The five-day mission aims to push the boundaries of human space exploration by reaching the highest Earth orbit since the Apollo program, exceeding 1,400 km (870 miles).  Another key objective is the first-ever private spacewalk, where two crew members will venture outside the spacecraft, relying solely on SpaceX spacesuits. The mission also includes 40 science experiments focused on understanding the effects of space travel on the human body. Onboard are Isaacman, mission pilot Scott Poteet, SpaceX lead operations engineer Sarah Gillis, and SpaceX medical officer Anna Menon.  This mission marks a significant step in commercial space exploration, demonstrating the capabilities of private citizens and companies in pushing the frontiers of space travel.</description>

			<title>‘Underwear storm’ hits Chinese city. What's going on?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/underwear-storm-hits-chinese-city-chongqing-what-is-going-on-13813780.html</link>
			<description>Chongqing, China experienced an unusual weather event dubbed the "9/2 Chongqing underwear crisis" on Monday.  A sudden windstorm, with gusts up to 122 km/h, swept through the city, scattering laundry from high-rise balconies. 

The city had been enduring a heatwave and authorities had recently used cloud-seeding technology to induce rainfall.  

Videos of underwear flying through the air went viral on social media, with residents sharing their experiences with humour and disbelief.  

While some speculated that cloud seeding was to blame, the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau stated that the strong winds were caused by natural convection and not artificial rainfall.</description>

			<title>Rahul Gandhi’s remarks in US on Sikhs draw ire: How Congress leader’s foreign trips have courted rows</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/congress-rahul-gandhi-sikh-remarks-us-visit-bjp-foreign-trips-controversy-13813807.html</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition, sparked controversy during his first foreign trip since assuming the role. 

While addressing the Indian diaspora in the US, Gandhi raised concerns about religious freedom in India, citing the potential restrictions faced by Sikhs in practicing their faith. He specifically questioned whether Sikhs would be allowed to wear turbans and kada, a Sikh religious symbol,  in the country. 

Gandhi also addressed the issue of reservations, stating that he believes they are necessary until India becomes a fairer place. This statement drew criticism from political parties like the BSP, who accused him of conspiring against reservations.

His comments on India’s employment situation, contrasting it with China, also drew flak from the BJP, who accused him of promoting China's economic model and disrespecting India. 

The BJP strongly condemned Gandhi's remarks, alleging that he was insulting India and resorting to mudslinging on foreign soil. They further criticized his previous remarks abroad, accusing him of consistently discrediting India and its institutions.</description>

			<title>How a hunt for man who threw boiling hot coffee on a baby in Australia turned global</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/global-hunt-for-man-who-threw-boiling-hot-coffee-on-baby-in-australia-13813805.html</link>
			<description>A nine-month-old baby named Luka suffered serious burns after a man allegedly threw scalding coffee on him at a Brisbane park in August. The unprovoked attack shocked Australia and the suspect, a 33-year-old man, fled the country. Police have issued an arrest warrant for aggravated grievous bodily harm, a charge that carries a potential life sentence.  The man was captured on CCTV and is believed to be aware of police procedures, making the investigation complex.  Luka has undergone multiple surgeries and while his physical recovery is expected to take years, his parents fear the lasting mental scars of the attack.</description>

			<description>The US presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump highlights stark contrasts on key issues. Harris supports middle-class tax cuts, climate action, and restoring abortion rights, aligning with the Biden administration's agenda. 

Trump, conversely, seeks to expand tax cuts, bolster fossil fuels, and implement stricter immigration policies. 

Their positions diverge on issues like immigration, where Harris advocates for comprehensive reform and Trump proposes mass deportations.  

On Ukraine, Harris backs continued support for Ukraine against Russian aggression, while Trump criticizes US aid and suggests negotiation with Russia.  

They also differ on abortion, with Harris defending federal abortion rights and Trump leaving the issue to states.  

Regarding climate change, Harris emphasizes clean energy projects, while Trump promotes fossil fuel expansion.  

On social issues, Harris supports LGBTQ+ rights, while Trump advocates for rollback of protections. Their trade policies also clash, with Harris focusing on alliances and Trump on tariffs against China. 


Finally, they hold opposing views on democracy and the rule of law, with Harris defending election integrity and Trump questioning the 2020 election results.</description>

			<title>SpaceX launches Polaris Dawn: Why mission is set to make history</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/spacex-launches-polaris-dawn-why-mission-is-set-to-make-history-13808475.html</link>
			<description>SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission, launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, marks the first privately managed spacewalk. The six-day mission involves a crew of four: billionaire Jared Isaacman, SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, and ex-US Air Force pilot Scott Poteet. The Crew Dragon capsule, named Resilience, will orbit Earth at an altitude of 1,367 kilometers, exceeding the distance to the International Space Station. The highlight of the mission is the spacewalk by Isaacman and Gillis, a historic feat as previous spacewalks have only been conducted by government astronauts.  
 
The spacewalk, lasting approximately two hours, will test SpaceX's new spacesuit, which will be crucial for future missions, including those to Mars. The crew will conduct approximately 40 experiments, exploring areas like human adaptation to low gravity and radiation exposure.  The success of Polaris Dawn is seen as a significant step towards private companies taking on a more prominent role in space exploration.</description>

			<title>Why has Delhi banned crackers until January 1? How much harm do firecrackers cause to the body?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/why-has-delhi-banned-crackers-until-january-1-how-much-harm-do-firecrackers-cause-to-the-body-13813655.html</link>
			<description>The Delhi government has implemented a complete ban on firecrackers until January 1, 2025, in an effort to mitigate the city's severe air pollution problem, particularly during the winter months. The ban encompasses manufacturing, storage, sale, and use of all firecrackers, including online purchases.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai stated that firecrackers significantly worsen air quality, posing health risks to citizens. This move comes after previous attempts to control pollution by allowing only "green" firecrackers, which proved ineffective due to difficulty in distinguishing them from conventional ones and the emergence of a black market.

Despite the ban, concerns remain about its enforcement, with opponents arguing that it infringes upon festivals and traditions while larger pollution sources like stubble burning are not adequately addressed.</description>

			<title>Are US migrants eating pet cats and ducks? Bizarre rumour pushed by JD Vance and Elon Musk</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-us-migrants-eating-pet-cats-and-ducks-bizarre-rumour-pushed-by-jd-vance-and-elon-musk-13813731.html</link>
			<description>False claims circulating online allege that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are stealing and eating pets. These claims, originating from social media posts, have been amplified by right-wing figures including JD Vance, Elon Musk, and Ted Cruz. Despite a lack of evidence and police reports confirming the allegations, these narratives have been shared to exploit anxieties around immigration and target Vice President Kamala Harris, who is seen as vulnerable on the issue. The spread of these false claims is seen as an attempt to further a nativist and racist agenda, particularly ahead of the upcoming US election.</description>

			<title>Has Pakistan discovered ‘massive’ oil and gas reserves that could turn its ‘destiny’?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pakistan-massive-oil-gas-reserves-discovery-economic-crisis-13813711.html</link>
			<description>Pakistan has announced the discovery of a potentially significant oil and gas reserve in its territorial waters.  

This discovery follows a three-year survey conducted in collaboration with a friendly nation. The potential size of the reserves has generated optimism, with some estimates suggesting it could be the fourth largest in the world. This find could significantly impact Pakistan's economy, which is heavily reliant on energy imports. 

However, experts caution against premature celebrations, emphasizing the need for further exploration and confirmation of the reserves' size and feasibility of extraction.  Actual production could take several years and require substantial investment. Despite the uncertainties, the discovery has renewed interest in Pakistan's offshore energy potential and its ability to benefit from the "blue economy."</description>

			<title>White supremacist terror network on Telegram exposed: What is the 'Terrorgram Collective'?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/white-supremacist-terror-network-on-telegram-exposed-what-is-the-terrorgram-collective-13813627.html</link>
			<description>Two leaders of the extremist white supremacist group ‘Terrorgram Collective’, Dallas Humber and Matthew Allison, have been charged by the US Department of Justice. Prosecutors allege the pair used Telegram to incite violence, glorify attacks on racial minorities and officials, and even provided bomb-making instructions.  The Terrorgram Collective, which promotes “white supremacist accelerationism,” aimed to provoke societal collapse through racially motivated violence. Humber and Allison are accused of celebrating attacks perpetrated by followers, including those in Turkey and Slovakia. If convicted on all charges, each could face up to 220 years in prison. 


This case highlights the growing threat posed by extremist groups operating online and the challenges of moderating platforms like Telegram.</description>

			<title>Apple Watch Series 10 can detect sleep apnea: What is the condition, can it be fatal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/apple-watch-series-10-sleep-apnea-detection-13813632.html</link>
			<description>The Apple Watch Series 10, announced at the "Its Glowtime" event, boasts a significant health advancement: the ability to detect sleep apnea. This feature uses the watch's accelerometer to monitor breathing disturbances during sleep.  Apple employs machine learning to analyze the data and alert users monthly to any irregularities.  If consistent patterns suggest moderate to severe sleep apnea, the watch will notify the user. 

The new Series 10 also retains features from its predecessor like notifications for atrial fibrillation (AFib) and prescription reminders. 


With a new wider OLED display, softer corners, and a thinner design,  the Apple Watch Series 10 aims to be both stylish and functional.</description>

			<title>Haryana Assembly polls: Why Congress-AAP alliance remains elusive</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/haryana-assembly-polls-2024-congress-aap-alliance-seat-sharing-talks-candidates-list-13813606.html</link>
			<description>Alliance talks between the Congress and the AAP for the upcoming Haryana Assembly elections have collapsed. While the Congress had initially expressed interest in an alliance, differences over seat sharing proved insurmountable.  The AAP demanded five to seven specific seats, including Kalayat and Jind, which the Congress was unwilling to concede. The Congress, optimistic about its chances of defeating the BJP, offered the AAP fewer seats it deemed less winnable. Dissenting voices within both parties also contributed to the breakdown of talks.   

The AAP, which will contest all 90 seats, blames an influential Congress leader for sabotaging the alliance.  With the nomination deadline approaching, both parties are now set to contest the elections independently.</description>

			<title>Donald Trump-Kamala Harris presidential debate: How are the candidates preparing? What can we expect?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/donald-trump-kamala-harris-presidential-debate-how-are-the-candidates-preparing-what-can-we-expect-13813471.html</link>
			<description>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to participate in a high-stakes debate.  Harris has been preparing extensively, including mock debates with an actor method-acting as Trump and reviewing policy details.  Trump, on the other hand, claims he requires minimal preparation, relying on his experience and frequent public appearances. 

The debate is expected to focus on key policy issues, with Harris likely to highlight Trump's record on issues like the economy, healthcare, and the environment. Trump is expected to attack Harris's liberal positions and paint her as being too radical.  Both campaigns anticipate the debate will be highly contentious.  Experts warn that a misstep in the 90-minute debate could significantly impact the election.</description>

			<title>Across UK, local governments are at risk of collapse. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/across-uk-local-governments-are-at-risk-of-collapse-heres-why-13813494.html</link>
			<description>A new report from Unison, the UK's largest trade union, warns that local governments in Wales, Scotland, and England face a funding shortfall of £5.6 billion this year, potentially rising to £11.1 billion.  This crisis could lead to the collapse of local government services, job cuts, and increased charges for residents and businesses. 

Unison blames the funding shortfall on years of austerity cuts imposed by previous Conservative governments, which have reduced local government funding by nine per cent since 2010-11.  They highlight eight councils declaring bankruptcy since 2018 and the closure of numerous youth centers, children's centers, public toilets, and libraries.  

However, some experts argue that the situation is more complex, pointing to specific poor financial decisions made by individual councils. For example, Birmingham's financial troubles are linked to equal pay lawsuits and a flawed IT system, while Nottingham's problems stem from a failed energy firm. 


Despite these varying perspectives, a consensus exists that local government funding is at a critical juncture, and urgent action is needed to prevent widespread collapse. The new Labour government plans to address this issue with increased funding and reforms to the local government system.</description>

			<title>What is abrosexuality, the latest talking point on the internet?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-abrosexuality-the-latest-talking-point-on-the-internet-13813430.html</link>
			<description>Abrosexuality is a relatively new and understood sexual identity characterized by fluctuating sexual or romantic attraction to different genders.  Unlike bisexual or pansexual identities which involve attraction to multiple genders consistently, abrosexual individuals experience shifts in attraction intensity and direction over time. These changes can occur daily, weekly, or even over longer periods, sometimes leading to little or no attraction at all.

The fluidity of abrosexual attraction presents unique challenges in dating and relationships, but many abrosexual individuals find ways to navigate them through open communication and mutual understanding.  For many, embracing the label "abrosexual" has brought a sense of clarity and self-acceptance.  As discussions around sexual orientation continue to evolve, abrosexuality is gaining more recognition and validating the experiences of those who identify with it.</description>

			<title>Attention remote workers. UK cafes are banning laptops. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/attention-remote-workers-uk-cafes-are-banning-laptops-heres-why-13813338.html</link>
			<description>Some UK coffee shops are implementing laptop bans or restrictions to encourage higher customer turnover and spending.  These cafes argue that laptop users often spend less and occupy tables for extended periods, impacting the cafe's revenue and atmosphere.  Owners cite a desire to create a more welcoming environment for customers who are looking to relax and socialize.  Similar restrictions are becoming common in European cities like Paris and Berlin. 

The move has sparked mixed reactions, with some customers praising the policy for reserving space for others and improving the cafe's ambiance. Conversely, some criticize the restrictions as being overly restrictive, particularly for travellers or remote workers seeking a work space. This trend reflects a broader discussion about the evolving role of coffee shops and how to balance the needs of different customer types.</description>

			<title>First mpox case in India: How does it spread, what are the symptoms to watch out for?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/first-mpox-case-india-how-does-it-spread-symptoms-to-watch-out-for-13813411.html</link>
			<description>India has identified a suspected case of mpox in a man who recently traveled from a country experiencing an outbreak. The patient is isolated in stable condition, and authorities are conducting tests to confirm the infection and tracing potential contacts. This case aligns with earlier risk assessments, and there is no cause for undue alarm. India previously detected 30 cases of a different mpox strain between 2022 and 2024.

Mpox is a viral infection spread through close contact, causing flu-like symptoms and skin lesions.  The disease has two known clades, with Clade II, prevalent in West Africa, linked to the recent global outbreak. While generally less severe, recent variations of Clade II have raised concern due to their increased transmissibility. Treatment for mpox is currently unavailable, but smallpox vaccines have shown effectiveness in preventing and reducing symptom severity. India is actively preparing for potential wider spread, with heightened scrutiny at border crossings, designated treatment hospitals, and approved diagnostic kits.</description>

			<title>2,000 cops, thermal imaging, and more: How celebrity Filipino pastor, ‘owner of the universe’, wanted for sex crimes was arrested</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/filipino-pastor-apollo-quiboloy-arrest-sex-crimes-human-trafficking-charges-us-fbi-13813397.html</link>
			<description>Apollo Quiboloy, a Filipino preacher known for his "owner of the universe" claim, surrendered to authorities after a two-week standoff.  He faced charges of sexual abuse and human trafficking in both the Philippines and the United States. Quiboloy, a close associate of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte,  had been on the run since a Philippine court ordered his arrest.  




A US federal grand jury charged him with various offenses, including sex trafficking, marriage fraud, and money laundering. The US indictment accused Quiboloy and his associates of operating a sex trafficking ring that exploited women and underage girls. Despite the accusations, Quiboloy maintained his innocence. His arrest concluded a tense situation involving police, riot squads, and his devout followers.  He is expected to face trial in the Philippines before any potential extradition to the US.</description>

			<title>What is the 'God of Chaos', an asteroid that could hit Earth? Why are experts worried?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/god-of-chaos-asteroid-possible-earth-collision-13813345.html</link>
			<description>The asteroid Apophis, also known as the "God of Chaos," is scheduled to pass close to Earth in 2029 at a distance of 32,000 kilometers. Despite initial concerns about a potential collision, recent research suggests that even a small object impacting Apophis could alter its trajectory and potentially lead to a future collision with Earth. The study indicates that an object as small as 0.6 meters could cause a significant change in Apophis' path.  While the probability of such an event is low, the possibility remains, and astronomers will continue to monitor Apophis closely in the coming years.</description>

			<title>Why is US mainstream media being accused of ‘sanewashing’ Donald Trump's speeches?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-us-mainstream-media-being-accused-of-sanewashing-donald-trumps-speeches-13813388.html</link>
			<description>The term "sanewashing" has recently gained traction, accusing mainstream media outlets like The New York Times, CNN, and The Wall Street Journal of  attempting to make sense of Donald Trump's often rambling and nonsensical speeches. 

Critics argue that this practice, exemplified by the media's coverage of Trump's childcare policy explanation, misrepresents his words and downplays their potential harm. They contend that this sanitized portrayal fails to hold Trump accountable and normalizes his erratic behavior, ultimately endangering democratic discourse.

Examples cited include Trump's frequent references to Hannibal Lecter, his bizarre anecdote about an electric boat and a shark, and his threats regarding tariffs. Critics argue that media outlets, in an attempt to present Trump in a more palatable light, often focus on tangential details or misrepresent the content of his speeches, creating a distorted reality for viewers. This, they argue, undermines public understanding of Trump's rhetoric and its potential consequences.</description>

			<title>Landslides are destroying multimillion-dollar homes in California. Why they can't be stopped</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/california-landslides-rancho-palos-verdes-homes-destroyed-13813275.html</link>
			<description>Rancho Palos Verdes, California, is experiencing severe landslide issues exacerbated by recent heavy rains. The city, built on a complex network of slowly moving landslides, is witnessing accelerated ground shifts, with some areas sinking up to 13 inches weekly. This has resulted in road buckling, power outages, and gas shut-offs.  The Portuguese Bend community is particularly hard-hit, leading to evacuation warnings.  

The city is implementing the "Emergency Hydraugers Project" to extract water from the ground and slow down the movement, but the situation remains dire.  Climate change, with its increased rainfall and stronger storms, is contributing to the severity of the landslides, posing a significant risk to the safety and stability of the community.</description>

			<title>What is Pakistan’s affidavit, invoked by Rajnath Singh, that called PoK foreign land?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-pakistans-affidavit-invoked-by-rajnath-singh-that-called-pok-foreign-land-13813303.html</link>
			<description>Defense Minister Rajnath Singh highlighted Pakistan's treatment of PoK residents as "foreigners," contrasting it with India's stance of considering them "our own." He cited a Pakistani government affidavit stating that the region is a "foreign land" under the Pakistani court's jurisdiction. Singh urged PoK residents to join India and benefit from the development witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir.  

 India maintains that PoK is an integral part of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.  External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar asserted that PoK is "will always be part of India," emphasizing that residents there are comparing their situation to those in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir and observing its progress.</description>

			<title>Russia to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon. Are India and China joining in?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/russia-to-build-a-nuclear-power-plant-on-the-moon-are-india-and-china-joining-in-13813317.html</link>
			<description>Following its successful Chandrayaan-3 mission, India is reportedly interested in joining Russia's lunar nuclear power plant project. Led by Rosatom, this initiative aims to provide power to a planned lunar base being developed in collaboration with China. The plant is designed to generate around half a megawatt of energy and is expected to be operational by 2036. 

Nuclear power is considered crucial for long-term lunar exploration due to the Moon's limited solar energy availability, particularly during its 14-day lunar nights.  Experts highlight the safety measures built into the design, including automatic shutdowns in case of problems, to address concerns regarding transporting nuclear fuel to the Moon.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/from-japan-to-us-how-kolkata-rape-protests-have-spread-to-25-countries-13813233.html</link>
			<description>A month after the horrific rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College, the case continues to garner global attention. Protests demanding justice have spread to over 130 cities across 25 countries, led by alumni of the medical college. The Supreme Court is closely monitoring the case and has requested the CBI to submit a fresh status report by September 17. 

Several irregularities, including alleged financial misappropriation by the hospital's former principal, have come to light. Meanwhile, the West Bengal Assembly unanimously passed a bill proposing capital punishment for perpetrators who cause death or vegetative state in rape cases. The case has sparked nationwide outrage and demands for stricter laws and swift justice to ensure the safety of women.</description>

			<title>Japan's Prince Hisahito turns 18: What this means for the world's oldest monarchy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-prince-hisahito-turns-18-worlds-oldest-monarchy-13813220.html</link>
			<description>Prince Hisahito, a son of Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko, turned 18, marking a significant event for Japan's imperial family. As the last male heir apparent, Hisahito's coming of age highlights the pressure on the country's unique succession system, which doesn't allow for empresses.  The future emperor,  currently enrolled in high school, expressed his desire to learn and grow while continuing his studies. 


This single male heir presents a challenge as Japan's population ages and shrinks.  There's ongoing debate about whether to amend the law to allow female succession or expand the imperial family to ensure a stable line of heirs.</description>

			<title>Why did Edmundo González, ‘winner’ of Venezuela election, flee to Spain?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/venezuela-edmundo-gonzalez-oppositon-leader-flees-to-spain-nicolas-maduro-13813243.html</link>
			<description>Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez, the opposition candidate declared the winner of Venezuela's July 28 presidential election by many Venezuelans and foreign governments, has fled to Spain.  He was granted asylum after the Maduro government ordered his arrest. 

GonzÃ¡lez had been in hiding at the Spanish embassy in Caracas before leaving on a Spanish Air Force plane.  The departure comes amid a government crackdown after the election, with over 2,000 arrests and deaths.

While the official results declared Maduro the winner, the opposition collected evidence suggesting GonzÃ¡lez won by a two-to-one margin. The UN and Carter Center, which observed the election, found the official results lacked credibility.  GonzÃ¡lez's departure is a significant setback for the Venezuelan opposition, leaving his political future uncertain.</description>

			<title>1 in 10 people fall ill by eating unsafe food every year. Here's how you should wash your veggies before use</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/1-in-10-people-fall-ill-by-eating-unsafe-food-every-year-heres-how-you-should-wash-your-veggies-before-use-13811342.html</link>
			<description>Consuming contaminated fruits and vegetables contributes to a significant number of foodborne illnesses. While we often associate dangers with raw meat and fish, fresh produce can also harbor bacteria, fungi, viruses, and pesticides.

The simplest and safest way to clean produce is by washing it under cold, running water, removing dirt and surface contaminants by rubbing.  

Avoid using detergents or bleach, as they can be absorbed by the produce and alter its taste and safety. While vinegar and baking soda solutions can reduce bacteria and pesticides, they may also impact the taste and texture of the produce.


For produce with firm skins or rinds, scrub gently with a vegetable brush. Leafy greens should be separated and rinsed thoroughly, discarding damaged outer leaves.  Berries, due to their high water content, are best washed right before consumption.  Finally, remember that no home washing method eliminates all germs, and cooking at temperatures above 60°C is the only way to ensure their complete destruction.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-people-putting-flowers-and-antiques-in-their-fridges-its-called-fridgescaping-13810875.html</link>
			<description>Fridgescaping, the trend of decorating the interior of refrigerators, has gained popularity on social media.  It involves arranging food items aesthetically, using decorative bowls, and incorporating non-food elements like flowers and artwork. 

While some find it a creative and fun way to enhance their kitchens, others criticize it as impractical and insensitive given food insecurity issues. Critics argue that turning a refrigerator into a display diminishes its functional purpose and may even pose safety risks. 

Advocates, however, suggest that fridgescaping can encourage healthier eating habits by making food more visually appealing and motivating users to consume ingredients before they spoil.</description>

			<title>How ageing 'bursts' at 44 and 60 can make you grow older rapidly</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/ageing-waves-44-66-growing-old-rapidly-13812446.html</link>
			<description>A new study challenges the traditional view of aging as a slow and steady process, revealing that it occurs in distinct "waves."  Researchers found that significant changes in molecules like RNA and proteins happen in two main spurts: around age 44 and again around age 60. These changes may explain sudden shifts in physical attributes and health, such as wrinkle formation, muscle soreness, and increased susceptibility to infections.  

The study suggests that lifestyle factors, including alcohol consumption, may contribute to these aging "waves." The researchers recommend individuals in their 40s and 60s prioritize healthier living, including exercise and a balanced diet, to mitigate the effects of these accelerated aging periods.</description>

			<title>Thailand's most controversial dynasty is back at the helm. Can Paetongtarn Shinawatra tread her own path?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/thailands-most-controversial-dynasty-is-back-at-the-helm-can-paetongtarn-shinawatra-tread-her-own-path-13812550.html</link>
			<description>Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Thailand’s new prime minister, faces significant challenges as she leads her family's political dynasty.  

Due to her father's popularity with the rural and working-class, his policies thrived despite alleged corruption accusations from the elite, resulting in two military coups.  Paetongtarn seeks to carry forward this legacy but must address the country's economic woes and navigate the complex Thai political landscape.  

The conservative establishment, which previously removed her father and aunt from power, remains a formidable opponent.  They are likely to closely scrutinize any decisions made by Paetongtarn's government, potentially using judicial or anti-corruption mechanisms to undermine her rule. The Shinawatras also face a dilemma regarding the progressive Move Forward Party, which poses a threat to their and the establishment's power.</description>

			<title>Who is Alice Guo? Ex-Mayor of a small Philippine town, accused of being a spy for China</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-alice-guo-ex-mayor-of-a-small-philippine-town-accused-of-being-a-spy-for-china-13812819.html</link>
			<description>Former Filipina mayor Alice Guo, once portrayed as a humble public servant, is at the center of a major international scandal.  Guo, who used the alias Alice Guo Hua Ping, is accused of ties to Chinese criminal syndicates, money laundering, and human trafficking. Her arrest came after months on the run, during which authorities discovered a network of businesses linked to Guo that facilitated online gambling operations and allegedly trafficked hundreds of workers. 

Philippine authorities, led by Senator Risa Hontiveros, allege Guo's connections to individuals convicted of fraud in Singapore.  Her case has highlighted concerns about the influence of Chinese organized crime in the Philippines and the vulnerability of the country's justice system. Guo's recent extradition from Indonesia marks a turning point in this case, with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr vowing to ensure justice is served.</description>

			<title>Who was Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, Turkish-American activist allegedly shot dead by Israeli forces in West Bank?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-was-aysenur-ezgi-eygi-turkish-american-activist-allegedly-shot-dead-by-israeli-forces-in-west-bank-13812785.html</link>
			<description>Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old Turkish-American and recent graduate of the University of Washington, was killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank while participating in a protest against Israeli settlement expansion. Eyewitnesses  say she was not posing a threat at the time of the shooting. Eygi was shot in the head during a clash with Israeli soldiers near Beita, a town known for frequent protests against settlements. Israeli forces claim they were responding to "instigators of violent activity." 

The US has called for an investigation and expressed its concern over Eygi's death. Turkish officials also condemned the killing and urged for accountability. Eygi was an active advocate for human rights and had participated in various protests, including those against the Dakota Access Pipeline and the war in Gaza. 


The incident highlights the escalating violence in the West Bank following the Israel-Hamas war and raises concerns about the safety of foreign nationals and civilians in the region.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-modaks-the-divine-sweet-that-won-lord-ganeshas-heart-13812705.html</link>
			<description>Modaks are traditional sweet dumplings deeply significant in Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Legend says Goddess Parvati declared whoever ate a divine modak would gain knowledge in various fields.  A competition arose between her sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya, for the modak. Ganesha, by symbolically circling his parents as his universe, won the favor of his mother, who made it his favorite. 

Modaks now symbolize wisdom and are essential offerings to Lord Ganesha, who is also known as "Modakapriyaya."  They are prepared with love, often in quantities of 21.</description>

			<title>Ganesh Chaturthi: In Mumbai, even Ganpati pandals are insured. But why?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ganesh-chaturthi-mumbai-ganpati-pandals-insurance-13812500.html</link>
			<description>Ganesh Chaturthi, a major festival in India, sees numerous Ganpati pandals erected across Mumbai.  These pandals often require insurance coverage for a variety of risks. 

The GSB Seva Mandal's Maha Ganapati, Mumbai's "richest idol," holds a record-breaking insurance policy of Rs 400.58 crore. This coverage includes protection against theft, fire, earthquake, and personal accident for volunteers and staff.

Lalbaugcha Raja, another famous Ganpati idol in Mumbai, is insured for Rs 32.76 crore, with provisions for personal accident cover, third-party liability, and protection for the idol's ornaments and the pandal structure.

Insurance for Ganpati pandals typically extends from the start of the festival until the idol's immersion. Beyond Ganpati festivals, insurance is also becoming increasingly common for other religious celebrations like Durga Puja, Janmashtami, and Navratri.</description>

			<title>Why luxury brand Burberry is no longer on UK’s ‘most valuable companies’ list</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-luxury-brand-burberry-is-no-longer-on-uks-most-valuable-companies-list-13812595.html</link>
			<description>Burberry's value has drastically declined, leading to its removal from the UK's most valuable companies list and the FTSE 100 index. The luxury brand has faced significant financial setbacks, with sales and profits plummeting due to slowed spending on luxury goods globally, particularly in China.  

Experts attribute their struggles to Burberry's attempts to move into the high-profit leather goods market and attract a more upscale clientele, areas where it lacked brand desirability and heritage.  Burberry's past design changes, along with its struggles to balance outlet sales with price increases, have also contributed to its decline.  Despite the challenges, the company remains optimistic about its future, highlighting the enduring appeal of its iconic products.</description>

			<title>Barack Obama’s half-brother will vote for Trump this US elections. Who is Malik Obama?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/barack-obamas-half-brother-will-vote-for-trump-this-us-elections-who-is-malik-obama-13812455.html</link>
			<description>Malik Obama, half-brother of former US President Barack Obama, has publicly declared his support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. This support stems from what Malik perceives as a lack of support from his brother, particularly regarding Malik's foundation established in their late father's name. Malik accuses Barack of wanting him to shut down the foundation and of not supporting him during controversial allegations against it.  

Beyond this, Malik expresses dissatisfaction with Barack's political stances,  finding him too "focused on himself" and disapproving of his support for LGBT rights. Malik shares conservative views, aligning with Trump's platform on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. He views Trump as a genuine leader who speaks his mind.</description>

			<description>Following inconclusive elections in France, President Macron appointed Michel Barnier as prime minister.  The new government lacks a majority, relying on support from Marine Le Pen's National Rally party.  Le Pen, leader of the far-right, now holds significant influence, demanding policies aligned with her party's priorities.  While she claims to be willing to compromise, Barnier faces challenges in balancing the demands of various political factions, including the need to address budget concerns and the ever-present potential for no-confidence motions.</description>

			<title>Why has a tiny town in Italy banned cricket?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-has-a-tiny-town-in-italy-banned-cricket-13812487.html</link>
			<description>The Italian town of Monfalcone has banned cricket, citing concerns about public safety and financial constraints. However, the ban is widely seen as part of a broader anti-immigration agenda pushed by the town's mayor, Anna Maria Cisint. 

Cisint, who won re-election on a platform opposing immigration, claims that the influx of Bangladeshi Muslim immigrants, many employed at the town's shipyards, is eroding Monfalcone's culture and that they contribute nothing to the community.  She has also taken steps to restrict religious practices of the Bangladeshi Muslim population, including banning collective prayer at local Islamic centers. Local Bangladeshis, who say they are targeted and contribute significantly to the town's economy, deny these allegations and feel ostracized.</description>

			<title>Did Vladimir Putin just ‘endorse’ Kamala Harris or did he do Donald Trump a huge favour?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/did-vladimir-putin-just-endorse-kamala-harris-or-did-he-do-donald-trump-a-huge-favour-13812432.html</link>
			<description>Vladimir Putin made a surprising endorsement of Kamala Harris for US president, praising her "infectious laugh." This comment came despite US accusations of Russian interference in the 2024 election, favoring Donald Trump through disinformation campaigns. 

Putin's past actions, including praising Trump in 2015 and supporting Russian interference in 2016, raise questions about the sincerity of his endorsement. Some experts believe it could be a tactic to sow discord and undermine US democracy, similar to his strategies in previous elections.  

The timing of Putin's endorsement coincides with serious allegations of Russian interference, including the unsealing of charges against two Russian citizens and the seizure of Russian-backed websites. While the Biden administration accuses Russia of actively supporting Trump, the Kremlin denies any involvement.</description>

			<title>Can Sheikh Hasina be extradited to Bangladesh from India?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-sheikh-hasina-be-extradited-to-bangladesh-from-india-13812438.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh after resigning as prime minister and is currently in India. The interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, has stated that Hasina should "keep quiet" and has implied they could request her extradition on charges related to violence and instability that followed her removal. 

A 2013 extradition treaty between India and Bangladesh, amended in 2016,  could allow for her extradition if  certain legal conditions are met.  These include charges being "extradition offences," punishable in both countries, and an arrest warrant issued by a court. However, the treaty allows for the refusal of extradition if the offenses are "political in nature."

Hasina's situation is complex, as some charges against her may be considered political, and India may prioritize its strategic interests in the region over complying with the extradition request. India has not made any public statements on the matter.</description>

			<title>Italy luxury yacht victims died of ‘dry drowning’: What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-dry-drowning-italy-luxury-yacht-13812384.html</link>
			<description>Autopsies on four victims of the Bayesian superyacht sinking revealed "dry drowning" as the cause of death. This condition, not medically recognized, occurs when inhaled water causes vocal cord spasms, restricting airflow to the lungs. 

The autopsies found no water in the victims' lungs, tracheas, or stomachs. It is believed they absorbed all the oxygen in an air pocket within the cabin before CO2 levels became fatal.  
 
Further autopsies are pending for other victims, including British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his daughter. Investigations into potential manslaughter and shipwreck are ongoing, focusing on the ship's engineer, sailor, and captain.  

The luxury yacht sank within 16 minutes after being struck by a downburst, prompting questions about its stability. Salvage operations are underway to raise the vessel and prevent fuel leakage.</description>

			<title>Olympian Rebecca Cheptegei dies after being set on fire. Her murder exposes Kenya's gender violence</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/olympian-rebecca-cheptegei-death-kenya-femicide-violence-against-women-13812407.html</link>
			<description>Rebecca Cheptegei, a 33-year-old Ugandan long-distance runner, was set on fire by her ex-boyfriend at her home in western Kenya. She died four days later from multiple organ failure due to the severe burns. This tragic incident highlights the widespread issue of femicide in Kenya. Cheptegei's death follows two similar cases of female athletes being killed in Kenya since 2021.  Kenya's sports minister acknowledged the urgent need to combat gender-based violence, especially within the sports community. Cheptegei's father called for justice, while fellow athletes and activists mourned her loss and condemned the violence.  The incident has sparked renewed calls for government action to address the root causes of femicide in the country, including societal attitudes that tolerate violence against women.</description>

			<title>US, Britain, EU sign world's first AI treaty: Why is it a big deal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-britain-eu-sign-world-first-ai-treaty-why-is-it-a-big-deal-13812386.html</link>
			<description>The US, EU, and UK have signed the first legally binding international treaty on artificial intelligence. The treaty, backed by over 50 nations, aims to balance AI innovation with safeguarding human rights and democracy. It focuses on addressing potential risks posed by AI while promoting responsible innovation.  

The treaty requires signatories to be held accountable for harmful or discriminatory outcomes resulting from AI systems and mandates that AI systems respect privacy, equality, and democratic principles.  While hailed as a significant step, some critics argue that the treaty lacks sufficient enforcement power and includes broad exemptions for certain AI applications.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-jobs-report-set-for-release-today-what-will-it-reveal-and-why-is-it-crucial-13812351.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming US jobs report is highly anticipated as it will influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Recent economic data, including a rise in unemployment to 4.3% in July, has raised concerns about a potential slowdown. Economists predict job growth will remain moderate with the unemployment rate edging down slightly. The report's outcome could impact the 2024 US presidential election, as it could influence public perception of the current administration's economic performance. Additionally, the US jobs report will have reverberations across global financial markets, including stock indexes, oil prices, and bond yields.</description>

			<title>Why has US president’s son Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in tax case? Will he go to jail?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-president-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-tax-case-guilty-plea-13812340.html</link>
			<description>Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges.  This avoids a second criminal trial for Hunter, who was previously found guilty in a separate case involving gun possession and drug use. The tax charges stem from Hunter Biden's failure to pay approximately $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019, as well as allegations of misrepresenting expenses on his tax forms. 

Prosecutors rejected an Alford plea from Hunter Biden, who asserted his innocence while acknowledging the strength of the evidence against him. Hunter Biden's guilty plea came after his lawyers proposed this alternative, stating he desired to spare his family further scrutiny and pain related to his past struggles with addiction.  

He faces a potential sentence of up to 17 years in prison and $1.3 million in fines.  His sentencing is scheduled for December, after the presidential election.</description>

			<title>Ganesh Chaturthi: From Thailand to Japan, how Ganpati is revered beyond India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ganesh-chaturthi-thailand-japan-how-ganpati-is-revered-beyond-india-13812104.html</link>
			<description>Ganesha, a beloved deity in India, enjoys widespread reverence across Asia.  His influence extends to Thailand, where he is known as Phira Phikanet and symbolizes success and obstacle removal.  In Cambodia, Ganesha is worshipped for his power to grant moksha, while Tibet incorporates him into Buddhism with forms like Maharakta Ganapati and Vajra Vinayaka, emphasizing his role as a protector and remover of obstacles.

China portrays Ganesha in a darker tantric form as Huanxi Tian, while Afghanistan houses the Gardez Ganesha, worshipped as a god of wisdom and prosperity. Reaching Japan through Tibet and China, Ganesha, known as Kangiten, is revered by merchants, gamblers, actors, and geishas, even evolving into a unique "twin" form, "Embracing Kangiten," representing prosperity through passion.   Indonesia sees Ganesha as a tantric deity removing obstacles in magical rituals, and   in Java, both tantric and Hindu versions exist, with a notable idol situated at Mount Bromo, believed to protect locals from the volcano.</description>

			<title>Is an economic crisis in China turning the population obese?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-economic-crisis-obesity-13811746.html</link>
			<description>China is facing a growing obesity crisis driven by economic and lifestyle changes. 

In urban areas, job losses in construction and manufacturing are pushing people towards cheaper, unhealthy meals. Automation in agriculture and a lack of access to healthcare are contributing to the problem in rural regions. The increasing number of desk-bound jobs due to economic shifts is leading to a decline in physical activity. This, combined with long work hours and stress, is further encouraging unhealthy eating habits. Experts warn that obesity can lead to costly health issues and strain China's healthcare system. The government has launched a public awareness campaign to combat obesity, promoting healthy diets, exercise, and lifestyle changes. However, addressing the underlying economic and structural factors driving the crisis remains a challenge.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pro-european-anti-brexit-hardliner-meet-frances-new-pm-michel-barnier-13812203.html</link>
			<description>Michel Barnier, a seasoned politician with decades of experience serving in various French ministerial roles, has been appointed Prime Minister by President Emmanuel Macron. Known for his role as the EU's Brexit negotiator, Barnier is seen as a relatively unifying figure despite his previous more hardline stances on issues like immigration.  Barnier faces the challenge of forming a stable government in a fractured parliament following the recent legislative elections.  His appointment comes after a period of intense political uncertainty and amidst calls for financial stability from the EU. The success of his government will depend on his ability to navigate the complex political landscape and forge alliances across the divided parliamentary blocs.</description>

			<description>The perception of veganism is changing, with some high-profile figures like Miley Cyrus and Mike Tyson abandoning plant-based diets. While veganism offers health benefits like lower cholesterol and reduced cancer risk, some former vegans cite fatigue, brain fog, and weakened health as reasons for switching.  Despite this, the growing vegan population suggests the movement remains significant.  However,  a more flexible approach, often called "flexitarianism,"  may be  gaining traction.</description>

			<title>Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh a month ago. Here's how the country is faring</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sheikh-hasina-fled-bangladesh-a-month-ago-heres-how-the-country-is-faring-13812105.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is in a state of flux following the resignation and exile of long-reigning Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has taken over, focusing on restoring law and order, fighting corruption, and holding fresh elections.  

Despite some signs of normality returning, tensions remain high. Widespread anger against Hasina's 15-year rule persists, with garment workers striking and former government officials facing legal action.  Student leaders, instrumental in forcing Hasina's resignation, are now part of the interim government but face the challenge of enacting meaningful reforms and managing public expectations.  

The timing of the next elections is a point of contention, with critics urging the interim government to prioritize consensus building among political parties before proceeding.  Hasina's opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is pushing for an early election, raising concerns about potential instability if their demands are not met.</description>

			<title>Why supermodel Elle Macpherson’s breast cancer story is causing a controversy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-supermodel-elle-macphersons-breast-cancer-story-is-causing-a-controversy-13812046.html</link>
			<description>Elle Macpherson, known for her acting and modeling career, revealed she was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer seven years ago. While doctors recommended chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or a mastectomy, Macpherson chose alternative therapies, describing her path as "heart-led, holistic." 

Macpherson claims she is now in remission and attributes her recovery to her alternative approach. However, this has sparked debate in the medical community. Some doctors warn against relying solely on alternative therapies for cancer treatment, citing potential dangers and a higher risk of mortality. They emphasize the importance of consulting with medical professionals and relying on evidence-based treatments.</description>

			<title>How did purple cupcakes lead to a diplomatic clash between Australia and Iran?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-did-purple-cupcakes-lead-to-a-diplomatic-clash-between-australia-and-iran-13812050.html</link>
			<description>An Australian embassy Instagram post celebrating 'Wear It Purple Day', which promotes LGBTQIA+ inclusivity, sparked a diplomatic row with Iran. The post, featuring purple cupcakes and the ambassador wearing a purple bow tie, was condemned by Tehran as disrespectful to its cultural norms.  

Homosexuality is illegal in Iran, punishable by death, and the Iranian government summoned the Australian ambassador, calling the post "norm-breaking" and a violation of international law. 

Australia's foreign minister defended the embassy's actions, reaffirming the country's commitment to human rights.  The incident further strained already tense relations between the two nations following a previous controversial post by Iran's ambassador to Australia.</description>

			<title>Fact Check: Did Kamala Harris really commit a hit-and-run that left a girl paralysed?</title>

			<description>A viral story alleging that Vice President Kamala Harris was involved in a 2011 hit-and-run accident that paralyzed a young girl has been debunked as false. The story originated from a recently created website, KBSF-San Francisco News, which features doctored images and a staged video. Investigations revealed that the images used in the story were taken from unrelated medical cases and the video shows a woman from an undisclosed location. No credible evidence supports the claims, and fact-checkers found no reports of such an incident involving Harris. Experts believe the story is part of a disinformation campaign aimed at undermining Harris and spreading misinformation ahead of the 2024 election.</description>

			<title>Who is Jaydeep Apte, sculptor of collapsed Shivaji statue, arrested in Maharashtra?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-jaydeep-apte-sculptor-of-collapsed-shivaji-statue-arrested-in-maharashtra-13811952.html</link>
			<description>Jaydeep Apte, the 24-year-old sculptor responsible for the collapsed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue in Sindhudurg, was arrested after a manhunt by police. Apte had evaded authorities since the August 26 incident where the 35-foot statue, unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2022, fell down after heavy rains. 

Apte, facing charges including attempted murder and culpable homicide, was nabbed in Kalyan, Thane district. The incident sparked a political controversy with questions raised about the project's execution and Apte's capabilities. The sculptor, an alumni of JJ School of Art, had limited experience with constructing large-scale statues before being awarded the contract.  


He was previously known for  creating a bronze bust of a Sikh soldier and a statuette of Manilal Gandhi. Apte’s arrest came amidst a political storm with both BJP and Shiv Sena trading accusations over the arrest and the handling of the case.</description>

			<title>Lesbianism as ‘sexual offence’, ‘importance’ of virginity: India’s ‘regressive’ new medical curriculum</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nmc-lesbianism-sexual-offence-importance-of-virginity-india-new-medical-curriculum-13812022.html</link>
			<description>The National Medical Commission (NMC) has revised the forensic medicine and toxicology curriculum for undergraduate medical students. Controversially, it has reintroduced  terms like "sodomy" and "lesbianism" under "unnatural sexual offences".  The revised syllabus also includes topics on the hymen, virginity, and defloration, which were previously removed.  

Other changes include a broader list of sexual offenses, the removal of seven hours of disability-related training, and updates to the psychiatry module that no longer explicitly address gender identity disorders. The NMC justifies the changes as necessary to adapt to evolving medical practices and societal contexts.  

However, disability rights activists have criticized the omission of disability-related training, arguing it negatively impacts the medical community's understanding and care for individuals with disabilities.</description>

			<title>Was Hvaldimir, the Russian ‘spy whale’, killed? Mystery deepens over death of the famous white beluga</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hvaldimir-russian-spy-whale-killed-mystery-death-famous-white-beluga-13811998.html</link>
			<description>Hvaldimir, a white beluga whale known for his friendly interactions with humans and his alleged ties to Russia, was found dead off the Norwegian coast.  Initially, the cause of death was unclear, but animal rights groups now allege that Hvaldimir was shot. They cite multiple bullet wounds found on his body as evidence.  

The groups have filed a police report, prompting an investigation. While the identity of the perpetrator remains unknown, Hvaldimir had gained notoriety in 2019 when he was found wearing a harness inscribed with "Equipment St. Petersburg," leading to speculation that he was a Russian spy. 

Despite the accusations, Hvaldimir was beloved for his playful nature, often engaging with people and retrieving objects.</description>

			<title>Is the Trudeau government set to fall? What’s going on in Canadian politics?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/canada-justin-trudeau-liberals-ndp-jagmeet-singh-withdraws-support-13811996.html</link>
			<description>Justin Trudeau's minority Liberal government faces uncertainty after the New Democratic Party (NDP) withdrew its support. The NDP, led by Jagmeet Singh, cited Trudeau's handling of recent labor disputes as a reason for the decision.  The agreement, in place since 2022, protected the Liberal government from confidence votes.  

The NDP's move leaves Trudeau needing to secure the support of other parties on a case-by-case basis to avoid an early election. This puts the government in a precarious position, especially as polls show declining popularity for the Liberals and support for the Conservative party.  

While not immediately triggering an election, the NDP's decision significantly weakens the Liberal government and increases the potential for an early poll. The next budget, expected in March or April, could serve as a catalyst for an election.  The NDP's strategy is to distance itself from the unpopular Liberals and position itself for the next election by focusing on issues like fighting corporate interests and protecting social programs.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-police-officials-bribe-parents-of-the-trainee-doctor-13811947.html</link>
			<description>The family of a trainee doctor murdered at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata has joined the protests, alleging police misconduct. They claim the police tried to suppress the incident, rushed the cremation, and offered them a bribe to drop the case. The allegations have been amplified by BJP leader Amit Malviya. The incident sparked widespread outrage and protests, leading to a CBI investigation. 

The investigation has revealed possible tampering of the crime scene and inconsistencies in the initial handling of the case by the Kolkata Police. The West Bengal Assembly passed a  bill proposing stringent punishments, including capital punishment for perpetrators resulting in death or permanent vegetative state for victims.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-russia-meddling-in-the-2024-us-election-what-we-know-so-far-13811953.html</link>
			<description>The US government has intensified scrutiny of Russian attempts to interfere in the 2024 presidential election.  

RT, a Russian state-controlled media outlet, is accused of being a key tool in spreading Kremlin-backed narratives and funding pro-Russian media campaigns in the US. Two RT employees were recently charged with funneling nearly $10 million to a Tennessee firm that employed conservative commentators to disseminate content favorable to Russia, particularly regarding Ukraine. 

The US has seized 32 Kremlin-controlled websites designed to mimic authentic US news outlets and is taking other actions, such as visa restrictions and foreign agent registrations, to counter Russian influence. 

Moscow's interference strategy, which involves disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and hacking attempts, is seen as a significant threat to US election security.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/georgia-school-shooting-colt-gray-gunman-13811914.html</link>
			<description>A shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia resulted in the deaths of four people, including two students. The shooter, 14-year-old Colt Gray, has been taken into custody and will be tried as an adult. Gray reportedly used an AR-platform weapon and was described as a quiet student who often skipped class.  

The FBI had interviewed Gray last year following online threats he made, but they did not arrest him at the time. The victims were identified as students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, along with teachers Richard Aspinwall and Christina Irimie. Nine others were injured in the shooting. The incident is the 30th mass killing in the US this year, prompting renewed calls for gun control.</description>

			<title>PM Modi in Singapore: How the island nation became India’s top FDI source</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-modi-singapore-india-top-fdi-source-13811787.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Singapore highlights the strong economic ties between the two nations. Singapore is India's top source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with a cumulative inflow of $159.94 billion since 2000, representing 24% of India's total FDI. In the recent quarter, Singapore led FDI into India at $3.9 billion.  

Experts attribute Singapore's prominence to factors like its competitive tax regime, efficient regulatory environment, and attractive features for global investors seeking Asian market entry.  While global uncertainties may temporarily impact FDI flows, India remains attractive to Singaporean investors, with anticipated growth in sectors like real estate, renewables, and semiconductors.</description>

			<title>Harris skipped campaigning in New Hampshire, a swing state, until now; here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/world/kamala-harris-new-hampshire-swing-state-13811836.html</link>
			<description>Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has focused primarily on large swing states, neglecting New Hampshire. Despite its recent Democratic leanings, Harris will visit the state on September 4th.  The visit aims to counter Republican criticism stemming from Biden's primary calendar changes and Trump's attacks on New Hampshire's economy. Harris plans to promote her proposal to expand tax incentives for small businesses, positioning herself as a champion for the middle class in the state. This focus on New Hampshire, even as a smaller swing state, could be crucial if the election outcome hinges on a few thousand votes.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/popular-honey-deuce-cocktail-us-open-increasing-sales-13811743.html</link>
			<description>The Honey Deuce, a signature cocktail at the US Open, is a blend of vodka, lemonade, and Chambord, garnished with three honeydew scoops resembling tennis balls. Created in 2007 by Nick Mautone, the drink's popularity has soared, becoming a cultural phenomenon and a must-have experience at the tournament.  

Sales are projected to reach over $10 million this year, driven by its clever marketing, association with the tournament, and exclusive availability.  Grey Goose, the drink's sponsor, has partnered with bartenders across New York to offer it in various locations and even in cans for delivery.  Beyond the drink itself, US Open organizers are capitalizing on its popularity by selling Honey Deuce merchandise. With record attendance expected this year, sales are likely to continue flourishing.</description>

			<title>Why are workers in Japan hiring resignation agencies to say ‘I Quit’?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-workers-hiring-resignation-agencies-toxic-work-culture-13811793.html</link>
			<description>Japan's challenging work environment, characterized by long hours and intimidating bosses, is leading employees to seek help from "resignation agencies." These agencies, like Exit and Momuri,  step in to resign on behalf of employees who fear backlash from their employers. 

Reasons for using these agencies include fear of bullying, guilt associated with leaving a job, and struggles with overwork. The cost of services varies, with fees ranging from 12,000 to 50,000 yen.

This trend reflects a shift in young employees' attitudes towards work and a growing power dynamic due to Japan's labor shortage.  However, some experts believe this reliance on resignation agencies could perpetuate a cycle of avoiding confrontation.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-airlines-first-class-seats-are-too-heavy-heres-why-that-is-a-problem-13811733.html</link>
			<description>Swiss International Airlines is introducing new, luxurious first-class seats called "Swiss Senses" on its Airbus A330s.  Scheduled for 2025, the suites offer spacious privacy with six-foot walls and sliding doors. 

However, the heavier-than-expected seats have created an imbalance in the aircraft. To address this, the airline will install a large balancing plate at the rear of the plane. Swiss acknowledges the environmental impact of the increased weight and reduced the number of first-class seats to mitigate it. The airline is also exploring alternative technological solutions for balancing the aircraft in the future.</description>

			<title>Earth's ‘Gateway to Hell’ in Siberia has tripled in size. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/gateway-to-hell-siberia-tripled-in-size-13811682.html</link>
			<description>The Batagaika Crater, nicknamed the "Gateway to Hell," is a massive sinkhole in Siberia that has been expanding rapidly due to climate change.  Originally forming millions of years ago during the Quaternary Ice Age, the crater has become significantly larger in recent decades due to thawing permafrost. Scientists are studying the Batagaika Crater to better understand the impact of climate change on permafrost and the potential consequences of accelerating permafrost thaw, including increased greenhouse gas emissions and threats to local ecosystems.  The crater's growth is causing erosion of the nearby Batagay River and altering the surrounding environment. Concerns exist that the crater could expand further, posing risks to nearby villages and releasing significant amounts of trapped organic carbon into the atmosphere.</description>

			<description>Wrestlers Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia recently met with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and general secretary KC Venugopal, fueling speculation about their potential entry into the political arena. Both wrestlers have previously shown support for farmers' protests and had led a high-profile agitation against the former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, accusing him of sexual harassment.  While no official announcements have been made, Congress officials suggest that the wrestlers' political aspirations may become clearer in the near future.</description>

			<description>Amazon's Alexa came under fire for allegedly displaying political bias when answering questions about voting for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. 

Users noticed that Alexa provided reasons to vote for Harris while offering criticisms of Trump. This inconsistency led to accusations of bias and caused Amazon's share price to dip. 

A spokesperson for Amazon acknowledged the issue as an "error" and stated they had implemented a fix. They emphasized that Alexa does not have political affiliations and is constantly being updated to prevent such incidents in the future.</description>

			<title>Why is Canada suddenly rejecting more visitor visas?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-canada-suddenly-rejecting-more-visitor-visas-13811652.html</link>
			<description>Canada has seen a sharp rise in visitor visa rejections, reaching the highest levels since early 2019. In July 2024 alone, nearly 6,000 foreign travellers were denied entry. This increase coincides with stricter immigration enforcement measures under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government. 

Growing public concern about immigration's impact on housing and living costs is believed to be a contributing factor to this trend. Border officials are reportedly more skeptical of applicants' intentions, and more visas are being refused than approved.  This shift has also impacted other temporary residency categories, such as study and work permits.  The government cites the need to address public concerns and manage population growth,  but the move has been criticized by opposition parties who accuse the government of mismanaging the immigration system.</description>

			<description>UPI Circle, a new feature by Google Pay in partnership with NPCI, allows users to add family and friends as secondary users for making digital payments without linking their bank accounts.  This aims to bridge the gap for those hesitant or unable to use UPI due to limited banking access.  Secondary users can make payments up to a certain limit (Rs 15,000 per month, Rs 5,000 per transaction)  without primary user authorization in full delegation mode. Partial delegation requires primary user approval for each transaction. Primary users can add up to five secondary users, who can only be part of one UPI Circle. The feature will be available on other UPI apps like BHIM, PhonePe, and Amazon Pay.</description>

			<title>Why have wolves in UP’s Bahraich turned ‘man-eaters’?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttar-pradesh-bahraich-attacks-why-wolves-turned-man-eaters-13811616.html</link>
			<description>A recent series of wolf attacks in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, has left nine people, including eight children, dead. The UP administration has launched 'Operation Bhediya' to capture the remaining wolves responsible. 

While wolves generally avoid humans, experts suggest several reasons for this unusual behavior. Habitat loss and prey scarcity due to flooding may be driving wolves to target humans. Some theorize that a wolf may have tasted human flesh accidentally, leading to a learned preference. 

Another possibility is that wolf-dog hybrids, accustomed to humans, might have developed a lack of fear and turned into man-eaters. The theory of revenge is also being explored, considering past instances where wolves attacked humans after experiencing human aggression towards them.</description>

			<title>Why did Nvidia suffer a record $279 billion loss, the biggest for a US company?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-did-nvidia-suffer-a-record-279-billion-loss-the-biggest-for-a-us-company-13811626.html</link>
			<description>Nvidia's stock price dropped significantly, wiping out nearly $279 billion in market value, the biggest ever loss for a US company.  This decline was triggered by a new report on slowing manufacturing activity and growing investor caution about artificial intelligence, a sector that has been driving market gains this year.  Nvidia's recent forecast also fell short of investor expectations. Concerns about the return on investment in AI are also weighing on investor sentiment, with some experts questioning the sustainability of the current valuation for AI-related companies.  Adding to the pressure is a subpoena from the US Justice Department investigating Nvidia's antitrust practices.  This downturn in chip stocks is part of a broader market selloff, with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 also experiencing notable losses.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-christmas-october-13811603.html</link>
			<description>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has controversially moved Christmas to October 1st, citing a "festive feeling."  However, many view this as a distraction from the country's deep political and economic crises.  Critics argue that with rampant inflation, soaring unemployment and concerns over the legitimacy of recent elections, people are struggling to afford basic necessities, rendering the early Christmas celebration hollow.  The move has drawn condemnation from the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference and international observers who highlight the country's dire situation, including widespread human rights violations and the suppression of dissent.</description>

			<title>Do cellphones cause brain cancer? The answer is...</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/cellphones-brain-cancer-who-iarc-research-13811382.html</link>
			<description>A new systematic review commissioned by the World Health Organization has found no link between mobile phone use and brain cancer. The review, published in the journal Environment International, analyzed over 5,000 studies, including 63 from 1994 to 2022.  

Despite previous concerns and a 2011 classification by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) labeling radio waves as a possible carcinogen, this extensive review concludes that exposure to radio waves from mobile phones does not increase the risk of brain cancer or other head and neck cancers.  The findings, which align with previous research, suggest that existing safety limits for radio wave exposure from mobile phones are protective.</description>

			<title>What is the FOCAC Summit? Why and how is China attempting to woo African leaders?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-focac-summit-why-and-how-is-china-attempting-to-woo-african-leaders-13811498.html</link>
			<description>The ninth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit is taking place in Beijing, bringing together over 50 African leaders and marking a significant moment in Sino-African relations. 

China is adjusting its investment strategy in Africa, moving away from large-scale state-backed loans towards public-private partnerships (PPPs) to mitigate risks and promote sustainable development. This shift comes amid concerns about Africa's growing debt burden and the need for more equitable partnerships. Despite challenges and scrutiny, China remains Africa's largest bilateral creditor, and the FOCAC summit is crucial for shaping the future of their economic collaboration. African leaders are seeking to balance their need for infrastructure funding with concerns about debt dependency, while China aims to secure access to resources and expand its influence on the continent. The summit is a platform for negotiation and strategic planning, with both sides seeking to navigate the evolving dynamics of their relationship.</description>

			<description>A 71-year-old French pensioner, Dominique P,  is on trial for drugging his wife, Gisele, and inviting over 50 men to rape her over a decade.  Police discovered images of his nude daughter, Caroline, on his computer, taken after he drugged her.  Dominique also admitted to sending messages to the men, enticing them with phrases like “You’re like me - you like rape mode.” He instructed the men on how to avoid leaving evidence and ensured his wife was heavily sedated. Fifty men are also on trial, with some claiming they believed it was a couple's fantasy.

			<title>After Brunei, PM Modi to visit Singapore: Why ties with the island nation matter to India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-modi-visit-to-singapore-ties-with-india-13811310.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Singapore aims to strengthen the already close ties between the two nations.  The relationship has evolved from diplomatic ties established soon after Singapore's independence in 1965 to a Strategic Partnership in 2015.  

Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN and its sixth largest globally.  Trade has flourished since the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) was signed in 2005, with a significant increase in trade volume and investment flow between the countries. 

Cooperation extends beyond trade and finance to areas like space technology, with ISRO launching several Singaporean satellites.  There is also a strong Indian diaspora in Singapore, contributing to the cultural and economic fabric of the nation. 


Experts suggest a renewed interest in India from Singapore's government, leading to increased engagement in areas like advanced manufacturing, digitalization, and sustainable development.</description>

			<title>How Canada's 24-hour work cap for international students will affect Indians</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/canada-24-hour-work-cap-international-students-will-affect-indians-13811173.html</link>
			<description>Canada's new rule allows international students to work off-campus up to 24 hours per week, a four-hour increase from the previous limit. The change aims to balance students' work and study commitments and align with policies in other countries.  The rule is expected to impact Indian students the most, as they are the largest group of international students in Canada. The work restriction may lead to financial difficulties for students who rely on off-campus jobs to cover expenses, especially in expensive cities. While some students criticize the rule, professors support it, believing it encourages students to focus on their studies.  Arguments regarding the impact on the quality of education and the equity of the rule persist.</description>

			<title>Why doesn’t France have a PM two months after polls? Whom is Macron considering?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-doesnt-france-have-a-pm-two-months-after-polls-whom-is-macron-considering-13811365.html</link>
			<description>France is in a political deadlock after snap elections resulted in a hung parliament. President Emmanuel Macron, despite winning the most votes, does not have a parliamentary majority and faces the challenge of forming a government. 

The inability to secure a majority has led Macron to consider several potential Prime Ministers. Among them are Xavier Bertrand, a leader from the conservative Les RÃ©publicains party, Bernard Cazeneuve, a former Prime Minister under Socialist president FranÃ§ois Hollande, and Thierry Beaudet, a technocrat with no prior political experience.  

Macron's search for a Prime Minister is  complicated by the fact that each potential candidate faces opposition from different political factions.  With growing pressure to form a government, Macron is navigating a complex political landscape where consensus-building is essential.

Furthermore,  left-wing parties who hold the largest number of seats oppose Macron's policies, creating challenges for the centrist president in passing his agenda.</description>

			<title>Netflix’s IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack: Decoding the real identity of the hijackers</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/netflix-ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-row-real-identity-of-hijackers-13811336.html</link>
			<description>The 1999 hijacking of IC 814 involved five terrorists from Pakistan who forced the plane to land in multiple locations, including Kandahar. To hide their identities, they used aliases like "Bhola" and "Shankar", which led to controversy when Netflix's series depicting the event used the same names.  The hijackers' real names were Ibrahim Athar, Shahid Akhtar Sayeed, Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Mistri Zahoor Ibrahim, and Shakir. They belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen terror group.  After widespread criticism, Netflix updated the opening credits to include both the aliases and real names of the hijackers.</description>

			<title>Can sleeping only 30 minutes a day 'double' your life?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/can-sleeping-only-30-minutes-a-day-double-your-life-13811304.html</link>
			<description>Daisuke Hori, a 40-year-old Japanese entrepreneur, claims to function normally on only 30 minutes of sleep per day. He believes this ultra-short sleep routine, adopted 12 years ago, has significantly increased his work efficiency. Hori attributes his ability to function on minimal sleep to his training methods and lifestyle choices, such as exercising and drinking coffee before meals.  He has even established a training association to teach others how to become "ultra-short sleepers."  However, medical experts warn that chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health problems, including memory decline, weakened immunity, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

			<title>From Abu Dhabi to Zanzibar: How IIT is India’s new big export</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/from-abu-dhabi-to-zanzibar-how-iit-is-indias-new-big-export-13811264.html</link>
			<description>The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), often compared to MIT and Harvard of India, are expanding their reach beyond India's borders. After IIT-Madras inaugurated its campus in Zanzibar in 2023, IIT-Delhi recently opened its international campus in Abu Dhabi.  

These offshore campuses aim to bolster ties between India and these countries and position them as global research and development hubs.  The expansion is part of India's "internationalization" of education strategy.  
 
Apart from Abu Dhabi and Zanzibar, IITs are exploring the possibility of establishing campuses in Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Malaysia. The initiative reflects the growing international recognition and influence of Indian educational institutions.</description>

			<title>Goodbye Kimchi? How climate change is affecting South Korea's cabbage quality</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/goodbye-kimchi-how-climate-change-is-affecting-south-koreas-cabbage-quality-13811289.html</link>
			<description>Due to climate change, rice production in South Korea is in jeopardy. Rising temperatures are impacting the quality and quantity of napa cabbage, the primary ingredient in kimchi. Cabbage thrives in cool climates, and the increasing summer heat is making it difficult to grow. Farmers are already noticing issues with cabbage quality, with the heart going bad and the root becoming mushy. Projections suggest that the area suitable for highland cabbage farming will dramatically decrease in the next few decades. 
The government is working to mitigate the impact through climate-controlled storage and research into heat-resistant cabbage varieties. However, these solutions may come with higher costs and potentially compromise the traditional taste of kimchi. This situation has many worried about the future of this iconic Korean dish.</description>

			<title>Is the ‘strange noise’ reported from Sunita Williams’ Starliner spacecraft a reason to worry?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nasa-strange-noise-sunita-williams-starliner-spacecraft-13811282.html</link>
			<description>Astronaut Barry Wilmore reported a "strange noise" coming from a Starliner spacecraft speaker while on the International Space Station (ISS).  The sound, described as a pulsing noise, was traced back to an audio configuration issue between the ISS and Starliner. NASA confirmed the sound did not impact the crew, the spacecraft, or station operations and has since stopped.  

The uncrewed Starliner spacecraft is scheduled to undock from the ISS and return to Earth on September 6th.  Astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, initially slated to return on Starliner, will now return to Earth in a SpaceX Dragon capsule in early 2025. This change is due to a series of glitches Starliner experienced during its initial flight, requiring an extended orbital stay for analysis and troubleshooting.</description>

			<description>Seventeen-year-old Paralympic archer Sheetal Devi, who was born with phocomelia, a condition causing severe limb underdevelopment, made her Olympic debut at the Paris 2024 games.  Despite narrowly losing in the pre-quarterfinals, Devi's journey is inspiring. 

Phocomelia is a rare congenital condition with the exact cause unclear, though it can be inherited or occur due to maternal use of thalidomide during pregnancy. Treatment focuses on prosthetics, therapy, and counseling. Devi, who shoots with her legs, shoulders, and jaw, discovered archery at 15 and quickly excelled with the support of her coaches. They adapted a bow to her needs, recognizing her determination and strength.  Devi's remarkable performance showcases her resilience and ability to overcome adversity.</description>

			<title>What is 9M370 Burevestnik, Russia’s ‘invincible’ nuclear missile, that could hit even the US?</title>

			<description>US researchers have identified a potential deployment site for Russia's 9M370 Burevestnik missile, a nuclear-powered cruise missile. 

The site, near a nuclear warhead storage facility, could allow for rapid launch capabilities. The Burevestnik, also known as SSC-X-9 Skyfall, is designed to carry a nuclear warhead and has a theoretical unlimited range due to its nuclear engine.  

While Russia claims the missile is "invincible," it has faced technical difficulties and accidents, including a radiation leak in 2019. Experts remain skeptical about its strategic value and raise concerns about its environmental and safety risks. Despite these challenges, the Burevestnik complicates international arms control efforts, as it is not covered by the New START treaty, which expires in 2026.</description>

Despite a 12% rise in participating companies, fewer students secured jobs this year.  Out of 2,414 registered students, only 1,475 accepted offers. The institute attributed this to students pursuing higher studies, entrepreneurship, or civil services. 

While the engineering and technology sector remained the largest recruiter, the finance sector experienced a decline. Emerging fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning showed increasing interest. 


The shift in the job market, influenced by a global economic slowdown and industry trends, led to a decrease in the median salary of IIT graduates.</description>

			<title>Who is Brunei's Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, one of world's richest monarchs, who will host PM Modi?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-bruneis-sultan-haji-hassanal-bolkiah-one-of-worlds-richest-monarchs-who-will-welcome-pm-modi-13811198.html</link>
			<description>Sultan Bolkiah ascended to the Brunei throne in 1967 at the age of 21, succeeding his father.  He oversaw Brunei's independence from Britain in 1984 and established the Malay Muslim Monarchy, with himself as the "defender of the faith."   Known for his immense wealth, estimated at $30 billion, Bolkiah is renowned for his extravagant car collection, extensive real estate holdings, and luxurious lifestyle, including a private zoo and a palatial residence.  While popular within Brunei, Bolkiah has faced criticism for introducing Sharia law, which includes punishments such as stoning for adultery and amputation for theft.  Despite international backlash, particularly concerning the death penalty for gay sex, Bolkiah remains a powerful figure with absolute authority over his nation.</description>

			<title>The shocking case of a French man who recruited strangers to rape his wife</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-shocking-case-of-a-french-man-who-recruited-strangers-to-rape-his-wife-13811128.html</link>
			<description>Dominique Pelicot, a 72-year-old Frenchman, is on trial for orchestrating a decade-long campaign of sexual abuse against his wife, Gisèle.  Pelicot allegedly drugged his wife with sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication, rendering her unconscious, before inviting over 70 men from an online chatroom to rape her. The assaults reportedly occurred from 2011 to 2020, at their homes in Paris and Mazan.

Police discovered 20,000 images and videos of the abuse on a USB drive connected to Pelicot's computer.  Gisèle became aware of the abuse in 2020 when police informed her. 

Fifty of the accused rapists are standing trial alongside Pelicot, while over 30 others remain unidentified. Pelicot faces charges for a 1991 murder and rape, which he denies.</description>

			<title>What’s the Philadelphi Corridor that Netanyahu calls 'Oxygen of Hamas'?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/whats-the-philadelphi-corridor-that-netanyahu-calls-oxygen-of-hamas-13811126.html</link>
			<description>The Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer strip along the Gaza-Egypt border, is a key point of contention in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.  Israel views the corridor as crucial for preventing Hamas from re-arming, describing it as "the oxygen of Hamas."  After Israel’s withdrawal in 2005, control was transferred to Egypt and the Palestinian Authority.  However, the rise of Hamas in 2007 led to concerns over weapons smuggling tunnels, prompting Israel to demand continued oversight.  Egypt, while committed to the peace treaty and security, is wary of Israeli reoccupation due to concerns about Palestinian displacement and regional instability.  Possible compromises involve an underground barrier and electronic monitoring with occasional patrols, but require approval from Palestinian factions, including Hamas.  This standoff complicates efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release.</description>

			<title>West Bengal's Aparajita Bill seeks death for rapists. But can states make their own criminal laws?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/west-bengal-aparajita-bill-death-rapists-states-criminal-laws-13811147.html</link>
			<description>The Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal has introduced the Aparajita Woman and Child (West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2024, aiming to enhance punishments for rape and create a safer environment for women and children.  

The bill proposes the death penalty for rapists if the victim dies or is left in a vegetative state, and life imprisonment for those convicted of rape and gang rape. It also mandates a 21-day deadline for investigating rape cases, requires convicts to cover the victim's medical expenses, and introduces penalties for publishing court proceedings without permission.  

The legislation requires presidential assent to be enforced and while states can amend central laws under certain circumstances, the President is not obligated to approve them. The passage of the bill in the West Bengal Assembly is likely given the Trinamool Congress's majority.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/corruption-case-ex-rg-kar-principal-sandip-ghosh-13811065.html</link>
			<description>Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College in Kolkata, has been arrested by the CBI on charges of financial irregularities.  

The arrest follows a two-week questioning session and comes after a petition filed by the hospital's former Deputy Superintendent, Akhtar Ali, alleging corruption, including the illegal sale of unclaimed corpses, embezzlement, and organ trafficking. The CBI has also named three others in connection with the case, including Ghosh's security guard and two vendors.  Ghosh’s arrest is seen as a moral victory by protesting doctors and residents, who have demanded his removal since the rape and murder of a junior doctor at the hospital last month.</description>

			<title>Putin in Mongolia amid ICC arrest warrant: Is the country defying international law?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/russian-president-vladimir-putin-visits-mongolia-amid-icc-arrest-warrant-is-the-country-defying-international-law-13811066.html</link>
			<description>Vladimir Putin's visit to Mongolia, a country legally obligated to arrest him due to an active ICC warrant for war crimes, has sparked international controversy. 

While Ukraine and international organizations are urging Mongolia to uphold its obligations, Russia maintains that all aspects of the visit have been discussed and agreed upon. 

Mongolia's critical dependence on Russia for energy and infrastructure complicates its position, forcing it to balance international legal commitments with its own national interests.  The visit coincides with several key events, including the anniversary of a historical Soviet-Mongolian victory and the potential expansion of a Russian gas pipeline through Mongolia, highlighting the country's strategic importance in Russia's energy plans. 



The situation presents a dilemma for Mongolia, which is trying to maintain its image as a neutral mediator while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of its powerful neighbors.</description>

			<title>Will Israel’s biggest protests mark the end of Benjamin Netanyahu’s rule?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-protests-strike-benjamin-netanyahu-rule-future-13811077.html</link>
			<description>Massive protests erupted in Israel following the recovery of six hostage bodies from Gaza.  The protesters, angered by the prime minister's handling of the situation, blame Netanyahu for the deaths and demand his resignation.

A general strike called by the Histadrut trade union brought the country to a standstill for several hours.  Demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu's home and the US embassy, chanting slogans and holding signs calling for his removal. 

While Netanyahu maintains his commitment to ending Hamas's threat and asserts control over the Philadelphi Corridor, he faces growing criticism from both the opposition and within his own cabinet. Experts believe that  Netanyahu's  stubborn stance stems from fear of losing his coalition partners and concerns about his legacy.</description>

Brunei is a wealthy country with a predominantly Malay population and a constitutional monarchy led by Sultan Bolkiah, one of the world's longest-reigning monarchs.

			<title>Firing outside AP Dhillon's Canada home: Who is he? What's his connection to Salman Khan?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/firing-outside-ap-dhillons-canada-home-who-is-he-whats-his-connection-to-salman-khan-13810969.html</link>
			<description>AP Dhillon, a Canadian rapper of Indian origin, rose to fame with chart-topping songs like "Majhail" and "Brown Munde." He gained further recognition through his Amazon Prime documentary series, "AP Dhillon: First of a Kind." Recently, he featured in a music video with Bollywood actor Salman Khan for the song "Old Money."  

This has led to threats from the Bishnoi gang, who are known for targeting individuals associated with Salman Khan.  The gang has a history of  criminality, including the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.  The Bishnoi gang has issued threats on social media, alleging that Dhillon's connection with Salman Khan makes him a target.  They allege that Salman will meet a "dog's death" if he doesn't stay within his limits. 


Salman Khan has also been targeted by the Bishnoi gang, who feel he killed a blackbuck, which is revered by the Bishnoi community.</description>

			<title>Is chicken tikka masala British? Tracing the origin of the dish amid row over TasteAtlas' ranking</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/chicken-tikka-masala-british-indian-origin-tasteatlas-rankings-13810942.html</link>
			<description>Chicken tikka masala's origins continue to be debated, despite its widespread popularity in the UK.  Often cited as the inventor, Ali Ahmed Aslam, a Pakistani-Scottish chef, claimed to have created the dish in 1972 at his Glasgow restaurant, Shish Mahal, to accommodate a customer's preference for sauce with their chicken tikka. 

However, other claims attribute the dish to Indian chefs in the 1950s and even earlier. Some believe it evolved from Indian butter chicken, while others suggest Bangladeshi chefs in the UK in the 1960s developed it to suit British palates.  The debate highlights the complex interplay of culinary traditions and cultural influences in the evolution of food.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-pope-francis-asia-visit-is-important-for-the-region-and-the-church-13810858.html</link>
			<description>Pope Francis is embarking on a significant journey to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore, highlighting the growing importance of Asia to the Catholic Church. This extensive trip, Pope Francis's longest to date, reflects his commitment to reaching out to the "peripheries" where Catholicism is experiencing growth and diversity. 

During his visit, Pope Francis will emphasize interreligious dialogue, environmental concerns, and the promotion of peace and tolerance, particularly in Indonesia, where he will meet with Muslim leaders to celebrate religious harmony.  In Papua New Guinea, he will engage with missionaries serving remote communities. 

His trip to East Timor, following in the footsteps of St. John Paul II, symbolizes the country's journey towards healing from its colonial past. In Singapore, the Pope's visit coincides with ongoing Vatican efforts to improve relations with China, acknowledging a complex geopolitical context.</description>

			<title>Are you a symbiosexual? The new sexual identity that everyone's talking about</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-symbiosexual-new-sexual-identity-13810901.html</link>
			<description>A new study published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour explores symbiosexuality, a phenomenon where individuals are attracted to couples rather than single people.  The study, conducted at Seattle University,  found that people who identify as symbiosexuals are drawn to the energy and dynamics within existing relationships.

Participants in the study described a genuine desire for the "whole" of the relationship, seeking validation and intimacy from multiple partners.  They tend to be extroverted and less prone to jealousy. 

Symbiosexuality, distinguished from polyamory, values the unique dynamics of each relationship.  Further research is underway to understand the mental health implications and relationship satisfaction associated with this evolving sexual identity.  Researchers hope to reduce stigma and expand the understanding of desire within sexuality studies.</description>

			<title>Urine-soaked teddy, bursting firecrackers: How UP’s Bahraich is trying to hunt down man-eating wolves who’ve killed 7 children</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttar-pradesh-bahraich-wolf-attacks-track-down-methods-13810879.html</link>
			<description>A series of deadly wolf attacks in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, has claimed eight lives, including seven children. The Uttar Pradesh government has launched 'Operation Bhediya' to capture the responsible wolves, with forest officials capturing four of the six wolves involved. Innovative tactics are being employed, such as using colourful teddy dolls soaked in children's urine as bait to lure the wolves into traps. 

Additionally, elephant dung is being burned to deter wolves from populated areas. A specialized task force comprising forest, police, and fire departments is tracking the wolves using thermal drones and CCTV cameras. The situation has triggered panic in neighboring Bihar, but experts criticize media sensationalization of the attacks and advise villagers to be vigilant and take precautions.</description>

			<title>‘How can house be demolished’: What is ‘bulldozer justice’ that Supreme Court has come down on?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bulldozer-justice-supreme-court-criticism-explained-13810871.html</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has criticized the practice of 'bulldozer justice,' where properties of accused individuals are demolished.  The court emphasized that even convicted individuals cannot have their houses demolished without following proper legal procedures. It stressed the need for guidelines to ensure that concerns regarding this practice are addressed. 

While the court acknowledged that illegal constructions should be removed, it clarified that there should be due process and no blanket demolishing of properties solely based on accusations. 



'Bulldozer justice' has been used in several states, notably Uttar Pradesh, following claims of criminal activity or communal violence. This practice has drawn criticism from legal experts and human rights organizations, who argue it violates the principles of natural justice and punishes families for the alleged actions of one individual.</description>

			<title>Could Nasa's DART mission create the first human-made meteor shower?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/could-nasa-dart-mission-create-the-first-human-made-meteor-shower-13810837.html</link>
			<description>NASA's DART mission, which impacted the asteroid Dimorphos in 2022, may create the first human-made meteor shower called the Dimorphids.  

Debris from the collision, estimated at over 2 million pounds, could reach Earth and Mars within the next decade.  While not posing a risk to Earth, these fragments could create a faint meteor shower, primarily visible from the southern hemisphere around May. 

Scientists used data from the LICIACube satellite to simulate the debris trajectories.

 The European Space Agency's Hera mission, launching in October, will further investigate the DART impact and the resulting debris cloud.</description>

			<title>Quicksplained: What's the She-Box portal Centre launched to address sexual harassment at the workplace?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/quicksplained-shebox-portal-sexual-harassment-at-workplace-13810817.html</link>
			<description>The Centre has launched SHe-Box, a centralized platform for registering and tracking complaints of sexual harassment against women at work. The portal aims to provide a unified system for handling complaints in both the private and public sectors. 

Women can file complaints online, and a designated nodal officer will monitor them in real-time.  Upon receiving a complaint,  a committee will be formed within the relevant institution to investigate and take necessary action. The Ministry of Women and Child Development will oversee the process, ensuring time-bound resolution and confidentiality.</description>

			<title>Beyond Mollywood: Did Telangana govt undermine report on sexual harassment in Telugu film industry?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mollywood-hema-committee-report-telangana-government-report-on-sexual-harassment-in-telugu-film-industry-13810785.html</link>
			<description>The Hema Committee report in Malayalam cinema, which exposed sexual harassment, has prompted calls for the release of a similar report on the Telugu film industry (Tollywood).  A sub-committee report on sexual harassment in Tollywood, submitted to the Telangana government in 2022, has remained unpublished.  The Tollywood report followed a protest by actress Sri Reddy highlighting abuse in the industry.  

Telugu actresses, including Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Lakshmi Manchu, have urged the government to release the findings, citing the need to establish a safe working environment for women in the industry.  The sub-committee found issues like unequal pay, lack of written contracts, and poor working conditions, but specifics about harassment were not detailed in the report. Despite its availability, the report faces a lack of urgency from both industry stakeholders and the government.</description>

			<title>What the deaths of 6 Israeli hostages mean for Benjamin Netanyahu and ceasefire talks</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-the-deaths-of-6-israeli-hostages-mean-for-benjamin-netanyahu-and-ceasefire-talks-13810807.html</link>
			<description>The deaths of six more hostages held by Hamas following the October 7 attack have  intensified public pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal for their release. The hostages, identified as Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Master Seargant Ori Danino, were found dead with gunshot wounds in a tunnel in southern Gaza.  

This latest tragedy has ignited protests across Israel, with organizers estimating 500,000 people joined nationwide demonstrations demanding Netanyahu make a deal with Hamas. The families of hostages, including Goldberg-Polin’s parents who had campaigned internationally for his release, have expressed outrage and accused the government of prioritizing other objectives over saving their loved ones.  

Within Israel's government, tensions are mounting with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant clashing with Netanyahu over his approach to the negotiations. Gallant, along with other security officials, has warned that time is running out and accused Netanyahu of  putting political calculations ahead of the hostages' lives. A  general strike, the first since the start of the war, is planned for Monday in a show of solidarity with the hostages' families. 

While Netanyahu blames Hamas for the stalled negotiations and maintains his stance on "total victory,"  the public outcry and internal dissent signal a possible turning point in his strategy.</description>

			<title>How Pakistan’s Peshawar has emerged as mpox 'epicentre'</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/pakistan-peshawar-mpox-epicentre-13810742.html</link>
			<description>Pakistan's Peshawar city is emerging as a potential epicenter for the mpox virus, with five cases reported, most recently a traveler returning from  the Gulf. This rise in cases has prompted concerns about the virus's spread from travellers from West Asia. Officials are increasing screening measures at airports and are working to monitor the situation closely.  The mpox virus was declared a global health emergency by the WHO due to the emergence of a new strain, clade lb, which appears to be spreading rapidly. 

While no cases of clade lb have been reported in Pakistan, other Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines have also reported cases. Countries like India, China, Japan, and South Korea are on high alert and have intensified surveillance measures.  UNICEF is working with global partners to secure mpox vaccines for affected countries.</description>

			<description>Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo plans to keep the Olympic rings, installed on the Eiffel Tower for the 2024 Summer Games, as a permanent fixture. Hidalgo believes this symbolizes the union of a French icon with a global one and aims to preserve the festive spirit of the Games. She intends to replace the current heavy rings with lighter ones while acknowledging the logistical challenges. The decision has sparked debate, with some Parisians praising the modern addition while others criticize defiling the historic monument. While Hidalgo views the rings as a positive legacy of the Games, the final decision on their permanence remains under discussion.</description>

			<title>How the Canada border is becoming the preferred choice for Indians to illegally enter the US</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/canada-border-indians-us-illegal-immigration-donkey-route-13810764.html</link>
			<description>A record number of Indians, 5,152 in June alone, attempted to illegally enter the US through the Canada-US border, surpassing the number using the traditional Mexico route. This surge is attributed to Canada's accessible visa process and relatively unguarded border stretches, making it a preferable alternative to more perilous "donkey routes". While Canada offers a safer pathway, experts warn of its risks, citing the tragic case of an Indian family who perished near the border during a blizzard. Indians, mostly from Gujarat and Punjab, are seeking a better economic future in the US, driven by factors like limited job opportunities and a struggling agricultural sector in India.</description>

			<title>After Mollywood MeToo, what’s the ‘casting couch’ row in Kerala Congress?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/casting-couch-row-kerala-congress-13810724.html</link>
			<description>Simi Rosebell John, a senior Congress leader from Ernakulam, Kerala, was expelled from the party for alleging a "casting couch" culture within the KPCC, similar to the one in the film industry. John claimed that women leaders face exploitation and have to endure  unfair behaviours to gain opportunities. She also accused opposition leader VD Satheesan of controlling factions and bestowing preferential treatment. 

The KPCC, taking the complaint filed by the Mahila Congress seriously, launched an investigation into John’s allegations, deeming her actions a serious breach of discipline. John, in turn, refuted these accusations and accused the party leadership of silencing her and creating an unsafe environment.</description>

			<title>Who were 6 hostages ‘killed’ by Hamas in Gaza? Why have the deaths triggered protests in Israel?</title>

			<description>Six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were found dead in an underground tunnel in Gaza.  The Israeli military claims Hamas brutally murdered them prior to IDF troops reaching the location.  

The hostages, who included Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lobanov, and Carmel Gat, were discovered in a tunnel close to one from which a hostage was rescued earlier. 

Israel states that the hostages were shot multiple times at close range.  The deaths have sparked protests in Israel, with many blaming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not securing a hostage deal with Hamas.



Hamas claims that the Israeli government bears responsibility for the deaths, stating they could have been released in a prisoner exchange.</description>

			<title>What a win by far-right AfD in eastern Germany could mean for Olaf Scholz's government?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-win-by-far-right-afd-in-eastern-germany-means-for-olaf-scholz-government-13810677.html</link>
			<description>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has secured a historic victory in the state election of Thuringia, marking the first time a far-right party has won a state election in post-World War II Germany. This victory comes on the heels of a strong second-place finish in neighboring Saxony. 

The AfD's success is attributed to growing dissatisfaction with the national government, particularly in eastern Germany, where the party's anti-immigration stance and opposition to policies such as climate change measures have resonated with voters. 

The far-right party's rise poses a significant challenge to the stability of the national coalition government led by Chancellor Scholz. Although other parties like Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW have also gained traction, the AfD's success underscores a deepening political divide in Germany.</description>

			<title>Wolfing down your food? Here's why it's not good for your health</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/wolfing-down-your-food-heres-why-its-not-good-for-your-health-13808836.html</link>
			<description>Eating quickly can have several negative impacts on our health.  It can lead to excessive gas and bloating due to increased air intake and gas production.  Rushed eating also requires our stomach to produce more acid for digestion, causing discomfort and indigestion.  

Moreover, quickly eating prevents our brains from receiving  fullness signals from leptin, leading to overeating. Studies link fast eating to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, elevated triglyceride levels, and metabolic syndrome. 

Slowing down and chewing thoroughly allows for proper digestion,  regulates fullness cues, and ultimately contributes to better overall health.</description>

			<title>Did Netflix series ‘IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack’ incorrectly use Hindu names for hijackers? The controversy explained</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/netflix-series-ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-incorrectl-names-hijackers-controversy-13810676.html</link>
			<description>The Netflix series "IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack" has sparked controversy for using Hindu names like Bhola and Shankar for the Pakistani terrorists involved in the 1999 hijacking. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya accuses the makers of legitimizing the terrorists' criminal intent, while historian Hindol Sengupta criticizes the show for glorifying them. 

Veteran journalist Vir Sanghvi alleges that the series serves as propaganda for Pakistan's ISI and portrays a whitewashed version of the hijacking. The series' creators, however, defend the use of these names, stating they were the aliases used by the hijackers throughout the incident. They cite sources, including the author of a book on the hijacking, who corroborate this claim. 


The Ministry of External Affairs also stated in 2000 that the hijackers were known by these aliases to the passengers.</description>

			<description>Israel’s main union, Histadrut, has called for a nationwide general strike following the recovery of six hostages’ bodies from Gaza. This comes amid widespread protests against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the situation after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the abduction of 251 people, 97 of whom remain captive.  Biden and Harris will campaign in Pittsburgh on Labour Day. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit China for a four-day trip before the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit. In India, the West Bengal Assembly will convene to discuss a bill proposing capital punishment for convicts in rape and murder cases.</description>

			<title>Tall people are at a higher risk of developing cancer. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/tall-people-are-at-a-higher-risk-of-developing-cancer-heres-why-13809199.html</link>
			<description>Several studies, including the UK Million Women Study, have shown a correlation between height and an increased risk of developing cancer.  Taller individuals have a higher chance of developing cancers of the pancreas, large bowel, uterus, ovary, prostate, kidney, skin (melanoma), and breast. 

Two main theories attempt to explain this link:  a higher number of cells in taller individuals, potentially leading to more opportunities for genetic mutations, and elevated levels of the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). While research supports both explanations, further investigation is needed to fully understand the relationship between height and cancer risk.


Despite the slight elevated risk, it's crucial to remember that many factors influence cancer development. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, a healthy weight, sun safety, limited alcohol consumption, and not smoking, significantly reduces cancer risk, outweighing the impact of height.</description>

			<title>Feline Facts: Do cats grieve the loss of fellow pets?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/feline-facts-do-cats-grieve-the-loss-of-fellow-pets-13809105.html</link>
			<description>A recent study suggests that cats may exhibit grieving behaviors after the loss of a fellow pet. Researchers observed changes in behavior like increased vocalization, attention-seeking, and reduced appetite in cats following the death of a companion animal. The strength of the bond and daily interactions between the cats were found to be factors influencing these behaviors.  While this study builds on previous research hinting at grief-like responses in cats, it's important to note that owner observations might be subjective and influenced by their own grief.  The study didn't investigate whether cats grieve for their human owners, leaving that question open for further research.</description>

			<title>Ozempic chic: How weight-loss drugs are changing the fashion industry, closet by closet</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-fashion-industry-resale-market-second-hand-luxury-clothes-13809854.html</link>
			<description>The increased use of Ozempic and similar weight-loss drugs is significantly impacting the fashion industry, particularly the second-hand luxury market. 

More people are selling larger clothing sizes as they experience weight loss due to these medications, leading to a surge in plus-size apparel listings on resale platforms like Poshmark and Vestiaire Collective.  This trend is also reflected in reports from brands like Lafayette 148 and Rent the Runway, where customers are buying smaller sizes.

However, this shift poses a challenge for resale platforms as they struggle to manage the surplus of larger clothing sizes and align their inventory with the changing demand.  This imbalance could result in unsold items ending up in landfills, highlighting the environmental implications of this trend.</description>

			<description>Japan, known for its dedication to work, is promoting a four-day workweek to address a labor shortage.  While the government endorsed the idea in 2021, adoption has been slow. Companies are reluctant to change the prevailing culture that values long hours and dedication. 

Despite challenges, the government is encouraging businesses to adopt shorter workweeks through initiatives offering support and success stories. Some companies, including fast-fashion retailer Uniqlo and electronics giants, have successfully implemented four-day schedules.

 Advocates argue the change leads to reduced stress, improved well-being, and allows for a more balanced life, benefiting both employees and the company.  Critics, however, point out that some individuals may end up working just as many hours for less pay.</description>

			<title>‘Fountain of Youth’: Can Ozempic, the weight-loss drug, help slow ageing?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/fountain-of-youth-can-ozempic-the-weight-loss-drug-help-slow-ageing-13810153.html</link>
			<description>Recent studies suggest that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, may offer benefits beyond its original use for type 2 diabetes and weight loss. Research indicates that semaglutide could potentially slow down the ageing process.

Studies involving thousands of participants found that semaglutide may reverse kidney disease, prevent heart failure, lower high blood pressure, and reduce the risk of death from COVID-19. It also appears to reduce inflammation, potentially benefiting a variety of age-related diseases. 

Experts suggest that semaglutide, which mimics the hormone GLP-1, could become a "multi-purpose drug" protecting against a broad spectrum of health threats.  However, as with any medication, consultation with a doctor is crucial due to potential side effects.</description>

			<title>How over 6 lakh children will be vaccinated for polio in Gaza in 3 days</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-over-6-lakh-children-will-be-vaccinated-for-polio-in-gaza-in-3-days-13810125.html</link>
			<description>A major polio vaccination drive is underway in Gaza to combat the first case in 25 years, affecting a 10-month-old boy. The World Health Organization (WHO) is partnering with Israel and Hamas to administer the vaccine during temporary ceasefires.  

The campaign aims to vaccinate 640,000 children under ten with two doses of oral polio vaccine, achieved through over 400 fixed sites and 230 outreach locations. A second round of vaccinations is planned for late September. 

Despite challenges posed by damaged infrastructure, displacement, and ongoing conflict, the WHO believes the campaign is feasible if logistical aspects are successfully implemented. The vaccination drive relies on the safe and effective oral polio vaccine, with extremely rare but serious side effects.</description>

			<description>Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the immediate suspension of X, formerly Twitter, due to the platform's failure to comply with court orders regarding the spread of misinformation.  Judge Alexandre de Moraes threatened fines for individuals using technological means to circumvent the block. This decision makes Brazil one of several countries, including China, Russia, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, that have banned or restricted access to X for various reasons, ranging from political dissent to preventing the spread of unrest and protecting national security.</description>

			<title>How low birth rate in South Korea has forced it to turn to foreign nannies</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-low-birth-rate-in-south-korea-has-forced-it-to-turn-to-foreign-nannies-13809840.html</link>
			<description>South Korea's historically low fertility rate has prompted a pilot program to allow 100 Filipino nannies into the country to address a childcare shortage. The program aims to make affordable childcare accessible to families, particularly dual-income households, potentially encouraging higher birth rates.  

The nannies will work under an E-9 visa and be employed for six months in Seoul. While the government hopes this program will ease the childcare burden, concerns remain about the cost for families, along with criticism regarding labor standards and potential exploitation of foreign workers.  

Successful completion of the pilot program could lead to its expansion, but evaluation and addressing concerns regarding illegal immigration and fair treatment of workers are necessary before a full-scale implementation.</description>

			<title>How Taliban's harsh new laws are setting women back decades</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-talibans-harsh-new-laws-are-setting-women-back-decades-13810007.html</link>
			<description>Following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, initial hopes for a more moderate regime have been dashed.  The Taliban leadership, under Hibatullah Akhundzada, has issued over 50 decrees, severely restricting social and individual freedoms. 

Women face particularly harsh restrictions, including bans on education beyond the age of 12, movement outside the home, and even speaking in public.  Public executions, flogging, and stoning are also back, reminiscent of the Taliban's 1990s rule.  

A Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (PVPV) has been established to enforce these laws, which empower the morality police to punish "vice" and un-Islamic behavior.  

These measures have effectively eliminated any distinction between the present regime and its previous, ostracized iteration.   The Taliban's recent actions raise serious concerns about human rights and the future of Afghanistan.</description>

			<title>Who is Jagdish Tytler? What is his alleged role in the anti-Sikh riots?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-is-jagdish-tytler-what-is-his-alleged-role-in-the-anti-sikh-riots-13809997.html</link>
			<description>A Delhi court has ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to charge Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case. The charges relate to the killing of three people in Pul Bangash. Special Judge Rakesh Siyal found sufficient evidence to proceed against Tytler. The CBI accuses Tytler of inciting a mob that set a gurdwara ablaze and looted shops. 

The chargesheet cites eyewitness testimony stating Tytler said, "kill the Sikhs, they have killed our mother."  Tytler has been given a clean chit by the CBI three times before and insists on his innocence.</description>

			<description>Polio, once nearing eradication, has re-emerged in Gaza, affecting a 10-month-old infant. The virus, a vaccine-derived strain linked to Egypt, highlights concerns about declining vaccination rates amid ongoing conflict and poor sanitation.  

Israel and Hamas have agreed to three-day ceasefires in Gaza's regions to allow for a mass vaccination campaign targeting 640,000 children under 10. The WHO emphasizes the need for 95% coverage to effectively combat the spread.  The situation poses a significant challenge to global polio eradication efforts, as Gaza faces the risk of widespread transmission and potential outbreaks in neighboring countries.</description>

			<description>The Indian government is introducing a repairability index for electronics to empower consumers with the "Right to Repair."  This index will rate products based on factors like technical document availability, spare part accessibility, and ease of disassembly. The scores will range from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most repairable. Manufacturers will be required to display the index scores, enabling consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. This initiative aims to address the growing e-waste problem and promote sustainable consumption by encouraging manufacturers to design repairable products.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-modi-accept-pakistans-invite-to-sco-meet-what-happened-when-indian-pms-visited-the-neighbour-13809856.html</link>
			<description>Since India first gained independence, several Indian prime ministers have visited Pakistan.  Jawaharlal Nehru made the first visit in 1953, hoping to resolve ongoing conflicts, including the dispute over Kashmir. He returned in 1960, signing the Indus Water Treaty, a landmark agreement on water sharing.

Rajiv Gandhi later visited in both 1988 and 1989, hoping to improve relations. Atal Bihari Vajpayee made two significant trips – one in 1999  by bus to Lahore, resulting in the landmark Lahore Declaration, and another in 2004, emphasizing SAARC cooperation. Narendra Modi's unexpected visit in 2015, on the occasion of Sharif's birthday, was a positive step towards stronger bilateral ties.  

Each visit has had its successes and challenges, but all have been attempts to foster dialogue and peace in the often-contentious relationship between the two nations.</description>

			<description>The University of Southampton will open India's third foreign university campus in Delhi-NCR in 2025. This follows Deakin University and the University of Wollongong, both from Australia, which established campuses in Gujarat's GIFT City. 

The Indian government is attracting foreign universities through the National Education Policy 2020.  Lincoln University College from Malaysia and Oxford University from the UK have also expressed interest in setting up campuses in India.

The UGC has laid down guidelines for foreign universities, including ranking requirements and autonomy in faculty recruitment.  However, the 10-year permit duration and lack of financial incentives have been cited as potential drawbacks.</description>

			<title>3 eastern states in Germany gear up for polls. But why is Russia closely watching the results?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/3-eastern-states-in-germany-gear-up-for-polls-but-why-is-russia-closely-watching-the-results-13809755.html</link>
			<description>Upcoming regional elections in eastern Germany are being closely watched by Russia. Pro-Moscow parties, particularly the AfD and the new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), are expected to perform well. These parties align with Russian interests by opposing NATO, expressing skepticism towards the European Union, and calling for normalized relations with Russia, including an end to sanctions. Putin, who spent time in East Germany during his KGB days, sees a potential opportunity to regain influence in the region. 

The AfD and BSW's success could signify a shift in Germany's foreign policy, potentially weakening European unity and impacting NATO's stance against Russia. Putin's support for these parties reflects a strategic effort to undermine Western influence and reassert Russia's standing in Europe.</description>

			<title>What is listeria that has forced a US company to recall 7 million pounds of meat?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/what-is-listeria-that-has-forced-a-us-company-to-recall-7-million-pounds-of-meat-13809763.html</link>
			<description>A serious listeria outbreak in the US, linked to Boar's Head deli meats, has resulted in nine deaths and over 50 hospitalizations. The outbreak prompted the recall of over seven million pounds of Boar's Head products, including sliced meats, ready-to-eat meats, and poultry. Listeria contamination was detected in an unopened loaf of liverwurst, leading to a wider recall. 

Affected products have a sell-by date from July 29, 2024 to October 17, 2024, and bear the markings "EST. 12612" or "P-12612" on the USDA label. Listeria, a resilient bacteria that can survive in refrigeration, can cause a range of symptoms from mild gastrointestinal distress to serious complications like meningitis.  Consumers are urged to discard or return recalled products and practice thorough cleaning and sanitation.</description>

			<title>1 billionaire in every 5 days: How India is becoming richer</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-billionaire-count-increase-hurun-rich-list-2024-13809757.html</link>
			<description>India's billionaire population has surged, with 334 individuals now classified as billionaires according to the Hurun Rich List 2024. This represents a 29% increase from the previous year and a  significant rise from 109 billionaires in 2014.  The collective wealth of these billionaires is estimated at Rs 159 lakh crore, surpassing the combined GDP of Saudi Arabia and Switzerland. 

 Mumbai has emerged as the "billionaire capital of Asia," surpassing Beijing in terms of billionaire concentration.  Factors driving this wealth creation include a new wave of entrepreneurs, competitive wages, a strong English-speaking population, and domestic economic reforms. However, the growth in wealth is not evenly distributed, with the richest 1% holding a larger share of India's wealth than at any point in the last six decades. Some of India's wealthy are choosing to emigrate to countries like Australia, the US, and Canada.</description>

			<title>'Unwell, critical, suicide': How 3 phone calls made to doctor’s parents reveal RG Kar Hospital’s flip-flops</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/3-phone-calls-doctors-parents-rg-kar-hospital-flip-flops-13809682.html</link>
			<description>Alleged audio recordings of phone calls from the authority of Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College to the parents of a murdered doctor have sparked controversy.  The recordings, purportedly made on August 9th, reveal changing statements from a hospital official, raising questions about whether the institution initially attempted to conceal the crime.

The calls describe the doctor's condition as "a little ill," then "very critical," and finally, leading to the revelation that she had "died by suicide" or "passed away."  The last call occurred with the presence of police and hospital authorities.

These revelations have prompted accusations of insensitivity and a cover-up attempt by the hospital. The probe, initially handled by the Kolkata police, is now in the hands of the CBI following a directive from the Calcutta High Court.  The authenticity of the recordings is yet to be independently verified, and hospital officials have remained silent.  The case has drawn scrutiny from the Supreme Court and High Courts, leading to investigations into the delay in filing a formal complaint and the potential mishandling of evidence. The parents of the victim claim they were made to wait for three hours before learning about their daughter's death.</description>

			<title>Who was Oleksiy 'Moonfish' Mes, the Ukrainian pilot killed in an F-16 crash?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/who-was-oleksiy-moonfish-mes-the-ukrainian-pilot-killed-in-an-f-16-crash-13809727.html</link>
			<description>Oleksiy Mes, a highly skilled Ukrainian fighter pilot known as "Moonfish," tragically died during a mission to counter a massive Russian air assault.  Mes was a key figure in Ukraine's efforts to acquire F-16 fighter jets, alongside another pilot, Andriy "Juice" Pilshchykov, who died in a previous crash.  He became one of the first Ukrainian pilots trained to operate the advanced jets and played a vital role in integrating them into Ukraine's air force. 

During the August 26th attack, Mes's F-16 successfully downed several Russian missiles but tragically crashed during the mission.  His death is a significant blow to Ukraine's air force, both because of his skill and his symbolic importance in securing the F-16s.  The incident highlights the risks faced by Ukrainian pilots as they use these advanced aircraft against a formidable adversary.</description>

			<title>Who is Niels Holck, aka Kim Davy, Danish ‘mastermind’ of the 1995 Purulia arms drop case?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/purulia-arms-drop-case-niels-holck-kim-davy-danish-mastermind-extradition-to-india-13809580.html</link>
			<description>A Danish court has again rejected India's extradition request for Niels Holck, also known as Kim Davy, who is involved in the 1995 Purulia arms drop case. The court's decision stems from concerns that Holck would not be treated according to the European Convention on Human Rights if sent to India. 

Denmark's top prosecuting authority had previously approved the extradition, but the final decision rested with the court. India has been seeking Holck's extradition for years to try him for his role in the case where a plane carrying weapons was dropped over Purulia, West Bengal. Holck, who admits to his involvement, argues that he would face inhumane treatment in India. The case has caused tension between the two countries, affecting diplomatic and economic relations.</description>

			<title>'Grabbed my child by the neck': How a pack of man-eating wolves is spreading terror in UP</title>

			<description>A pack of man-eating wolves has terrorized 25 to 30 villages in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich district, killing nine people, including eight children, in 45 days. The attacks have left over 50,000 residents living in fear.  

The first incident occurred in mid-July when a one-year-old child was killed. Since then, attacks have continued with horrifying regularity, leaving villagers traumatized and struggling to survive.  
  
In response, the Uttar Pradesh government launched "Operation Bhediya" to capture the wolves. Over 250 personnel, including forest officials, are involved in the operation which includes setting up traps and deploying drone cameras.  They have already trapped three wolves, but two remain at large. The government is also providing support to villagers by installing doors and toilets in homes.</description>

			<title>What is EEE, the deadly mosquito-borne virus that is raging in the US?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/what-is-eee-the-deadly-mosquito-borne-virus-that-is-raging-in-the-us-13809414.html</link>
			<description>Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), a rare but potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus, is causing concern in the US. A man in New Hampshire has died from the virus, marking the state's first case in a decade.  This year, EEE cases have also been reported in New Jersey, Vermont, and Wisconsin. 

While most people infected with EEE don't experience symptoms, those who do can develop fever, brain swelling, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, behavior changes, and drowsiness.  About 30% of infected individuals die from the illness. 

There is no specific treatment or vaccine for EEE.  Prevention is key and includes avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito hours and using insect repellent. States are taking measures to control mosquito populations through insecticide spraying and encouraging residents to take preventive steps.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-polio-still-a-threat-in-afghanistan-and-pakistan-13809531.html</link>
			<description>Polio, a highly infectious viral disease, mainly affecting children under five, was nearly eradicated globally through widespread vaccination efforts. However, outbreaks continue to occur in countries with low vaccination rates, like recent cases in Gaza.  The virus can cause paralysis and even death.  Before the vaccine, polio outbreaks were catastrophic, causing thousands of deaths and lifelong disability. Eradication efforts, led by the WHO, have been incredibly successful but face challenges in conflict zones and regions with weak health systems.  Despite the progress, achieving complete eradication remains a complex and ongoing task.</description>

			<title>Why Japan is luring single women with money to move out of Tokyo</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-japan-is-luring-single-women-with-money-to-move-out-of-tokyo-13809437.html</link>
			<description>To address Japan's declining population and gender imbalance in rural areas, the government is implementing a new initiative.  The plan includes covering travel expenses for single women relocating from Tokyo to rural areas for matchmaking events and offering financial incentives for those who decide to permanently move. This aims to encourage single women who currently stay in Tokyo for work or education to return to their hometowns and potentially find partners. The government hopes this will help reverse the trend of a shrinking rural population and boost birth rates.</description>

			<title>Explained: South Korea’s deepfake porn epidemic and its link to Telegram</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-south-korea-deepfake-porn-epidemic-telegram-group-chats-13809416.html</link>
			<description>South Korea is facing a surge in deepfake pornography cases targeting women and girls, often shared on Telegram. Universities and schools have been affected, with victims ranging from students and teachers to military personnel. President Yoon Suk Yeol has called for a crackdown on these "digital sex crimes," urging authorities to investigate and eradicate the issue. Telegram has been identified as the main platform for distributing this illegal content, prompting calls for the social media platform to take stronger measures against its spread. 


Concerns have been raised about the government's response, with activists calling for a national emergency declaration and urging increased efforts to address the root causes of these crimes, including gender inequality and a culture of online anonymity.  The Korean National Police Agency has launched a campaign to combat online sex crimes, while the Korea Communications Standards Commission is working with platforms like Telegram, Facebook, and YouTube to remove and prevent the spread of deepfake content.  South Korea's legal system punishes the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes with up to five years in prison or a fine of 50 million won.</description>

			<title>The shocking truth behind young, beautiful women promoting Trump on X</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-shocking-truth-behind-young-beautiful-women-promoting-trump-on-x-13809398.html</link>
			<description>A new method of pro-Trump propaganda has emerged on X, relying on stolen images of European and Russian fashion and beauty influencers. These accounts, created over the last few months, depict fictional personas supporting Trump and JD Vance, garnering thousands of followers. The accounts utilize everyday photos from the influencers' Instagram accounts, often captioned with pro-Trump hashtags and pleas for votes, despite these individuals having no connection to US politics. This practice raises concerns about misrepresentation and foreign interference in the upcoming US election. In addition to promoting Trump, these fake accounts spread misinformation on various issues, including the recent assassination attempt against Trump, Kamala Harris's ethnicity, and US military aid to Ukraine. X has taken down a majority of these accounts, but the incident highlights the platform's vulnerability to manipulation and the spread of false information.</description>

			<title>What is the tree-felling case that Chief Justice DY Chandrachud has taken up?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-tree-felling-case-that-chief-justice-dy-chandrachud-has-taken-up-13809364.html</link>
			<description>Two Supreme Court benches were handling different aspects of a contempt case against the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) regarding alleged unauthorized tree-cutting in Delhi's Ridge area. This resulted in a potential judicial standoff as one bench issued a contempt notice in April, while another bench took up a separate petition in May. 

The conflict arose due to concerns over potential contradictory judgments and a lack of adherence to judicial propriety. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of the DDA's environmental impact assessment and accusations of covering up the extent of tree felling.  

To prevent further conflict and ensure judicial coherence, Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud intervened and formed a new bench to take over the case,  with himself presiding over the hearing.</description>

			<title>More students than farmers are dying by suicide in India. What's behind the alarming rise?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rising-student-suicide-rates-in-india-whats-behind-the-alarming-rise-13809308.html</link>
			<description>A new report reveals a growing crisis of student suicide in India. Student suicides have increased at an alarming rate of four per cent annually, outpacing both population growth and overall suicide trends. Despite a slight decline in 2022, student suicides still account for 7.6 per cent of all suicides nationally. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Madhya Pradesh have the highest numbers of student suicides.  Male students comprise 53 per cent of reported suicides, with both genders experiencing a significant increase in suicide rates over the past decade. The report attributes this crisis to various factors such as academic pressure, career choices, ragging, bullying, discrimination, and financial stress.  It emphasizes the need for improved mental health support, quality education, and comprehensive counseling systems within educational institutions to address this growing concern.</description>

			<title>What’s the West Bank where Israel has launched a massive raid? Why does the timing matter?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/west-bank-israel-military-raid-timing-matters-13809312.html</link>
			<description>Israel launched a large-scale military operation in the West Bank, the largest in 20 years. The operation resulted in the deaths of at least 10 Palestinians and injuries to dozens more.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) cited a need to counter a "systematic strategy" by Iran to smuggle weapons and explosives into the West Bank, pointing to a rise in Palestinian attacks against Israelis.  

The raids, which involved armored vehicles, drones, and mass arrests, focused on areas like Jenin and Tulkarem.  

The international community condemned the operation, with the UN calling for an immediate cessation and the EU expressing concern about it escalating the conflict.  Palestinian authorities condemned the raids as a "serious escalation".</description>

			<title>Netflix's IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack: The true story of the hijacking that shook India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/netflix-series-ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-flight-180-hostages-india-13809211.html</link>
			<description>In December 1999, Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 was hijacked by five terrorists. The plane, carrying 180 passengers, was diverted to various locations including Pakistan, Dubai, and finally Kandahar, Afghanistan. 

The hijackers demanded the release of 36 terrorists in exchange for the hostages and a ransom of $200 million. After intense negotiations, the Indian government agreed to release three militants in a deal that garnered criticism for appeasing terrorists. The hijackers released some hostages but kept the rest until the deal was completed. 

The three released terrorists, including Masood Azhar, went on to form the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed, responsible for numerous attacks on India.</description>

			<title>In Hong Kong, two journalists are awaiting the results of their sedition trial. Here's what is at stake</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-hong-kong-two-journalists-are-awaiting-the-results-of-their-sedition-trial-heres-what-is-at-stake-13809213.html</link>
			<description>Two journalists from the now-defunct Hong Kong outlet Stand News, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam, are awaiting the verdict in a landmark sedition case.  This is Hong Kong's first such case involving media since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. 

They are charged with conspiracy to publish seditious materials under a colonial-era law increasingly used to target dissent following the 2019 anti-government protests.  Stand News, known for its critical reporting, was shut down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets. The prosecution alleges that the outlet acted as a political platform and published seditious articles, while the defense maintains that Stand News upheld freedom of speech.  



 The case has drawn international attention and is seen as a test of press freedom in Hong Kong.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-why-is-namibia-planning-to-cull-elephants-zebras-and-wildebeest-amid-drought-13809038.html</link>
			<description>Namibia is facing a severe drought that has depleted its food reserves by 84%.  To address escalating food insecurity, the government has authorized the culling of 723 wild animals, including 83 elephants, to distribute meat to drought-stricken communities. The cull is justified by the government as necessary to manage animal populations where resources are scarce.  Already, 157 animals have been culled, providing over 56,800 kilograms of meat for the relief program. This drastic measure highlights the dire situation facing Namibia and the region due to the ongoing drought.</description>

			<title>What is Trump-flation? Why are economists worried about it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-trump-flation-why-are-economists-worried-about-it-13809135.html</link>
			<description>The term "Trump-flation" refers to concerns about inflation potentially rising if Donald Trump wins a second term.  Economists worry about this because of several of Trump's stated policies, including imposing tariffs on imports, weakening the dollar, and potentially pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.  

These policies could lead to higher consumer prices. A 20% tariff on China, for example, could cost US households an additional $1,700 to $2,350 per month. Some economists believe that Trump's policies could lead to a surge in inflation, potentially echoing the situation in Turkey under President Erdogan, where inflation reached 85%. 

However, some argue that Trump's focus on tax cuts and replacing them with tariffs on international trade could be beneficial. They point out that income taxes are also a type of trade tax, and it's a matter of preference whether to tax domestic or international trade. Ultimately, the potential impact of Trump's policies on inflation remains a subject of debate.</description>

			<description>W Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has pledged to introduce a bill in the state Assembly that will mandate the death penalty for rapists within seven days of the crime. This comes in response to the recent rape and murder of a trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. Banerjee stated she will call a special session next week to pass the bill and will pressurize the Governor to approve it, even resorting to protests if necessary. India's existing rape laws already provide for the death penalty in certain cases, such as rape leading to death or permanent vegetative state.</description>

			<title>Do Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore have enough food and supplies to stay in space until 2025?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nasa-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-food-supplies-international-space-station-2025-survival-13809077.html</link>
			<description>Two US astronauts, Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams, were  scheduled for an eight-day mission to the International Space Station (ISS) but remain there due to issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. 

They are now expected to return to Earth in February 2025 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.  Nasa assures that the ISS has sufficient supplies, including food, water, and oxygen, to support the crew for the extended period.  

They will be participating in regular crew tasks, such as spacewalks, maintenance, and scientific experiments.  However, concerns exist regarding the impact of the prolonged stay on their physical and mental health. Potential issues include muscle and bone loss, fluid redistribution, space anemia, vision problems, and psychological effects of isolation.  Despite these concerns, the astronauts are well equipped to handle the challenges of a longer stay, as Nasa has extensive experience managing extended missions.</description>

			<title>Buying a new car? Here's how scrapping your old vehicle can earn you discounts</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/buying-a-new-car-heres-how-scrapping-your-old-vehicle-can-earn-you-discounts-13809032.html</link>
			<description>Following a meeting between Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and SIAM CEOs, many automobile manufacturers have agreed to offer discounts on new car purchases for customers who scrap their old vehicles. Discounts range from 1.5% to 3.5% on passenger vehicles and 1.5% to 3% on commercial vehicles, based on various factors like vehicle weight and age. Luxury car brand Mercedes-Benz is offering a flat discount of Rs 25,000 for scrapped vehicles. 

The scheme aims to promote the National Vehicle Scrappage Policy, which encourages phasing out unfit and polluting vehicles while fostering a circular economy. 


This initiative incentivizes vehicle owners to contribute to a cleaner environment and benefits the automotive industry by stimulating new vehicle sales. To qualify for the discounts, owners must link their scrapped vehicle's details to the Vahan system.</description>

			<title>Is Kamala Harris ineligible to run for US president? What's the latest controversy?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-kamala-harris-ineligible-to-run-for-us-president-whats-the-latest-controversy-13808992.html</link>
			<description>The National Federation of Republican Assemblies (NFRA), a conservative organization, has sparked controversy by citing the 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court ruling to argue that Vice President Kamala Harris is ineligible to run for president. The NFRA claims that Harris, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy do not meet the Constitution's “natural-born citizen” requirement.

Their argument hinges on a strict interpretation of the clause, suggesting that only those born on US soil to two US citizen parents qualify. This stance draws on originalist legal philosophies and cites several Supreme Court cases, including Dred Scott,  which is widely considered one of the worst rulings in US history.

The NFRA's position has been widely criticized as legally flawed and racially insensitive. Legal experts argue that their interpretation contradicts established precedents and would have disqualified several early US presidents. 
Critics also point out that invoking Dred Scott to challenge a woman of color's eligibility for president resembles racial dog-whistling. While the NFRA claims their actions are solely based on legal arguments, the timing and targeting of their claim against Harris raise questions about its political motives, particularly in light of their endorsement of Donald Trump.</description>

			<title>How this Arizona county could play a crucial role in deciding the fate of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/arizona-county-crucial-role-us-presidential-elections-13809055.html</link>
			<description>Maricopa County, Arizona, containing Phoenix and 4.5 million residents, holds significant weight in national elections.  

This was once a reliably Republican county, but its political landscape is shifting.  The 2020 election saw Biden defeat Trump, hinting at a trend towards more centrist leanings and fueled by a growing Hispanic population that tends to vote Democratic.

While the county still leans Republican, a significant portion of voters are unaffiliated, making the outcome of elections more unpredictable. Maricopa County also has a high early voting rate, adding complexity to the vote counting process.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh frees ABT chief Jashimuddin Rahmani, a vocal supporter of Al Qaeda. Should India be worried?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-frees-abt-chief-jashimuddin-rahmani-a-vocal-supporter-of-al-qaeda-should-india-be-worried-13809034.html</link>
			<description>Jashimuddin Rahmani, the leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), has been released from prison in Bangladesh. Rahmani was convicted for abetting the murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in 2013. The ABT is responsible for the killings of several other bloggers, writers, and activists in Bangladesh. Rahmani is known for his extremist views and support of Al Qaeda. He has authored books promoting violence against non-believers.
 
Experts believe that Rahmani's release poses a threat to India as the ABT has been attempting to establish a jihadi network in the country. They have allegedly collaborated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba to carry out attacks in India's northeast. The Indian authorities have arrested several ABT members in recent months.</description>

			<title>Where is MH370? Has an Australian scientist solved the mystery of the Malaysian Airlines plane?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mh370-australian-scientist-solved-mystery-malaysian-airlines-plane-13808969.html</link>
			<description>The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in 2014 remains a mystery, but Australian scientist Vincent Lyne proposes a new theory.  Lyne suggests the plane is located in a deep trench at the eastern end of the Broken Ridge in the Southern Indian Ocean, a site he believes was deliberately chosen by the pilot.

He bases his theory on a flight path generated from the pilot’s home simulator that intersects with the coordinates of this trench. Lyne argues that damage to the plane’s wings and flaps points to a “controlled ditching” rather than a catastrophic crash.  

While official investigations focused on the 7th arc, where the last satellite communication occurred, Lyne believes the evidence points to the deep trench as the final resting place of MH370.</description>

			<title>NDA crosses majority mark in Rajya Sabha: Why it matters for govt</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nda-bjp-majority-mark-rajya-sabha-why-it-matters-for-govt-13809010.html</link>
			<description>The BJP-led NDA has secured a majority in the Rajya Sabha after 11 members, including nine from the BJP, were elected unopposed. This shift in numbers gives the ruling alliance the power to pass bills without relying on the support of non-aligned parties.  Prior to the elections, the NDA was short of the majority mark, prompting concerns about its ability to push through its legislative agenda. The NDA now holds 121 seats in the Upper House, surpassing the required 119 for a majority.  This newfound majority is expected to significantly bolster the NDA's legislative capabilities and streamline the passage of important bills.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder: Who is Anup Dutta, the policeman under scanner as CBI demands polygraph test?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-who-is-anup-dutta-the-policeman-under-scanner-as-cbi-demands-polygraph-test-13808943.html</link>
			<description>The CBI investigation into the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata has led them to suspect Anup Dutta, an assistant sub-inspector with the Kolkata Police. Dutta was in contact with Sanjay Roy, the only person arrested in the case, on the day the body was found.  Suspicions arose due to alleged favors Dutta extended to Roy, including access to police quarters and a motorcycle, which Roy wasn't entitled to.  

Dutta also had connections to the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, who is also under CBI investigation. Photos of Dutta and the former principal together have surfaced on social media.  The CBI is investigating whether Dutta helped Roy destroy evidence or escape. A polygraph test has been requested from the court, pending Dutta's consent.</description>

			<title>Selling Sunlight: The truth behind US firm’s sci-fi plan of providing sunlight after dark</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/reflect-orbital-us-firm-selling-sunlight-after-dark-13808980.html</link>
			<description>Reflect Orbital, a California-based startup, is developing a system to beam sunlight from space to Earth.  The company plans to launch a network of satellites equipped with large mylar mirrors to reflect sunlight onto specific locations, providing an additional 30 minutes of "sunshine" to solar farms during peak demand times.  This technology aims to address the issue of solar energy's inconsistency, as it's unavailable at night and can be affected by weather conditions. Reflect Orbital's concept has garnered significant attention, with thousands of individuals expressing interest in its "spot of light" service. 



However, the technology faces challenges, including potential light pollution and the risk of debris re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Despite these concerns, Reflect Orbital's ambitious project has the potential to revolutionize energy production and illuminate previously dark areas.</description>

			<title>How Israel rescued a hostage from Hamas’ infamous tunnel network in Gaza</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-israel-idf-rescued-hostage-qaid-farhan-alkadi-from-hamas-infamous-tunnel-network-in-gaza-13808918.html</link>
			<description>Israeli forces successfully rescued Farhan Al-Qadi, a 52-year-old Bedouin Israeli, from Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza. Held captive since October 7, he was found alive and in stable condition, marking the first time a hostage has been rescued alive from these tunnels. Guided by intelligence, special forces discovered Al-Qadi alone, leading to speculation that his captors fled upon realizing Israeli troops were nearby.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Al-Qadi, who expressed overwhelming relief and gratitude.

Al-Qadi, a father of 11, was working as an unarmed guard at the time of his abduction. His rescue brought immense joy to his family, who had endured a year of uncertainty. Al-Qadi's brother described the experience as "bringing him back from the dead," detailing the brutal conditions of captivity, including constant darkness and witnessing another hostage die. He had reportedly lost significant weight and suffered from untreated injuries. 


The rescue highlights the ongoing plight of hostages in Gaza, with 104 still held captive, and 34 presumed dead, following the October 7 attacks. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum emphasizes the need for more than just military operations to secure the release of the remaining hostages.</description>

			<title>Floods, deaths and more: How Gujarat is devastated by heavy rains, which are likely to worsen</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/gujarat-floods-devastation-heavy-rains-13808938.html</link>
			<description>Incessant rains have caused widespread flooding in Gujarat, claiming 15 lives and disrupting transportation, electricity, and daily life.  The state has received significantly higher than average rainfall, with some districts experiencing over 200 millimeters of rain in a 12-hour period.  

Rivers have breached danger marks, forcing evacuations in Vadodara and Panchmahals. Several bridges have collapsed due to overflowing rivers, hindering commuting and access between villages.  Additionally, the state administration reported waterlogged roads, disrupted train and flight services, and over 600 villages without electricity. The Gujarat government has deployed National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams and Indian Army columns to aid in rescue and relief efforts.  The IMD has issued warnings for continued heavy to very heavy rains until Thursday, prompting authorities to urge residents to stay indoors and avoid water bodies.</description>

			<title>Why did US readout on Modi-Biden call omit Bangladesh crisis? The controversy explained</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-readout-modi-biden-call-bangladesh-crisis-controversy-explained-13808909.html</link>
			<description>A phone conversation took place between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden. While India's readout mentioned discussions about the situation in Bangladesh, the US readout did not. 

India clarified that it's common practice for separate press releases to be issued following conversations, and the omission doesn't necessarily mean an issue wasn't discussed. Some geopolitical experts suggest the US's omission reflects growing unease with Bangladesh, while others believe the US focused mainly on Modi's recent visit to Ukraine. 


The US silence on Bangladesh, particularly concerning minority safety, has drawn attention.  Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, alleged in a reported undelivered speech that she was pressured by the US to allow a naval base on St. Martin's Island.



The situation in Bangladesh remains a point of contention, with differing perspectives on the US's role and stance.</description>

			<title>Was there a time when dinosaurs travelled across continents? Here's what new study says</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/dinosaurs-footprints-across-continents-new-study-13808767.html</link>
			<description>Over 260 dinosaur footprints have been discovered in Brazil and Cameroon, separated by the Atlantic Ocean. These tracks, dating back to the Early Cretaceous period, provide insights into the environment of the Gondwana supercontinent. The footprints, consistent in age and shape, suggest a family of predators roamed both continents before they split apart.  

The majority of the fossils belong to three-toed theropod dinosaurs, with some possibly belonging to sauropods and ornithischians. Both regions where the footprints were found were once connected, forming a land bridge that allowed dinosaurs to travel between Africa and South America.  

The tracks offer valuable information about dinosaur behavior, including their gait, social interactions, and the environments they inhabited.</description>

			<title>How Hema Committee report has left Kerala's ruling CPI (M) in a fix</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-hema-committee-report-has-left-keralas-ruling-cpi-m-in-a-fix-13808827.html</link>
			<description>The  Justice Hema Committee report, submitted in 2019, details the exploitation of women in the Malayalam film industry.  The report alleges the existence of a powerful  "mafia" within the industry that wields influence and imposes unofficial bans on those who challenge it.  

The report's findings have sparked controversy, with opposition parties accusing the ruling CPI(M) government of a cover-up and inaction. They point to alleged links between prominent figures in the industry and the ruling party, and question the government's delay in releasing the report. 

The government has defended its actions, stating it is committed to taking action against those implicated and implementing the report's recommendations. Critics, however, argue that the government's focus on the economic impact of the industry overshadows the need to address the systemic abuse and exploitation.</description>

			<title>Play badminton, read books: Hong Kong's bizarre sex ed advice for teens</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/play-badminton-read-books-hong-kongs-bizarre-sex-ed-advice-for-teens-13808788.html</link>
			<description>Hong Kong's Education Bureau released a controversial 70-page sex education document advising teenagers to delay romantic relationships and limit intimacy. The curriculum includes worksheets for adolescents and guidance for teachers, focusing on the relationship between love and sex, boundaries, coping with sexual fantasies and impulses, and the potential consequences of acting on them.  It suggests activities like playing badminton or studying as distractions from temptation and asks students to sign a commitment form setting limits on intimacy.  

The document has faced criticism for being outdated, unrealistic, and overly simplistic in its approach to complex issues.  Experts and lawmakers argue that it emphasizes control over understanding and facing sexual development, potentially perpetuating harmful rape myths.  Despite the backlash, Hong Kong officials stand by the guidelines, emphasizing the importance of cultivating comprehensive values and enabling informed decision-making.</description>

			<title>UK takeaways crisis: The rising cost of fish and chips, other fast foods, explained</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-takeaways-crisis-rising-cost-of-fish-and-chips-other-fast-foods-explained-13808818.html</link>
			<description>The average price of fish and chips in the UK has risen by 52% over the past five years, reaching £9.88 in July 2024. This increase is higher than other popular takeaway meals like pizza, Indian, or Chinese food.  

Rising costs for chip shop owners, including energy, imported seafood, and potatoes, are the main drivers of this price surge.  Other factors contributing to the increase are tariffs on Russian seafood imports and the UK government's ban on single-use plastic packaging. The cost of living crisis has further exacerbated these pressures.</description>

 Australia has reduced its student intake by 20,000, barred loopholes extending visas, doubled student visa fees, and tightened English language requirements.  This, coupled with a crackdown on dependent visas,  has led to a steep decline in Indian student visa approvals and applications.

The UK has barred students from bringing their families unless they are on research programs or government-funded scholarships and tightened rules around post-study work visas.  This coupled with uncertainty surrounding the Graduate Route, has also dampened interest from Indian students.

 New Zealand has doubled its student visa fees, citing the need for a sustainable immigration system. Poland has tightened visa rules after a scandal involving student visa misuse for work purposes in the Schengen area. 

Canada, meanwhile, is capping study permits and reducing permanent residency nominations, potentially impacting 70,000 international students due to  changes in post-graduation work permit eligibility.</description>

			<title>Could Ukraine's new homegrown weapon bypass Western restrictions and hit deep into Russia?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraine-new-homegrown-weapon-bypass-western-restrictions-russia-13808775.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine has unveiled its new long-range weapon, the "Palianytsia," a domestically developed missile-drone hybrid with a range of up to 700 kilometers.  The weapon, named after a type of Ukrainian bread, was created to counter Russia's dominance in the skies and to bypass Western restrictions on using long-range missiles against targets deep inside Russia. 

The Palianytsia has been used in its first strike, targeting a Russian military base in occupied territory.  Ukrainian officials believe it will be a game changer, allowing them to strike deeper into enemy territory and erode Russia's military infrastructure. The weapon's development, which took about 18 months, was driven by the need to effectively respond to Russia's relentless bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure.</description>

			<title>What’s the controversy surrounding Bangladesh floods and India’s Farakka barrage?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-floods-india-farakka-barrage-treaty-ganga-water-sharing-13808771.html</link>
			<description>Flooding in Bangladesh, which has resulted in 23 deaths and displacement of millions, has sparked accusations against India. 

 Bangladeshi reports claim the opening of the Farakka barrage in West Bengal is partially responsible for the deluge.  

India has refuted these allegations, stating that the barrage is not a dam and operates in accordance with the 1996 Ganga Water Treaty. 

The treaty ensures that a certain amount of water is released downstream from Farakka, particularly during specific periods.  

Indian officials have emphasized that the barrage operates to divert water for navigability in Calcutta port and does not directly cause flooding in Bangladesh.</description>

			<title>Will men be wiped out from Earth? The case of disappearing Y chromosomes</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-men-be-wiped-out-from-earth-the-case-of-disappearing-y-chromosomes-13808746.html</link>
			<description>A recent study suggests the Y chromosome, responsible for male development, is shrinking and may eventually disappear. This is due to the chromosome's loss of genes over time and its inability to undergo genetic recombination. While this raises questions about the future of male humans, some species, like spiny rats, have evolved alternative sex determination mechanisms after losing their Y chromosome.  This suggests that even if the Y chromosome disappears, humans might evolve new ways to determine sex, potentially leading to diverse human species in the future.</description>

			<title>EEE, West Nile, malaria: How different are the mosquito-borne diseases on the rise in the US?</title>

			<description>Mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing an increase in the United States. Cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a rare but severe disease, have been reported in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont. The disease causes brain inflammation and can be fatal. West Nile virus, spread by Culex mosquitoes, has also affected the former top US infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. 

Dengue and malaria, typically found in tropical regions, are also becoming more common in the US due to factors like global warming.  Dengue, known for causing severe muscle and joint pain, carries a high risk globally with millions of infections occurring annually. Malaria, a parasitic disease, infects hundreds of millions globally, primarily in Africa. Although primarily found in tropical regions, warming temperatures are expanding the reach of these mosquito-borne diseases.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mollywood-metoo-kerala-bigwigs-sexual-abuse-allegations-hema-committee-report-13808698.html</link>
			<description>Reports by the Justice Hema Committee triggered a Malayalam film industry MeToo movement.  Several women accused prominent figures like actor Siddique of sexual misconduct. 

A female actor accused Siddique of rape when they met about a film role. Another actor, Sridevika, claimed filmmaker Thulasidas harassed during the shoot of  "Avan Chandiyude Makan," and that AMMA, the industry association, failed to act on her complaints.

These accusations sparked outrage, and Mohanlal, the AMMA president, resigned. Actor Prithviraj Sukumaran demanded action against perpetrators and criticized AMMA's handling of previous complaints. 

The Kerala government has formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the allegations.</description>

			<title>Nabanna Abhijan protests turn violent: What is ‘Chhatra Samaj’, the new student outfit behind the stir in Kolkata?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nabanna-abhijan-protests-chhatra-samaj-student-outfit-kolkata-13808640.html</link>
			<description>A newly formed student group, Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj, organized a protest march in Kolkata demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the recent rape-murder case of a trainee doctor. The march, called "Nabanna Abhijan," aimed to reach the state secretariat.  

The group, while claiming to be apolitical, faced accusations from the ruling Trinamool Congress of having BJP backing. The BJP denied the allegations, stating they supported the movement but were not organizing it.  Police called the march illegal and deployed significant security measures, including tear gas and water cannons, to prevent the students from reaching their destination. The situation escalated, leading to stone-throwing by protesters and forceful dispersal by police.</description>

			<title>Pavel Durov arrest: Is Telegram the go-to app for terrorists?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-arrested-is-it-the-go-to-app-for-terrorists-13808712.html</link>
			<description>Telegram, with approximately 700 million users globally, has positioned itself as a platform prioritizing user privacy and data protection. It gained notoriety following the 2015 Paris attacks when ISIS utilized the app to spread propaganda and recruit members. Despite claims of taking down numerous ISIS accounts, experts argue that Telegram is ineffective in curbing the group's online activity, as new channels can be easily created. 

The app's strong encryption features, while appealing to many, have also attracted criminal and terrorist organizations.  Concerns over Telegram's role in facilitating terrorist activities have heightened following CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France over allegations of money laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorism support.</description>

			<title>India has developed its own mpox RT-PCR testing kits. Here’s why this matters</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/india-has-developed-its-own-mpox-rt-pcr-testing-kits-heres-why-this-matters-13808633.html</link>
			<description>India has made significant strides in its fight against the mpox virus by developing two indigenous RT-PCR testing kits. The 'ErbaMDx Monkeypox RT-PCR Kit', developed by Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ) and Transasia Diagnostics, boasts a 12-month shelf life, no cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses, and uses lyophilized components for easier storage and transportation.  

Siemens Healthineers has also developed the 'IMDX Monkeypox Detection RT-PCR Assay', which offers rapid results in 40 minutes and high accuracy with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Both kits are approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and demonstrate India's growing expertise in advanced medical technology.
 
  These developments come at a crucial time as the WHO has declared a second public health emergency due to the global spread of a more virulent mpox strain.</description>

			<title>What’s al-Aqsa, Islam’s third holiest site, where Israeli minister wants to build a synagogue?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/al-aqsa-islam-third-holiest-site-israel-itamar-ben-gvir-palestine-conflict-13808680.html</link>
			<description>Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has sparked international outrage by stating that he would build a synagogue at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem if he had the authority.  The compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, is the third holiest site in Islam and is highly contested. 

Ben-Gvir's comments have drawn criticism from both Israeli and international leaders, who argue that his actions threaten regional stability. The site has been a flashpoint for conflict for decades, with numerous clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian worshippers.  Current arrangements stipulate that the Islamic Waqf controls the compound's internal affairs while Israel manages external security. However, Israeli actions, such as allowing Jewish visitors and prohibiting prayer, have been condemned by Muslims.  Ben-Gvir's previous visits to the site have also caused significant controversy.</description>

			<description>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is launching the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), a digital platform designed to simplify and streamline the lending process in India. Similar to the successful Unified Payments Interface (UPI), ULI aims to revolutionize credit accessibility by facilitating a seamless flow of customer financial and non-financial data from various sources to lenders. This centralized data sharing will reduce the time taken for credit appraisal, particularly benefiting smaller borrowers and those in rural areas. ULI is currently in a pilot phase and will be rolled out nationwide based on its success. The RBI envisions ULI as a transformative force in the lending landscape, creating frictionless credit access and driving financial inclusion.</description>

			<title>First floods, now visas: How anti-India sentiment continues to grow in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/floods-visa-anti-india-sentiment-bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-13808597.html</link>
			<description>Anti-India sentiment is rising in Bangladesh following recent floods and the provision of shelter for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after her ouster.  Protests erupted at an Indian visa centre in Satkhira as applicants expressed frustration over processing delays and alleged harassment. The demonstrators voiced anger at what they perceive as India's role in the flooding and criticized the Indian visa application process. While the Indian High Commission addressed the situation with Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the incident highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations.  

The situation has been further complicated by allegations of election rigging and India's alleged complicity in supporting Hasina's regime, which has fueled distrust among the Bangladeshi populace. Despite diplomatic efforts to mend relations, the "India Out" sentiment persists, posing a challenge to the smooth functioning of bilateral ties.</description>

			<title>Can Lebanon afford to go to war with Israel?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-lebanon-afford-to-go-to-war-with-israel-13808421.html</link>
			<description>The recent exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah has raised concerns about a potential wider conflict. Lebanon, already grappling with economic and political turmoil, is facing a precarious situation.  Unlike the 2006 war, Lebanon is hosting a large Syrian refugee population, further straining its resources. The country's infrastructure is fragile, and its ability to cope with a major humanitarian crisis is limited. 

Hezbollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since 2006, raising fears of a more destructive conflict. The possibility of a wider war with Hezbollah’s involvement adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile situation in the region.</description>

			<description>Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, was arrested in France on serious charges, including the dissemination of criminal content. His arrest involved a woman named Juli Vavilova, a 24-year-old crypto coach from Dubai. Vavilova has been seen with Durov on multiple occasions and her social media posts suggest a close relationship with him. Her presence at the time of his arrest has led to various theories, ranging from accidental exposure to intentional involvement in a plot to capture Durov. Some speculate that she may have been a "honeytrap" or a Mossad agent, though these claims are unsubstantiated. Vavilova's whereabouts and involvement in the case remain unclear as of now.</description>

			<title>Ghost of Gaza: How Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar remains as elusive as ever to Israeli and American intelligence</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ghost-of-gaza-how-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-remains-as-elusive-as-ever-to-israel-and-american-intelligence-13808374.html</link>
			<description>Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, has eluded capture by Israeli and American intelligence despite significant efforts and advanced technology.  Sinwar's use of a human courier network, reminiscent of Osama bin Laden's tactics, has made him one of the most difficult targets in history. He has moved his operations underground, relying on Gaza's extensive tunnel system for shelter and communication. Sinwar's direct involvement in the October 7 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of many Israelis, makes his capture a priority for Israel and the US. While they have collaborated extensively, including deploying ground-penetrating radar to map the tunnel network, Sinwar has continued to evade detection.</description>

			<title>Looking for a mate: How a lonely dolphin is wreaking havoc in Japanese waters</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/lonely-dolphin-wreaking-havoc-japan-13808319.html</link>
			<description>A bottle-nosed dolphin named Suzu has been responsible for a series of attacks on swimmers and divers in Fukui Prefecture, Japan. Since 2022, at least 47 people have been injured, with attacks reported in both  Wakasa Bay and near the towns of Echizen and Mihama. Suzu is believed to be a lone male dolphin who may be seeking a mate or acting out due to previous negative interactions with humans.  Authorities have attempted to deter Suzu with acoustic deterrents, warning signs, and restricted swimming hours.</description>

			<title>What is the Baloch Liberation Army, the group behind the deadly attacks in Pakistan?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-baloch-liberation-army-the-group-behind-the-deadly-attacks-in-pakistan-13808396.html</link>
			<description>The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) launched a series of attacks across Pakistan's Balochistan province. Targets included police stations, railway lines, and highways. The BLA claimed responsibility for killing over 100 soldiers in attacks on army camps, though these claims are yet to be confirmed.  

Monday's attacks, described as the most widespread by the insurgent group in years, resulted in the deaths of at least 23 civilians and security personnel.  The group, which seeks an independent state of Greater Balochistan, has been designated a terrorist organization by several countries.  They cite the exploitation of Balochistan's resources and mistreatment of its people by the Pakistani establishment as reasons for their actions.</description>

			<title>Is the Maldives facing a currency crisis? Has it run out of dollars?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-the-maldives-facing-a-currency-crisis-has-it-run-out-of-dollars-13808298.html</link>
			<description>The Maldives is facing its worst financial crisis ever, with usable dollar reserves reaching a negative balance for the first time. This alarming situation was triggered by a $25 million oil bill and dwindling reserves, attributed to loan repayments and rising import costs.  The decline has prompted the central bank to impose temporary restrictions on dollar transactions. The government, while striving to reassure the public,  has faced criticism for lack of transparency and is exploring measures like raising fees and taxes to bolster dollar revenue.  Experts suggest the government might have to utilize the Sovereign Development Fund if the crisis deepens. The Maldives urgently needs to address this financial instability to ensure it can meet its financial obligations and maintain essential imports.</description>

			<title>Maharashtra becomes first state to offer Unified Pension Scheme. How is it different from National Pension Scheme?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/maharashtra-becomes-first-state-to-offer-unified-pension-scheme-how-is-it-different-from-national-pension-scheme-13808306.html</link>
			<description>Maharashtra has become the first state to implement the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for its employees.  The UPS guarantees a fixed pension after retirement, calculated at half the employee's average basic pay over the last year of service for those who have served for 25 years. It offers inflation indexation and a lump sum payment upon retirement.  Contributions are split between the employee (10%) and the government (18.5%). 

This differs from the National Pension Scheme (NPS) which, despite also providing a pension,  links returns to the stock market, making the pension amount variable. NPS contributions are split between the employee (10%) and the government (14%). NPS subscribers can choose their risk level and benefit from tax deductions.</description>

			<title>New clashes break out in Dhaka: Why are Bangladeshis protesting even after Sheikh Hasina’s ouster?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/clashes-dhaka-ansar-forces-bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-ouster-13808252.html</link>
			<description>Clashes erupted in Dhaka, Bangladesh, between students and members of the Ansar paramilitary force, resulting in nearly 50 injuries. The violence stemmed from students protesting the Ansar's continued blockade of the Secretariat, despite government assurances. The Ansar members were demanding the nationalization of their jobs and other benefits. Tensions escalated when students confronted the Ansar, accusing them of acting as agents of the dictators. 

The Bangladesh interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, has urged calm and pledged to hold free and fair elections after implementing reforms.  The government also ordered the transfer of several Ansar officials and imposed a ban on gatherings near key government buildings. The situation highlights the ongoing political turmoil in Bangladesh following the resignation and flight of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</description>

			<title>Who is Telegram founder Pavel Durov? Why has he been arrested in France?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-arrested-in-france-13808228.html</link>
			<description>Pavel Durov, founder of the messaging app Telegram, was arrested in France over allegations related to his platform. The allegations include fraud, drug trafficking, organized crime, promotion of terrorism, and cyberbullying. 

Durov, a self-proclaimed libertarian, has built a tech empire and amassed a $15.5 billion fortune. He moved from Russia in 2014 after refusing government demands to censor opposition content on his previous social network, VK.  Telegram has gained popularity for its focus on privacy and encryption, but it has also faced criticism for allegedly hosting harmful content and facilitating illegal activities.  


Durov maintains that he complies with EU laws and removes content promoting violence.  He is currently detained in France as the investigation continues.</description>

			<title>Hezbollah fires over 320 Katyusha rockets at Israel: What makes these missiles so dangerous?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hezbollah-katyusha-rockets-israel-soviet-era-dangerous-lethality-13808191.html</link>
			<description>Hezbollah launched over 320 Katyusha rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the death of a senior commander.  These rockets, first developed by the Soviet Union during World War II, are known for their ability to deliver a large number of explosives over a wide area, creating a destructive "storm of fire." While lacking precision, their sheer volume makes them effective weapons, particularly in terrorizing enemy troops. 

Hezbollah's arsenal also includes a variety of other rockets and missiles, such as Iranian-made Raad, Fajr, and Zilzal rockets, as well as  Kornet anti-tank missiles.  The group is estimated to possess a significant number of these weapons, potentially up to 130,000 rockets and missiles.</description>

			<title>How China’s growing unemployment has given rise to ‘rotten tail kids’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-growing-unemployment-rotten-tail-kids-13807250.html</link>
			<description>China is facing a severe youth unemployment crisis, with the rate exceeding 20% in June 2023.  The term "rotten-tail kids" has emerged on social media to describe this generation of graduates struggling to find meaningful employment despite their qualifications. Many accept low-paying jobs or rely on parental support. The government acknowledges the issue and has implemented measures to create job opportunities and support businesses, but the situation remains dire.  Widespread pessimism prevails among young job seekers, with concerns about scams and limited prospects. This crisis stems from a long-standing mismatch between the supply of college graduates and available jobs, exacerbated by a slowing economy and changing industry demands.</description>

			<title>Massaging the fascia is the latest social media trend. But does it really work?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/massaging-the-fascia-is-the-latest-social-media-trend-but-does-it-really-work-13806238.html</link>
			<description>One popular trend on social media promotes facial fascial massage as a treatment for wrinkles and sagging.  This technique aims to lengthen collagen molecules, release pressure on fascia, and improve circulation. However, there's no scientific evidence to support the claims that facial fascial massage can alter facial features or tissue structure.

As we age, our collagen production decreases and bone structure changes, leading to wrinkles and sagging. While facial massage may temporarily improve skin appearance, it's unlikely to reverse these natural aging processes. The massaging action itself can potentially break down collagen and stimulate fibroblasts, but the effects on collagen production are likely minimal and unlikely to significantly reduce wrinkles. 


Focusing on sun protection, hydration, and a healthy diet is a more effective approach to maintaining youthful skin compared to facial fascial massage.</description>

			<title>A quiet movement: What’s the ‘hushed hybrid’ trend at workplaces?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/a-quiet-movement-whats-the-hushed-hybrid-trend-at-workplaces-13806894.html</link>
			<description>The "hushed hybrid" trend sees managers quietly allowing employees to work remotely despite return-to-office mandates.  This arises from employee preference for flexibility,  with research indicating benefits like improved productivity and lower quit rates. 

However, this practice can create a two-tier workforce, breed resentment, and erode trust in leadership. It can also lead to cultural inconsistencies and conflict.  Companies are urged to clearly communicate flexible work policies, understand employee needs, and adopt a transparent approach to hybrid work that considers individual team requirements.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/explained-the-health-insights-your-nose-can-provide-13806544.html</link>
			<description>The human brain often filters out the nose from our visual field. However, examining the nose, like other body parts, can reveal skin conditions and internal diseases. Acne vulgaris and rosacea are common skin conditions affecting the nose, with rosacea sometimes leading to rhinophyma, thickening of the nose skin. Sarcoidosis, causing lupus pernio, can also affect the nose, while lupus pernio is a skin rash associated with lupus, an autoimmune disease. Trigeminal trophic syndrome, a rare condition damaging the facial nerve, can cause nose skin sensation changes.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/tiktok-cucumber-trend-viral-iceland-shortage-13807842.html</link>
			<description>A viral TikTok trend featuring cucumber salad recipes has led to a cucumber shortage in Iceland.  The trend, started by Canadian TikToker Logan Moffitt, has seen a surge in demand for cucumbers, surpassing the production capacity of Icelandic farmers.  As a result, major grocery chains like Kronan and Hagkaup have reported empty shelves and are scrambling to import cucumbers from the Netherlands.  
The shortage comes at a challenging time as Icelandic cucumber farmers are in the process of replacing plants, and schools are placing increased bulk orders during the return from summer holidays.</description>

			<description>The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency due to a surging mpox outbreak.  Originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the virus has claimed 450 lives and spread across Central and East Africa. The Clade 1B strain is now emerging in Europe and Southeast Asia, including countries like Sweden, Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan.  This follows a reported 99,176 cases and 208 deaths since 2022 across 116 countries. The WHO urges healthcare professionals to be aware of mpox symptoms, which may resemble those of COVID-19, but are fundamentally distinct viruses.</description>

			<title>RG Kar rape case accused, six others undergoing 'lie detector' test, but is it admissible in court?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/india/rg-kar-rape-case-lie-detector-polygraph-test-accurate-or-not-13807852.html</link>
			<description>Polygraph tests, or "lie detector" tests, are being conducted on the main suspect and six others in the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in West Bengal. The tests are being conducted by a team of polygraph specialists from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Delhi. The accuracy of polygraph tests is controversial, as physiological changes that they measure can be caused by factors other than deception. In India, polygraph test results are not admissible in court as confessions, but any evidence discovered as a result of the test can be used.</description>

			<title>'A balancing act': How global media reported PM Modi's Ukraine visit</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/a-balancing-act-how-global-media-reported-pm-modis-ukraine-visit-13807780.html</link>
			<description>PM Modi's visit to Kyiv was the first by an Indian prime minister since diplomatic ties were established in 1992.  The visit garnered global media attention, with various outlets analyzing its potential implications for India's foreign policy and the war in Ukraine.  

Some reports, like those from Reuters and the BBC, framed the visit as a "balancing act"  between India's relations with Russia and the West, while others, such as the New York Times, highlighted India's position as a voice of the "Global South" in the conflict.  The Chinese media outlet Global Times was critical, calling the visit a "symbolic gesture" unlikely to significantly advance peace talks.

The Moscow Times pointed to India's continued trade with Russia during Western sanctions, while Al Jazeera suggested Modi's visit could help bolster India's image as a potential peacemaker.</description>

			<title>Is mpox caused by the COVID vaccine? The many myths around the virus</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-mpox-caused-by-the-covid-vaccine-the-many-myths-around-the-virus-13807550.html</link>
			<description>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency due to the spread of mpox, a viral disease originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The virus, which had initially affected primarily Africa, has now spread to Europe and Southeast Asia. This global spread has led to a wave of misinformation online. 

One common misconception is that mpox is related to shingles or the Covid-19 vaccine. Medical experts clarify that mpox and shingles are caused by different viruses and that mpox predates Covid vaccines.  Another misconception is that mpox only affects gay men, but experts emphasize that close, skin-to-skin contact, not sexual orientation, is the primary mode of transmission.  

Claims about a readily available miracle drug for mpox circulating online are also refuted. While some medications may show promise, none have undergone rigorous clinical trials specifically for mpox. Lastly, the WHO has denied ordering any lockdowns in response to the mpox outbreak.</description>

			<description>Botswana has emerged as a global leader in diamond production, thanks to an abundance of high-quality gems.  Its diamond journey began in the mid-20th century with the discovery of the Orapa kimberlite field, leading to the establishment of major mines.

			<description>The Russia-Ukraine war has had a devastating impact on children, with thousands killed or injured and many more experiencing trauma, displacement, and the disruption of their education.  

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, visiting Ukraine, expressed his condolences for the children lost in the conflict. Experts estimate that millions of children have been affected, witnessing violence, losing their homes and families, and being separated from loved ones.  

The war has also caused widespread damage to schools, forcing many children out of education. International organizations like UNICEF are working to provide support and assistance to affected children, but the situation remains dire. The forcible deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, with reports of "re-education" camps, has further compounded the crisis, prompting international condemnation and calls for their return.</description>

			<title>‘What is a woman?’ Why Australian court’s ruling on discrimination is critical</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/australian-transgender-woman-gender-discrimination-case-court-ruling-13807625.html</link>
			<description>A court in Australia ruled in favor of a transgender woman, Roxanne Tickle, who was barred from a women-only social media app called Giggle for Girls. The court found that Tickle was indirectly discriminated against based on her gender identity.  

Giggle for Girls argued that sex is a biological concept, but the judge ruled that sex is changeable and not necessarily binary. The app's CEO also faced criticism for her dismissive and offensive behaviour towards Tickle throughout the trial.

This landmark ruling could set a precedent for other countries, as many nations have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which protects women's rights.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/national-space-day-india-space-sector-isro-chandrayaan-3-mission-13807534.html</link>
			<description>India achieved a significant milestone in the global space sector with the successful landing of its Chandrayaan-3 mission on the Moon's south pole last year.  This feat, accomplished by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO),  has placed India among a select few nations to have landed on the Moon. Over the years, ISRO's cost-effective missions, leveraging both domestic and international technologies, have established India as a major player in the space arena. 

India's future space endeavors include a joint moon mission with Japan, the ambitious Gaganyaan human spaceflight program, and the continued growth of its private space sector. The government's encouragement of private firms in space exploration has further fueled this growth, leading to a dynamic and innovative space ecosystem in India.</description>

			<title>Why has the Centre banned 156 cocktail drugs? Which are they?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-has-the-centre-banned-156-cocktail-drugs-which-are-they-13807479.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government has banned 156 fixed-dose combination (FDC) medicines, commonly known as "cocktail" medicines.  The ban stems from concerns that these combinations pose risks to human health, with safer alternatives available. The government cites recommendations from expert committees and the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB), which found no therapeutic justification for the ingredients in these FDCs.  

The banned list includes combinations used to treat fever, cold, allergies, pain, hair growth, skin issues, and nutritional deficiencies. Prominent pharma companies have been affected by this ban. While health experts support the move, they also call for greater transparency in the decision-making process.</description>

			<title>In Graphics | Was the Moon once covered by molten lava?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-was-the-moon-once-covered-by-molten-lava-13807484.html</link>
			<description>A new study utilizing data from India's Chandrayaan-3 mission supports the Lunar Magma theory, which proposes that the Moon was once covered in molten lava.  Analysis of lunar soil samples collected by the Pragyan rover at multiple points along a 100-meter track strengthens this theory.  Prior evidence for the magma oceans theory primarily came from the US Apollo program's analysis of mid-latitude lunar soil. This latest study provides further evidence for the Moon's formation process.</description>

			<title>How Saathiya, an Indian eatery, became a shelter as Ukraine war broke out</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-modi-kyiv-visit-russia-ukraine-war-saathiya-indian-eatery-shelter-13807330.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Ukraine holds significance amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, an Indian restauranteur named Manish Dave offered refuge in his basement eatery to over 130 people fleeing the conflict in Kyiv.  Dave opened his doors to locals, students, pregnant women, and the homeless, providing free food and shelter. He used social media to spread the word and welcomed people of all nationalities.  Dave and his staff cooked meals, often facing shortages, and even delivered food to other bunkers. Despite his mother and daughter worrying for his safety, Dave stayed in Ukraine until India issued an urgent advisory for its citizens to evacuate. He eventually left Kyiv with his staff, leaving the keys to his restaurant with the Ukrainians still seeking shelter.</description>

			<title>‘Pervert, animal-like instincts’: What psychoanalysis test reveals about Kolkata rape-murder accused</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pschoanalysis-test-kolkata-rape-murder-accused-13807459.html</link>
			<description>A psychoanalytic test conducted on the main accused in the Kolkata doctor rape-murder case, Sanjay Roy, revealed he is a "pervert and severely addicted to pornography."  Roy, a 35-year-old with an alleged history of violence and abuse, exhibited no remorse and calmly recounted the crime details to investigators. The CBI has also gathered evidence suggesting Roy's presence at the crime scene at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where the victim was found dead.  Roy was arrested based on CCTV footage that showed him entering the building and wearing a headset later found near the victim. The CBI has submitted a status report to the Supreme Court, alleging inconsistencies in the West Bengal Police's handling of the case, including an initial report suggesting suicide. The case has raised concerns about potential tampering of the crime scene and a possible cover-up. Hearings in the case are scheduled to continue in September.</description>

			<title>Modi in Kyiv: Will India be peacemaker in Russia-Ukraine war?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/modi-kyiv-peacemaker-russia-ukraine-war-13807441.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kyiv is the first by an Indian leader since Ukraine's independence.  The trip, which comes amid heightened tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war, is seen as an effort to promote dialogue and peace.  Modi will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite criticism from Western capitals over India's relationship with Russia. 
While some analysts believe Modi's strong ties with both Russia and the West may make him a suitable mediator, others remain skeptical, suggesting India's self-interest in Russia could hinder its ability to play a neutral role. Ultimately, the visit is seen as a display of India's strategic autonomy and a diplomatic win for Ukraine.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-modi-ukraine-new-delhi-kyiv-ties-13806982.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ukraine is a historic event, marking the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited the country in over 30 years. The visit, at the invitation of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,  will focus on strengthening bilateral ties across various sectors, including agriculture, economy, defense, pharmaceuticals, and people-to-people connections. 

India and Ukraine have a longstanding relationship, with India being one of the first countries to recognize Ukraine's independence in 1991.  Trade between the two nations has been steadily growing, with pharmaceuticals, machinery, and chemicals being key Indian exports.  India has also provided humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, including medical supplies and equipment. 



Modi's visit is seen as an opportunity to reaffirm India's commitment to peace and dialogue in the ongoing conflict with Russia, while also deepening its strategic relationship with Ukraine.</description>

			<title>Indonesia protests: What happened? Why have plans to change election law been scrapped?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/indonesia-protests-what-happened-why-have-plans-to-change-election-law-been-scrapped-13807349.html</link>
			<description>Thousands of Indonesian protesters clashed with police in several cities over proposed changes to the election law. The changes could have given outgoing President Joko Widodo more political power, allowing his allies to dominate upcoming regional elections.   Parliament had planned to overturn a recent Constitutional Court ruling that made it harder for Jokowi’s allies to run for office.  

The protests, fueled by concerns about democratic backsliding and dynastic politics, led to parliament delaying the proposed law’s implementation, meaning it would not apply to this year's elections. The move comes amid criticism of Jokowi for alleged power grabs and the emergence of a political dynasty focused on his family.</description>

			<title>Inside Rail Force One, the special train that ferried PM Modi from Poland to Ukraine</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/modi-ukraine-visit-rail-force-one-special-train-joe-biden-world-leaders-13806408.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ukraine is the first by an Indian prime minister since the country's independence in 1991. He traveled to Ukraine from Poland via the "Rail Force One," a diesel-powered train also used by world leaders like Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron to reach Kyiv amidst the war.  The train journey highlights the importance of rail travel in Ukraine due to the closure of airspace and limited road access. Over 200 foreign diplomatic missions have arrived in Ukraine by train since the invasion, making it a vital lifeline for international engagement and aid delivery. While Rail Force One provides a relatively safe passage, it has posed challenges to Ukraine's rail network, causing delays to other essential services.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh cancels Sheikh Hasina's red passport: What does this mean for the ex-PM?</title>

			<description>The interim government in Bangladesh has revoked all diplomatic passports, including those held by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and other officials of her ousted government. This move complicates Hasina's situation as she is currently in India and could face extradition to Bangladesh on several criminal charges. The cancellation of these passports also impacts the ability of former officials to travel internationally and signals a strong intent by the interim government to strip away their privileges.  The decision has potential implications for Bangladesh's relationship with India, which has an extradition treaty with Bangladesh.</description>

			<description>A 90-foot-tall bronze statue of Lord Hanuman, named the 'Statue of Union,' has been unveiled in Sugar Land, Texas. It is now the third tallest sculpture in the US,  surpassed only by the Statue of Liberty and the Pegasus and Dragon in Florida.  Located at Sri Ashtalakshmi Temple, the statue is intended as a spiritual epicenter for North America,  evoking strength, devotion, and selfless service. Its unveiling was marked by a grand three-day Prana Prathishta ceremony, drawing thousands of devotees. The statue's design, with arms raised, has sparked debate about its inspiration, with some suggesting a connection to the Thai Buddha's gesture of "do not fight."</description>

			<description>The Hema Committee report has exposed disturbing details about sexual harassment, exploitation, and discrimination faced by women in the Malayalam film industry.  The report highlights the prevalence of casting couch, where power figures demand sexual favors in exchange for roles. Women are also subjected to suggestive comments, unwelcome advances, and cyber attacks when they speak out.  The report reveals the existence of a powerful "mafia" group of men who control the industry and stifle dissent. Suggestions include establishing an independent tribunal to address these issues and enforcing the POSH Act on film sets. The report has elicited strong reactions from politicians, film personalities, and women's rights groups.</description>

			<title>Why have Canada’s railroads shut down? What could be the impact?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-have-canadas-railroads-shut-down-what-could-be-the-impact-13807197.html</link>
			<description>The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, representing 10,000 engineers, conductors, and dispatchers, went on strike with CN and CPKC after contract negotiations failed. The primary sticking points are scheduling practices and concerns about fatigue-related safety.  The union argues the companies want to shift away from  a km-based pay system to an hourly one, potentially leading to longer working hours and increased safety risks. 

The railroads, on the other hand, claim their offers maintain current work rules and comply with safety regulations, while offering wage increases comparable to recent industry deals. Both believe binding arbitration would be the best way to resolve the dispute.

A complete shutdown of both CN and CPKC, which control most of Canada's rail freight, poses a significant threat to the economy. The stoppage could result in billions of dollars in losses, disrupt the movement of crucial goods, and impact industries like agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation. The situation is drawing international attention due to its potential to impact US businesses and supply chains, given the significant cross-border trade reliant on Canadian railroads.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder case: Was the crime scene altered?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-case-was-the-crime-scene-altered-13807156.html</link>
			<description>The CBI filed a status report with the Supreme Court regarding the alleged rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The report stated the crime scene may have been tampered with and highlighted inconsistencies in the West Bengal Police's handling of the case, including initially stating it was a suicide and later claiming it was murder. The report also noted a delay in informing the police about the discovery of the body and raised concerns about the credibility of initial police procedures.

The Supreme Court questioned the reasons for the delay in filing an FIR and the lack of crime scene security until after the post-mortem. 

The CBI is investigating Sanjoy Roy, a Kolkata Police volunteer, as the primary suspect based on CCTV footage and his confession. The case sparked protests from doctors across India, leading the Supreme Court to initiate a National Task Force to address safety concerns for medical professionals.</description>

			<title>India's Chandrayaan-3 unveils lunar secrets: Did the Moon once host a magma ocean?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-isro-chandrayaan-3-unveils-lunar-secrets-did-moon-once-have-a-magma-ocean-13807149.html</link>
			<description>India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has provided compelling evidence supporting the theory that the Moon was once covered by a vast ocean of magma.  The Pragyan rover's data revealed a consistent presence of ferroan anorthosite, a key mineral, suggesting a shared geological history across the lunar south pole. This discovery aligns with previous missions and strengthens the Lunar Magma Ocean hypothesis. 

The rover also detected magnesium-rich minerals, indicating that material from deeper within the Moon may have been brought to the surface, possibly due to the impact that formed the South Pole-Aitken Basin. 


These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the Moon's formation and evolution, highlighting the global processes that shaped its crust. Chandrayaan-3 cements India's position as a major player in space exploration.</description>

			<description>Following student protests triggered by the rape and murder of a junior doctor at RG Kar Medical College, the West Bengal government removed Suhrita Paul as principal a week after her appointment. 

Paul’s appointment followed the resignation of the previous principal, Sandip Ghosh, who was facing intense pressure. However, Paul's tenure was short-lived due to continued student unrest and her perceived lack of engagement with the campus.

Students complained about Paul's absence and criticized her failure to address their concerns after the violent incident. Protests escalated, leading to her removal and the appointment of a new principal, Manas Kumar Bandhopadhyay.  
Three other senior officials, Bulbul Mukhopadhyay, Arunabha Datta Chaudhuri, and Saptarshi Chatterjee were also transferred.</description>

			<description>The third day of the Democratic National Convention highlighted unity and "freedom" through speeches by Bill Clinton, Tim Walz, and Oprah Winfrey. Clinton, known for his political experience, contrasted the Democratic ticket with Trump's approach. Walz, Minnesota's governor, emphasized his roots and fighting for working-class Americans. Winfrey delivered a passionate endorsement of Kamala Harris, embodying the American dream and advocating for decency and respect. 

The night featured diverse perspectives, including an invocation based on "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" (the whole world is one family) and  heartfelt pleas from the parents of a Hamas hostage. Democrats tied freedom to various issues like reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ rights, with governors like Jared Polis and Josh Shapiro showcasing their party's commitment. Social media influencers were also integrated into the convention, reflecting a shift in media consumption. Nancy Pelosi addressed rumors of tension with Biden, praising his accomplishments and emphasizing unity within the party.  Unfortunately, a bizarre incident involving insects found in delegate food added an unsettling note to the proceedings.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/not-an-era-of-war-pm-modi-peace-russia-ukraine-war-poland-visit-13807061.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a visit to Poland, reaffirmed India’s dedication to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.  This stance, consistent since the start of the war, emphasizes peace and underscores India's belief that war is not a solution. Modi's message was reiterated in his meeting with President Putin in Russia and at the G7 summit in Italy, where he stressed the importance of a human-centric approach to finding a resolution. India has consistently abstained from UN votes condemning Russia's actions, advocating for peaceful dialogue and maintaining neutral ground.</description>

			<description>India is experiencing a tourism boom, with both domestic and international travel seeing significant growth. Factors driving this rise include a growing middle class, increased disposable incomes, and a younger population eager to explore.

Popular destinations for Indians include Southeast Asia, the UAE, the US, and Japan. Direct flights, affordable fares, and diverse experiences are attracting Indian tourists.  India's tourism sector is expected to continue its upward trajectory, fueled by a rising middle class and a passion for travel.</description>

			<title>Why Pakistan has arrested a man over UK’s Southport riots</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-pakistan-has-arrested-a-man-over-uks-southport-riots-13806916.html</link>
			<description>Farhan Asif, an independent journalist allegedly linked to the now-defunct website Channel3Now, has been arrested in Pakistan for spreading misinformation that fueled the Southport riots. 

The website published a false claim that the perpetrator of the stabbing incident was an asylum seeker named Ali al-Shakati. The article went viral, contributing to widespread violence and racial attacks across the UK based on the false information.  Asif initially denied responsibility but later admitted to Pakistani police that he published the article based on unverified information from a UK social media account. Channel3Now has since been shut down, and those involved in publishing the article have been fired.  Asif is facing charges of cyber terrorism.</description>

			<title>Is your love for meat putting you at risk of diabetes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/processed-meat-red-meat-putting-you-at-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-research-13806835.html</link>
			<description>Research links regular consumption of red and processed meats to a higher risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Studies show that even small daily servings can increase this risk. Consuming processed meat, the size of a medium sausage or two to three slices of bacon, was associated with a 15% increase in diabetes risk, while 3.5 ounces of red meat, roughly a small steak, led to a 10% increase. 

Heme iron, found predominantly in red meat, is identified as a significant contributor to this risk. Researchers suggest limiting red meat consumption and prioritizing plant-based foods for a healthier diet.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-mpox-outbreak-has-helped-make-pharma-company-bavarian-nordic-richer-13806848.html</link>
			<description>Bavarian Nordic, a Danish biotech firm, has seen a significant surge in its share price following the World Health Organisation's declaration of mpox as a global public health emergency.  The company is one of the few with an approved mpox vaccine, marketed under names such as Jynneos and Imvanex.  Bavarian Nordic has been supplying vaccines for emergencies like the Ebola virus and has recently donated 40,000 doses to the Africa CDC.  

The company aims to increase its production capacity and ensure fair access to its vaccine.  Bavarian Nordic has also submitted data to the EU medical regulator for approval of its vaccine for adolescents and plans to initiate trials for use in younger children.</description>

			<title>Is Democratic VP candidate Tim Walz's 'damn' strategy winning voters?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-democratic-vp-candidate-tim-walzs-damn-strategy-winning-voters-13806890.html</link>
			<description>Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, has been using the word "damn" frequently during his recent campaign appearances. This isn't a new tactic for Walz, as he has consistently incorporated the word into his public speaking for many years. Despite potential negative perceptions associated with profanity, Walz's use of "damn" hasn't hindered his electoral success, suggesting a calculated effort to appear relatable and authentic. This approach has historical precedents in American politics, with many previous leaders, from Andrew Jackson to Lyndon Johnson, utilizing profanity in their public and private discourse. While journalists often highlight these instances, the societal tolerance for profanity has arguably increased, particularly among younger generations. Walz's continued use of "damn" will be interesting to observe as the campaign progresses, as it remains to be seen if he maintains this approach or adjusts his language.</description>

			<title>Why are couples hiring ‘professional parents’ to raise their children in China?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-couples-hiring-professional-parents-to-raise-their-children-in-china-13806817.html</link>
			<description>In China, a new trend is emerging where affluent families hire "professional child companions"  to fulfill a range of parental roles. These highly educated individuals, often graduates of prestigious universities, provide academic support, extracurricular guidance, and emotional care. They can manage homework, accompany children to activities, and even attend medical appointments.  

The demand for these professionals stems from parents' busy careers and a desire to provide exceptional care.  While salaries are substantial, averaging between Rs 1.17 lakh to Rs 3.43 lakh per month,  concerns exist about the potential impact on the parent-child relationship. Some worry that children may develop stronger attachments to their companions than their own parents, raising questions about the true meaning of "parental" care.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-indias-rupee-is-the-worst-performer-in-the-asian-market-against-the-dollar-13806810.html</link>
			<description>The Indian rupee has weakened against the US dollar in August, becoming the worst-performing Asian currency.  While other Asian currencies have strengthened due to anticipation of US rate cuts,  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has intervened in the market to prevent a larger decline in the rupee. The RBI's intervention and a combination of factors such as foreign outflows from equities, import demand for dollars, and unwinding of carry trades have contributed to the rupee's weakness. Despite these challenges, the RBI's efforts are expected to keep the rupee within a narrow range.</description>

			<title>How a pair of scissors led to more than 30 flight cancellations at Japan's airport</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pair-of-scissors-missing-japan-airport-flight-cancellations-13806806.html</link>
			<description>Traffic at New Chitose Airport in Japan was halted on Saturday after a pair of scissors went missing.  The incident triggered extensive security searches, resulting in the cancellation of 36 flights and delays of around 200 more.  The airport's strict security procedures mandate that scissors be stored securely, raising concerns about a potential breach.  Security checks were suspended for over two hours, leading to long lines and travel disruptions, particularly impacting passengers returning home from the Obon festival.  After two days, the missing scissors were found in the same location where they disappeared. The airport operator apologized for the inconvenience and promised to investigate the incident to prevent future occurrences.</description>

Retief efforts are ongoing with the hope that survivors may be trapped in air pockets within the wreckage. The yacht was carrying 22 people, including British tech mogul Mike Lynch and his daughter Hannah. While fifteen passengers were rescued, the remaining six are still unaccounted for.  Experts suggest the possibility of air pockets, but time is a critical factor as chances of survival diminish. Divers face challenges due to the depth of the wreckage, and authorities remain skeptical about finding anyone alive.</description>

			<title>Mahatma Gandhi’s friend, ‘motherji’ to Dalai Lama: Meet the Polish woman Umadevi, who made India her second home</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-narendra-modi-poland-visit-umadevi-wanda-dynowska-india-story-13806799.html</link>
			<description>Wanda Dynowska, born in Russia to Polish nobility, was a woman of multiple names and passions.  A theosophist at heart, she was drawn to Eastern philosophies and travelled extensively.  After establishing herself in Poland, she later made India her second home in 1935. Fluent in several languages, she immersed herself in Indian culture, learning Hindi and Tamil, and translating Hindu scriptures into Polish. A staunch supporter of freedom in both India and Poland, she  worked tirelessly to aid Polish refugees in India during World War II. Recognized by Mahatma Gandhi as “Bearer of Light,” she adopted the name Umadevi and continued her humanitarian work, including assisting Tibetan refugees.  Deeply devoted to spirituality,  Dynowska, who was also known as Tenzin Chodon,  bridged cultural divides, leaving a lasting legacy of kindness and understanding.</description>

			<title>How Starbucks’s new CEO will undertake a 1,600 km super commute to work</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-starbuckss-new-ceo-will-undertake-a-1600-km-super-commute-to-work-13806749.html</link>
			<description>Starbucks' incoming CEO, Brian Niccol, will undertake a significant commute, flying 1,000 miles three times a week from his California home to the Seattle headquarters in a corporate jet.  This arrangement, along with a remote office and additional perks, is part of a substantial compensation package worth approximately $113 million. While Starbucks emphasizes the connection between Niccol's compensation and company performance, the decision has drawn criticism for its environmental implications, with some accusing the company of hypocrisy given its sustainability initiatives. This "super commute" trend among executives is becoming more common, driven by a competitive labor market and the desire to attract top talent.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland marks the first by an Indian leader in 45 years. His first stop is the Jam Saheb of Nawanagar Memorial in Warsaw, dedicated to Jam Saheb Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji, a former Maharaja of Nawanagar. 

Ranjitsinhji, known as the "Good Maharaja" in Poland, is remembered for his humanitarian efforts during World War II. He provided refuge to hundreds of Polish children who were orphaned and displaced due to the war.

The Maharaja welcomed them to Nawanagar, India, offering them a home,  medical care, education, and a sense of belonging. He even sought support from other rulers and organizations to ensure their well-being. 

Years later, Poland honored Ranjitsinhji for his kindness by naming a square after him in Warsaw and awarding him posthumous recognition.  His legacy continues to be celebrated as a testament to compassion and global empathy.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/thane-sexual-abuse-case-mass-protests-and-vandalism-13806750.html</link>
			<description>Two kindergarten girls were allegedly sexually abused by a school attendant in Badlapur, Thane. The incident came to light when one girl complained of pain and later revealed the assault. The accused, Akshay Shinde, was arrested on August 17.  

The parents alleged a 11-hour delay by the police in filing an FIR. This sparked massive protests in Badlapur, with locals vandalizing the school and blocking train services.  

The Maharashtra government has ordered a Special Investigation Team led by IPS officer Arti Singh to probe the case and suspended three police officials. 
The Chief Minister has assured speedy justice and stated that the case will be fast-tracked under the POCSO Act.  

The National Human Rights Commission has also issued notices to the Maharashtra government demanding a detailed report on the case.</description>

			<description>The second night of the Democratic National Convention featured powerful endorsements of Kamala Harris by Barack and Michelle Obama.  Both highlighted Harris' qualifications while delivering scathing critiques of Donald Trump's leadership. They warned against the dangers of another Trump term, emphasizing  the need to move beyond "bluster and chaos." 

The DNC continued its focus on Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda, portraying it as a threat to working families and social progress. Representatives spoke against its proposed policies, painting a picture of potential harm if implemented.  

Adding to the celebratory atmosphere, a lively roll call of states was transformed into a dance party, featuring music representative of each state. Personal endorsements came from former Republicans who expressed disillusionment with Trump and admiration for Harris, aiming to appeal to voters dissatisfied with the former president. Doug Emhoff, Harris' husband, shared a heartfelt tribute, emphasizing her dedication and character, and humanizing her amidst personal attacks.</description>

			<description>The Jagiellonian University in Poland began offering Sanskrit grammar lectures in 1860, establishing a long history of Indological studies. In 1893, the first Sanskrit Chair in Poland was founded, led by Professor Leon MaÅkowski. Subsequent professors, including Andrzej GawroÅski and Helena Willman-Grabowska, further expanded Sanskrit studies and introduced courses on various aspects of Indian culture and languages.  The Indology Department at the University of Warsaw is now the largest center for Indian studies in Central Europe.</description>

			<title>What’s behind the Bharat Bandh today? What is open, what is closed?</title>

			<description>The Reservation Bachao Sangharsh Samiti has called a Bharat Bandh on August 21 to protest the Supreme Court's decision allowing states to create sub-categories within SC/ST reservations.  Organisations like NACADOR and political parties like the JMM, Congress, and RJD support the strike, demanding justice and equity for marginalised communities.  

The Supreme Court's ruling reverses its 2004 decision,  leading to concerns about undermining the reservation principle. While the Samiti calls for a complete shutdown, the impact remains unclear. 

Emergency services, including hospitals, pharmacies, and public transportation, will remain operational. Government offices, banks, and schools will generally function as usual, though some may close in solidarity or switch to online classes. Protests are expected, prompting heightened security in sensitive areas.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pm-narendra-modi-poland-trip-new-delhi-warsaw-ties-ukraine-war-13806539.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Poland marks the first time an Indian Prime Minister has travelled to the country in over four decades.  The trip is significant given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in light of the Russia-Ukraine war.  

Discussions between Modi and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk are expected to focus on defense collaboration, trade, and strategic alignment. The visit also offers an opportunity to strengthen  ties  that had weakened in the post-Cold War era.  Poland, a staunch supporter of Ukraine and a key NATO member, presents India with potential for enhanced military cooperation.  Modi's visit is anticipated to revitalize the relationship between India and Poland.</description>

			<title>Who was Aruna Shanbaug mentioned by the Supreme Court during Kolkata rape-murder case hearing?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/supreme-court-kolkata-rape-murder-case-hearing-aruna-shanbaug-euthanasia-13806612.html</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court mentioned the 1973 case of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse who was brutally sexually assaulted at Mumbai's KEM Hospital. The attack left her in a persistent vegetative state for 42 years.  The perpetrator was convicted but received a lenient sentence.   Shanbaug's case sparked a national debate on euthanasia and highlighted the lack of safety for healthcare professionals, particularly women, who are more susceptible to violence. The case led to the first euthanasia plea in the Supreme Court, which ultimately rejected the request but allowed for passive euthanasia in rare cases. Shanbaug passed away in 2015, her story serving as a reminder of the need for safer workplaces for healthcare workers.</description>

			<title>Why is Switzerland offering Rs 49 lakh to pull ammunition from its lakes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/switzerland-rs-49-lakh-ammunition-lakes-13806561.html</link>
			<description>Switzerland faces a challenge with thousands of tons of old military munitions disposed of in its lakes between 1918 and 1964. These explosives pose risks of environmental contamination and explosions. In response, the Swiss government launched a competition, offering a prize of 50,000 Swiss francs, to find innovative and safe methods for removing the munitions.  The competition seeks to involve academia and industry in finding solutions for this decades-old problem.  The issue is significant, with Lake Lucerne alone estimated to contain 3,300 tonnes of munitions, posing substantial environmental and safety concerns.</description>

			<title>Can Taylor Swift sue Donald Trump for sharing AI-generated endorsement? What does the law say?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-taylor-swift-sue-donald-trump-for-sharing-ai-generated-endorsement-what-does-the-law-say-13806602.html</link>
			<description>Donald Trump used AI-generated images of Taylor Swift to falsely suggest she endorsed him for the 2024 election. Swift has not endorsed any candidate this year and previously opposed Trump in 2020 with strong social media statements against him.  Legal experts believe Swift could sue Trump for using her likeness without permission, potentially violating her right of publicity.  The NO FAKES Act and the ELVIS Act offer legal avenues for Swift, but the effectiveness of these laws in this specific case is unclear.  Some experts suggest that a cease-and-desist letter would be a more practical approach, while others believe a lawsuit might not be worth the cost and effort.</description>

			<title>Excessive screen time can cause ‘digital dementia’. What is this condition?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/excessive-screen-time-can-cause-digital-dementia-what-is-this-condition-13806465.html</link>
			<description>Digital dementia, while not a formally recognized diagnosis, refers to cognitive decline potentially linked to excessive technology use. Studies suggest a correlation between increased screen time and risks of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.  Excessive screen time can negatively impact memory, attention span, learning capacity, and mental health.  Symptoms may mirror those of traditional dementia, such as short-term memory loss and difficulty focusing. 

The constant multitasking and rapid information processing associated with technology overuse may strain cognitive functions. Additionally, blue light emitted from screens can disrupt sleep patterns, further hindering cognitive performance.  


Preventing digital dementia involves managing screen time and engaging in activities that challenge cognitive function.  Limiting passive media consumption, prioritizing real-world interactions, and incorporating brain-boosting activities like puzzles, reading, and learning new skills can help mitigate the potential risks.</description>

			<title>Fashion faux pas: Why Zara has pulled its ‘perfect snack’ T-shirt off shelves</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/zara-perfect-snack-t-shirt-controversy-13806475.html</link>
			<description>Zara faced backlash for a t-shirt marketed towards girls that read "the perfect snack" and featured a strawberry with the phrase "take a bite". 

Mothers on social media criticized the garment, deeming the wording sexually suggestive due to the slang use of "snack" to refer to attractive individuals. Zara subsequently apologized, pulled the shirt from stores and their website, stating their intent was not to imply anything other than the literal meaning of "snack". This incident isn't Zara's first controversy, as the brand has previously faced criticism for advertising campaigns and product designs deemed insensitive or offensive.</description>

			<title>Mpox outbreak: Why has the world reacted so slowly?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/mpox-outbreak-why-has-the-world-reacted-so-slowly-13806537.html</link>
			<description>The current mpox crisis in Congo, which has seen 96% of the world's cases this year, highlights a slow global response to the threat.  While the 2022 outbreak primarily affected gay and bisexual men in wealthier countries, the current strain is disproportionately affecting young people in Congo. Despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, Congo lacks access to these resources due to logistical and political challenges, exacerbating the situation. 

The spread of the new, potentially more infectious strain raises concerns about its potential to reach other countries. Experts warn that Africa's lack of appropriate assistance during the 2022 outbreak has created this situation.  A rapid and coordinated global response is crucial to prevent a wider pandemic.</description>

			<title>How pro-Trump supporters are spreading rumours about Kamala Harris’ ‘drinking problem’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/pro-trump-supporters-spread-rumours-about-kamala-harris-drinking-problem-13806361.html</link>
			<description>Following a surge in support for Kamala Harris, some of Donald Trump's supporters have started to spread rumors about her alleged drinking problem. They point to videos of Harris speaking at rallies and events, claiming her speech patterns and demeanor suggest intoxication. These claims have been widely shared on social media, with some users comparing her to "vodka Pelosi" and speculating about the potential dangers of a drunk Commander-in-Chief.  Supporters of Harris, however, have dismissed these accusations as baseless and sexist.  They argue that the videos do not provide evidence of alcohol consumption and that the attacks are part of a larger pattern of Trump and his allies attempting to discredit her.</description>

			<title>What led to the sinking of the Bayesian superyacht off Italy’s coast?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-led-to-the-sinking-of-the-bayesian-superyacht-off-italy-sicily-coast-13806409.html</link>
			<description>The 56-meter superyacht Bayesian sank off the coast of Sicily, Italy, after being caught in a severe storm.  The yacht, owned by British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, had 22 people on board.  One person died, and six others, including Lynch and his daughter, are still missing. 15 people were rescued.  The Italian coastguard believes the Bayesian was struck by strong winds, possibly exacerbated by its tall mast and potentially a raised lifting keel.  The tragedy raises concerns about yacht safety in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather events in the Mediterranean.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-islamic-preacher-zakir-naik-a-fugitive-in-india-became-malaysias-guest-13806439.html</link>
			<description>Zakir Naik, a controversial Islamic preacher, is the subject of tension between India and Malaysia. Naik fled India in 2016 after being accused of inciting terror and hate speech.  He gained notoriety for remarks supporting Osama bin Laden, advocating for the death penalty for homosexuals and apostates, and defending Islamic State practices. While Malaysia granted Naik permanent residency, India has repeatedly sought his extradition, facing rejections from the Malaysian government. Naik himself claims his words have been misconstrued, stating his intention was never to incite violence or hatred. The issue of Naik's status remains a point of contention between the two nations despite attempts to deepen their strategic ties.</description>

			<title>Top Gear: How Ethiopia has seen a rapid transition to electric vehicles</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ethiopia-rapid-transition-electric-vehicles-13806101.html</link>
			<description>Ethiopia is spearheading a green mobility revolution in Africa by banning gas-powered car imports and promoting electric vehicles (EVs). Driven by abundant hydropower and government incentives, the country has seen a rapid surge in EV adoption, with over 100,000 EVs currently in circulation.  Local manufacturing is also gaining momentum, with companies assembling EVs using imported parts. 

Despite these advancements, economic constraints and the high cost of EVs pose hurdles to widespread adoption. 

The government aims to quadruple EV ownership by 2032 and is investing in electric public transport to make the transition more accessible to all income levels.</description>

They upload pictures of the men to the AI, which estimates their height based on proportions and surroundings.  A venture capitalist, Justine Moore, tested ChatGPT on photos of friends and family and found the estimates to be accurate within an inch. This comes as OKCupid analysis shows men are increasingly exaggerating their height on dating apps, potentially motivated by societal preferences for taller men. Dating experts caution against the use of AI for this purpose, emphasizing the importance of treating people with kindness and remembering the human element in online dating.</description>

			<description>The political turmoil in Bangladesh has significantly impacted tourism in India.  Outbound tourism from Bangladesh has plummeted, with a reported 90% drop in travel due to flight and visa suspensions. 

Though medical tourism from Bangladesh continued to grow in 2023, reaching 449,570 patients, experts predict a potential 10-15% decline in 2024.  

This instability has noticeably affected key Indian tourism hubs like Kolkata, where hotel occupancy has dropped and local businesses reliant on Bangladeshi tourists are suffering.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder case: Why doctors in India are in urgent need for a central protection law</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-india-doctors-central-protection-act-13806125.html</link>
			<description>The recent rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata has reignited the demand for a central law to protect healthcare workers in India.  Instances of violence against doctors in the workplace are widespread, with a study by the Indian Medical Association revealing that over 75% of doctors have faced some form of violence. 

Several factors contribute to this issue, including an overburdened public health system, high healthcare costs, and a lack of trust in the healthcare delivery system. 

While some states have enacted their own laws, the absence of a national framework has led to inconsistencies and loopholes.  Medical professionals are urging the government to create safe zones in healthcare institutions, provide adequate security measures, and ensure that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions.</description>

			<description>The relationship between India and Malaysia is significantly influenced by their trade in palm oil. India is the world's largest importer of palm oil, with Malaysia being one of the primary suppliers.  

Historically, diplomatic issues led to a reduction in palm oil imports from Malaysia to India. However,  the trade relationship has since recovered, with both nations seeking to strengthen cooperation in the palm oil sector. 

They are working together to counter global negativity towards palm oil,  particularly concerns regarding deforestation. This collaboration aims to ensure the continued growth and sustainability of the palm oil trade between the two countries.</description>

			<title>Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago: What to expect</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-presidential-election-democratic-national-convention-kicks-off-in-chicago-what-to-expect-13806014.html</link>
			<description>The Democratic National Convention (DNC) 2024 kicked off in Chicago, marking a historic moment as Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz were formally nominated.  The convention, which runs from August 19th to 22nd, saw President Joe Biden deliver a final address before stepping back from the political stage. The DNC platform highlights ambitious proposals like raising a billionaire income tax, lowering childcare costs, investing in clean energy, and restoring reproductive rights. 

Harris, aiming for a broader appeal, is emphasizing her stance as an advocate for everyday Americans and unveiled an economic policy agenda targeting working-class voters. The convention's notable speakers include former Presidents Barack and Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama, and prominent figures like Jacinda Ardern.  Anticipation remains high as Harris and Walz embark on their journey towards the November election versus Donald Trump.</description>

			<title>Are there vaccines against mpox? How effective are they?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mpox-outbreak-who-vaccines-effectiveness-13806048.html</link>
			<description>Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral infection caused by the monkeypox virus. It spreads through contact with infected individuals, materials, or animals and presents symptoms such as skin lesions, fever, headache, muscle pain, and swollen lymph nodes. 

The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global health emergency due to rising cases in Africa, Sweden, Pakistan, and the Philippines.  While there isn't a specific vaccine for mpox, vaccines developed for smallpox, such as MVA-BN (Jynneos) and ACAM2000, offer cross-protection as both viruses belong to the Orthopoxvirus genus.  

 These vaccines are reported to be around 85% effective against mpox, potentially reducing severity or preventing infection altogether.</description>

			<title>Why is a rail strike looming large over Canada? How could it hurt the economy?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/canada-rail-strike-canadian-national-railway-canadian-pacific-kansas-city-teamsters-union-economy-13806034.html</link>
			<description>A potential strike by the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference on August 22, 2024, could severely disrupt Canada's freight rail system.  Contract negotiations between the union, representing 9,300 engineers, conductors, and other rail workers, and the two largest railway companies,  Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC), have stalled.  

The union accuses the companies of seeking concessions that compromise worker safety, while the companies maintain their offers uphold safety standards and comply with government regulations. 

A strike would have significant economic repercussions, impacting supply chains, particularly for agriculture, and potentially causing billions in losses.  It could also lead to truck rate increases as freight seeks alternative transport methods.  

While the federal government has the power to impose binding arbitration, it has not yet indicated a willingness to intervene, leaving the future of negotiations uncertain.</description>

			<description>In Bengaluru, a 21-year-old college student was sexually assaulted by an unidentified man who offered her a ride home after she reportedly met with an accident while returning from a social gathering. The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday, August 18, near Hosur Main Road. According to the police, the survivor was intoxicated and the suspect, instead of taking her to her destination, took her to an isolated location and assaulted her. He fled when the survivor's friends arrived at the scene. The survivor is currently in stable condition at a private hospital. Bengaluru police have registered a case and formed five teams to apprehend the suspect.  

Police are investigating the incident and are confident of arresting the perpetrator soon.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraine-destroys-second-bridge-in-russia-what-is-kyiv-plan-in-kursk-13805980.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine has intensified its offensive in Russia's Kursk region, destroying two key bridges to disrupt supply lines.  President Zelenskyy aims to create a buffer zone within Russia to protect Ukraine from further attacks. The operation has been successful in advancing Ukrainian forces and capturing territory, boosting morale and demonstrating Ukraine's ability to take the initiative. Zelenskyy has called on Western allies to lift restrictions on long-range weapons, enabling strikes deeper into Russian territory.  Russia's response has been largely reactive, with limited success in organizing a counteroffensive. The situation has escalated tensions, with Belarus warning of potential nuclear consequences and concerns raised about the safety of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder case: The many questions parents of the victim are now asking Mamata Banerjee</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-case-questions-parents-of-the-victim-are-now-asking-mamata-banerjee-13805972.html</link>
			<description>The death of a postgraduate trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Medical College has sparked nationwide protests and raised serious questions about women's safety in West Bengal. The victim's parents have accused Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of suppressing the protests and trying to hush up the case, alleging a double standard in her approach. They claim the police initially tried to pass off the death as a suicide and that the investigation was mishandled. 

The primary suspect is a Kolkata Police volunteer who allegedly confessed to the crime.  The case is now being investigated by the CBI, which is examining call logs and conversations of key individuals, including the former principal of the hospital. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation, with the victim's mother and other groups calling for justice and the resignation of Chief Minister Banerjee.</description>

			<title>Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim to visit India: What are the ties that the two countries share?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/malaysian-pm-anwar-ibrahim-india-countries-ties-relationship-pm-modi-13805357.html</link>
			<description>Malaysia and India established diplomatic relations in 1957, with ties strengthened over the years through numerous high-level visits.  The two nations elevated their relationship to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership in 2015. Malaysia is home to the third-largest Indian diaspora globally. 

Trade between the countries has been steadily increasing, reaching $20 billion in 2022-23, and is expected to grow further. 

Defense cooperation is also a focus, with recent joint exercises and an amendment to the 1993 defense cooperation MoU. 

Tourism is another important dimension, with Malaysia offering visa-free travel to Indians.  

Despite some challenges related to past political statements and the extradition request for Zakir Naik, experts believe Anwar Ibrahim’s visit will contribute to strengthening ties between the two countries.</description>

			<title>Is it safe for children to lift weights? Does it stunt growth?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/is-it-safe-for-children-to-lift-weights-does-it-stunt-growth-13804927.html</link>
			<description>Exercise is important for children's physical and mental health.  Resistance training, which includes weightlifting, is safe for kids as long as proper precautions are taken. Studies show no evidence that resistance training stunts growth.  

On the contrary, it improves strength, power, speed, agility, and endurance.  It can also benefit children who struggle with aerobic activities. Children should get at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily, which can include resistance training three days a week. 

It's important to start slowly and make it fun. As children get older, they can progress to more targeted training and heavier weights. Supervise children, start with lighter weights, and encourage proper technique.</description>

			<title>Mpox outbreak declared a public health emergency: How to prevent it from becoming a global pandemic</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/africa-mpox-outbreak-declared-a-public-health-emergency-how-to-prevent-a-global-pandemic-13804656.html</link>
			<description>The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has declared the mpox outbreak sweeping across Africa a continental public health emergency. This comes after a virulent strain of the disease spread rapidly to 16 countries with six new countries being affected in just 10 days. 

There have been over 15,000 confirmed cases since the start of 2024. Compared to previous years, this clade II strain, much less dangerous, has a 0.1% fatality rate, while the newly prevalent clade I strain has a 3-4% fatality rate, posing a more serious threat, particularly affecting children.  

Experts are concerned about the virus's rapid mutation and spread, exacerbated by a long incubation period and vague initial symptoms, making containment difficult. The shortage of vaccines is a major obstacle, as demand greatly exceeds available supply. 


Key measures to control the outbreak include widespread testing, community education focusing on broader transmission routes, and accelerated development and distribution of vaccines. Urgent action is needed to prevent this epidemic from escalating into a global pandemic.</description>

			<title>Why extreme weather in Pakistan has given rise to 'monsoon brides'</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-extreme-weather-in-pakistan-has-given-rise-to-monsoon-brides-13805367.html</link>
			<description>Since the devastating floods of 2022 in Pakistan, a concerning trend has emerged: "monsoon brides."  Families in rural Sindh, struggling to recover from the floods' economic impact, are marrying off their young daughters to escape poverty.  These marriages often involve men significantly older than the girls. While the families believe they are securing a better future for their daughters, the reality is often harsh. The girls experience limited opportunities and face difficult circumstances, with many returning to live with their parents due to their husbands' unemployment. This trend underscores the vulnerability of young girls in the face of climate-related disasters and the urgent need for sustainable solutions to address poverty and empower women.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-week-in-explainers-mpox-who-global-health-emergency-13805394.html</link>
			<description>The WHO declared mpox a global health emergency, highlighting the spread of the virus beyond its African origins, with cases now reported in Sweden and Pakistan.  

In a stunning move, Ukrainian forces launched a significant incursion into Russian territory, seizing control of dozens of settlements in the Kursk region. This bold counteroffensive has exposed vulnerabilities in Russia's defenses and prompted a warning from President Putin.

Thailand appointed Paetongtarn Shinawatra, daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as its youngest prime minister following the removal of the previous leader.

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation, paving the way for a new leader to take over the ruling party. This decision comes amidst economic challenges and security concerns in the region.</description>

			<description>Doctors across India are on strike, protesting the rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata. This strike has disrupted all non-emergency medical services nationwide. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has made five key demands to the government, focusing on the safety of medical professionals. These demands include a central law to address violence against healthcare workers, improved working and living conditions for resident doctors, enhanced hospital security, fair compensation for the victim's family, and a thorough investigation into the crime and vandalism at RG Kar Hospital. The IMA argues for stronger protections and action to prevent such tragedies in the future.  The Union Health Ministry has held a meeting with doctor representatives, acknowledging their concerns and assuring them of efforts to enhance healthcare worker safety. The ministry has also requested doctors to resume duties in light of rising dengue and malaria cases.</description>

			<title>Who is Tahawwur Rana, the 26/11 Mumbai attacks accused, who can now be extradited to India from the US?</title>

			<description>A US court has ruled that Tahawwur Rana is eligible for extradition to India to face trial for his role in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. The court rejected Rana's appeal based on insufficient evidence and the "non bis in idem" (double jeopardy) clause. 

Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian businessman, was convicted in the US for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks and for supporting a plot to attack a Danish newspaper. According to US authorities, he aided his childhood friend David Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks, by providing him with a cover story and financial support for his surveillance activities in India. 


 India has been seeking Rana's extradition since 2019, and the Biden administration has supported the request.  Rana still has the option to appeal the decision.</description>

			<title>Is India prepared for mpox after it being declared a global health emergency?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-india-prepared-for-mpox-after-it-being-declared-a-global-health-emergency-13805475.html</link>
			<description>India is strengthening its preparedness against mpox following the WHO's global health emergency declaration.  

The country has already witnessed a small number of cases in 2022, primarily from travelers and local transmissions.  

High-level meetings are underway with government agencies and health institutions to review the situation and reinforce precautionary measures. Airports and seaports are being advised to remain vigilant for potential cases. 

While India hasn't reported new cases recently, experts recognize the need for continued vigilance. Existing smallpox and chickenpox vaccines are believed to offer some protection against mpox.
 
The ICMR is actively conducting serosurveys to assess exposure levels and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing a dedicated mpox vaccine.</description>

			<title>Sunita Williams, Barry Wilmore stuck in space: How six months in space alters one’s perception of time</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sunita-williams-barry-wilmore-stuck-in-space-how-six-months-in-space-alters-ones-perception-of-time-13805377.html</link>
			<description>Two NASA astronauts, Commander Barry Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, are currently stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) awaiting a return trip to Earth.  Their original spacecraft, the Boeing Starliner, experienced technical difficulties, leaving their return date uncertain.  

Nasa and Boeing are assessing the Starliner's safety, and a decision could be made soon. If deemed safe, their stay may be short. If not, they face a potential six-month wait. Research suggests that  waiting can be psychologically challenging, distorting our perception of time and increasing stress.  Being busy and having clear information about the situation can help manage the waiting period. Interestingly, studies on people in Antarctica show that constant activity can make time feel like it passes quickly. This might offer hope for the stranded astronauts.</description>

			<description>This week in India, the horrific rape and murder of a junior doctor in Kolkata sparked outrage and nationwide protests. The incident also ignited a political battle between the TMC, BJP, and CPI(M) in West Bengal.  

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Independence Day, emphasizing the need for swift justice in crimes against women. He also highlighted the progress of India's space sector, which was further showcased with the successful launch of the EOS-08 satellite.

Controversy arose when US-based firm Hindenburg accused Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch of a conflict of interest related to Adani Group due to past investments by her husband.  Meanwhile, India's Olympic medalists were welcomed back with celebrations and financial rewards. However, the placement season for MBA graduates from top institutes like IIMs saw a slowdown.</description>

			<title>Jammu and Kashmir to hold polls after a decade. What happened in the last elections?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/jammu-and-kashmir-to-hold-polls-after-a-decade-what-happened-in-the-last-elections-13805405.html</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India has announced that Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be held in three phases, starting September 18th and culminating on October 1st.  This is the first election in the Union Territory since 2014, after a Supreme Court order mandated polls by September 30, 2024. The court also ordered the restoration of statehood.  

The 2014 elections saw the PDP emerge as the single largest party. Following the BJP's withdrawal of support from the PDP-led government in 2018, Governor's Rule was imposed. In 2019,  Jammu and Kashmir's special status was revoked and the state was bifurcated into two Union Territories.</description>

			<title>US records 300,000 child marriages from 2000: Why is it still legal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-records-300000-child-marriages-from-2000-why-is-it-still-legal-13805227.html</link>
			<description>Child marriage remains legal in 37 US states despite global efforts to eradicate it.  Over 300,000 children have been married in the US since 2000, with girls most often targeted.  Legal exceptions like parental consent and judicial approval allow the practice to persist, even in states that have banned child marriage outright. This legal loophole makes it difficult for child brides to escape abusive relationships.  Child marriage has severe consequences for victims, including increased risk of poverty, dropping out of school, and experiencing domestic and sexual violence.  Despite growing momentum to ban child marriage nationwide, opposition from various groups continues to hinder progress.  Advocates argue that a uniform federal law setting a minimum age for marriage is essential to protect minors.</description>

			<title>What is ‘slapped cheek virus’, the contagious disease on the rise in the US?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/what-is-slapped-cheek-virus-the-contagious-disease-on-the-rise-in-the-us-13805262.html</link>
			<description>Parvovirus B19, commonly known as “fifth disease,” is currently experiencing a surge in cases across the US. The virus is known for its distinctive "slapped-cheek" rash, and although it mostly causes mild illness, it poses a risk to pregnant individuals and those with blood disorders. The CDC reports that around 10% of the US population and 40% of children aged 5-9 have recently shown evidence of infection. While most people recover without complications, pregnant women infected with the virus may face risks to their fetus, and individuals with weakened immune systems or blood disorders are at risk for severe complications like anemia. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets, and prevention focuses on handwashing, avoiding close contact with the sick, and for high-risk groups, wearing masks.</description>

			<title>Double whammy for Indian graduates: How IIMs are hiking fees but first pay drops</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iim-graudates-median-salary-jobs-bsuiness-school-fees-13805333.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 batch of graduates from India's leading business schools are facing a challenging job market with stagnant median salaries. Several IIMs, including Kozhikode, Indore, and Lucknow, have reported drops in median pay compared to previous years.  

While IIM Ahmedabad's figures are yet to be released, it still hasn't reached the levels seen in 2023.  Despite a slow placement season, marked by a reduction in offers from consulting firms,  several IIMs, including Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, and Bangalore, managed to achieve 100% placement rates by the final phase.  

However, the overall median salaries remain lower compared to previous years. 

Adding to the financial burden, students are experiencing increased fees at various IIMs, with institutions citing rising operational costs as the reason. This combination of stagnant salaries and increasing fees is putting a financial strain on IIM students.</description>

			<title>Where did the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs come from? We have the answer</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/asteroid-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs-66-years-ago-13805321.html</link>
			<description>A new study sheds light on the origin of the asteroid that  ended the reign of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Researchers analyzed sediment samples and ruthenium isotopes, revealing that the asteroid was a C-type, carbonaceous asteroid that formed beyond Jupiter's orbit. This finding refutes earlier theories suggesting a cometary origin and highlights the rare nature of such impacts. The study's findings could be crucial in understanding Earth's water origins and in assessing future asteroid threats.</description>

			<description>A recent survey by India's National Medical Commission revealed alarming statistics about the mental health of medical students.  The survey found that 27.8% of undergraduate students and 31.23% of postgraduate students reported experiencing suicidal thoughts.  Factors contributing to these issues include  a lack of access to mental health services, stigma surrounding mental health,  stressful working conditions, and financial instability. The survey also highlighted concerns about  inadequate living conditions, faculty support, and  the  rural service bond policy.  The report calls for immediate action, recommending measures such as providing 24/7 mental health support, improving living conditions,  reducing working hours, standardizing pay scales, and establishing mentor-mentee programs.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder: How RG Kar incident has spurred a political blame game in Bengal</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-doctor-rape-murder-rg-kar-vandalism-tmc-bjp-politial-blame-game-west-bengal-13805215.html</link>
			<description>A young trainee doctor's rape and murder in Kolkata has triggered a political blame game in West Bengal. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) blames the opposition BJP and CPI(M) for inciting violence at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where the incident occurred. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claims the vandalism was carried out by "outsiders" and accuses the opposition of attempting to defame Bengal.  She further alleges a coordinated effort to politicize the issue and draw comparisons to Bangladesh. 

The opposition parties, however, criticize the TMC government's handling of the case, demanding Banerjee's resignation and questioning the alleged cover-up. The BJP accuses TMC goons of being behind the vandalism and calls for deployment of central forces at the hospital. The CPI(M) and CPI also condemn the violence and blame the TMC government for the  unsafe environment for doctors .

As protests erupt in Bengal, Banerjee plans to lead a rally demanding the death penalty for the accused while opposition parties hold their own demonstrations over the incident.</description>

			<title>From Africa to Sweden and now Pakistan, how mpox is spreading across the globe</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/mpox-africa-spreading-across-the-globe-sweden-pakistan-13805159.html</link>
			<description>Mpox, a viral infection related to smallpox, has been declared a global health emergency by the WHO.  The current outbreak is the worst ever in Africa, with over 27,000 cases and 1,100 deaths since January 2023.  A new, more easily transmissible variant, clade Ib, is driving the spread, particularly in central and west Africa.  

Symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle aches, and a characteristic rash that can progress to pustules and scabs. While usually mild, mpox can be fatal in some cases.  

The WHO is concerned about the virus spreading beyond Africa, with cases recently reported in Sweden and Pakistan.  There is no vaccine specifically for mpox, although the smallpox vaccine is licensed for use in severe cases.  Current efforts are focused on controlling the outbreak in Africa through vaccination, isolation, and public health measures.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-uk-challenger-2-tanks-are-helping-ukraine-in-kursk-incursion-13805171.html</link>
			<description>British Challenger 2 tanks have been deployed in Ukraine's cross-border raid into Russia's Kursk Oblast. This marks a significant escalation in the conflict, showcasing Ukraine's growing military capabilities. While the tanks are known for their durability and firepower, they face challenges in Ukraine's terrain and logistical constraints.  Their heavyweight and dated design limit mobility, and their unique ammunition type presents logistical hurdles. Reports suggest only a handful remain operational, with concerns about repair delays and low readiness levels. Despite these challenges, the deployment holds symbolic and tactical value, demonstrating Ukraine's offensive capabilities and potentially impacting the psychological warfare aspect of the conflict.</description>

			<title>Matthew Perry’s death: Who is the ‘Ketamine Queen’ charged in FRIENDS star’s demise?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/matthew-perry-death-who-is-the-ketamine-queen-charged-in-friends-star-demise-13805131.html</link>
			<description>The death of Matthew Perry, star of the sitcom "Friends," has led to a criminal investigation uncovering a network involved in drug distribution and exploitation. Perry's assistant, two doctors, and a drug dealer known as the "Ketamine Queen" have been charged. Authorities allege that these individuals conspired to supply Perry with ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, contributing to his death.  The investigation revealed that Perry's fight with addiction led him to seek ketamine treatment, but when his doctors refused to increase his dosage, he turned to illegal sources. The "Ketamine Queen", Jasveen Sangha, is accused of being the primary supplier, and faces the most serious charges, including conspiracy to distribute ketamine and maintaining a drug-involved premises. Perry's death has sparked a wider investigation into the illegal ketamine trade and the individuals who profit from it.</description>

			<title>Can ousted PM Sheikh Hasina be extradited from India to Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-ousted-pm-sheikh-hasina-extradition-treaty-india-13805102.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's interim government is considering requesting India's extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled the country amid protests and now faces multiple accusations, including murder and enforced disappearance.  Bangladesh and India have an extradition treaty since 2013, allowing the exchange of convicts or undertrials. However, the treaty's applicability to Hasina's case is debated, as it may not cover political asylum seekers. 

India is in a delicate position, balancing its long-standing ties with Hasina and the need to maintain good relations with the current Bangladesh administration. Extradition could strain ties with Bangladesh and potentially fuel anti-India sentiment.</description>

			<title>Quicksplained: What is the famous Leheriya print turban donned by PM Modi for I-Day address?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/quicksplained-pm-narendra-modi-independence-day-speech-leheriya-print-turban-13804922.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation from the Red Fort on India's 78th Independence Day. He  spoke about national development and the theme of "Viksit Bharat 2047."  A highlight of the event was Modi wearing a multi-coloured Leheriya print turban, a traditional Rajasthani textile with distinctive wavy patterns. This craft, employing a tie-dye technique, emerged in the 17th century and was originally patronized by the royal courts. 


Leheriya, signifying prosperity, has become a symbol of Rajasthani culture and is worn during festivals and special occasions.  Modi's choice of attire reflects his appreciation for Indian heritage and craftsmanship.</description>

			<title>Who is Oleksandr Syrski, Ukraine’s ‘butcher’, in-charge of the Kursk incursion in Russia?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraine-incursion-russia-kursk-general-oleksandr-syrski-butcher-13804903.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine has launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region, capturing over 1,000 square kilometers of territory and 74 towns and settlements.  

The operation,  orchestrated by Ukraine's top military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, marks the deepest Ukrainian penetration into Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.   

Syrskyi, nicknamed "the butcher," is a veteran commander with extensive battlefield experience who led the defense of Kyiv and the successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv in 2022. 

President Zelenskyy has stated that Ukraine's strategic goals are being achieved in the Kursk region, but emphasized that Kyiv does not intend to hold onto the captured territory and offered to cease raids in exchange for a "just peace" from Russia. 

Russia has condemned the incursion as an act of aggression and vowed a "tough response." While redeploying troops to the Kursk region, Moscow is unlikely to significantly divert  forces from its eastern front lines.  The incursion has been seen as a symbolic blow to President Putin, highlighting vulnerabilities in Russian defenses and challenging his narrative of strength.</description>

			<title>Independence Day 2024: Why PM Modi did away with tradition of bullet-proof glass for Red Fort speech</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-why-pm-modi-did-away-with-tradition-of-bullet-proof-glass-for-red-fort-speech-13804657.html</link>
			<description>The tradition of prime ministers addressing the nation on Independence Day from behind bulletproof glass began after Indira Gandhi's assassination in 1984.  This security measure continued for three decades, with each PM using varying degrees of protection. In 2014, Narendra Modi broke with this tradition, choosing to deliver his speech without any physical barriers.  He felt that Independence Day was a people's festival and wanted a direct connection with his audience.  This decision, made despite intelligence warnings, was met with surprise and concern from security officials who had to ramp up security measures extensively.</description>

			<title>How Tamil Nadu’s M Karunanidhi championed rights of CMs to hoist Tricolour on I-Day</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-independence-day-tamil-nadu-m-karunanidhi-cms-hoist-national-flag-13804579.html</link>
			<description>India is celebrating its 78th Independence Day, marking the country's freedom from British rule in 1947.  

While the Prime Minister hoists the flag at the Red Fort, the right for Chief Ministers to do the same in their states was granted in 1974. This was due to the efforts of DMK leader M Karunanidhi who, in a battle for state autonomy, argued that elected Chief Ministers should have the same privilege as the Prime Minister.  

Karunanidhi's persistent campaigning, including letters to then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, led to the government's acceptance of his suggestion. As a result, Karunanidhi became the first Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to unfurl the national flag at Fort St. George on Independence Day, 1974. This change was significant as it reinforced the autonomy of states within India's federal structure.Karunanidhi, known for his strong advocacy for Dravidian rights, viewed this as a step towards respecting state identities within a united India.</description>

			<title>Thai court removes PM Srettha Thavisin over ethics breach. What happens next?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/thai-court-removes-pm-srettha-thavisin-over-ethics-breach-what-happens-next-13804566.html</link>
			<description>Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been removed from office by the Constitutional Court for an ethics violation. The court ruled that Srettha's appointment of a Cabinet member with a past conviction for bribery was dishonest. Though the former minister had served his sentence, the court found that Srettha, as prime minister, bore responsibility for vetting nominations and had breached ethical standards. 

Srettha had maintained that his appointment was legitimate and that he couldn't have anticipated this ruling. His removal comes after a tumultuous period in Thai politics, which has seen the dissolving of the progressive Move Forward Party and numerous challenges to the Pheu Thai party.  


Thailand's parliament will now convene to choose a new prime minister from a pre-submitted list of candidates.

			<title>Iran promised a 'harsh punishment' against Israel: What is behind the delayed attack?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iran-promised-a-harsh-punishment-against-israel-what-is-behind-the-delayed-attack-13804449.html</link>
			<description>Iran has vowed revenge for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, sparking tensions in West Asia. However, Tehran has yet to respond, likely due to strategic considerations. Iran's new government is balancing displays of strength with diplomatic and economic factors, and officials are wary of a major conflict.  Experts suggest Iran might aim for a symbolic or limited strike to deter further aggression while maintaining the option for future negotiations. The international community, particularly the US, is closely monitoring the situation with fears of escalation, urging Iran to de-escalate and deploying additional military assets to the region.</description>

			<description>The murder of a 31-year-old trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata has sparked outrage and scrutiny over the handling of the case by Dr Sandip Ghosh, the former principal.  

Dr Ghosh, facing allegations of mismanagement and attempting to downplay the incident as suicide, initially resisted calls for his resignation. After public pressure mounted, he resigned, but the West Bengal government swiftly reinstated and transferred him to another medical college. This move has been met with more protests and criticism, leading the Calcutta High Court to order a CBI investigation and Dr Ghosh to go on leave. The court also questioned the government's decision to reinstate him, calling it "difficult to comprehend."</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/swat-teams-ai-powered-systems-what-goes-into-securing-new-delhi-independence-day-13804416.html</link>
			<description>New Delhi is under heightened security as the nation prepares for the 78th Independence Day celebrations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation from the Red Fort. Over 10,000 police personnel, including snipers, SWAT commandos, and sharpshooters, have been deployed across the city. Additional forces are stationed at key locations like airports, railway stations, and markets. 

The security perimeter around the Red Fort has been designated as a "no kite flying zone," and advanced AI-powered security systems, including CCTV cameras with facial and number plate recognition, have been installed for enhanced surveillance.  A two-step frisking process is in place at Delhi Metro stations. Traffic restrictions and diversions are also in effect. 
 
Following reports of potential threats from anti-India elements, security agencies are on high alert. The Delhi Police recently apprehended a suspect linked to the ISIS Pune module, who was believed to be involved in reconnaissance for potential attacks on VIPs in the Delhi-NCR area.</description>

			<title>What are MQ-9B drones that India is pushing to buy from US? How soon before New Delhi gets them?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/mq-9b-drones-india-us-deal-game-changer-defence-boost-13804435.html</link>
			<description>India is rapidly pushing forward with a deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B drones from the US, aiming to finalize the agreement by November or December.  The drones, manufactured by General Atomics, will bolster India's military capabilities at a time of heightened tensions with neighbors China and Pakistan. The deal includes 15 SeaGuardians for the Navy and eight SkyGuardians each for the Army and Air Force. 

The MQ-9B, also known as the "hunter-killer" drone, is a sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicle capable of long-endurance surveillance, carrying various weapons, and operating in harsh weather conditions.  Its acquisition is seen as a significant step in enhancing India's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, particularly in the Indian Ocean Region and along its land borders.</description>

			<title>Will a new round of Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks culminate in a deal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-a-new-round-of-israel-hamas-ceasefire-talks-culminate-in-a-deal-13804408.html</link>
			<description>International mediators are attempting to restart ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas to end the 10-month conflict and secure the release of hostages. 

Despite a proposed three-phase plan backed by the US, key issues remain unresolved. Israel is concerned about the duration of the initial ceasefire and Hamas' potential stalling tactics. Hamas fears Israel might resume hostilities after releasing vulnerable hostages and is wary of additional Israeli demands. 

The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and a top Hezbollah commander further complicates the situation, escalating regional tensions and diverting attention from ceasefire efforts.  Both Netanyahu and Hamas' new leader, Yahya Sinwar, face political pressures that could impede negotiations.</description>

			<title>I-Day controversy: Why AAP's Kailash Gahlot not Atishi will hoist the flag in Delhi</title>

			<description>Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, currently in jail, proposed that his Education Minister, Atishi, hoist the national flag at the Independence Day event. However, the General Administration Department deemed this decision legally invalid, stating that Kejriwal cannot authorize someone else to do so in his place. The department cited prison rules and said the CM's communication was an abuse of privileges. 

Lt Governor VK Saxena then nominated Delhi Home Minister Kailash Gahlot to hoist the flag, which has heightened tensions between the AAP and the LG.  The AAP views this as an attempt to undermine the elected government, while the LG's office maintains that they are following proper procedures.</description>

			<title>Why is August 15 National Mourning Day in Bangladesh? Why has interim government scrapped the holiday?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-crisis-sheikh-hasina-august-15-national-mourning-day-holiday-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-assassination-13804370.html</link>
			<description>In a statement issued after leaving the country, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged the people to observe August 15 as "National Mourning Day" to commemorate the assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This request came shortly after the interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, decided to cancel the national holiday for the day. August 15 marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president, and his family members.   

The decision to scrap the holiday has been met with mixed reactions, with some attributing it to the public anger directed at Hasina and the recent violence that included the desecration of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and the toppling of Rahman's statue.</description>

			<title>Independence Day 2024: Why Pakistan celebrates freedom a day before India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-pakistan-august-14-day-freedom-india-13803847.html</link>
			<description>Both India and Pakistan gained independence on August 15, 1947, according to the Indian Independence Act.  Pakistan's founding father, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, affirmed August 15 as Pakistan's Independence Day in his historic address. Historical records, including Jinnah's oath-taking ceremony and Pakistan's first postage stamps, corroborate this. 

Due to logistical constraints during the power transfer, Viceroy Lord Mountbatten officially handed over power to Pakistan in Karachi on August 14, but this does not change the legal date of independence.  

Pakistan shifted its Independence Day to August 14 in 1948, likely to distinguish itself from India. This decision was likely made by political leaders aiming to establish  a unique national identity for the newly formed country.</description>

			<description>New Zealand is experiencing a record number of citizens leaving the country. From the start of 2024 to June, 80,174 citizens departed, almost double the pre-pandemic levels.  Economic factors like high unemployment, persistent interest rates, and sluggish growth are driving this exodus. Many are seeking opportunities in Australia, which has a strong economy and offers relocation packages for in-demand professions. The declining number of new arrivals adds to this trend, suggesting a potential shift in New Zealand's attractiveness as a destination.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-there-a-crackdown-on-air-conditioners-in-italys-portofino-13804243.html</link>
			<description>Portofino, a picturesque Italian coastal village, is facing a battle against air conditioners. 

Known for its stunning harbor and luxury lifestyle, Portofino is also a regional park subject to strict regulations.  While a ban on ACs once existed, it has recently been relaxed to permit installations with official approval and discreet placement.

Current scorching temperatures have prompted residents to secretly install AC units, leading to neighborly tensions and a police crackdown.  The mayor aims to preserve Portofino's aesthetic beauty and environmental integrity, emphasizing the need for discretion and adherence to regulations. Those caught installing units without permission face hefty fines, adding to the controversy surrounding this unexpected conflict.</description>

			<description>The UK is home to 971 Indian-owned firms that employ over 118,000 people and generate $87 billion in revenue. These companies paid $1.5 billion in corporation taxes, a significant increase from previous years.  

Indian financial services firms have also made inroads, with six percent of tracked companies falling into this category.  Prominent Indian-owned firms in the UK include the St James Court Hotel, EET fuels, and several major pharmaceutical companies.

			<title>From the sepoy mutiny to Quit India, the key movements that shaped India’s freedom struggle</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/from-the-sepoy-mutiny-to-quit-india-the-key-movements-that-shaped-indias-freedom-struggle-13804095.html</link>
			<description>India's path to independence was paved by a series of pivotal struggles. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, triggered by British policies and religious sensitivities, marked the first major uprising against colonial rule. The Swadeshi Movement, sparked by the partition of Bengal, promoted Indian-made goods and fostered national identity. Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha, a campaign of non-violent resistance against oppressive land laws, established Satyagraha as a cornerstone of the independence struggle.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, sought to weaken British rule through mass civil disobedience, culminating in the Salt Satyagraha, a dramatic act of defiance against the salt tax. The Quit India Movement of 1942, with its resounding "Do or Die" call, intensified the pressure for independence, ultimately leading to India's freedom on August 15th, 1947.</description>

			<title>How are Yemen's Houthi rebels driving up coffee prices in Europe?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-are-yemens-houthi-rebels-driving-up-coffee-prices-in-europe-13804191.html</link>
			<description>The price of coffee in Europe has seen a substantial increase, driven by a combination of geopolitical events, climate change, and new regulations. Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea have disrupted shipping routes, leading to higher transport costs. The war in Ukraine has further exacerbated the situation by impacting fertilizer supplies and energy prices. Climate change has also played a role, with adverse weather events causing decreased coffee yields in major producing countries. New EU regulations aimed at curbing deforestation have added to the burden on coffee producers, increasing costs and uncertainties. While production is expected to be in surplus next year, the long-term outlook is uncertain due to the ongoing threat of climate change on coffee cultivation.</description>

			<title>Ukraine's incursion into Russia: Why are Ukrainian vehicles marked with white triangles?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraines-incursion-into-russia-why-are-ukrainian-vehicles-marked-with-white-triangles-13804213.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region, marking the biggest cross-border attack since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured 28 settlements and control 1,000 square kilometers of territory. 

The operation, shrouded in secrecy, utilizes white triangles as markings on vehicles, distinguishing friendly forces.  This tactic mirrors Russia's use of the "Z" symbol during the invasion.  Analysts believe the incursion aims to stretch Russian resources, inflict losses, and demonstrate Ukraine's offensive capability.  It also serves as a symbolic reminder that the war has reached Russian soil.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-case-doctors-strike-patients-suffer-opd-services-admission-surgeries-13804149.html</link>
			<description>Junior doctors across India are on strike, demanding justice for a 31-year-old junior doctor who was raped and murdered at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.  

They are also pushing for better security measures in hospitals. The strike has significantly disrupted healthcare services, with OPDs closed and elective surgeries postponed, causing immense inconvenience to patients.  The horrifying details of the doctor’s death, including evidence of strangulation and severe injuries, have fueled the anger and frustration of medical professionals. 

Protests have erupted in various cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, with doctors demanding a fast-track investigation into the crime and the resignation of authorities they believe are responsible for inadequate security. They underscore the urgent need for improved safety protocols in hospitals and a stronger legal framework to protect healthcare workers from violence. 

The indefinite strike has left patients struggling to access essential medical care, highlighting a critical issue within the healthcare system.</description>

			<title>Explained: Why are multinational corporations fleeing Pakistan?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-why-are-multinational-corporations-fleeing-pakistan-13804087.html</link>
			<description>Multinational corporations are leaving Pakistan in large numbers due to a multitude of factors. Economic instability, a complex regulatory environment, high taxation, and political turmoil are all contributing to a decline in investor confidence. Companies like TotalEnergies, Telenor, and Shell Oil have  already scaled back or exited the Pakistani market,  highlighting the severity of the situation. This trend raises concerns about Pakistan's future ability to attract foreign direct investment and its overall economic prospects. 

To reverse this exodus, Pakistan needs to create a more stable and predictable business environment.  This requires addressing issues such as regulatory uncertainty, repatriation of profits, and political instability.  Without these changes, Pakistan risks further economic decline and continued disillusionment among foreign investors.</description>

			<title>Iran is set to attack Israel. Here’s how it could go down</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/iran-is-set-to-attack-israel-heres-how-it-could-go-down-13804112.html</link>
			<description>Iran is reported to be planning a retaliation attack against Israel following the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.  

The US has heightened its military presence in the region, deploying a missile submarine and an aircraft carrier strike group. Experts believe Iran will likely launch a drone and missile attack similar to the one it carried out in April, but may limit the scale to avoid escalating into a full-scale war. Some analysts suggest Iran might coordinate its response with Hezbollah.

While Iran insists its retaliation is unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire, international pressure is mounting to prevent a wider conflict. Experts say both sides may strive to avoid a major confrontation, while also seeking to demonstrate their strength and deter future aggression. Iran's actions are perceived to be aimed at signaling its unwavering resolve and capability.</description>

			<description>The death of a trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata has sparked outrage.

			<description>This viral video shows cars in China with bulging exteriors, resembling "pregnant" vehicles. The phenomenon is not due to manufacturing defects but the extreme heatwave gripping the country. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures weakens the adhesive backing of car wraps, causing them to bubble and swell. Experts advise using high-quality wraps with strong adhesives and seeking shade to prevent this issue. While seemingly comical, these "pregnant cars" highlight the growing impact of climate change on everyday life, showcasing the unpredictable consequences of extreme weather events.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/as-the-olympic-flame-extinguishes-what-awaits-macron-in-france-political-quagmire-13804019.html</link>
			<description>The Paris Olympics ended on a high note, offering a brief respite from France’s ongoing political divisions.  President Macron, however, faces  significant challenges as he returns to a hung parliament and pressing budgetary concerns. 

Forming a stable government and appointing a new prime minister are immediate priorities. Macron must also address the looming budget crisis, requiring a credible financial plan to avoid penalties from the European Commission. 

Despite the successful Olympics, which showcased national unity, Macron's approval ratings remain low and political opposition is likely to intensify. The coming months will be crucial for Macron and his ability to steer France through these turbulent times.</description>

			<title>Liquid water found on Mars: Does this mean there could be life on the Red Planet?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/liquid-water-mars-nasa-insight-lander-13804052.html</link>
			<description>Scientists have discovered evidence of a vast reservoir of liquid water on Mars, hidden deep within the planet's outer crust. This finding, based on seismic data from NASA's InSight Lander, suggests that the volume of water may exceed that of ancient Martian oceans.  The water is believed to be trapped in cracks of igneous rock approximately seven to twelve miles beneath the surface. While this discovery doesn't confirm the existence of life on Mars, it significantly improves our understanding of the planet's history and raises the possibility of habitable environments in its subsurface.</description>

			<title>Who is Faiz Hameed, former ISI chief, who has been arrested by Pakistan army? What are the charges against him?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/faiz-hameed-former-pakistan-isi-chief-arrested-charges-13804041.html</link>
			<description>This article reports on the unprecedented arrest and court-martial proceedings initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the former chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).  Hameed's arrest stems from allegations of misconduct in a housing scheme scandal known as the Top City case. 

He is accused of extortion and misuse of authority during his tenure as ISI chief. The Pakistani Supreme Court ordered an investigation into the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest and the commencement of court-martial proceedings.

His arrest is seen as a significant development, signifying a crackdown on allies of former Prime Minister Imran Khan and a warning to those who might attempt to weaken the military establishment.</description>

The attack aimed to take the platform offline by overwhelming it with traffic.

Despite the technical difficulties, the interview ultimately took place and covered topics like Trump's interactions with world leaders and his critique of Democrats' policies.</description>

			<description>Donald Trump made numerous inaccurate or misleading claims during a conversation with Elon Musk on X. He exaggerated border crossing numbers, misrepresented Vice President Kamala Harris's role, and made unsubstantiated claims about other countries releasing criminals into the US.  Trump's assertions on energy policy, the economy, and climate change were also flawed, including downplaying the threat of rising sea levels and inflating inflation rates.  He continued to make false claims about the 2020 election and the Biden administration's targeting of him politically. Additionally, Trump provided inaccurate information about nuclear weapon possession and misrepresented the amount of aid European countries have provided to Ukraine.</description>

			<title>‘Why is he lisping?’: How the Trump-Musk chat has raised questions about ex-US president’s health</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/donald-trump-elon-musk-interview-lisping-voice-slurring-health-concerns-us-presidential-elections-13803976.html</link>
			<description>Elon Musk and Donald Trump recently had a two-hour interview on X, which garnered attention for Trump's apparent lisp. Many viewers commented on his speech, sparking discussions and speculation about his health.  The lisp raised concerns about Trump's fitness for office, especially considering his age (78) and previous health questions.  A recent survey showed that a majority of Americans believe Trump is too old to run for president.  Despite assurances from his doctor and Trump's own claims of vitality, there's a lack of transparency regarding Trump's health status.  This lack of information contrasts with his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whose age is less of a concern for the Democratic Party.</description>

			<description>Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a long-awaited conversation plagued by technical difficulties. While the discussion yielded little insight into Trump's second-term plans, several notable themes emerged. Trump's speech patterns drew attention, with some comparisons made to President Biden's stutter.  He suggested a potential role for Musk in his administration, praising his efficiency and proposing Musk join a government efficiency commission.  Trump reiterated his desire to abolish the Department of Education and voiced his support for establishing an Iron Dome-style missile defense system in the US, similar to Israel's. 

The interaction also included Trump's praise for world leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un, acknowledging their toughness and strategic acumen. Finally, Trump's return to X (formerly Twitter) ahead of the interview signifies a potential boost in his reach and communication platform.</description>

			<title>Greece wildfires spread: What's behind the deadly blazes?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/greece-wildfires-spread-whats-behind-the-deadly-blazes-13803881.html</link>
			<description>A massive wildfire raging outside Athens forced the evacuation of thousands of residents. Fueled by strong winds, the blaze has burned homes and sent plumes of smoke over the capital. Greece has requested assistance from European countries, with numerous nations sending fire-fighting resources. Experts attribute the severity of the fire to Greece's hot and dry weather combined with climate change, which has increased the frequency and intensity of wildfires in the Mediterranean region.  The country has faced record high temperatures this summer, further exacerbating the situation.</description>

			<title>Red, yellow, green and white? Why traffic lights could be getting a new colour</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/red-yellow-green-and-white-why-traffic-lights-could-be-getting-a-new-colour-13803832.html</link>
			<description>Experts propose adding a fourth colour, white, to traffic lights to accommodate driverless cars.  Autonomous vehicles would be better able to respond to a single white light compared to human drivers who rely on a system of red, yellow, and green. The new system could involve driverless cars communicating with each other and computers, with a white light signaling to human drivers that it is safe to follow the leading self-driving vehicle. This could potentially reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency.</description>

			<title>After the Paris Games, comes the ‘Olympic comedown’ for athletes. What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/after-the-paris-games-comes-the-olympic-comedown-for-athletes-what-is-it-13803793.html</link>
			<description>The end of the Olympic Games often brings a sense of emptiness, known as "Olympic comedown," for athletes. This phenomenon stems from the abrupt shift from a high-pressure, highly stimulating environment to the normalcy of everyday life. 

Athletes experience a decrease in adrenaline, which they get from training and competition, leading to feelings similar to withdrawal.  They also face an existential crisis as their identity, largely defined by their sport, is challenged.  

It's crucial for athletes to prepare mentally and physically for this transition.  Recognizing and accepting the end of the competition cycle, taking time to celebrate achievements, and engaging in enjoyable activities outside of sport are essential coping mechanisms.</description>

			<title>Why has Kamala Harris’ laugh become a subject of debate in US election?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-has-kamala-harris-laugh-become-a-subject-of-debate-in-us-election-13803790.html</link>
			<description>Trump and Republicans are targeting Kamala Harris' laugh, using derogatory nicknames like "Laughing Kamala" to undermine her. They claim her laughter is inappropriate and try to portray her as unhinged. This tactic is reminiscent of past attacks on women in power, such as Hillary Clinton's "cackle," which were criticized as misogynistic. 

Experts suggest that voters are more aware of such tactics today. Some argue that Harris' laughter is a display of strength and authenticity, contrasting with Trump's perceived lack of humor and emotional control. Supporters view it as a joyful expression, while critics perceive it as unprofessional and unbecoming of a leader.</description>

			<title>Was statue of Pakistan army’s surrender in 1971 Liberation War in Bangladesh vandalised?</title>

			<description>Congress MP Shashi Tharoor claimed that statues at a memorial complex in Bangladesh depicting the Pakistani army's surrender to the Indian Army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War have been "destroyed" by "anti-India vandals." He cited images appearing to show broken statues. However, this claim has been challenged, with some pointing out that the statues themselves are designed to depict people lying down as a symbol of the atrocities committed during the war. They argue that the images shared by Tharoor show the intended artistic representation, not vandalism.</description>

			<title>Independence Day 2024: How India and Pakistan divided money, military and an elephant amid partition</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-india-pakistan-assets-partition-13803755.html</link>
			<description>The Partition of India in 1947 led to a massive task of dividing assets between India and Pakistan. A committee, the Partition Council, was formed with representatives from both sides to oversee the division. 

A significant challenge was splitting the military, with two-thirds staying in India and one-third going to Pakistan. The division was not without its tensions, as exemplified by the case of the Brigade of Gurkhas and the exchange of troops between units. 

Financial assets were divided according to the Partition agreement, with Pakistan receiving 17.5%. The process of exchanging currency and settling debts proved complex and controversial, with both countries claiming outstanding payments. Beyond military and financial assets, movable assets like furniture and even light bulbs were divided in an 80-20 ratio. 

Even animals were included in the division, as illustrated by the case of Joymoni, an elephant whose ownership was a subject of dispute.  The Partition Council successfully navigated these intricate challenges, ultimately achieving a division of assets despite the complexities and difficulties inherent in the process.</description>

			<title>All that glitters is not gold: What’s the real value of an Olympic medal?</title>

			<description>Olympic medals, while symbolizing athletic excellence, hold a surprisingly modest intrinsic value.  The Paris 2024 gold medal, for example, contains only 6 grams of gold and is valued at around $1,027. While the material value is relatively low, the historical significance and the stories connected to these medals can drive their auction prices to millions.  Examples include medals from Jesse Owens, Bob Beamon, and Luz Long, which have fetched impressive sums at auctions, highlighting the enduring legacy and cultural impact of Olympic achievements.</description>

			<title>World Elephant Day: How railway tracks have become graveyards for jumbos in India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/world-elephant-day-indian-railway-tracks-jumbos-death-13803684.html</link>
			<description>India is home to a significant population of Asian elephants, but these majestic creatures face a growing threat from train collisions. In the past decade, at least 200 elephants have perished in such accidents. 

To address this issue, authorities are implementing various safety measures.  Tamil Nadu has deployed an AI-based surveillance system to alert authorities of elephant movement near tracks, while the national government plans to roll out a similar system across a 700-km stretch. States are also constructing wildlife overpasses to provide safe passage for elephants. 

Despite these efforts, challenges remain.  The vast network of Indian Railways, coupled with development priorities, frequently intersects with elephant corridors, increasing the risk of collisions. Experts suggest further measures such as reducing night-time train operations, ensuring adequate food and water within forests, and implementing strict speed controls in areas prone to accidents.</description>

			<description>The escalating violence against Hindus in Bangladesh following the ousting of Sheikh Hasina has sparked international concern. Protests demanding justice and protection materialized in both the US and the UK, with demonstrators highlighting the attacks on temples, businesses, and homes, as well as the killing of two prominent Hindu leaders.

In Bangladesh, rallies drew sizable crowds, with people protesting the attacks and urging the interim government to address the situation. The government has expressed concern, promised to investigate, and pledged financial aid to the affected families, but has also issued warnings against the spread of misinformation.  

Meanwhile, prominent Indian-American lawmakers have called for an end to the violence and emphasized the need to hold perpetrators accountable.  They urged the US government to take a proactive role in ensuring the safety of minorities in Bangladesh.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-ukraine-incursion-of-kursk-has-left-putin-humiliated-13803631.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine launched a surprise cross-border attack into Russia's Kursk region, pushing nearly 1,000 troops supported by tanks and artillery deep into Russian territory.  The operation has caught Russia off guard, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate and prompting the Kremlin to declare a state of emergency. Ukrainian forces have captured strategic positions, destroying Russian military vehicles and inflicting casualties. 

The incursion has been hailed as a success by Ukraine, showcasing their military capability and boosting morale.  It has also exposed weaknesses in Russia's border defenses and dealt a blow to Putin's image of invincibility. While Ukraine's plans remain unclear, the operation has already achieved significant strategic objectives by diverting Russian resources and highlighting Ukraine's resilience.</description>

			<title>What are the new allegations Hindenburg has levelled against Sebi chief and Adani?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hindenburg-research-sebi-chief-madhabi-puri-buch-allegations-adani-group-13803652.html</link>
			<description>The ongoing Hindenburg vs Adani Group saga intensifies with fresh allegations from Hindenburg Research. The US-based firm claims that Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband, Dhaval Buch, had stakes in offshore entities linked to the Adani family, potentially constituting a conflict of interest. 

Hindenburg cites "whistleblower documents" to support its claim, alleging that these funds were used for financial irregularities within the Adani Group. Sebi chief Madhabi Buch and her husband vehemently deny the allegations, asserting the transparency of their financial dealings and highlighting that their investments predate Buch's appointment at Sebi. They claim they sold off their stakes in 2018 upon the CIO's departure from the fund and reiterate their commitment to ethical conduct, labelling Hindenburg's accusations as baseless.  

The Hindenburg report, however, raises concerns about a potential conflict of interest given Buch's role in overseeing investigations related to the Adani Group. This new development has triggered a decline in Adani Group stocks, with investors losing billions of rupees amid market uncertainty.</description>

			<description>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will visit Russia from August 12 to 14, his first trip since 2021. Ties between the two nations date back to 1974, when the Palestinian Liberation Organisation opened a branch in Moscow. Russia has consistently supported the two-state solution and a Palestinian state, while maintaining a neutral stance as a mediator in the region. However,  Recent events, including Russia's support for Hamas and its strained relationship with Israel, have raised questions about its ability to effectively mediate. 

Abbas' visit aims to discuss the latest international developments, coordinate positions, and strengthen bilateral relations.</description>

			<description>St. Martin's Island, a small Bangladeshi island in the Bay of Bengal, has become a geopolitical flashpoint. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina claimed the US sought to acquire the island in exchange for political support, a claim her son denied and the US State Department refuted. The island's strategic location near crucial maritime routes makes it highly valuable, potentially allowing for surveillance of Chinese activity and control of vital trade routes. While Bangladesh benefits economically from the island's resources and tourism, maritime boundary disputes with Myanmar add complexity.  The island's potential for a US military presence raises concerns among neighboring countries, including India and China, who are also vying for influence in the region.</description>

			<description>The Kolkata Police arrested Sanjay Roy, a civic volunteer, for the rape and murder of a 31-year-old trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Roy had access to the hospital premises and was allegedly drunk at the time of the crime. 

CCTV footage showed Roy entering the building around 4 am and leaving 40 minutes later without his Bluetooth device, which was found near the scene of the crime. Blood found on his shoes also serves as evidence. He allegedly attempted to destroy evidence by washing his clothes.

The autopsy report confirmed sexual assault and revealed multiple injuries on the victim's body, indicating a violent struggle.

			<title>Explained: How USA's Jordan Chiles lost bronze medal for floor exercise at Paris Olympics</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/sports/olympics-2024-how-usas-jordan-chiles-lost-bronze-medal-for-floor-exercise-13803479.html</link>
			<description>During the Paris Olympics, a scoring controversy erupted in the women’s floor exercise. American Jordan Chiles initially won the bronze medal after her coach appealed a score, boosting her placement. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled the appeal was made outside the allowed timeframe, reinstating the original ranking. This awarded the bronze medal to Romania’s Ana Barbosu.  Romanian gymnast Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, who was initially placed fourth, also appealed a penalty but was denied. 

The controversy resulted in criticism directed at Chiles, with some calling for her to return the medal. Both Barbosu and Chiles received support from fellow gymnasts like Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee, who emphasized the importance of fair judging.</description>

			<title>Gen X and millennials at greater risk of cancer than older generations. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/gen-x-and-millennials-at-greater-risk-of-cancer-than-older-generations-heres-why-13802867.html</link>
			<description>A recent study by the American Cancer Society found that Gen X and millennials are at increased risk for 17 types of cancer compared to older generations. This includes cancers of the small intestine, thyroid, kidney, and pancreas.  The study analyzed data from nearly 24 million cancer patients and concluded that younger generations are developing these cancers at younger ages. 

Researchers attribute this trend to lifestyle changes, such as increased obesity and sedentary behavior, as well as altered dietary habits with more ultra-processed foods. Binge drinking, particularly among millennial women, was also identified as a contributing factor to liver and esophageal cancer rates.  The study highlights the importance of understanding the causes of these rising cancer rates to develop effective prevention strategies. However, the study also noted positive trends, such as a decrease in lung and melanoma cancer rates, demonstrating the impact of public health campaigns promoting smoking cessation and sun-safe practices.</description>

			<title>Is Mercury retrograde really to blame for life's chaos? What is it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-mercury-retrograde-really-to-blame-for-lifes-chaos-what-is-it-13802094.html</link>
			<description>Mercury retrograde, an astrological phenomenon where Mercury appears to move backward in its orbit, is believed to disrupt communication, travel, and technology. This perceived backward motion occurs because Mercury orbits the Sun faster than Earth.  

Astrologically, Mercury governs communication, travel, technology, and information. During retrograde, these areas are thought to be prone to disruptions like miscommunications, travel delays, and technological malfunctions.  

While there's no scientific evidence to support these claims, many people believe that Mercury retrograde can impact their lives negatively. To navigate this period, astrologers recommend exercising extra caution, avoiding major decisions, backing up technology, and staying flexible.</description>

			<title>Cats vs toddlers: Are Chinese youth choosing pets over kids?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-pet-population-young-children-report-13802532.html</link>
			<description>A Goldman Sachs report predicts that China's urban pet population will surpass the number of young children by 2030.  The report attributes this trend to declining birth rates in China, with urban pet ownership projected to reach 70 million by 2030, compared to a child population under four years old of less than 40 million. This boom in pet ownership is expected to fuel a significant growth in the pet food market, reaching $12 billion by 2030.  The report also notes that cat ownership is predicted to surpass dog ownership due to space constraints.  
China's shrinking population and declining birth rates are a major concern, driven by factors such as economic instability, pandemic effects, and the high cost of raising a family.   To combat this, the government is implementing various incentives to encourage childbirth, but young people cite financial concerns as a primary deterrent.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-week-in-explainers-will-sheikh-hasina-return-to-bangladesh-and-politics-13802926.html</link>
			<description>A military coup in Bangladesh has ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, forcing her to flee the country.  The coup followed weeks of anti-government protests. Hasina has sought refuge in India, but her future and that of Bangladesh remain uncertain. A caretaker government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, is now in power. Meanwhile, the UK continues to grapple with a wave of far-right violence sparked by recent stabbings. Anti-racism protests have emerged in response.  In the US,  Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate, sparking debate over a controversial passage in Vance's memoir. Other global stories include a proposed law in Iraq that would lower the legal age of marriage, and the delayed return of Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams from the International Space Station.</description>

			<title>6 murals in 7 days. What's street artist Banksy up to in the UK?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/6-murals-in-7-days-whats-street-artist-banksy-up-to-in-the-uk-13803176.html</link>
			<description>Banksy has recently unveiled a series of six animal-themed murals across London, sparking curiosity and debate about their meaning.  The striking silhouettes, ranging from goats and elephants to wolves and pelicans, have been placed in various locations, with the artist providing no accompanying captions.  

Speculation abounds regarding the message behind the artworks, with some linking them to social and political issues such as far-right violence, environmental crises, and the state of global politics. Banksy has often used animals in his work to convey messages about animal welfare, climate change, and threats to the environment. The rapidity with which these murals appeared is unusual for the elusive artist, who typically releases work in spaced intervals.</description>

			<title>Your microwave is full of bacteria. Does it make it a health hazard?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/health/your-microwave-is-full-of-bacteria-does-it-make-it-a-health-hazard-13802936.html</link>
			<description>A recent study investigated the presence of bacteria in microwaves from various environments like homes, offices, and laboratories.  Researchers discovered  747 different bacterial genera, with  Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria being the most prevalent. Microbes found in domestic and shared microwaves were similar to those found on kitchen surfaces, suggesting food particles may offer protection from radiation. In contrast, laboratory microwaves harbored distinct bacteria resembling those found in extreme environments. The study highlighted that some bacteria, like Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas, present in domestic microwaves could pose health risks.</description>

			<title>This Week in Explainers: Why changes in Waqf Act have sparked uproar</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/this-week-in-explainers-waqf-amendment-bill-lok-sabha-opposition-uproar-13802954.html</link>
			<description>The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which proposes over 30 changes to the 1995 Waqf Act, was introduced in the Lok Sabha and faced strong opposition. The bill has sparked controversy with opposition parties accusing the government of attacking the Constitution and federalism. 

Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country and sought refuge in India. Her stay, initially expected to be temporary,  might be extended as her asylum request to the UK faces hurdles. 

Manish Sisodia, former Delhi deputy chief minister, was granted bail by the Supreme Court in  cases connected to the Delhi excise policy scam, offering a significant boost to the AAP.  

Meanwhile, Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the Paris Olympics for being overweight triggered widespread concern and speculation about potential bias.  

Concerns surfaced regarding the impact of Bangladesh's political turmoil on India's trade relations, as bilateral trade was disrupted due to the crisis. Kerala reported a surge in cases of amoebic meningoencephalitis, a rare and deadly brain infection, raising public health concerns.</description>

			<title>America is facing a major blood shortage. Here’s why heat is to blame</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/america-is-facing-a-major-blood-shortage-heres-why-heat-is-to-blame-13802979.html</link>
			<description>The US national blood supply has dropped by over 25% since July 1st due to extreme heat impacting blood drives.  The Red Cross, which provides 40% of the country's blood donations, is urging people to donate, emphasizing the need for type O blood, particularly in emergencies.  The heat wave has led to cancellations and low turnout at blood drives, resulting in a deficit of approximately 19,000 donations in July.  Hurricane season further compounds the issue, potentially disrupting collection efforts. Experts warn that the shortage could impact critical medical treatments, including surgeries, childbirth complications, and care for patients with trauma, cancer, and blood disorders.   The Red Cross is offering a $20 Amazon gift card to encourage donations.</description>

			<title>The Netherlands has prisons that are too ‘empty’. Here's why</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-netherlands-has-prisons-that-are-too-empty-heres-why-13802844.html</link>
			<description>The Netherlands is facing a unique problem: severely underpopulated prisons. This is due to remarkably low crime rates and a focus on rehabilitation over punishment.  The country has implemented shorter sentences for non-violent crimes, with many serving less than three months.  There is a strong belief that prison can be more detrimental than beneficial.  

The Dutch system emphasizes alternatives like electronic tagging and specialized mental health treatment programs to reduce recidivism.  As a result, the prison population has been dramatically reduced, leading to the closure of numerous facilities and their repurposing for other societal needs.</description>

			<title>Can mayonnaise hold the key to unlocking nuclear fusion? Scientists think so...</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-mayonnaise-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-nuclear-fusion-scientists-think-so-13802920.html</link>
			<description>Researchers at Lehigh University are using mayonnaise to study the challenges of nuclear fusion.  Mayonnaise, which behaves like a solid until subjected to pressure, mimics the behavior of plasma, the charged state of matter involved in fusion.  

The research focuses on understanding how hydrodynamic instabilities, particularly the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, affect fusion reactions. These instabilities can reduce the efficiency of fusion energy production.

By studying how mayonnaise flows and becomes unstable under pressure, the researchers aim to develop strategies to predict, control, and potentially suppress these instabilities in actual fusion experiments.  This knowledge could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of fusion energy generation.</description>

			<description>The path from Nobel Peace Prize laureate to political leader can be complex and varied. Figures like Aung San Suu Kyi, who faced controversy during her time as Myanmar's de facto leader, and Nelson Mandela, who successfully led South Africa's transition from apartheid, demonstrate the challenges and potential triumphs involved. Other laureates, such as JosÃ© Ramos-Horta, have found success in guiding their nations through peaceful development.  Economist Muhammad Yunus's recent appointment as Bangladesh's interim leader adds another dimension to this conversation, raising questions about his ability to navigate the country's turbulent political landscape.</description>

			<title>Why is S Jaishankar's Male visit significant for India-Maldives ties?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-s-jaishankars-male-visit-significant-for-india-maldives-ties-13802884.html</link>
			<description>S Jaishankar's visit to the Maldives aims to strengthen bilateral ties that had faced strain following the election of President Mohamed Muizzu.  Muizzu, who campaigned on an 'India out' platform, has since visited India for Modi's swearing-in ceremony and met with the Maldivian Foreign Minister and Indian officials in Kampala. 

Despite initial reservations about India, the Maldives has requested financial assistance from India, and New Delhi has provided a $50 million loan and eased export restrictions on essential goods. This visit seeks to build upon the previous government's strong defense and security cooperation with India.  

While questions remain about Muizzu's long-term policy stance, his actions suggest a more nuanced approach, potentially influenced by the economic challenges facing the Maldives. His administration's dealings with China, meanwhile, are subject to close observation.</description>

			<title>Is a megaquake coming to Japan? How ready is the country for it?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/japan-megaquake-nankai-trough-tremors-asia-scientists-warning-13802822.html</link>
			<description>Japan experienced a 7.1 magnitude earthquake off its southern coast, triggering a tsunami advisory. Following this tremor, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first-ever warning about a potential major earthquake in the near future. The warning, citing a higher risk of an earthquake along the Nankai Trough,  emphasized the potential for widespread shaking and tsunami waves impacting coastal areas from Tokyo to Okinawa.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida canceled his Central Asia trip in response to the warning.  Despite past devastating earthquakes, Japan has implemented strict earthquake-resistant building codes and widespread preparedness measures. Buildings are designed to withstand significant shaking, and the country has an effective early warning system and well-rehearsed evacuation protocols. 

However,  experts acknowledge that it remains impossible to guarantee building safety against a major earthquake until it occurs. The potential impact of a major earthquake on Japan's infrastructure and economy is significant, with estimates of billions of dollars in potential damage.</description>

			<title>Terror threat at Taylor Swift’s Vienna concerts: Who are the ‘ISIS-inspired’ teen suspects?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/terror-threat-at-taylor-swifts-vienna-concerts-who-are-the-isis-inspired-teen-suspects-13802739.html</link>
			<description>Austrian authorities foiled a terror attack planned for Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna, leading to the arrest of three teenage suspects. The 19-year-old, described as radicalized towards ISIS, confessed to planning a bombing and stabbing attack using explosives and knives. 

He had stockpiled chemicals, detonators, and weapons, and allegedly researched bomb-making techniques from jihadist videos. 

Two other teenagers, aged 17 and 15, were also arrested, with the 17-year-old suspected of planning to detonate a bomb at the concert venue. 

Due to the threat, three sold-out concerts were cancelled, impacting an estimated 170,000 fans and prompting heightened security across Austria.</description>

			<title>NYT calls violence against Hindus in Bangladesh ‘revenge attacks’: How Western media gets the India story wrong</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/nyt-violence-against-hindus-bangladesh-revenge-attacks-how-western-media-gets-the-india-story-wrong-13802799.html</link>
			<description>The New York Times drew criticism for its initial headline on violence against Hindus in Bangladesh following the departure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  The headline, which labeled the attacks as "revenge," sparked outrage on social media, leading the newspaper to revise it. 

This incident isn't the first time the NYT has faced backlash for its coverage of India.  Past controversies include a cartoon in 2014 depicting India in a stereotypical manner and opinion pieces alleging curbs on press freedom in Kashmir.  The NYT's coverage of India and such incidents highlight a broader concern about Western media bias against the country.</description>
