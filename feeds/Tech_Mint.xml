			<title>WhatsApp now allows users to pin messages. Here's how to use the new feature</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/whatsapp-now-allows-users-to-pin-messages-heres-how-to-use-the-new-feature-11702441874349.html</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with information about pinning messages on WhatsApp. Users can pin any type of message in a conversation, including text, polls, and emojis. To pin a message, you can go to the menu, click on 'Pin,' and select the duration for the pinned message. On an iPhone, you can swipe right on the chat you want to pin, and on Android, you can hold the chat you want to pin. Group admins have the option to choose whether only admins or all members can pin a message. It's not yet clear if the pin chat feature will be available for WhatsApp Channels. Other messaging apps like iMessage and Telegram already offer the ability to pin messages for individual and group chats. WhatsApp has been adding new features, including the recent release of 'View Once Voice Messages' for sharing sensitive information via voice messages. Additionally, WhatsApp is working on improving its integration with Instagram to allow users to share status updates directly as stories.</description>

			<title>Apple adds new Stolen Device Protection with iOS 17.3 beta. What is it and how does it work?</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apple-adds-new-stolen-device-protection-with-ios-17-3-beta-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work-11702435957732.html</link>
			<description>Stolen Device Protection is a new feature introduced by Apple in the iOS 17.3 beta. It is designed to protect users in case their iPhone is stolen and the thief knows the password. To enable Stolen Device Protection, users can navigate to the Face ID and Passcode settings in the iOS 17.3 Beta. The stable version of the upgrade is expected to be available to all users in January or February. Once enabled, users will need to use Face ID or Touch ID to perform various tasks, such as viewing passwords stored in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, turning off Lost Mode, resetting the device to factory settings, and using stored payment information in Safari. Apple is also adding a one-hour delay followed by Face ID or Touch ID verification for sensitive tasks like changing the Apple ID password or iPhone passcode. However, there will be no delay for these tasks if they are performed in familiar places like home or office.</description>

			<title>E-sports to be the next big bet</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/esports-to-be-the-next-big-bet-11701882062478.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the growing revenue opportunities in the e-sports industry in India. With 42.5 crore gamers, second only to China, India has seen a rise in e-sports events with substantial prize money. Companies like Nodwin Gaming and JetSynthesys have organized tournaments with high prize pools and live broadcasts on traditional and digital platforms. Industry stakeholders believe that the potential for monetizing e-sports in India is significant due to the large user base and enthusiasm among young users. The proliferation of mobile phones and affordable internet data has fueled the growth of the gaming industry. However, challenges such as limited spending propensity and a relatively less mature domestic market persist. Real-money games currently contribute the largest share of revenue in the Indian gaming industry. As the industry matures and Indian e-sports teams gain more exposure and success, the business opportunity in e-sports is expected to grow. While some gaming ventures are betting on e-sports, others are not considering diversification into this segment.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-faces-backlash-over-glitch-muting-earliest-videos-heres-what-happened-11701841612266.html</link>
			<description>Instagram users are experiencing a glitch where audio is disappearing from their oldest videos posted on the platform, specifically affecting videos from 2014 and earlier. This issue is not related to copyright concerns, as Instagram usually notifies users in such cases. The problem seems to be limited to Instagram, as the videos play with sound when embedded on other platforms. Meta, the parent company of Instagram, is aware of the problem and working to fix it. In the meantime, there is no known solution to restore audio on the platform, but users can watch these videos with sound when embedded elsewhere.</description>

			<title>Nov services activity rises, but at slower pace: Survey</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/nov-services-activity-rises-but-at-slower-pace-survey-11701798616675.html</link>
			<description>India's services sector expanded in November, although at the slowest pace in a year, according to a private survey. The Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 56.9 in November from 58.4 in October, still indicating expansion. Concerns about inflation remain high among businesses. Despite the slowdown in growth, experts expect certain segments to pick up in the coming months, boosting overall sector growth. Notably, domestic air travel recorded a significant growth rate. While price pressures cooled and demand remained resilient, there was softer expansion in new work intake and output. The external sector is identified as a hindrance to economic growth. Despite the slowdown, the outlook for business activity remains positive, though optimism is fading due to rising inflation expectations. Input price inflation has receded, providing some relief to service providers. Employment rose, but at a marginal rate, and hiring caution was observed. Chief economic adviser Anantha Nageswaran predicts comfortable growth of 6.5% in India's current fiscal year.</description>

			<title>Acquisitions on the horizon in real-money gaming sector</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/acquisitions-on-the-horizon-in-real-money-gaming-sector-11701793730470.html</link>
			<description>India's real-money gaming industry is going through a phase of consolidation as larger firms seek to improve their user base and revenue by acquiring smaller startups. Companies like Games24x7 and Nazara Technologies believe that industry-wide consolidation is inevitable, though finding acquisitions with the right valuation is challenging. The chief operating officer of Nazara stated that strategic acquisitions are part of their long-term strategy, but they won't rush into them. Smaller ventures may be affected by cash constraints, making it sensible for larger firms to assist with tech infrastructure and operational costs. While some startup founders are holding out for revised tax rates, at least 20 gaming startups are considering acquisition offers. Despite projections of a potential drop in overall revenue share due to new taxation, companies and investors remain optimistic. The real-money gaming segment is seen as a behavior-building sector, which will eventually decline in revenue share as the market matures.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses Samsung's focus on bringing artificial intelligence-enabled upgrades to its upcoming flagship phone series, the Galaxy S24. Samsung has applied for AI-related trademarks, such as 'AI Phone' and 'AI Smartphone', although it may not be granted a patent due to the generic nature of these terms. Additionally, Samsung plans to launch the Galaxy AI experience alongside the global launch of the Galaxy S24, which will bring on-device AI capabilities to Samsung smartphones. The Galaxy AI experience will introduce features like AI Live Translate, which provides real-time call transcripts. The article also mentions leaked images of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, indicating a departure from curved screens and the possibility of the S Pen being introduced. Overall, the Galaxy S24 series is expected to feature upgrades in terms of processor, camera capabilities, and additional features.</description>

			<description>The Indian government is taking steps to combat the dangers of deepfake technology by assisting citizens in filing First Information Reports (FIRs) against social media platforms for violating IT rules. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) will develop a platform where users can report violations by social media platforms. A Rule Seven officer will be nominated to create this platform and address complaints from citizens. If a platform discloses the source of objectionable content, the FIR will be filed against that entity. The government has been alerting internet players about the threat of deepfakes since October 2022. Social media platforms have been given seven days to align their terms of use with IT rules.</description>

			<title>Google Chrome's upcoming features: AI-powered Tab Organization and Autofill Helper in work, suggests report</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/google-chromes-upcoming-features-ai-powered-tab-organization-and-autofill-helper-in-work-suggests-report-11700638244399.html</link>
			<description>Google is reportedly planning to introduce new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to its Chrome browser, allowing users to organize tabs more efficiently. Screenshots shared on the X forum show a forthcoming feature called 'Advanced' in the Chrome settings, suggesting the incorporation of AI technology. The upcoming section will include an AI tool called 'Organize tabs' that uses machine learning to automatically sort tabs when a certain number are opened. Another feature in development is Autofill Helper, which requires browser restart and its purpose remains unclear. Google has been introducing various updates to its Chrome app, including AI translations, map addresses, calendar event creation, and the option to move the address bar to the bottom of the interface. Furthermore, Google celebrated Chrome's 15th anniversary by revamping it with the 'Material You' theme, featuring refreshed icons and a redesigned Chrome Web Store.</description>

			<description>Google is actively discouraging YouTube users from using ad blockers and instead promoting its premium subscription for an ad-free experience. The company has introduced a five-second delay before video loading for users with ad blockers, claiming that their viewing experience will be suboptimal. Google's crackdown on ad blockers has resulted in hundreds of thousands of users uninstalling them in October, but there has also been a surge in ad blocker installations as people seek alternatives to bypass the premium subscription prompt.</description>

			<description>The board of OpenAI approached Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, offering him the position of CEO and discussing a potential merger between the two companies. However, Amodei declined both offers. Following the ousting of Sam Altman as CEO, Mira Murati was appointed as interim CEO, but she was replaced by Emmett Shear shortly after. Over 500 OpenAI employees threatened to resign if the board did not step down. A letter signed by 505 employees stated that they would join Microsoft's AI team led by Altman and Greg Brockman. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, expressed regret for his role in Altman's removal. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman, Brockman, and their colleagues would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research team, while still maintaining support for OpenAI.</description>

			<description>The Indian government is planning to crack down on the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) through deepfakes, according to Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar. The government aims to create a framework to ensure that deepfakes do not threaten the safety of internet users in India. Chandrasekhar stated that the government is consulting with intermediaries and engaging with platforms to address the issue. The move comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern about the rising risk of deepfakes, highlighting a recent incident involving a fake video of him dancing. The threat posed by deepfakes was further emphasized when actress Rashmika Mandanna revealed that her face was used in a deepfake video, raising concerns about women's safety online.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk's X Corp is suing Media Matters, a liberal media advocacy group, for allegedly manipulating social media algorithms and creating false posts to drive away advertisers. Musk stated that this is the first of many lawsuits against the group. The lawsuit claims that Media Matters manipulated algorithms on X to pair advertisers' paid posts with racist content, creating a false impression. Media Matters denies the allegations and stands behind its reporting. Musk faced controversy for endorsing a post on X that inaccurately claimed Jewish people were fueling hostility towards white people. Following this, several advertisers, including Disney and Apple, pulled their ads from the platform.</description>

			<title>OpenAI's Ilya Sutskever ‘deeply regrets’ his role in ouster of Sam Altman</title>

			<description>OpenAI's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, has expressed regret for his role in the board rebellion against the ousted CEO Sam Altman. Sutskever posted on social media that he never intended to harm OpenAI and would do everything to reunite the company. This statement came after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman, along with OpenAI's former president Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. Despite this, Microsoft clarified that they would continue to support OpenAI. Reports suggest that 505 OpenAI employees have threatened to join the new Microsoft team if the board doesn't resign. Among the signatories is Mira Murati, OpenAI's interim CEO.</description>

			<description>A woman in Gurugram lost over ₹30,000 when she attempted to purchase a bottle of whiskey online. She came across a phone number claiming to offer doorstep alcohol delivery, but it turned out to be a scam. After paying ₹3,000 for the bottle, she received a call demanding additional funds for delivery. Suspecting a scam, she canceled the order, but the scammers insisted she send ₹5 for a refund. Following the transaction, her bank account was debited ₹29,986. The police are investigating the case and suspect that the scam may have involved a qr code transmitted by the fraudsters. It is advised to protect personal and financial information, avoid disclosing sensitive details, use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be cautious of phishing attempts to enhance online security.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The messaging app called Nothing Chats, developed by the company Nothing, experienced a setback when its beta version was quickly removed from the Play Store a day after its release. The official launch of the app has been postponed due to the need for further evaluation and improvement. The app aimed to address texting challenges between Android and iPhones by supporting both RCS and iMessage. However, critics raised concerns about potential security risks associated with these solutions.

The decision to take down the app came after users shared a blog post from texts.com, which revealed that messages sent through the app lacked end-to-end encryption, making them vulnerable to compromise. Texts.com's reverse engineering team discovered that users were required to transmit their Apple ID credentials to the company's servers, raising multiple security concerns. Despite claims of ISO27001 certification, the investigation found misleading information regarding end-to-end encryption.

While messages sent to the servers were encrypted, the transmission of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was done without encryption, exposing them to potential interception. The intercepted JWTs allowed access to the Firebase real-time database and user information with just 23 lines of code. Sunbird, the foundation of the app, explained that HTTP was used solely for the initial request from the app to the back-end to notify it of the iMessage connection.

Overall, the app faced criticism and concerns over security vulnerabilities, leading to its removal from the Play Store and the postponement of its official launch.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, mocked Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's announcement reaffirming their partnership with OpenAI. Nadella stated that Microsoft was committed to the partnership and shared the news that former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research team. In response, Musk sarcastically commented that Microsoft would now have to use Teams. Musk's tweet seemingly refers to OpenAI personnel who fired Altman at a Google Meet despite receiving funding from Microsoft. Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI and owns about 49% of the company. Altman was informed of his termination by the OpenAI board members, led by co-founder Ilya Sutskever, during a Google Meet.</description>

However, the feature's inclusion in the global release is not guaranteed, and a specific timeline for its availability is not disclosed. Additionally, WhatsApp has introduced a privacy feature called 'protect IP address in calls' to conceal users' IP addresses during individual calls by routing them through a server instead of peer-to-peer connections.</description>

			<title>Sam Altman's ouster from OpenAI draws parallels with ‘Apple fired Steve Jobs’ decades ago | Read here</title>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, was recently fired as the CEO of the company due to a lack of consistent communication with the board of directors. This news has surprised many people, considering Altman's crucial role in the development of ChatGPT, an AI language tool that sparked an artificial intelligence race among tech leaders. Some have drawn parallels between Altman's dismissal and Steve Jobs' firing from Apple in 1985. Jobs, too, was initially ousted from the company he helped build due to conflicts with the board. While Jobs' confrontational management style and interpersonal skills were speculated to be the reasons for his dismissal, it was later acknowledged that he demanded a lot from his employees. Jobs went on to start NeXT Computer before rejoining Apple in 1997 and achieving great success. In Altman's case, the specific reason behind his dismissal remains undisclosed, but it is clear that there was a loss of confidence in his leadership and a breakdown in communication.</description>

			<description>OpenAI has fired its co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, after a review found that he was not consistently honest with the board of directors. The company stated that it no longer had confidence in his ability to lead OpenAI and named Mira Murati, the chief technology officer, as the interim CEO while they search for a permanent replacement. Following Altman's removal, several tech leaders praised his accomplishments in the field of AI. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt referred to Altman as a hero and acknowledged his role in building the company from nothing to a value of $90 billion. Other leaders, such as Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and Lattice CEO Jack Altman (Sam's brother), recognized Altman's significant impact on the industry and praised his character. Despite the positive reactions, some individuals, including Chris Anderson, Chief of TED, expressed surprise and compared Altman's firing to Apple's decision to terminate Steve Jobs. In addition to Altman's departure, OpenAI's co-founder and President Greg Brockman also announced his resignation. Altman had previously expressed concerns about humanity's path to self-destruction and emphasized the need for technology, particularly artificial intelligence, in ensuring our long-term flourishing. He suggested that heavy regulation may be necessary when AI models possess massive capabilities and output similar to entire companies, countries, or even the world.</description>

			<description>After OpenAI fired Sam Altman, the co-founder and president Greg Brockman has announced his departure from the company. Altman was pushed out due to communication issues with the board of directors. Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO. Brockman expressed pride in the company's accomplishments but stated that he is quitting in response to the news. Both Brockman and Altman were shocked and saddened by the decision and are still trying to understand what happened. OpenAI has received investments from tech giants like Microsoft and has integrated its technology into various products. Analysts believe Altman's firing won't significantly impact the company's momentum. Originally a nonprofit, OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit structure after Microsoft's investment. The company recently announced its most powerful language model, GPT-4 Turbo.</description>

			<title>Threads launches mobile web version; find out what's new</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/threads-launches-mobile-web-version-find-out-whats-new-11700227739912.html</link>
			<description>Threads, a social media platform, has introduced its mobile web browser version to enhance user experience. Initial testing showed seamless login through Chrome on iOS, with a temporary hurdle on Safari. Users are optimistic about quick resolutions to any technical glitches. The addition of the mobile web version is a relief for users who have expressed frustration over the lack of functionality. Previously, accessing user profiles was possible, but browsing feeds, posting, replying, or logging in from browsers was elusive. Threads initially gained popularity as a mobile-first platform but experienced a decline in engagement over time. Recognizing this, Mark Zuckerberg and Adam Mosseri committed to providing a mobile web version. Meta, the parent company, revealed developments to retain users, including the introduction of operating Threads on smartphones and other devices. This move addresses the demand for additional features and counters the limited view-only mode on desktop.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple has announced that it will support Rich Communication Services (RCS) messages in iPhones. This comes after Google requested for Apple's support in this area. RCS chat is seen as the successor to SMS. Apple stated that it will add support for the RCS Universal Profile next year, which is the standard set by the GSM Association. Apple believes that RCS will offer a better interoperability experience compared to SMS or MMS, and it will work alongside iMessage. It is also noted that RCS messages from iPhones will be represented in green, while messages sent from iPhones were previously represented in blue, indicating that iMessage is the safest mode of communication. The report also mentions that the blue color bubbles in iMessage have gained cultural significance and have triggered pressure on tech companies, leading some Android users to switch to iPhones. RCS offers several features for carrier-based messaging, including group messaging and messaging over Wi-Fi. Additionally, Apple has extended access to its emergency SOS via satellite service for an additional year for existing iPhone 14 users.</description>

			<title>EMIs, pre-used units drive Diwali smartphone sales</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/emis-pre-used-units-drive-diwali-smartphone-sales-11700160286423.html</link>
			<description>Refurbished smartphones and no-interest financing schemes were the key drivers of sales during Diwali, surpassing industry expectations in India's smartphone market. The introduction of zero-interest, two-year financing schemes for smartphones and the attractiveness of refurbished phones boosted sales during the festive season. Customer reluctance to upgrade due to the quality of existing smartphones and lack of organic demand has caused market stagnation. The budget segment struggled, while premium smartphones experienced higher demand. The market is expected to decline for the second consecutive year, although the finance scheme helped some retailers achieve growth. Refurbished smartphone resellers also benefited from increased demand, particularly for iPhone models. Overall, the combination of financing offers and refurbished phones contributed to a better-than-expected sales performance during Diwali.</description>

			<description>Please provide me with the instructions or questions you have, and I'll do my best to help you.Here's how you can connect multiple computers wirelessly:

1. Check network requirements: Ensure that all computers have wireless network adapters or built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. If any computer doesn't have a wireless adapter, you may need to purchase a USB Wi-Fi adapter for it.

2. Set up a wireless router: Connect the wireless router to your internet modem using an Ethernet cable. Power on the router and follow the manufacturer's instructions to complete the setup process. This typically involves configuring the network name (SSID) and password.

3. Connect computers to the wireless network: On each computer, locate the network icon in the system tray or menu bar. Click on it and select your wireless network from the list of available networks. Enter the network password if prompted. Repeat this step for all computers.

4. Verify connectivity: Once connected, verify that each computer has internet access by opening a web browser and visiting a website. If any computer experiences issues, make sure the Wi-Fi connection is stable and troubleshoot accordingly.

5. Share files and printers (optional): To enable file and printer sharing between computers, you'll need to configure the appropriate settings. On Windows, go to the Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Advanced sharing settings. Enable network discovery, file sharing, and printer sharing. On macOS, go to System Preferences &gt; Sharing and check the desired options.

6. Test file and printer sharing: To test file sharing, create a shared folder on one computer, then try accessing it from another computer on the same network. For printer sharing, install the printer drivers on each computer individually and try printing a test page.

By following these steps, you can establish a wireless network and connect multiple computers together. Remember to keep your network secure by using a strong password and enabling encryption on your wireless router.</description>

			<description>China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and Cernet Corporation have unveiled the 'world's fastest internet' network, capable of transmitting data at 1.2 terabits per second. The network, built in collaboration with Tsinghua University, spans over 3,000 kilometers, connecting Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou through an optical fiber system. This speed surpasses existing major networks by more than ten times, as most networks operate at just 100 gigabits per second. The new internet network will play a crucial role in China's Future Internet Technology Infrastructure and has demonstrated stable and reliable performance. Notably, Huawei Technologies vice-president Wang Lei described the network as capable of transferring the data equivalent of 150 high-definition films in just one second. The project leaders believe this superfast network not only operates successfully but also provides advanced technology to build even faster internet for the country.</description>

OpenAI recently announced their powerful language model, GPT-4 Turbo, which has a larger context window and is more powerful and updated than the previous GPT-4 version. Altman launched a beta program for developers to fine-tune GPT-4 models, and OpenAI also launched its custom models program, enabling users to build customized bots. OpenAI plans to launch a GPT Store where people can share their GPTs and earn money based on the number of users. GPT-4 Turbo comes with a larger context window and is cheaper for developers to use compared to GPT-4.</description>

			<description>The mobile gaming industry in India is experiencing wider popularity due to mainstream broadcast deals and increased willingness of users to pay for games.

Challenges include competition from other sports and the need for further improvement in monetization. However, experts believe that 2024 could be the biggest year for the industry.</description>

			<title>Google fined $164,000 for failing to store users’ data on servers in Russia</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/russian-court-imposes-164-000-fine-on-google-for-failing-to-store-users-data-on-servers-in-russia-11699959502951.html</link>
			<description>A Russian court has fined Google 15 million roubles ($164,000) for refusing to store Russian users' data on servers within the country. This follows previous fines imposed on the company for the same charges in August 2021 and June 2022. These fines were given under a Russian law that requires foreign companies to localize the personal data of their Russian users. In addition to these legal issues, Google's Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after its bank account was seized by Russian authorities, leading to difficulties in paying staff and vendors. While Twitter and Facebook are banned in Russia, access to Google's services, search engine, and YouTube remains free. Apple and the Wikimedia Foundation have also faced fines from Russian courts in the past. In other news, YouTube will soon implement a policy update requiring video creators to disclose when they upload manipulated or synthetic content that appears realistic. This includes videos created using artificial intelligence tools. Starting from December 1, Google plans to delete certain personal data, including Gmail messages, Google Photos libraries, Google Calendar appointments, and Google Docs archives. The company had previously sent out emails warning users about the upcoming deletions.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Elon Musk, the world's richest man and Tesla CEO, apologized to India's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, for not being able to meet him during a visit to Tesla's factory in California. Musk expressed his honor at Goyal's visit and showed optimism about meeting the minister at a later date. Goyal praised India's contribution to Tesla's journey and mentioned the crucial role played by Indian engineers and finance professionals within the company. He also stated that Tesla is on track to double its component imports from India. Goyal's visit coincides with speculation about the Indian government granting tax concessions to Tesla for establishing an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in India. The Indian government is reportedly considering reducing the duty on electric vehicles to 15%, although it has yet to be agreed upon. Tesla has requested an initial concession on customs duty levied on imported cars in India, where vehicles priced below $40,000 face a 70% import duty, while those priced above $40,000 attract a 100% import duty.</description>

			<title>GTA 6 leaks: Launch date, new weapons and everything you should know</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/gta-6-leaks-launch-date-new-weapons-and-everything-you-should-know-11699872129922.html</link>
			<description>Rockstar Games has provided some information about the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6), including that the game's trailer will be released next month as part of the company's 25th anniversary celebrations. Although details about characters and gameplay remain a secret, a leaked document from last year has hinted at potential features. The leaked information suggests that players can expect a range of weapons and tools, including an auto-dialer, various golf clubs, a crowbar, and a cut-off tool for unlocking doors and containers. There may also be a slim jim for opening older cars and an immobilizer bypass for accessing modern vehicles. The game might also include a tracker jammer device to avoid being detected by law enforcement. In terms of health recovery, players could potentially use items like food, drinks, painkillers, and trauma kits, with cigarettes potentially providing an adrenaline or stamina boost. Other potential items in the game could include a torch, USB drive, and binoculars, while characters might carry duffle bags or backpacks to store valuables. The leaked information also suggests that GTA 6 could feature a lineup of weapons similar to those seen in GTA 5, including guns, grenades, and melee weapons. However, it's important to note that all the information is based on leaks and rumors and should be taken with caution until there is official confirmation from Rockstar Games.</description>

			<title>Thinking of upgrading? Here’s the Mark Gurman's advice on M3 MacBook Pro and iMac model</title>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple recently unveiled its latest Mac devices, including the m3, m3 Pro, and m3 Max chips. The event also showcased updated MacBook Pros and the first refresh of the iMac in nearly three years. Analyst Mark Gurman from Bloomberg provided insights on whether these devices are worth choosing or if it's better to wait for the next release. Gurman commented that the new 24-inch iMac, equipped with the latest Apple M3 chip, is fast but not groundbreaking. The iMac maintained its existing color options. The MacBook Pro introduced a new space black color, but Gurman noted that the speed improvement is not revolutionary. Gurman advised waiting for another generation or two if you have a Macbook Pro with an M1 chip, and if you have an M1 iMac, patience may be rewarded with a larger release. However, for those still using an Intel-based Mac, transitioning to Apple silicon is recommended as it offers significant performance upgrades and improved battery life. Gurman also mentioned the introduction of three M3 chips during the event and noted that there was no mention of the rumored M3 Ultra chip. Historical patterns suggest the M3 Ultra chip could feature twice the CPU and GPU cores and support for up to 256GB of RAM.</description>

			<title>'Ambitious and compelling': Apple plans to bring Gen AI and other key features to iOS 18</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/ambitious-and-compelling-apple-plans-to-bring-gen-ai-and-other-key-features-to-ios-18-11699848427018.html</link>
			<description>Apple has released its latest operating system upgrade, iOS 17, to the public. However, the company is already working on iOS 18, which will be announced at next year's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. iOS 18 is important because Apple will not bring a hardware upgrade to the iPhone 16, instead focusing on new software upgrades to attract customers. Apple is also betting on generative AI to compete with Google and OpenAI. The upcoming operating system is described as "ambitious and compelling" and could bring improvements in features, design, security, and performance. Apple's head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, decided to freeze development work on new major software updates to debug and improve performance. This move is similar to what Apple did in 2019 when bugs and feature delays affected iPhone launches. Apple's policy, "the pact," ensures that any regressions or glitches caused by new features are fixed immediately.</description>

The woman ordered expensive items, including a ₹10,000 hukka and a ₹15,000 wine bottle. She then threatened the man, saying that the restaurant owner could damage his car if he didn't pay the bill. Netizens speculated that the woman was hired by the restaurant to scam customers. Similar incidents have been reported on Bumble in Delhi as well. In one case, a man was scammed out of ₹15,886 after meeting a woman on the app. After paying the bill, the man realized he had been scammed when the woman disappeared and ignored his calls.</description>

			<title>Google Chrome starts rolling out Material You redesign; here is everything new</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/google-chrome-starts-rolling-out-material-you-redesign-here-is-everything-new-11699689772356.html</link>
			<description>Google Chrome recently celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced plans for a refreshed design. The upcoming changes will include the incorporation of the material you theme, featuring more rounded corners, updated icons, and the removal of the lock icon from the address bar. This marks the first major transformation for Chrome in five years. The redesign aims to enhance legibility, introduce new color palettes, and better integrate with operating systems. Despite these changes, the overall layout and appearance of the browser will remain familiar. Notably, there will be a new drop-down menu to display open tabs and recently closed ones, and horizontal tabs at the top will appear as small pills when hovered over. The absence of the lock icon is justified by the widespread adoption of HTTPS, and it is replaced by a settings icon for connection security and other options. Additionally, there are new outlined style icons and a range of bright material you color palettes. Quick access to bookmarks, reading lists, and history is facilitated through the side panel icon. Overall, the redesign aims to provide a fresh look and improved features for Google Chrome users.</description>

			<title>iOS 17.2 Beta 2: Apple takes steps to retire iTunes Movie Store, suggests report</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/ios-17-2-beta-2-apple-takes-steps-to-retire-itunes-movie-store-suggests-report-11699685691100.html</link>
			<description>Apple has released the iOS 17.2 public beta 2, which includes new features such as spatial video recording and a journal app for iPhones. However, a less-talked-about change suggests that Apple is taking steps to retire the dedicated iTunes movie store. Code strings indicate that iPhone users will eventually receive a notification stating that iTunes movies are moving to the Apple TV app. The TV app has been updated with a new sidebar for easier navigation, and speculation suggests that additional changes will make the iTunes movie store obsolete. The movies and TV shows tabs will be removed from the iTunes store, but users can still access them until the global release of iOS 17.2. Additionally, the update introduces spatial video recording exclusively for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and extends the sensitive contact warning feature to include contact posters in certain apps.</description>

			<description>Google plans to delete inactive Gmail accounts as part of a policy shift. If a Gmail account remains unused for more than two years, it may be deleted along with its associated content within Google Workspace. This change in policy aims to address potential security breaches and leaks, as inactive accounts are less likely to have two-factor authentication configured. Google advises users to log in at least once every two years to prevent their accounts from becoming inactive. In other news, Google is expanding its car crash detection feature on Pixel phones to include India and four other countries.</description>

			<description>Airlines are businesses that provide air transportation services for passengers and cargo. They operate by owning or leasing aircraft, scheduling flights, and selling tickets to customers.

Here are the steps to start an airline company:

1. Market Research: Conduct thorough research to identify if there is a demand for your airline services in the intended market. Consider factors such as competition, target audience, and potential routes.

2. Business Plan: Develop a detailed business plan outlining your goals, strategies, financial projections, marketing plans, and operational procedures. This plan will serve as a blueprint for your airline company and help attract investors if needed.

3. Financing: Determine how you will finance your airline startup. This can involve personal funds, loans, or investments from private investors or venture capitalists. Consider the costs of acquiring aircraft, hiring staff, marketing, insurance, maintenance, and other operational expenses.

4. Legal Requirements: Understand and comply with the legal requirements for starting an airline in the country where you intend to operate. This may include obtaining licenses, permits, certifications, and adhering to aviation regulations and safety standards.

5. Fleet Acquisition: Decide what type of aircraft your airline will operate and acquire them either through purchase or lease agreements. Consider factors like the number of seats, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and compatibility with your target routes.

6. Infrastructure: Establish a physical presence for your airline, including office space, check-in counters at airports, maintenance facilities, and a reservation system.

7. Staffing: Hire employees for various roles such as pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, customer service representatives, and administrative staff. Ensure they meet the necessary qualifications and have appropriate training.

8. Route Planning: Determine the routes your airline will operate on based on market demand, profitability, and competition. Consider factors such as distance, frequency of flights, and potential partnerships with other airlines.

9. Marketing and Branding: Develop a strong brand identity and marketing strategy to attract customers. Utilize various marketing channels such as digital advertising, social media, partnerships, and promotions.

10. Launch Operations: Once all the necessary preparations are in place, start operating flights according to your planned schedule. Monitor performance, gather customer feedback, and make improvements based on the market response.

Remember that starting an airline is a complex and capital-intensive endeavor. Seek professional advice from experts in the aviation industry and consult with legal and financial advisors to ensure compliance and proper planning.</description>

			<description>Sure, I'm here to help! How can I assist you today?Here are some interesting facts about the human brain:

1. The human brain weighs approximately 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) and is made up of about 100 billion neurons.
2. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right, which are responsible for different functions. The left hemisphere is often associated with logic, language, and analytical thinking, while the right hemisphere is linked to creativity, intuition, and emotions.
3. The brain is one of the most energy-consuming organs in the body, accounting for about 20% of the body's total energy usage.
4. The brain has no pain receptors, so it cannot feel pain. However, it can perceive pain signals from other parts of the body.
5. The brain is composed of about 75-80% water, which helps cushion and protect it from injury.
6. Despite popular belief, humans do not use only 10% of their brains. Every part of the brain has a specific function, and even small-scale damage can have significant effects on the body.
7. The brain is capable of generating approximately 23 watts of power, enough to power a dim light bulb.
8. The human brain comprises several areas responsible for different functions, such as the frontal lobe (decision-making and problem-solving), parietal lobe (sensory information processing), occipital lobe (visual processing), and temporal lobe (hearing and memory).
9. Neurons in the brain can transmit electrical signals at speeds of up to 268 miles per hour (432 kilometers per hour).
10. The brain contains an estimated storage capacity of 2.5 petabytes, which is equivalent to three million hours of television shows.

These facts provide just a glimpse into the complexity and wonders of the human brain.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure.

The developers regularly update these codes, and players can visit a dedicated microsite to redeem them.

By redeeming these codes, players have the chance to win various in-game rewards like Rebel Academy Weapon Loot Crate, Revolt Weapon Loot Crate, Diamonds Voucher, and Fire Head Hunting Parachute. However, it's important to note that these codes are only available for a limited time (up to 12 hours) and for the first 500 users.

The article also provides a list of specific codes that were valid on November 10, 2023. It then guides players on how to redeem the Garena Free Fire Max codes. Players need to visit the game's official Rewards Redemption site, log in using their social media accounts, copy and paste the codes into the text box, and click on Confirm. The rewards will be delivered through the in-game mail section, and gold or diamonds will automatically be added to the account wallet. Players can then access the game vault to exchange the redeemed codes for gold and diamonds or use them to purchase various in-game items.

			<description>Can you help me write a persuasive letter to my boss requesting a raise?

Subject: Request for a Well-Deserved Raise

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss an important matter that has been on my mind for quite some time now. Over the past [time period], I have had the pleasure of working under your guidance and leadership, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience.

It is through this support that I have been able to grow both professionally and personally.

			<title>Samsung dives into Mixed Reality headset league with ‘Infinite,’ an Apple Vision Pro competitor: Report</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/gadgets/samsung-dives-into-mixed-reality-headset-league-with-infinite-an-apple-vision-pro-competitor-report-11699523246121.html</link>
			<description>Samsung is reportedly developing a mixed-reality headset, similar to Apple's Vision Pro. There have been ongoing discussions and speculation about the project, with some intriguing information available. The release of Apple's Vision Pro has supposedly led to the postponement of Samsung's XR headset launch, which was originally planned for this year. The rumored launch date for the Samsung headset is late 2024, and it may be codenamed "Infinite." Samsung is said to be collaborating with Google and Qualcomm on this project, and there are rumors that the headset could operate on an Android version and be powered by a Snapdragon chipset. It is speculated that Samsung may use Samsung Display's OLEDs for the display of the headset. However, all information surrounding the Samsung mixed reality headset is based on rumors and speculation, and official details have yet to be released. In other news, Samsung recently launched its generative AI model called Samsung Gauss at the company's AI forum 2023.</description>

The feature is being gradually rolled out for Android and iOS users. In addition, WhatsApp is reportedly developing voice message and sticker features, and there is a possibility of ads appearing in different locations, like status or channels.</description>

			<title>Apple's iMessage should be a 'core' service, Google tells EU. Here's what it means</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apples-imessage-should-be-a-core-service-google-tells-eu-heres-what-it-means-11699446745280.html</link>
			<description>Google, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, and Orange have written a letter to the European Commission urging them to regulate Apple's iMessage as a 'core' platform service under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA). They argue that designating iMessage as a 'core' service would benefit consumers by allowing enriched messaging features to be available across different platforms. The companies also highlight that currently, only Apple users can send enriched messages through iMessage, while others must rely on traditional SMS. Apple has responded by claiming that iMessage should not fall under the new rules because users do not directly pay for the service and Apple devices can be used without it. However, the Commission notes that iMessage indirectly contributes to increasing Apple's revenue and plays an important role in expanding its ecosystem. If iMessage is designated as a 'core' platform service, Apple will be required to make it interoperable with other similar messaging apps.</description>

			<description>Rockstar Games is reportedly set to announce the highly anticipated sequel to the Grand Theft Auto series, GTA VI, this week. The game's trailer may be released the following month as part of Rockstar Games' 25th anniversary celebrations. Grand Theft Auto V, the previous installment, is the second best-selling game of all time, with 185 million copies sold. Last year, hackers leaked early gameplay footage of GTA VI, which Rockstar attributed to a "network intrusion." To prevent burnout among employees, Rockstar has been working on improving work-life balance and addressing corporate culture issues. While details about GTA VI have been scarce, it is rumored to be set in a fictional version of Miami and will include both male and female protagonists. The developers are also said to be mindful of avoiding jokes that marginalize communities. Leaks suggest that the game could feature a modern-day Vice City-like setting with improved gameplay mechanics and AI.</description>
