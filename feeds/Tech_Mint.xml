			<title>Smartwatch sales rise in Q2</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/smartwatch-sales-rise-in-q2-11700069385341.html</link>
			<description>India's smartwatch market experienced significant growth in the September quarter, with a 32% sequential increase in shipments. The rise was driven by domestic brands focusing on offline retail, which saw a 58% surge in overall sales. In total, 16.9 million smartwatches were shipped during this period, accounting for one-third of all wearable devices. Offline retail channels accounted for 31.5% of all sales, up from 26.1% in the previous quarter. This strategy aims to boost market share for homegrown brands. The top five smartwatch brands in India are all domestic. Brands are employing high-decibel marketing campaigns and promotions to drive shipments in the December quarter and anticipate strong double-digit annual growth. The availability of easy affordability plans at physical retailers also contributed to the growth of smartwatches.</description>

This partnership is expected to benefit both companies, with Amazon also having similar partnerships with Instagram and Pinterest. Earlier this year, Snap and Amazon collaborated on augmented reality eyeglass try-on experiences.</description>

			<description>OpenAI has temporarily paused accepting new users for its paid ChatGPT Plus service due to overwhelming demand. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the development and stated that they want to ensure everyone has a great experience. Users can still sign up to be notified within the app when subscriptions reopen. OpenAI revealed that approximately 100 million people use their services every week, and over 90% of Fortune 500 businesses are building tools on their platform. OpenAI recently announced their powerful language model, GPT-4 Turbo, which has a larger context window and is more powerful and updated than the previous GPT-4 version. Altman launched a beta program for developers to fine-tune GPT-4 models, and OpenAI also launched its custom models program, enabling users to build customized bots. OpenAI plans to launch a GPT Store where people can share their GPTs and earn money based on the number of users. GPT-4 Turbo comes with a larger context window and is cheaper for developers to use compared to GPT-4.</description>

			<description>The mobile gaming industry in India is experiencing wider popularity due to mainstream broadcast deals and increased willingness of users to pay for games.

			<title>Google fined $164,000 for failing to store users’ data on servers in Russia</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/russian-court-imposes-164-000-fine-on-google-for-failing-to-store-users-data-on-servers-in-russia-11699959502951.html</link>
			<description>A Russian court has fined Google 15 million roubles ($164,000) for refusing to store Russian users' data on servers within the country. This follows previous fines imposed on the company for the same charges in August 2021 and June 2022. These fines were given under a Russian law that requires foreign companies to localize the personal data of their Russian users. In addition to these legal issues, Google's Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after its bank account was seized by Russian authorities, leading to difficulties in paying staff and vendors. While Twitter and Facebook are banned in Russia, access to Google's services, search engine, and YouTube remains free. Apple and the Wikimedia Foundation have also faced fines from Russian courts in the past. In other news, YouTube will soon implement a policy update requiring video creators to disclose when they upload manipulated or synthetic content that appears realistic. This includes videos created using artificial intelligence tools. Starting from December 1, Google plans to delete certain personal data, including Gmail messages, Google Photos libraries, Google Calendar appointments, and Google Docs archives. The company had previously sent out emails warning users about the upcoming deletions.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Elon Musk, the world's richest man and Tesla CEO, apologized to India's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, for not being able to meet him during a visit to Tesla's factory in California. Musk expressed his honor at Goyal's visit and showed optimism about meeting the minister at a later date. Goyal praised India's contribution to Tesla's journey and mentioned the crucial role played by Indian engineers and finance professionals within the company. He also stated that Tesla is on track to double its component imports from India. Goyal's visit coincides with speculation about the Indian government granting tax concessions to Tesla for establishing an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in India. The Indian government is reportedly considering reducing the duty on electric vehicles to 15%, although it has yet to be agreed upon. Tesla has requested an initial concession on customs duty levied on imported cars in India, where vehicles priced below $40,000 face a 70% import duty, while those priced above $40,000 attract a 100% import duty.</description>

			<title>GTA 6 leaks: Launch date, new weapons and everything you should know</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/gta-6-leaks-launch-date-new-weapons-and-everything-you-should-know-11699872129922.html</link>
			<description>Rockstar Games has provided some information about the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6), including that the game's trailer will be released next month as part of the company's 25th anniversary celebrations. Although details about characters and gameplay remain a secret, a leaked document from last year has hinted at potential features. The leaked information suggests that players can expect a range of weapons and tools, including an auto-dialer, various golf clubs, a crowbar, and a cut-off tool for unlocking doors and containers. There may also be a slim jim for opening older cars and an immobilizer bypass for accessing modern vehicles. The game might also include a tracker jammer device to avoid being detected by law enforcement. In terms of health recovery, players could potentially use items like food, drinks, painkillers, and trauma kits, with cigarettes potentially providing an adrenaline or stamina boost. Other potential items in the game could include a torch, USB drive, and binoculars, while characters might carry duffle bags or backpacks to store valuables. The leaked information also suggests that GTA 6 could feature a lineup of weapons similar to those seen in GTA 5, including guns, grenades, and melee weapons. However, it's important to note that all the information is based on leaks and rumors and should be taken with caution until there is official confirmation from Rockstar Games.</description>

			<title>Thinking of upgrading? Here’s the Mark Gurman's advice on M3 MacBook Pro and iMac model</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/thinking-of-upgrading-here-s-the-mark-gurmans-advice-on-m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-model-11699859810887.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple recently unveiled its latest Mac devices, including the m3, m3 Pro, and m3 Max chips. The event also showcased updated MacBook Pros and the first refresh of the iMac in nearly three years. Analyst Mark Gurman from Bloomberg provided insights on whether these devices are worth choosing or if it's better to wait for the next release. Gurman commented that the new 24-inch iMac, equipped with the latest Apple M3 chip, is fast but not groundbreaking. The iMac maintained its existing color options. The MacBook Pro introduced a new space black color, but Gurman noted that the speed improvement is not revolutionary. Gurman advised waiting for another generation or two if you have a Macbook Pro with an M1 chip, and if you have an M1 iMac, patience may be rewarded with a larger release. However, for those still using an Intel-based Mac, transitioning to Apple silicon is recommended as it offers significant performance upgrades and improved battery life. Gurman also mentioned the introduction of three M3 chips during the event and noted that there was no mention of the rumored M3 Ultra chip. Historical patterns suggest the M3 Ultra chip could feature twice the CPU and GPU cores and support for up to 256GB of RAM.</description>

			<title>'Ambitious and compelling': Apple plans to bring Gen AI and other key features to iOS 18</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/ambitious-and-compelling-apple-plans-to-bring-gen-ai-and-other-key-features-to-ios-18-11699848427018.html</link>
			<description>Apple has released its latest operating system upgrade, iOS 17, to the public. However, the company is already working on iOS 18, which will be announced at next year's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. iOS 18 is important because Apple will not bring a hardware upgrade to the iPhone 16, instead focusing on new software upgrades to attract customers. Apple is also betting on generative AI to compete with Google and OpenAI. The upcoming operating system is described as "ambitious and compelling" and could bring improvements in features, design, security, and performance. Apple's head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, decided to freeze development work on new major software updates to debug and improve performance. This move is similar to what Apple did in 2019 when bugs and feature delays affected iPhone launches. Apple's policy, "the pact," ensures that any regressions or glitches caused by new features are fixed immediately.</description>

The woman ordered expensive items, including a ₹10,000 hukka and a ₹15,000 wine bottle. She then threatened the man, saying that the restaurant owner could damage his car if he didn't pay the bill.

In one case, a man was scammed out of ₹15,886 after meeting a woman on the app. After paying the bill, the man realized he had been scammed when the woman disappeared and ignored his calls.</description>

			<title>Google Chrome starts rolling out Material You redesign; here is everything new</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/google-chrome-starts-rolling-out-material-you-redesign-here-is-everything-new-11699689772356.html</link>
			<description>Google Chrome recently celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced plans for a refreshed design. The upcoming changes will include the incorporation of the material you theme, featuring more rounded corners, updated icons, and the removal of the lock icon from the address bar. This marks the first major transformation for Chrome in five years. The redesign aims to enhance legibility, introduce new color palettes, and better integrate with operating systems. Despite these changes, the overall layout and appearance of the browser will remain familiar. Notably, there will be a new drop-down menu to display open tabs and recently closed ones, and horizontal tabs at the top will appear as small pills when hovered over. The absence of the lock icon is justified by the widespread adoption of HTTPS, and it is replaced by a settings icon for connection security and other options. Additionally, there are new outlined style icons and a range of bright material you color palettes. Quick access to bookmarks, reading lists, and history is facilitated through the side panel icon. Overall, the redesign aims to provide a fresh look and improved features for Google Chrome users.</description>

			<title>iOS 17.2 Beta 2: Apple takes steps to retire iTunes Movie Store, suggests report</title>

			<description>Apple has released the iOS 17.2 public beta 2, which includes new features such as spatial video recording and a journal app for iPhones. However, a less-talked-about change suggests that Apple is taking steps to retire the dedicated iTunes movie store. Code strings indicate that iPhone users will eventually receive a notification stating that iTunes movies are moving to the Apple TV app. The TV app has been updated with a new sidebar for easier navigation, and speculation suggests that additional changes will make the iTunes movie store obsolete. The movies and TV shows tabs will be removed from the iTunes store, but users can still access them until the global release of iOS 17.2. Additionally, the update introduces spatial video recording exclusively for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and extends the sensitive contact warning feature to include contact posters in certain apps.</description>

			<description>Google plans to delete inactive Gmail accounts as part of a policy shift. If a Gmail account remains unused for more than two years, it may be deleted along with its associated content within Google Workspace. This change in policy aims to address potential security breaches and leaks, as inactive accounts are less likely to have two-factor authentication configured. Google advises users to log in at least once every two years to prevent their accounts from becoming inactive. In other news, Google is expanding its car crash detection feature on Pixel phones to include India and four other countries.</description>

			<description>Airlines are businesses that provide air transportation services for passengers and cargo. They operate by owning or leasing aircraft, scheduling flights, and selling tickets to customers.

Here are the steps to start an airline company:

1. Market Research: Conduct thorough research to identify if there is a demand for your airline services in the intended market. Consider factors such as competition, target audience, and potential routes.

2. Business Plan: Develop a detailed business plan outlining your goals, strategies, financial projections, marketing plans, and operational procedures. This plan will serve as a blueprint for your airline company and help attract investors if needed.

3. Financing: Determine how you will finance your airline startup. This can involve personal funds, loans, or investments from private investors or venture capitalists. Consider the costs of acquiring aircraft, hiring staff, marketing, insurance, maintenance, and other operational expenses.

4. Legal Requirements: Understand and comply with the legal requirements for starting an airline in the country where you intend to operate. This may include obtaining licenses, permits, certifications, and adhering to aviation regulations and safety standards.

5. Fleet Acquisition: Decide what type of aircraft your airline will operate and acquire them either through purchase or lease agreements. Consider factors like the number of seats, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and compatibility with your target routes.

6. Infrastructure: Establish a physical presence for your airline, including office space, check-in counters at airports, maintenance facilities, and a reservation system.

7. Staffing: Hire employees for various roles such as pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, customer service representatives, and administrative staff. Ensure they meet the necessary qualifications and have appropriate training.

8. Route Planning: Determine the routes your airline will operate on based on market demand, profitability, and competition. Consider factors such as distance, frequency of flights, and potential partnerships with other airlines.

9. Marketing and Branding: Develop a strong brand identity and marketing strategy to attract customers. Utilize various marketing channels such as digital advertising, social media, partnerships, and promotions.

10. Launch Operations: Once all the necessary preparations are in place, start operating flights according to your planned schedule. Monitor performance, gather customer feedback, and make improvements based on the market response.

Remember that starting an airline is a complex and capital-intensive endeavor. Seek professional advice from experts in the aviation industry and consult with legal and financial advisors to ensure compliance and proper planning.</description>

			<description>Sure, I'm here to help! How can I assist you today?Here are some interesting facts about the human brain:

1. The human brain weighs approximately 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) and is made up of about 100 billion neurons.
2. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right, which are responsible for different functions. The left hemisphere is often associated with logic, language, and analytical thinking, while the right hemisphere is linked to creativity, intuition, and emotions.
3. The brain is one of the most energy-consuming organs in the body, accounting for about 20% of the body's total energy usage.
4. The brain has no pain receptors, so it cannot feel pain. However, it can perceive pain signals from other parts of the body.
5. The brain is composed of about 75-80% water, which helps cushion and protect it from injury.
6. Despite popular belief, humans do not use only 10% of their brains. Every part of the brain has a specific function, and even small-scale damage can have significant effects on the body.
7. The brain is capable of generating approximately 23 watts of power, enough to power a dim light bulb.
8. The human brain comprises several areas responsible for different functions, such as the frontal lobe (decision-making and problem-solving), parietal lobe (sensory information processing), occipital lobe (visual processing), and temporal lobe (hearing and memory).
9. Neurons in the brain can transmit electrical signals at speeds of up to 268 miles per hour (432 kilometers per hour).
10. The brain contains an estimated storage capacity of 2.5 petabytes, which is equivalent to three million hours of television shows.

These facts provide just a glimpse into the complexity and wonders of the human brain.</description>

			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/garena-free-fire-max-redeem-codes-for-nov-10-2023-grab-daily-exciting-gifts-11699592359521.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses Garena Free Fire Max redeem codes, which can be used to obtain in-game items such as weapons, diamonds, and skins. These codes are 12-digit alphanumeric combinations that consist of capital letters and numbers. Garena Free Fire Max is a revamped version of Garena Free Fire that gained popularity after the ban of the former by the Indian government. The developers regularly update these codes, and players can visit a dedicated microsite to redeem them.

By redeeming these codes, players have the chance to win various in-game rewards like Rebel Academy Weapon Loot Crate, Revolt Weapon Loot Crate, Diamonds Voucher, and Fire Head Hunting Parachute. However, it's important to note that these codes are only available for a limited time (up to 12 hours) and for the first 500 users. Users are encouraged to redeem the codes quickly before they expire.

The article also provides a list of specific codes that were valid on November 10, 2023. It then guides players on how to redeem the Garena Free Fire Max codes. Players need to visit the game's official Rewards Redemption site, log in using their social media accounts, copy and paste the codes into the text box, and click on Confirm. The rewards will be delivered through the in-game mail section, and gold or diamonds will automatically be added to the account wallet. Players can then access the game vault to exchange the redeemed codes for gold and diamonds or use them to purchase various in-game items.

Additionally, the article briefly mentions that Livemint is the fastest growing news website globally and encourages readers to explore premium stories and download the Mint News App for daily market updates and live business news.</description>

			<description>Can you help me write a persuasive letter to my boss requesting a raise?

Subject: Request for a Well-Deserved Raise

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss an important matter that has been on my mind for quite some time now. Over the past [time period], I have had the pleasure of working under your guidance and leadership, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience.

It is through this support that I have been able to grow both professionally and personally.

			<title>Samsung dives into Mixed Reality headset league with ‘Infinite,’ an Apple Vision Pro competitor: Report</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/gadgets/samsung-dives-into-mixed-reality-headset-league-with-infinite-an-apple-vision-pro-competitor-report-11699523246121.html</link>
			<description>Samsung is reportedly developing a mixed-reality headset, similar to Apple's Vision Pro. There have been ongoing discussions and speculation about the project, with some intriguing information available. The release of Apple's Vision Pro has supposedly led to the postponement of Samsung's XR headset launch, which was originally planned for this year. The rumored launch date for the Samsung headset is late 2024, and it may be codenamed "Infinite." Samsung is said to be collaborating with Google and Qualcomm on this project, and there are rumors that the headset could operate on an Android version and be powered by a Snapdragon chipset. It is speculated that Samsung may use Samsung Display's OLEDs for the display of the headset. However, all information surrounding the Samsung mixed reality headset is based on rumors and speculation, and official details have yet to be released. In other news, Samsung recently launched its generative AI model called Samsung Gauss at the company's AI forum 2023.</description>

The feature is being gradually rolled out for Android and iOS users. In addition, WhatsApp is reportedly developing voice message and sticker features, and there is a possibility of ads appearing in different locations, like status or channels.</description>

			<title>Apple's iMessage should be a 'core' service, Google tells EU. Here's what it means</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apples-imessage-should-be-a-core-service-google-tells-eu-heres-what-it-means-11699446745280.html</link>
			<description>Google, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, and Orange have written a letter to the European Commission urging them to regulate Apple's iMessage as a 'core' platform service under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA). They argue that designating iMessage as a 'core' service would benefit consumers by allowing enriched messaging features to be available across different platforms. The companies also highlight that currently, only Apple users can send enriched messages through iMessage, while others must rely on traditional SMS. Apple has responded by claiming that iMessage should not fall under the new rules because users do not directly pay for the service and Apple devices can be used without it. However, the Commission notes that iMessage indirectly contributes to increasing Apple's revenue and plays an important role in expanding its ecosystem. If iMessage is designated as a 'core' platform service, Apple will be required to make it interoperable with other similar messaging apps.</description>

			<description>Rockstar Games is reportedly set to announce the highly anticipated sequel to the Grand Theft Auto series, GTA VI, this week. The game's trailer may be released the following month as part of Rockstar Games' 25th anniversary celebrations. Grand Theft Auto V, the previous installment, is the second best-selling game of all time, with 185 million copies sold. Last year, hackers leaked early gameplay footage of GTA VI, which Rockstar attributed to a "network intrusion." To prevent burnout among employees, Rockstar has been working on improving work-life balance and addressing corporate culture issues. While details about GTA VI have been scarce, it is rumored to be set in a fictional version of Miami and will include both male and female protagonists. The developers are also said to be mindful of avoiding jokes that marginalize communities. Leaks suggest that the game could feature a modern-day Vice City-like setting with improved gameplay mechanics and AI.</description>
