			<title>Google Chrome starts rolling out Material You redesign; here is everything new</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/google-chrome-starts-rolling-out-material-you-redesign-here-is-everything-new-11699689772356.html</link>
			<description>Google Chrome recently celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced plans for a refreshed design. The upcoming changes will include the incorporation of the material you theme, featuring more rounded corners, updated icons, and the removal of the lock icon from the address bar. This marks the first major transformation for Chrome in five years. The redesign aims to enhance legibility, introduce new color palettes, and better integrate with operating systems. Despite these changes, the overall layout and appearance of the browser will remain familiar. Notably, there will be a new drop-down menu to display open tabs and recently closed ones, and horizontal tabs at the top will appear as small pills when hovered over. The absence of the lock icon is justified by the widespread adoption of HTTPS, and it is replaced by a settings icon for connection security and other options. Additionally, there are new outlined style icons and a range of bright material you color palettes. Quick access to bookmarks, reading lists, and history is facilitated through the side panel icon. Overall, the redesign aims to provide a fresh look and improved features for Google Chrome users.</description>

			<title>iOS 17.2 Beta 2: Apple takes steps to retire iTunes Movie Store, suggests report</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/ios-17-2-beta-2-apple-takes-steps-to-retire-itunes-movie-store-suggests-report-11699685691100.html</link>
			<description>Apple has released the iOS 17.2 public beta 2, which includes new features such as spatial video recording and a journal app for iPhones. However, a less-talked-about change suggests that Apple is taking steps to retire the dedicated iTunes movie store. Code strings indicate that iPhone users will eventually receive a notification stating that iTunes movies are moving to the Apple TV app. The TV app has been updated with a new sidebar for easier navigation, and speculation suggests that additional changes will make the iTunes movie store obsolete. The movies and TV shows tabs will be removed from the iTunes store, but users can still access them until the global release of iOS 17.2. Additionally, the update introduces spatial video recording exclusively for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and extends the sensitive contact warning feature to include contact posters in certain apps.</description>

			<description>Google plans to delete inactive Gmail accounts as part of a policy shift. If a Gmail account remains unused for more than two years, it may be deleted along with its associated content within Google Workspace. This change in policy aims to address potential security breaches and leaks, as inactive accounts are less likely to have two-factor authentication configured. Google advises users to log in at least once every two years to prevent their accounts from becoming inactive. In other news, Google is expanding its car crash detection feature on Pixel phones to include India and four other countries.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.An Oklahoma woman credits her Apple Watch for saving her life by alerting her to an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. Initially considering delaying a doctor's visit, she was persuaded by the watch notification and the encouragement of those around her to seek medical attention. The visit to the doctor led to a surprising diagnosis of diabetes and elevated blood sugar levels, indicating that the Apple Watch's initial alert played a crucial role in identifying these conditions. The woman's daughter also expressed gratitude for the life-saving diagnosis and contacted Apple CEO Tim Cook, who responded on the same day and expressed his happiness that Apple's technology had safeguarded her life. The Apple Watch has become an essential part of the woman's daily routine and is credited with saving her life.</description>

			<title>Samsung dives into Mixed Reality headset league with ‘Infinite,’ an Apple Vision Pro competitor: Report</title>

			<description>Samsung is reportedly developing a mixed-reality headset, similar to Apple's Vision Pro. There have been ongoing discussions and speculation about the project, with some intriguing information available. The release of Apple's Vision Pro has supposedly led to the postponement of Samsung's XR headset launch, which was originally planned for this year. The rumored launch date for the Samsung headset is late 2024, and it may be codenamed "Infinite." Samsung is said to be collaborating with Google and Qualcomm on this project, and there are rumors that the headset could operate on an Android version and be powered by a Snapdragon chipset. It is speculated that Samsung may use Samsung Display's OLEDs for the display of the headset. However, all information surrounding the Samsung mixed reality headset is based on rumors and speculation, and official details have yet to be released. In other news, Samsung recently launched its generative AI model called Samsung Gauss at the company's AI forum 2023.</description>

The feature is being gradually rolled out for Android and iOS users. In addition, WhatsApp is reportedly developing voice message and sticker features, and there is a possibility of ads appearing in different locations, like status or channels.</description>

			<title>Apple's iMessage should be a 'core' service, Google tells EU. Here's what it means</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apples-imessage-should-be-a-core-service-google-tells-eu-heres-what-it-means-11699446745280.html</link>
			<description>Google, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, and Orange have written a letter to the European Commission urging them to regulate Apple's iMessage as a 'core' platform service under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA). They argue that designating iMessage as a 'core' service would benefit consumers by allowing enriched messaging features to be available across different platforms. The companies also highlight that currently, only Apple users can send enriched messages through iMessage, while others must rely on traditional SMS. Apple has responded by claiming that iMessage should not fall under the new rules because users do not directly pay for the service and Apple devices can be used without it. However, the Commission notes that iMessage indirectly contributes to increasing Apple's revenue and plays an important role in expanding its ecosystem. If iMessage is designated as a 'core' platform service, Apple will be required to make it interoperable with other similar messaging apps.</description>

			<title>GTA VI likely to be announced this week. Launch date, new characters and everything we know so far</title>
			<link>https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/gta-vi-to-be-announced-next-week-heres-what-new-report-suggests-rockstar-games-11699422095476.html</link>
			<description>Rockstar Games is reportedly set to announce the highly anticipated sequel to the Grand Theft Auto series, GTA VI, this week. The game's trailer may be released the following month as part of Rockstar Games' 25th anniversary celebrations. Grand Theft Auto V, the previous installment, is the second best-selling game of all time, with 185 million copies sold. Last year, hackers leaked early gameplay footage of GTA VI, which Rockstar attributed to a "network intrusion." To prevent burnout among employees, Rockstar has been working on improving work-life balance and addressing corporate culture issues. While details about GTA VI have been scarce, it is rumored to be set in a fictional version of Miami and will include both male and female protagonists. The developers are also said to be mindful of avoiding jokes that marginalize communities. Leaks suggest that the game could feature a modern-day Vice City-like setting with improved gameplay mechanics and AI.</description>
