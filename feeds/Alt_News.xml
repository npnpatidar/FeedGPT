            <description>Summary: 
A viral video showing individuals in police uniforms being assaulted is being shared on social media with the claim that the incident happened in Rajasthan and the attackers are from the Muslim community. However, fact-checking reveals that the incident actually took place in Kaliaganj, West Bengal in April 2023. The assault occurred after a video of policemen dragging the body of a minor tribal girl through the street had surfaced. The girl had been allegedly raped and murdered. The video being circulated is unrelated to Rajasthan and is not communal in nature. It is important to verify information before making claims based on viral videos.</description>

            <title>No, Salzburg Airport does not have a help desk for travellers who mistake Austria for Australia</title>
            <link>https://www.altnews.in/no-salzburg-airport-does-not-have-a-help-desk-for-travellers-who-mistook-austria-for-australia/</link>
            <description>#### Summary:

A viral picture of a signboard claiming that Salzburg Airport in Austria has a special desk for travelers who accidentally flew to Austria instead of Australia has been circulating on social media. However, it has been confirmed that the signboard is an advertisement by Commend Internationals, an intercom company based in Austria. Salzburg Airport made an official statement clarifying that no such help desk exists. The viral picture is a marketing gimmick and not an actual help desk at the airport.

#### Verification and Details:

The viral picture shows a signboard with the text, "Sorry, this is Austria not Australia! Need help? Please press the button. Commend provides Security and Communication. From Salzburg to the rest of the world. Even for the most unlikely of situations." Several users on social media claimed that Salzburg Airport in Austria has a special desk for travelers who accidentally flew to Austria instead of Australia.

However, it has been verified that the signboard is an advertisement by Commend Internationals, an intercom company based in Austria. Salzburg Airport made an official statement on its Facebook page clarifying that the signboard was a marketing gimmick and that no such help desk exists at the airport. The statement mentioned, "NO, such a switch has never existed! It was just a genius advertising idea from our customer Commend International, who advertised at the airport with the slogan 'Austria not Australia!'" [[SOURCE 1]]

A closer look at the viral image also reveals that the signboard is placed in front of the luggage area in the airport, further confirming that it is an advertisement and not an actual help desk.

In conclusion, the claim that Salzburg Airport in Austria has a special desk for travelers who accidentally flew to Austria instead of Australia is false. The viral picture is an advertisement by Commend Internationals and does not represent an actual help desk at the airport.

#### Additional Information:

The viral picture and claim were shared on social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram. The tweet by the verified account @Britain_People received over 1,608 views, 40 likes, and 16 retweets. An Instagram page, @traveltipsbyjackie, also amplified the claim in a video that has been played over 30 million times and has garnered over 18,766 comments. However, it is important to note that the claim is not true and the signboard is a marketing gimmick.

    <item><title>Dead man in Gaza opening his eyes? No, viral video is from a funeral management course in Malaysia</title><link>https://www.altnews.in/dead-man-in-gaza-opening-his-eyes-no-viral-video-is-from-a-funeral-management-course-in-malaysia/</link><description>The Israel-Gaza war has been ongoing for a month, and the health ministry in Gaza has reported a high number of casualties. According to their data, over 9,700 Palestinians, including 4,800 children, have been killed in the territory. However, there have been doubts raised by the Israeli government and pro-Israel commentators regarding Gaza's claims of death and destruction.

In the midst of this, a video has been widely shared on social media, showing bodies covered in white shrouds lying on the ground. One man, partially covered in a shroud, can be seen opening his eyes. The video includes a Persian text that translates to: "I don't know if the problem is with the Israeli bullets or something else, but apparently they are the same. One is coming alive."

A parody account of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, shared this clip on social media, stating that the man's condition had been "upgraded to alive." The tweet gained significant attention and was retweeted thousands of times. Israeli journalist Eddie Cohen also shared the same clip, emphasizing the movement of the supposedly deceased man.

Further investigation into the video revealed that it was originally posted on TikTok by a user from Malaysia before the recent Hamas attack in Israel. The video was part of a Funeral Management course, where volunteers acted as deceased bodies for demonstration purposes. This confirmed that the video was unrelated to the Israel-Gaza war.

It is important to note that the amplification of such videos and images aims to challenge Palestine's claims of the human cost of the war. This aligns with previous instances where Israel and pro-Israel influencers have attempted to discredit Palestinian accounts of casualties. Misinformation and false claims have been circulated, including footage of a deceased child being labeled as a "doll" and survivors being called "actors."

In conclusion, the viral video of a man dressed as a corpse opening his eyes is not connected to the Israel-Gaza war. It originated from a Funeral Management course in Malaysia. The spread of such videos reflects a broader effort by Israel and pro-Israel influencers to undermine Palestine's claims of the human toll of the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 15:20:49 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><ns0:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Viral video of Israeli forces taking away boy from West Bank camp is 8-year-old</title><link>https://www.altnews.in/2015-video-of-israeli-soldiers-detaining-palestinian-boy-has-been-shared-as-recent/</link><description>The article discusses a video that is being widely shared on social media showing soldiers in uniform forcefully detaining a young child. A bystander who protests against this is pushed off by the officers. The video has sparked outrage, with users expressing concern about the treatment of Palestinian children by Israeli soldiers. However, it is revealed that the video is from 2015 and shows Israeli forces detaining a six-year-old boy and an activist in a Palestinian refugee camp. The boy was later released, but the activist was kept in custody. The article concludes that the video is being shared without any context amid the recent conflict between Israel and Palestine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 10:09:16 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><ns0:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>No, the shrouded corpse is not ‘moving its head’ in the viral video; yet another false claim by Israel’s official X handle</title><link>https://www.altnews.in/no-the-shrouded-corpse-is-not-moving-its-head-in-the-viral-video-yet-another-false-claim-by-israels-official-x-handle/</link><description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding a viral video that claims Palestinians are faking injuries and deaths during the Israel-Gaza war. The video shows a woman mourning next to bodies covered in shrouds, and pro-Israel social media influencers have amplified the conspiracy theory that the bodies are moving and that Palestinians are play-acting. Israeli official accounts and influential figures, including the official X account of the Embassy of Israel to the United States, tweeted the video and accused Hamas of using "fake news and propaganda to lie to the world." However, fact-checking organizations have debunked these claims, and the original video does not show the body moving. The video was shot by a Palestinian journalist, and he refuted the claims, providing the unedited video and additional images taken at the Al-Aqsa hospital in Gaza. The article highlights that these false claims are part of a larger effort by Israel and pro-Israel influencers to question Palestine's claims of the human cost of the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 06:13:06 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><ns0:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Aircraft set on fire: Old video falsely viral as visuals of Pakistan airbase attack</title><link>https://www.altnews.in/aircraft-set-on-fire-old-video-falsely-viral-as-visuals-of-pakistan-airbase-attack/</link><description>According to an article, a video of a Pakistani aircraft in flames has gone viral on social media, with users claiming that the visuals are from an attack on an air force base in Mianwali, Pakistan. However, it has been found that the video is actually from May 2023 and shows supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan setting fire to a Chinese Shenyang F-6 dummy aircraft outside the Mianwali air base. The video has been falsely attributed to the November 4 terror attack at the Pakistani airbase. Verified profiles on social media, including Megh Updates, FrontalForce, and several others, initially shared the video with false claims. It is important to note that Megh Updates is known for sharing misinformation regularly on the platform. The video was later taken down by Megh Updates. The Hindustan Times and Business Today had previously reported on the incident in May 2023, stating that protests had broken out after the arrest of Imran Khan, and his supporters had set fire to the dummy aircraft outside the Mianwali air base. EurAsian Times also tweeted the video in May 2023, confirming that it showed a dummy aircraft being set ablaze by the public outside a Pakistan Air Force base in Mianwali.</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 16:57:13 +0000</pubDate><ai_summary>True</ai_summary><ns0:thumbnail url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /><ns0:content url="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" medium="image" /></item><item><title>Did MP CM Shivraj Singh say ‘Do anything but stop Kamal Nath’?: No, video tampered with fake audio</title><link>https://www.altnews.in/did-mp-cm-shivraj-singh-say-do-anything-but-stop-kamal-nath-no-video-tampered-with-fake-audio/</link><description>The article discusses a viral video of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan that is being widely circulated on social media. In the video, Chouhan is heard expressing his inhibitions about losing the election against Congress leader and former chief minister Kamal Nath. However, it has been determined that the audio in the video is fake and has been tampered with. The original video, posted by Asian News International (ANI) on June 13, 2023, shows Chouhan holding a review meeting with ministers and officials regarding a fire incident at Bhopal's Satpura Bhawan. The video has no audio, and there is no mention of Kamal Nath or any comments about the upcoming Madhya Pradesh elections in the reports about the meeting. Therefore, the viral video is unrelated to the elections, and the claims made in it are false.

It is important to be cautious when consuming and sharing videos on social media, as they can be manipulated or taken out of context. Verifying the authenticity of the content and relying on credible sources is crucial to avoid spreading misinformation.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.#### Summary:

A viral video circulating on social media shows a man falling off a hoverboard and exploding into flames. The video has been shared with claims that the man is a suicide bomber. However, our fact-check reveals that the video was edited. The original video, titled "Араб на гироскутере" (translation: Arab on gyro-scooters), was uploaded to YouTube in 2015 and shows the man falling off the hoverboard without any explosion. The claim of a bomb blast or explosion is false.

#### Context and Background:

The video in question shows a man wearing a white kaftan falling off a hoverboard and exploding into flames. It has been shared on social media with claims that the man is a suicide bomber who exploded after falling off the hoverboard. However, our fact-check reveals that the video was edited and manipulated to create a false narrative.

#### Verification and Debunking:

To verify the authenticity of the video, a reverse image search was conducted on one of the key-frames using Invid software. This led to a 2015 YouTube video titled "Араб на гироскутере" (translation: Arab on gyro-scooters). The original video shows the man falling off the hoverboard without any explosion.

Additionally, a 2015 report by Daily Mail titled "Painful moment man is sent hurtling down the road face-first after he loses his balance on speeding hoverboard in Dubai" features the original video. The report describes the incident as an unfortunate fall and does not mention any bomb blast or explosion.

Based on this information, it is clear that the claim of a bomb blast or explosion in the viral video is false.

#### Conclusion:

In conclusion, the viral video showing a man falling off a hoverboard and exploding into flames is edited and manipulated. The original video from 2015 does not show any explosion.

A viral video clip of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been altered to misrepresent his statement about Hindutva ideology. The clip suggests that Modi said Hindutva is only a card for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to play for electoral gains. However, in the original video, Modi actually stated that Hindutva is not a card used by the BJP for electoral campaigns. The altered clip has been shared on social media, leading to confusion and misinterpretation of Modi's statement.

#### Context and Analysis:

The viral video clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been shared on social media with altered captions, suggesting that Modi sees Hindutva ideology as a mere card for electoral purposes. However, a closer look at the original video reveals that the altered clip misrepresents Modi's statement.

The original video, which was published by Zee News on September 17, 2022, features an interview with Prime Minister Modi on the occasion of his 72nd birthday. At the 10:27 mark of the interview, the viral bit begins. In the longer version of the video, Modi can be clearly heard saying in Hindi, "Hindutva has never been an electoral slogan for Bharatiya Janata Party, it is an article of faith for us. It is not a card to play in regards to electoral campaign" [[1]](https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/02/19/violent-cow-protection-india/vigilante-groups-attack-minorities).

The altered clip, however, removes the crucial part where Modi emphasizes that Hindutva is not used as a card for electoral gains. This alteration changes the meaning of Modi's statement and creates a false narrative that Hindutva is merely a political tool for the BJP.

It is important to note that Hindutva is a political ideology that seeks to promote Hindu culture and values. The BJP, which Modi is a member of, is often associated with Hindutva ideology. By misrepresenting Modi's statement, the altered clip aims to create a negative perception of the BJP's stance on Hindutva.

#### Conclusion:

The viral video clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been altered to misrepresent his statement about Hindutva ideology. The original video clearly shows that Modi stated that Hindutva is not a card used by the BJP for electoral campaigns. The altered clip removes this crucial part of his statement, creating a false narrative. It is important to be cautious of manipulated videos and to verify information from reliable sources before drawing conclusions.
