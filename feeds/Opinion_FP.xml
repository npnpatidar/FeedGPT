			<title>Why Pakistan Army and establishment find itself in a Catch-22 situation while dealing with Imran Khan</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pakistan-army-and-establishment-find-itself-in-a-catch-22-situation-while-dealing-with-imran-khan-13818336.html</link>
			<description>There is growing speculation about a possible deal between Imran Khan and Pakistan's establishment. This potential agreement is causing anxiety among ruling political parties who see maintaining friction between Khan and the establishment as their only chance of survival. The establishment, however, seeks a safe exit from the increasingly volatile situation. Following the violent events of May 9th, 2023, the focus has been on pinning responsibility on Khan. Despite being in custody at the time, he remains Pakistan's most popular leader, with widespread support across age, socio-economic, and ethnic divides. Khan's rise has challenged the status quo and the establishment's traditional control over Pakistani politics. His opponents and the establishment have attempted to discredit him through a series of legal cases, but their efforts have ultimately failed to diminish his popularity. 


The writer argues that Khan's rejection of corruption and his unwavering commitment to his vision for Pakistan make him a threat to the existing political order.</description>

			<title>Quad is a tool for India to further its strategic interests</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/quad-is-a-tool-for-india-to-further-its-strategic-interests-13818256.html</link>
			<description>The recent Quad summit, where India reaffirmed the coalition's commitment to a rule-based order, highlighted  geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific. While the group declaration avoided naming China, concerns about its assertiveness were evident, particularly from the US.  India's unique position as the only Quad member sharing a land border with China adds complexity to its approach. 

The US-India relationship faces challenges, including differences over Russia sanctions, with the US expressing concerns about India's neutrality in the Ukraine conflict. However, both sides recognize the importance of their partnership.  India's strategic autonomy requires a delicate balancing act, particularly considering the recent thawing of ties between India and China.</description>

			<title>Why did American company block its website after Lebanon pager explosions?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-did-american-company-block-its-website-after-lebanon-pager-explosions-13818161.html</link>
			<description>An Israeli operation involving exploding pagers targeting Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon has garnered international attention. The pagers, manufactured by Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo, were laced with PETN explosives, killing and injuring hundreds. 

Israel claims it acted to prevent Hezbollah from carrying out attacks, while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had previously warned against using mobile phones for fear of Israeli surveillance.

Gold Apollo initially denied involvement but later claimed a Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, was responsible for manufacturing the pagers under its brand. However, BAC is a shell company with minimal operations and is now denying any role in the incident. Another suspect, a Bulgarian company, Norta Global, has also vanished from public records, casting further suspicion on its connection to the explosive pagers. 

Given the lack of transparency surrounding the origins of the pagers and the involvement of several shell companies, the incident raises concerns about accountability and the potential for exploitation of international trade for covert operations.</description>

			<title>White House meeting with Khalistanis just ahead of Modiâ€™s visit is a provocation, humiliation and betrayal of trust</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/white-house-meeting-with-khalistanis-just-ahead-of-modis-visit-a-provocation-humiliation-and-betrayal-of-trust-13818137.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States, highlighting a perceived discrepancy between the positive portrayals of the relationship and actions that undermine trust.  

While a semiconductor fabrication agreement and participation in the Quad Leaders' Summit are presented as achievements, the article criticizes a meeting between US National Security Council officials and Khalistani separatists prior to Modi's arrival. This meeting, considered a provocation by the author, is seen as a transgression of India's red lines and a signal of US containment strategies despite promoting strategic engagement. 

The article further investigates the timing of the meeting,  suggesting a deliberate effort to challenge India's sovereignty and potentially embolden the Khalistani movement.  It questions the US's understanding and disregard for India's security concerns, emphasizing the negative impact of such actions on bilateral relations.</description>

			<title>Head-on | Israel-Saudi diplomacy blown up by pager attack</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-israel-saudi-diplomacy-blown-up-by-pager-attack-13818095.html</link>
			<description>Diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia were close to being established before the Hamas attack on Israel.  The US had been attempting to forge this alliance for years, believing it would enhance Western security in the region and potentially lead to a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  However, the recent explosion of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies linked to Mossad, killing and injuring Hezbollah fighters and civilians, has significantly damaged this prospect. Saudi Arabia has condemned the attacks and reaffirmed its stance that it will not normalize relations with Israel without a Palestinian state.

The timing of the device explosions is seen as a deliberate tactic by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is seeking to prolong the Gaza war to avoid facing corruption charges.  The attacks also appear to be a message to future US presidents, signaling Israel's continued determination in the conflict. The international community has condemned the actions, calling them a violation of international law.</description>

			<title>PM Modi to address Summit of Future: How India leads Global South in climate diplomacy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modi-to-address-summit-of-future-how-india-leads-global-south-in-climate-diplomacy-13817995.html</link>
			<description>India's perspective on climate change has evolved significantly. Initially hesitant due to development priorities, India began recognizing the impacts of climate change on its ecosystems in the early 2000s. The Paris Agreement marked a turning point, with India emerging as a key player by setting ambitious renewable energy targets. The establishment of the International Solar Alliance further solidified India's commitment.

India has made substantial progress in expanding its renewable energy capacity and launched initiatives like the National Hydrogen Mission and FAME to combat climate change. India's approach balances development, sustainability, and global leadership, positioning itself as a bridge between developed and developing nations while advocating for climate justice and technology transfer.</description>

			<title>Post Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s exit, can Bangladeshâ€™s democracy be salvaged?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/post-sheikh-hasinas-exit-can-bangladeshs-democracy-be-salvaged-13817975.html</link>
			<description>The recent student-led protests in Bangladesh led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, aimed to represent all political sections. However, Yunus' appointment of former army general Sakhawat Hussain as home affairs advisor sparked protests, as Hussain's alleged support for the Awami League was seen as a betrayal of the protesters' trust. 

Further concerns arose from Yunus' decision to lift the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami, a party associated with war crimes, and appoint a controversial lawyer, Tajul Islam, as the chief prosecutor of the international crimes tribunal. These moves have fueled fears among the Hindu minority, as the Awami League's influence weakens and incidents of communal violence have increased.

This volatile situation, marked by the rise of Islamists and a lack of representation for the Hindu community, raises concerns about the future of democracy in Bangladesh. The international community, led by the US and India, is closely watching these developments, each navigating its own interests in the region.</description>

			<title>Ramification | Assassination attempts on Trump are an extension of culture wars dominating US elections</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-assassination-attempts-on-trump-are-an-extension-of-culture-wars-dominating-us-elections-13817968.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming 2024 US election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has been marked by unprecedented levels of animosity and political violence.  Social issues like gender identity, abortion, and immigration have become deeply polarized, driving a wedge between Trump and Biden/Harris supporters. The Pew Research Center survey highlights the stark contrast in viewpoints on these issues, particularly regarding immigration, where Trump supporters largely favor deportation while Biden/Harris supporters are far more accepting. 

Despite some positive economic indicators like low unemployment rates, concerns about potential recession, rising housing costs, and a ballooning national debt loom large. However, cultural issues appear to be dominating the political discourse, fueled by a media narrative that often pits one party as the aggressor and the other as the victim.  The rise of "wokeism" and cancel culture, while defended by some Democrats, is widely seen as contributing to a toxic atmosphere of intolerance and division. These cultural fault lines, exacerbated by recent assassination attempts on Trump, underscore the deep societal rift that threatens to further divide the nation.</description>

			<title>How CIA, Pentagon shape Hollywood narratives: Lessons for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-cia-pentagon-shape-hollywood-narratives-lessons-for-india-13817957.html</link>
			<description>Hollywood films often portray the US in a positive light, promoting American values and military strength.  This is partly due to the influence of the Pentagon and CIA, who have collaborated with filmmakers to shape narratives in their favor. 

Movies like "Top Gun" and "Zero Dark Thirty" highlight this cooperation, with the military and intelligence agencies providing support and influencing storylines. This can be seen as a form of soft power, used to project a particular image of the US and garner public support for its actions. 

Other countries, like China, have also recognized the power of Hollywood and exert their own influence on films to advance their interests. India, however, hasn't fully utilized the potential of cinema as a tool of soft power.</description>

			<title>Book review | Rajiv Dograâ€™s â€˜Autocratsâ€™ bets on humanity amid all signs of authoritarianism</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/book-review-rajiv-dogras-autocrats-bets-on-humanity-amid-all-signs-of-authoritarianism-13817778.html</link>
			<description>The book "Autocrats: Charisma, Power and Their Lives" by Rajiv Dogra explores the origins and motivations of dictatorial figures.  Dogra examines various autocrats throughout history, such as Stalin, Hitler, and Saddam Hussein, analyzing their childhoods and how societal instability contributed to their rise.  The author also delves into the role of charisma and psychology, questioning whether these individuals are inherently born tyrants or shaped by their experiences. Dogra uses personal anecdotes from his diplomatic experience in Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu to illustrate the brutal consequences of dictatorship. He warns that the future may hold an even more sinister form of autocracy, driven by artificial intelligence. While acknowledging the bleak reality of history, Dogra maintains a glimmer of hope, believing that a better future is possible.</description>

			<title>A pale Beijing Xiangshan Forum shows Chinaâ€™s failure as a reliable global power</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/a-pale-beijing-xiangshan-forum-shows-chinas-failure-as-a-reliable-global-power-13817743.html</link>
			<description>Despite its growing economic and military power, China struggles to project itself as a peaceful and trustworthy actor on the world stage. The annual Xiangshan Forum, organized by China to rival the Shangri-La Dialogue, has failed to garner the same international attention and influence.  While China promotes initiatives like the Global Security Initiative, its actions in the region, such as military assertiveness in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, undermine its credibility.  The lack of enthusiasm and critical dialogue at the Xiangshan Forum highlights China's struggles to cultivate soft power and build genuine trust with other nations.  The limited media coverage reflects the forum's inability to achieve its stated aims of promoting peace and dialogue.</description>

			<title>Harris vs Trump: US presidential election is a close race; it's a do or die moment</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/harris-vs-trump-us-presidential-election-is-a-close-race-its-a-do-or-die-moment-13817707.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 US presidential race is shaping up to be a closely contested affair between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. While Harris currently holds a slight lead in national polls, the race is tighter in key battleground states. 

The first and possibly only debate between the two candidates took place on September 10th. Harris was seen as the stronger performer, appearing confident and articulate, while Trump continued to make unsubstantiated claims and avoid direct answers. 

Despite Trump's loyal base, Harris has garnered support from prominent Republicans and celebrities like Taylor Swift, potentially influencing undecided voters. The outcome hinges on a handful of purple states, with Pennsylvania being particularly crucial.  The race remains unpredictable, with any misstep potentially proving fatal for either candidate.</description>

			<title>Why PM Modiâ€™s US visit is an ideal opportunity to capitalise on shared interests</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pm-modis-us-visit-is-an-ideal-opportunity-to-capitalise-on-shared-interests-13817685.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to the US includes participation in the Quad summit, the Summit of the Future at the UN, and meetings with American CEOs and the Indian diaspora. While a meeting with Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh is unlikely, India-US relations have seen advancements under the Biden administration, with a state visit by Modi, Congress address, and agreements on defense and critical technology cooperation. 

Challenges remain, including US concerns about India's ties with Russia and human rights issues. Despite these differences, both administrations have valued the relationship, and India is committed to the Quad as a global good.</description>

			<title>How Ayatollah Khamenei's remarks could derail Indo-Iranian cooperation</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ayatollah-khameneis-remarks-could-derail-indo-iranian-cooperation-13817674.html</link>
			<description>Ayatollah Khamenei's statement about the suffering of Indian Muslims, comparing their situation to that of Palestinians and Rohingyas, has caused friction in India-Iran relations. 

India's Ministry of External Affairs strongly criticized the remarks, calling them misinformed and unacceptable. Khamenei's statement, which some argue is posturing to portray Iran as the leader of the Muslim world, has raised concerns about public perception of India within Iran. 

Despite previous gestures of goodwill from India, including vaccine assistance and support for the development of the Chabahar port, existing tensions, such as US sanctions and the insurgency in Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province, further complicate the situation.</description>

			<title>Can India counter Pakistan's proxy play with Baloch card?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/can-india-counter-pakistans-proxy-play-with-baloch-card-13817460.html</link>
			<description>This article argues that Pakistan's strategy of promoting separatism and terrorism in India has failed. 

The author cites the example of Kashmir, where the revocation of Article 370 has led to improved security and prosperity for Kashmiri people. The article also criticizes Pakistan's support for the Khalistan movement, which aims to create an independent Sikh state in Punjab.

The author contends that Pakistan is a deeply divided country with no real sense of national unity, and that its government uses terrorism as a distraction from its internal problems. They suggest that India should respond to Pakistan's aggression by exposing its dubious legitimacy and highlighting the potential consequences for Pakistan's own existence.</description>

			<title>How Bangladeshi Frankenstein may hurt its American, Chinese masters</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladeshi-frankenstein-may-hurt-its-american-chinese-masters-13817374.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that the US and China's actions in Bangladesh, aiming to destabilize India, will ultimately backfire.

It criticizes the US for supporting  Muhammad Yunus' interim government, which has allegedly emboldened anti-India and anti-Hindu sentiments while neglecting the plight of minorities.  The article suggests that this interference, mirroring the US's past failures in conflict resolution, will create chaos and a civil war in Bangladesh, harming both the US and China.  It predicts that the Awami League, the previous governing party, may rise as opposition to Yunus' government and radical Islamist forces, potentially leading to further instability. The article concludes that this experiment will fail, leading to unintended consequences for all involved.</description>

			<title>In Sri Lanka, presidential poll is more than a test for democratic resilience</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/in-sri-lanka-presidential-poll-is-more-than-a-test-for-democratic-resilience-13817314.html</link>
			<description>Sri Lanka is heading towards a historic presidential election marked by a three-way race between three formidable contenders.  Anura Kumara Dissanayake from the JVP-NPP alliance, Sajith Premadasa from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe all aim to lead the nation.

Public focus appears to have shifted from solely economic revival to broader governance concerns, with voters critical of corruption, nepotism, and lawlessness.  

The contest is also complex due to shifting political allegiances.  Wickremesinghe, from the UNP, faces challenges from Premadasa, who hails from a breakaway faction of the same party.  The JVP, traditionally a left-nationalist force, has surprisingly gained traction amid economic woes.  The fate of the Tamil vote, traditionally split, remains uncertain, with a possibility of it significantly impacting the outcome.   

However, the election's outcome remains unpredictable. While Dissanayake enjoys a strong lead in the race, it's unclear whether any candidate will secure a majority in the first round. A second and potentially protracted recount process could ensue leading to potential political instability. 


 The choice before Sri Lankan voters is crucial, one that will determine the nation's direction for years to come.</description>

			<title>Trump assassination attempt: Toxic polarisation of American politics is a threat to democracies everywhere</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-toxic-polarisation-of-american-politics-is-a-threat-to-democracies-everywhere-13817256.html</link>
			<description>This article argues that the United States, under President Biden, is experiencing a decline in democratic norms and a rise in political violence. The author points to the alarming rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum, culminating in assassination attempts against former President Trump, as evidence of a breakdown in civil discourse.  

The piece contrasts this with India, which the author suggests has a stronger democratic framework despite facing challenges.  It expresses concern that the US's dysfunctional democracy could inspire other countries to embrace autocratic models.  The author blames the toxic media environment, particularly cable news and talk radio, for fueling polarization and animosity. 

 Ultimately, the article paints a bleak picture of American democracy, fearing that the country's example could damage democratic values worldwide.</description>

			<title>New faces crop up as Japan searches for new PM</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/new-faces-crop-up-as-japan-searches-for-new-pm-13817139.html</link>
			<description>Japan is facing a crucial juncture in its political landscape with leadership contests underway in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), and their coalition partner Komeito. 

Within the LDP,  Shigeru Ishiba, Sanae Takaichi, and Shinjiro Koizumi are considered the frontrunners. Ishiba, the most popular among the public, advocates for comprehensive reforms. Takaichi, aiming to be Japan's first female PM, focuses on strengthening national security and economic measures.  Koizumi, riding on his father's legacy and generational change appeal, promises political and regulatory reforms. 

Meanwhile, the CDPJ leadership race pits Yukio Edano and Yushihiko Noda against each other, as the party seeks to reinvigorate itself and form a strong opposition coalition. Komeito, preparing for a generational shift, is likely to see Secretary-General Keiichi Ishii succeed Natsuo Yamaguchi. 

These leadership changes come amidst growing public demand for younger, dynamic leaders, especially after recent political scandals. Japan's political future hinges on the next generation of leaders addressing both internal and external challenges.</description>

			<title>Musk, Trump and the social media blitz: Decoding an unlikely friendship</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/musk-trump-and-the-social-media-blitz-decoding-an-unlikely-friendship-13817107.html</link>
			<description>Elon Musk is providing ardent support for Donald Trump's presidential campaign on his platform X. Musk's actions, including defending Trump against criticism and engaging in provocative social media exchanges, have attracted significant attention.  Their relationship has evolved from initial disapproval to a close alliance, with Musk even suggesting a potential political role for himself should Trump win. This unexpected partnership highlights their shared business acumen, impulsive personalities, and reliance on social media.  Despite their differing views on issues like climate change and renewable energy, Musk's financial ties to government initiatives and his discontent with California's pandemic policies appear to have contributed to his alignment with Trump.</description>

			<title>Quad summit in America will bolster security and cooperation in Indo-Pacific</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/quad-summit-in-america-will-bolster-security-and-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-13817085.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming Quad Summit in Delaware signifies a significant step forward for this initiative, proving the commitment of its members â€“ the United States, India, Japan, and Australia â€“ to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region.  

Since its revival in 2017, the Quad has made substantial progress, culminating in four in-person summits.  While China is not explicitly named, the Quad's actions and statements directly address China's assertive actions in the region, particularly in the South China Sea. The Quad's focus extends beyond maritime issues, encompassing cybersecurity, critical technologies, climate change, counterterrorism, and infrastructure development. 


The Quad aims to counter China's influence through concrete cooperation, including expanding its maritime domain awareness program.  A notable development is the inclusion of references to the Permanent Court of Arbitration's 2016 ruling against China's claims in the South China Sea and calls for action against terrorist groups like LeT and JeM, demonstrating a growing boldness in challenging China and Pakistan.  

The Quad strives to garner broader regional support, especially from ASEAN countries facing China's pressure.  Focusing on tangible benefits in areas like health and infrastructure will be crucial for strengthening ties and countering China's debt-trap diplomacy. As the Indo-Pacific navigates geopolitical complexities, the Quad plays a vital role in promoting stability and prosperity.</description>

			<title>India becoming the propaganda battleground between Americans and Russians</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-becoming-the-propaganda-battleground-between-americans-and-russians-13816848.html</link>
			<description>The author argues that India is becoming a target of propaganda warfare from both the US and Russia, leveraging social media to influence public opinion.  Historically, India has been a battleground for CIA and KGB influence, but the rise of social media has given foreign powers new tools to manipulate narratives. The author points to the Meta ban on Russian state media as an example of how social media companies can be used to control information.  

He criticizes the lack of control India has over its social media landscape, highlighting the concentration of media ownership in the US and the potential for biased reporting.  The author believes that India needs to create its own "Great Indian Firewall" to protect itself from foreign propaganda and maintain its independent voice.  He warns that failing to do so will allow the West to control India's narrative and ultimately undermine its sovereignty.</description>

			<title>Zelenskyâ€™s Kursk operation can be a costly gambit as Putin targets eastern Ukraine</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/zelenskys-kursk-operation-can-be-a-costly-gambit-as-putin-targets-eastern-ukraine-13816768.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the strategic significance of the ongoing battle for Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. If Russia captures this city, it would sever crucial supply lines for Ukrainian forces, leading to potential isolation and collapse of defenses in the Donetsk region. 

While Ukraine launched a successful incursion into Russia's Kursk region, the article argues that this may be a deliberate diversionary tactic by Russia to draw Ukrainian resources away from key areas in eastern Ukraine.  

The article also highlights concerns within the West about Ukraine's ability to sustain its counteroffensive with limited Western weaponry and concerns regarding the effectiveness and potential risks associated with using advanced Western equipment in the conflict.


It concludes by mentioning  weakening support for Ukraine among some Western allies and suggests Ukraine needs a clearer strategy to prosecute the war within the existing constraints.</description>

			<title>Abraham Accords need a Palestinian course correction</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/abraham-accords-need-a-palestinian-course-correction-13816762.html</link>
			<description>The Abraham Accords, signed in 2020, aimed to normalize relations between Israel and several Arab states.  However, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has cast a shadow on this initiative.  The normalization agreements were predicated on the resolution of the Palestinian issue, which has unfortunately not occurred. Instead, the situation has escalated, with devastating consequences for Palestinians in Gaza and Israelis.  While trade between Israel and some Arab states continues, the broader context has become volatile, raising doubts about the future of regional cooperation and potentially pushing the Palestinian issue back to the forefront of Arab concerns.   The war has challenged the viability of the Accords as a platform for genuine peace and stability in the region.</description>

			<title>Itâ€™s the inflation, stupid: Trump still beats Harris on â€˜bacon and eggsâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/its-the-inflation-stupid-trump-still-beats-harris-on-bacon-and-eggs-13816575.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses public perception of the economy and the impact of inflation on voters' decisions. While President Biden's economic policies have seen positive outcomes like job creation and GDP growth, high inflation remains a significant concern for voters. 

Despite inflation easing recently, the prices of essential goods remain high, negatively influencing voters' perception of the economy. Donald Trump capitalizes on this sentiment, emphasizing his record of low inflation during his presidency and framing Biden's policies as responsible for the current economic challenges. This resonates with voters who prioritize economic stability and directly feel the impact of rising costs on their daily lives. Consequently, polls show a preference for Trump over Kamala Harris on handling the economy, highlighting the powerful influence of inflation on voter sentiment.</description>

			<title>Dangerous lies: Why Khamenei should look at Iranâ€™s own genocidal record before pointing fingers at India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dangerous-lies-why-khamenei-should-look-at-irans-own-genocidal-record-before-pointing-fingers-at-india-13816379.html</link>
			<description>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, accused India of persecuting Muslims, equating India's treatment of its Muslim population to the plight of Muslims in Myanmar, Gaza, and other locations.  This assertion is refuted by the fact that India has a significant and growing Muslim population and has historically granted Muslims preferential treatment in areas such as education and religious institutions.  The article argues that Khamenei's claim is a deliberate attempt to bolster Iran's Islamist credentials and influence among Muslim countries while simultaneously avoiding criticism of China's human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.  The author criticizes India's left-leaning liberals for overlooking Iran's problematic record and failing to recognize the potential threat posed by Iran's opportunistic stance towards India.  The article concludes by emphasizing the need for India to strengthen its ties with countries like Israel, who are demonstrably more reliable allies in times of crisis.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/modi-at-74-a-decade-of-bharats-re-awakening-13816333.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses Prime Minister Narendra Modi's achievements and his role in India's transformation, marking his 74th birthday and 100 days of his third term. 

Modi is recognized as a charismatic and visionary global leader who led India to become the third largest major economy. His tenure is highlighted by initiatives like direct benefit transfers, infrastructure development, and a focus on self-reliance in defense manufacturing. 

The article also mentions positive developments in India's relations with China, with border disputes being largely resolved.  It underscores Modi's efforts to build new transport corridors to Europe and strengthen trade ties with various nations.

Additionally, the article praises Modi's commitment to religious tourism and his ambitious plans for the country's development, culminating in a vision for India as a prosperous nation by 2047.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-emerges-as-a-force-for-good-irrespective-of-result-as-a-mediator-13816268.html</link>
			<description>India has emerged as a possible mediator in the war in Ukraine, leveraging its diplomatic relationships with both Russia and the West. Proposed solutions include a standstill agreement, formalizing the current territorial status quo, or establishing buffer zones.  However, these options face challenges from both sides. The US, while wary of India's neutrality, may be hesitant to diminish support for Ukraine ahead of its presidential election.  India, meanwhile, is cautiously navigating the situation, avoiding overt condemnation of Russia while seeking to position itself as a key player in brokering peace.  Ultimately, India's success in mediating a solution will depend on the willingness of both Moscow and Kyiv to negotiate and the global political landscape shifting in favor of a diplomatic resolution.</description>

			<title>Why Indiaâ€™s deepening water crisis needs a market-based credit solution</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-indias-deepening-water-crisis-needs-a-market-based-credit-solution-13816210.html</link>
			<description>India faces a severe water crisis with increasing demand and depleting groundwater resources. To address this, a market-based solution using tradable water credits, similar to carbon credits, is proposed. 

This framework would encourage businesses to reduce their water footprint across their operations and supply chains by implementing conservation measures and investing in water replenishment projects. 

Water credits could be generated by projects that demonstrate water conservation and quality improvement, and traded by businesses seeking to offset their water use. 

Addressing challenges like water being seen as a fundamental human right and the localized impact of water credits can be achieved through a tiered pricing mechanism ensuring basic water access for all while incentivizing efficient use in commercial sectors. 


This system can promote sustainable water management, equitable distribution, and ultimately contribute to water security for future generations.</description>

			<title>Should India be part of Russia-China bid to have nuclear power plant on Moon?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/should-india-be-part-of-russia-china-bid-to-have-nuclear-power-plant-on-moon-13816149.html</link>
			<description>Russia and China are partnering to build a nuclear power station on the Moon. The reactor, capable of generating half a megawatt, will provide a reliable power source for future lunar bases and operate even during the lunar night. 

The project aligns with the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) initiative, a collaboration between Russia and China that includes plans for robotic bases and future human habitation.  India expresses interest in joining this project, which could solidify a trilateral endeavor involving India, Russia, and China in lunar exploration. 

This development comes as the U.S. also has its own ambitious program, Artemis, aiming to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon.  While the U.S. focuses on permanent habitats, the Russo-Chinese reactor signals a shift towards utilizing nuclear power to support both robotic and human lunar operations. India, with its own nuclear energy program and growing space ambitions, is well-positioned to contribute to this evolving lunar landscape.</description>

			<title>Can a backchannel via Moscow help India address the China challenge?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/can-a-backchannel-via-moscow-help-india-address-the-china-challenge-13815897.html</link>
			<description>The article explores the possibility of using Russia as a backchannel to resolve the escalating tensions between India and China. While acknowledging the challenges posed by Russia's close relationship with China and its dependence on Chinese support in the wake of the Ukraine war, the author argues that Russia has a vested interest in preventing an India-China conflict. 

Russia, as a "civilisational state", understands China's concerns and can act as a credible mediator without raising suspicions. Additionally, a conflict would harm Russia's interests by weakening its strategic position in Asia and potentially isolating it further from the West.

The article highlights the benefits and risks for both India and Russia in pursuing this diplomatic path. For India, it offers a chance to engage with China through a trusted intermediary and prevent military escalation. However, India must carefully navigate the potential risks of being manipulated by China or Russia exploiting its anxieties. 

The article concludes by urging India to focus on conflict avoidance and escalation containment while strengthening its economic and military capabilities.  Ultimately, it recommends a pragmatic approach that balances engagement with Russia with a strong and independent foreign policy stance.</description>

			<description>The Russia-Ukraine war has entered a critical phase, with Russia's threat to deploy nuclear weapons adding to global tension.  While Russia initially seemed to have a tactical advantage, Ukraine's recent attack on the Kursk region has changed the narrative.  

Ukraine, bolstered by NATO's support and weapons supply, is seeking to negotiate a way out of the conflict through diplomacy.  India, meanwhile, has emerged as a key player in mediating the peace process, seeking dialogue and a resolution. The Indian Prime Minister visited both Russia and Ukraine, highlighting India's commitment to peace and a "not neutral" stance. 

The war's escalation and possible expansion into a Russia-NATO conflict raises serious concerns. India's role in bringing Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table is crucial in averting a catastrophic outcome.</description>

			<title>What cards Sri Lankan presidential election will bring to Indiaâ€™s deck</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/what-cards-sri-lankan-presidential-election-will-bring-to-indias-deck-13815844.html</link>
			<description>Sri Lanka is heading towards a presidential election on September 21st, with a wide array of candidates vying for the top spot. Prominent figures include Ranil Wickremesinghe, seeking to secure his position after being appointed president in 2022; Sajith Premadasa, who boasts the support of a significant number of lawmakers; and Anura Dissanayake, a rising star from the JVP, leading the National People's Power.  

The outcome remains highly unpredictable. While Dissanayake is gaining traction in polls, his lack of national political experience raises questions. Premadasa, backed by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party, has pledged comprehensive implementation of the 13th Amendment, addressing Tamil concerns. 

India is deeply invested in the election, as Sri Lanka holds strategic importance in its Indian Ocean Region strategy. Amidst economic distress and pressure from China, India seeks a stable and friendly government in Colombo.</description>

			<title>Why China should fix its own house before commenting on Jaishankar</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-china-should-fix-its-own-house-before-commenting-on-jaishankar-13815680.html</link>
			<description>Recently, a Chinese publication criticized Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, accusing him of having a 'China problem'.  The article highlights Jaishankar's statement about the existence of a global "China problem," stating that this reflects India's adoption of anti-China policies.  

The article also brings up the 2020 Ladakh standoff, where China initiated incursions, questioning whether Jaishankar was responsible for that.

The piece further discusses China's internal issues, including the demotion of its defense minister and ongoing anti-corruption measures within the military.  These issues, coupled with military drills near Taiwan,  suggest China may be facing internal challenges and using external distractions to deflect attention. Finally, the article notes that  President Xi Jinping's emphasis on "self-revolution" within the Chinese Communist Party echoes the Maoist era and points to potential concerns about China's direction.</description>

			<title>Kursk counter-offensive: Ukrainian masterstroke or Russian tactical trap?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/kursk-counter-offensive-ukrainian-masterstroke-or-russian-tactical-trap-13815516.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine launched a counteroffensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August, a surprise move intended to relieve pressure on the Donbas front, expose Russian weaknesses, and bolster Ukraine's negotiating position.  Despite initial tactical successes, the operation failed to achieve its strategic objectives.  Russia concentrated its efforts on the Donbas, launching a counteroffensive in Kursk that has  recaptured territory and trapped Ukrainian forces.

The Kursk offensive exposed vulnerabilities in Ukraine's strategy, highlighting the importance of maintaining strategic balance and minimizing reliance on limited resources.  While Ukraine emphasized the need for Western support, the counteroffensive underscored the limitations of firepower without effective maneuver and the importance of boots on the ground.  Russia's methodical response, allowing Ukraine to commit resources in Kursk before launching a counteroffensive in the Donbas, demonstrates strategic clarity and a willingness to exploit vulnerabilities. 
 
The outcome of the Kursk offensive could have significant implications for future negotiations, potentially diminishing Ukraine's leverage.  The war continues, with Russia holding the advantage.</description>

			<title>The forgotten â€˜Spy Princessâ€™ of Second World War</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-forgotten-spy-princess-of-second-world-war-13815483.html</link>
			<description>The article tells the story of Noor Inayat Khan, a British resistance agent during World War II whose life ended tragically. Born in Moscow to Sufi musician Inayat Khan, Noor grew up in Paris and fled to England at the outbreak of war.  She joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and worked as a radio operator in German-occupied France, sending vital intelligence back to Britain.

Despite facing constant danger, Noor refused to abandon her mission, even after her network was compromised. Captured by the Gestapo, she endured torture and solitary confinement before being executed at Dachau concentration camp in 1944. Despite her immense contributions to the Allied war effort, Noor is only remembered by a small stone tablet at her father's dargah in Nizamuddin, Delhi.</description>

			<title>Ramification | Sri Lanka: First presidential election after economic crisis and all weather Colombo-Delhi ties</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-sri-lanka-first-presidential-election-after-economic-crisis-and-all-weather-colombo-delhi-ties-13815472.html</link>
			<description>The Sri Lankan presidential election scheduled for September 2024 is highly anticipated,  coming after the economic crisis that led to the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. 

Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe is seeking re-election, facing competition from Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake. While Wickremesinghe emphasizes economic stability achieved during his tenure, he faces challenges from the perception of his association with the Rajapaksa family, blamed for the country's economic woes. 

Premadasa and Dissanayake offer alternative visions for the economy, with Premadasa advocating for a liberal approach and Dissanayake promoting a people-centric model.

Regardless of the election outcome, India remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka's economic recovery through initiatives like financial aid, infrastructure projects, and enhanced security cooperation. India's actions are seen as a counterbalance to China's growing influence in the region. 
   
The implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which promotes federalism, is another crucial issue for bilateral relations. 


Regardless of the election outcome, India's "Neighbourhood First" policy and its SAGAR vision will continue to guide its engagement with Sri Lanka.</description>

			<title>Aparajita: Why this is a Bill with no legal common sense</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/aparajita-why-this-is-a-bill-with-no-legal-common-sense-13815450.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the low conviction rate for rape in India despite public outcry and calls for stricter laws.  The author uses the recent Aparajita Women and Child Bill in West Bengal as an example. While the bill aims to enhance penalties for sexual crimes, the author argues that its provisions may conflict with existing laws and be struck down by the Supreme Court.  

The author points out the inherent limitations of mandating timeframes for investigations and trials, citing principles of natural justice. They suggest that the West Bengal government's move might be more about creating an impression of action rather than pursuing genuine reform.</description>

			<title>NATO member Turkey's bid to join BRICS: Erdogan will find it tough to balance West with East</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/nato-member-turkeys-bid-to-join-brics-erdogan-will-find-it-tough-to-balance-west-with-east-13815203.html</link>
			<description>Turkey aims to bolster its global standing by formally requesting membership in BRICS+, a group of emerging economies challenging Western dominance. This move signifies Turkey's shift towards an "oriental turn" in foreign policy, contrasting with its traditional Western alliances like NATO.  While Turkey seeks to leverage its geopolitical position and historical legacy, navigating the complexities of the East requires a nuanced understanding of regional dynamics.  

Russia, for instance, has sent mixed signals about Turkey's BRICS bid, potentially aiming to deepen the divide between Turkey and the West.  Turkey's  relationship with India is also strained due to its stance on Kashmir and ties with Pakistan.  To successfully forge new alliances in the East, Turkey needs to move beyond Ottoman nostalgia and adopt a more comprehensive and realistic geopolitical strategy.</description>

			<title>Maldives: Once 'India Out' votary, why Muizzu is anxious for Delhi visit</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/maldives-once-india-out-votary-why-muizzu-is-anxious-for-delhi-visit-13815271.html</link>
			<description>The Maldives has announced President Mohamed Muizzu's imminent visit to India, indicating a desire to mend strained relations following Muizzu's ascent to power. This comes after several diplomatic efforts to repair the ties, including External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's recent visit to Male. The  announcement, made before formal diplomatic protocol, emphasizes Maldives' urgency in seeking India's assistance amidst an unfolding economic crisis.  

The article highlights several positive developments, such as the resignations of two "anti-India" ministers and renewed security cooperation, including  Maldives' return to the Colombo Security Conclave. However, challenges remain, including the economic crisis requiring significant debt servicing in the coming years. 

President Muizzu's decision to mandate dollar payments for taxes from dollar-earning entities, while potentially beneficial, could face opposition  from influential business owners and politicians.  The article concludes by emphasizing the precarious economic situation and political risks Muizzu faces as he attempts to navigate these challenges.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the IMF's recent decision to grant Pakistan a $7 billion support program.  While this provides temporary relief, the author argues that Pakistan's real issues lie in its economic and foreign policies. 

The author criticizes the Pakistani army for its excessive involvement in the country's economy and business, viewing it as detrimental to the nation's well-being. They blame the army's narrative of itself as Pakistan's savior for public acceptance of its undue influence. The author suggests that the army's stance against India hinders economic stability and calls for the army to relinquish its control over the country's security and commerce.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-sutra-after-the-debate-what-lies-ahead-in-the-us-presidential-race-13815159.html</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the Trump-Harris debate, suggesting it was a tie with Harris performing better in terms of composure and likability.  Trump, while appearing angry and defensive, remained resilient.  The author criticizes the perceived bias of ABC and the media in general, claiming they favored Harris and fact-checked Trump more than her.  It argues that the "Modi effect" might benefit Trump, as criticism from the media could push undecided voters towards him.  

Ultimately, the article contends that while the debate impacted perceptions, its effect on voter behavior remains uncertain. It suggests the election is too close to call, but Trump has a chance to win due to his perceived strength as a leader and the potential "Modi effect."</description>

			<title>Imran Khan's PTI renews its confrontation with Pakistan Army</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/imran-khans-pti-renews-its-confrontation-with-pakistan-army-13815007.html</link>
			<description>The PTI continues its confrontational stance against the military establishment, with its leader Imran Khan demanding the court martial of military officers and threatening to end all negotiations with them.  PTI Chief Minister of KP, Ali Amin Gandapur, made inflammatory remarks and was summoned for reprimand by security officials. Despite a pledge of remorse and restraint, the KP Assembly passed a resolution demanding the military's court martial and Khan's release. The situation is further complicated by judicial hostility towards the military, highlighted in the LHC ruling against the appointment of a serving general as NADRA chairman. However, leaked evidence from the court martial of former Lt Gen Faiz Hameed has had a damaging impact on PTI morale.  



  
The focus now shifts to a planned PTI protest rally in Lahore on September 21st, where the government must decide whether to grant permission, potentially escalating tensions further.</description>

			<title>How AI can help in Disaster Management: Lessons from across the world</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ai-can-help-in-disaster-management-lessons-from-across-the-world-13814943.html</link>
			<description>The increasing number and severity of natural disasters globally necessitate innovative solutions for prediction and mitigation. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising tools in this regard. 

AI-powered systems can analyze vast datasets like satellite images and social media posts to identify patterns and predict potential disasters. They can also be used to assess damage, allocate resources efficiently, and guide rescue operations.  

Several real-world examples demonstrate the effectiveness of AI in disaster management, including the quick response to the Nepal earthquake and the accurate assessment of damage in Japan after the Tohoku earthquake. As technology advances, AI and ML will play an increasingly crucial role in safeguarding lives and property in the face of natural disasters.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-china-rivalry-in-bay-of-bengal-not-all-quiet-on-indias-eastern-front-13814868.html</link>
			<description>The ousting of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh has created a power vacuum and  shifted the country's foreign policy landscape.  The interim government, lacking international credibility, has halted Bangladesh's international engagement. 

China has significant economic and political influence in Bangladesh, providing infrastructure development, weapons, and being the top import partner. The US, dissatisfied with Bangladesh's rejection of requests for St Martin Island and closer ties with China, is now seeking to assert its influence in the region. 

The situation in Bangladesh is viewed as part of a larger geopolitical contest between China and the US for dominance in the Bay of Bengal, which has implications for India's regional security and economic interests in the northeastern states. The instability created by the regime change poses a threat to regional peace and development, requiring a  stable democratic government to restore trust and collaboration.</description>

			<title>How Horn of Africa is on the brink of a crisis again</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-horn-of-africa-is-on-the-brink-of-a-crisis-again-13814809.html</link>
			<description>The Horn of Africa is engulfed in renewed conflicts, primarily centered around the Nile waters dispute involving Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan. Efforts to resolve the dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) have stalled, leading both Egypt and Ethiopia to take their claims to the UN. 

Further complicating the situation is the breakdown in relations between Ethiopia and Somalia, exacerbated by Ethiopia's agreement with Somaliland to lease a section of coastline for a naval base. This move has prompted Somalia to forge a military alliance with Egypt, raising concerns about potential regional instability.

Amidst these tensions, Turkey seeks to mediate, balancing its interests in Somalia with its strong economic ties to Ethiopia. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other regional players with vested interests in the Horn of Africa are also navigating this complex geopolitical landscape.  The delicate balance of alliances and historical rivalries in the region makes the future seem precarious.</description>

			<title>Head-on | Rahul Gandhi attacks India, not just Modi</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-rahul-gandhi-attacks-india-not-just-modi-13814766.html</link>
			<description>A common argument is made that Rahul Gandhi's recent attacks on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his US visit are just a continuation of Modi's own tactics against the Congress Party. However, the author contends that there are key differences between the two. Firstly, while Modi's criticism focuses on the damage done to India's economy under Congress rule, Rahul's attacks encompass a broader condemnation of India as a nation. 

Secondly, Rahul's choice of associations and comparisons, such as praising China's manufacturing and suggesting Sikhs are unfairly treated in India, are seen as damaging to the nation's image. The author argues that criticisms directed at a political opponent are acceptable, but disparaging India itself crosses a line.</description>

			<title>Will Turkeyâ€™s inclusion into BRICS push India on the back foot?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/will-turkeys-inclusion-into-brics-push-india-on-the-back-foot-13814627.html</link>
			<description>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's move to have Turkey join the BRICS group is significant. BRICS,  originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa,  has expanded to include several new members,  positioning itself as a counterbalance to Western influence.  Turkey's potential membership would make it the first NATO member in the group, given its strategic location between Europe and Asia and its role as a key NATO ally. 

This move comes at a time of global geopolitical shifts, including the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza conflict, and the upcoming US presidential election. India, which maintains diplomatic ties with Turkey despite some friction, will need to assess the implications of Turkey's entry for its own foreign policy, particularly  its balancing act between Russia, the US, and China within the context of BRICS and the SCO.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ukraine-war-why-theres-growing-consensus-about-indias-role-as-peacekeeper-13814599.html</link>
			<description>India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has evolved from neutrality to a position of global importance as a potential peacemaker. Prime Minister Modi's recent visits to both Russia and Ukraine, where he met with Putin and Zelensky respectively, have garnered international attention.  

Modi's message of peace and diplomacy has been widely welcomed, with leaders like Condoleeza Rice and Italian Prime Minister Meloni recognizing India's role in mediating the conflict. India's unique relationship with both Russia and Ukraine, coupled with Modi's diplomatic efforts, places the country in a crucial position to contribute to finding a resolution to the war.</description>

			<title>Dangerous politics of Rahul Gandhi and the â€˜3.5% Ruleâ€™ of regime change</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dangerous-politics-of-rahul-gandhi-and-the-3-5-rule-of-regime-change-13814518.html</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi's recent statements about India during his US visit have raised concerns.  His comments, particularly regarding Sikhs and the Indian Constitution, have been deemed ignorant and divisive. Critics argue that  he  trivializes India's issues and downplays the achievements of Indian democracy, while simultaneously praising China.  Furthermore, his meetings with known anti-India figures have fueled suspicions that he is aligning with groups that seek to destabilize the country. 

The article suggests that Gandhi's rhetoric echoes tactics outlined by Gene Sharp, a strategist who advocates for regime change through non-violent means. However, it contends that these strategies are more likely to succeed in illiberal societies and are unlikely to resonate in India's vibrant democracy.  The piece concludes by urging  Gandhi to reconsider his approach and engage in constructive dialogue with the government to address India's challenges.</description>

			<title>Why India needs to consolidate its control in the western Indian Ocean</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-needs-to-consolidate-its-control-in-the-western-indian-ocean-13814494.html</link>
			<description>India's security interests in the Indian Ocean basin are being challenged by various actors, including China and Turkey. China has established a naval base in Djibouti and has gained influence through debt diplomacy in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Turkey's growing influence in Somalia, with the establishment of a naval base, is also a concern. 

To counter these threats, India needs to assert its presence more strongly in mainland Africa.  Strengthening ties with countries like Rwanda and Mozambique, and possibly securing a base in Cabo Delgado, could help India deny China and Pakistan-backed groups a foothold.  Furthermore, engaging with countries like Kenya and Tanzania through increased trade  would provide India with strategic counterbalance. 

Envisioning the African coast from Somalia to Mozambique as an Indian sphere of influence, while respecting African sovereignty, could ensure India's maritime security and regional stability.</description>

			<description>Rahul Gandhi's recent trip to the United States, aimed at bolstering his image as a thoughtful leader, has backfired. During interviews and events, he made controversial statements about India's democracy, institutions, and social inequalities.  

His claims about Sikhs facing restrictions in India were deemed outrageous and played into the hands of Khalistani separatists. He also met with controversial US lawmakers, amplifying criticism that he is exploiting fault lines and undermining national security for political gain. His strategy of portraying India in a negative light on foreign soil has been met with outrage and accusations of incompetence.</description>

			<title>Why Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate wonâ€™t decide presidential election</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate-wont-decide-presidential-election-13814252.html</link>
			<description>The first face-off between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump lacked substance, focusing on personal attacks rather than policy discussions. Both candidates avoided specific answers on key issues like the economy and Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

While Harris appeared more prepared, debates rarely decide elections, as shown by past examples.  

Despite Indian-Americans already having made up their minds, both parties are actively courting them. This crucial voting bloc feels Harris's Indian heritage makes her relatable. However, Harris identifies strongly with her Black American roots, which might resonate more with the media narrative. Despite attempts to connect with Indian-Americans, the Democratic party's outreach to this demographic remains minimal according to recent surveys.</description>

			<title>Beijingâ€™s island-grab playbook: South China Sea tactics and their implications for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beijings-island-grab-playbook-south-china-sea-tactics-and-their-implications-for-india-13814241.html</link>
			<description>This article examines China's strategy of island-grabbing in the South China Sea (SCS). Beginning in the 1950s, China has progressively occupied and militarized features in the SCS, disregarding international law and the 2016 ruling by the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) which invalidated China's claims. The article highlights China's use of economic and military pressure to assert its dominance in the region and warns of similar tactics being employed in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).  

It cites the potential risk of China coercing nations in the IOR to lease or cede their offshore islands for its strategic benefit, citing the attempted takeover of islands in Pakistan as an example. The article concludes by urging India to remain vigilant against China's ambitions and proactively safeguard its national security interests in the IOR.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/abu-dhabi-crown-princes-delhi-visit-india-uae-ties-scaling-new-heights-13814175.html</link>
			<description>The recent visit of the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi to India signifies the strengthened partnership between the two nations amidst global geopolitical complexities. 

Bilateral discussions focused on various key areas, including the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), which aim to bolster economic and commercial collaborations. The CEPA has demonstrably increased bilateral trade, while the BIT fosters investor confidence and encourages Foreign Direct Investment. 

Recognizing the importance of energy security, India and the UAE signed agreements covering LNG supply, crude storage, and production concessions.  The partnership also addresses food security concerns through a proposed India-UAE/India-Middle East food corridor.

Discussions encompassed a wide range of issues, including AI and technology collaborations, connectivity, climate change, counter-terrorism, and regional stability.  India, a prominent leader in the Global South, sees this partnership as vital in navigating the challenges of a volatile world and promoting peace and prosperity.</description>

			<title>Tagore a pariah? Bangladeshâ€™s rapid descent proves Hasina was the only secular bulwark against Islamist radicalism</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/tagore-a-pariah-bangladeshs-rapid-descent-proves-hasina-was-the-only-secular-bulwark-against-islamist-radicalism-13813963.html</link>
			<description>Following the removal of the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh is experiencing a shift towards a more Islamist polity. During her tenure, Hasina, despite accusations of authoritarianism, oversaw significant economic growth and maintained a secular stance, balancing religious and secular concerns.  The US, advocating for democratic values and having pushed for Hasina's removal, now faces challenges as Islamist radicals assert influence.

Incidents of violence against Hindus and calls to alter Bangladesh's national anthem, penned by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, highlight the growing religious extremism. The US, despite initial expressions of support for the interim government, may need to re-evaluate its approach as secularism in Bangladesh seems to be losing ground.</description>

			<title>Why Indiaâ€™s strategic partnership with the US-led West fails to click</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-indias-strategic-partnership-with-the-us-led-west-fails-to-click-13813814.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complexities of a potential strategic alliance between India and the US against China. 

While proponents point to shared democratic values, economic ties, and the threat posed by China's rise, the article highlights several limitations and concerns. These include:

* **US limitations in offering concrete support:** Intelligence sharing and limited logistical or technological aid don't constitute a decisive advantage against China's superior military capabilities. 

* **Distrust stemming from historical events:** 
  US support for Pakistan during the 1971 war and continued engagement with Pakistan fuel Indian skepticism.

* **Democratic backsliding concerns:**

The US raises concerns about democratic erosion in India, further straining relations.
*  Concerns about US motives: Some believe the US seeks to push India into a direct confrontation with China, benefiting its own weapons industry.
* **Conflicting priorities in the Western bloc:**  Economic ties between China and Western powers like Germany and the US-China "managed competition" stance raise doubts about Western unity and commitment to containing China.
* **Geographic realities:** India's geographical proximity to China makes a complete alignment with the West risky, as it limits strategic options and could lead to heightened tensions. 

In conclusion, while a strategic partnership with the US may seem appealing, the article argues that deep-rooted historical mistrust, differing priorities, and geopolitical realities make a complete alignment a complex and challenging prospect.</description>

			<title>What BRICS+ means for India amid rising polarity in global order</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/what-brics-means-for-india-amid-rising-polarity-in-global-order-13813761.html</link>
			<description>BRICS+'s expansion to include Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, and Egypt signifies its growing global influence and challenges the dominance of Western institutions like the IMF and UNSC.  This bloc now controls a substantial portion of global energy production, offering opportunities for India to secure resources at competitive rates.  

BRICS+ promotes economic integration among members, with increased intra-group trade and the development of institutions like the New Development Bank (NDB), facilitating infrastructure projects. India views BRICS+ as a platform to advocate for reforms in global institutions and shape a more equitable world order. 

While fostering economic growth, BRICS+ presents India with geopolitical challenges, primarily managing its relationship with China amidst border disputes and competition. India seeks to balance its engagement with BRICS+ by maintaining its strategic partnership with Russia and  the US.  
 


Vocabulary:  
* Geopolitical: Relating to the influence of geography on politics and international relations.
* Hegemony: Leadership or dominance, especially by one country or social group over others.
* Intra-group trade: Trade carried out within a particular group, such as a trade bloc.</description>

			<title>Illegal immigration from Bangladesh: Why India should deal with the issue with a sense of urgency</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/illegal-immigration-from-bangladesh-why-india-should-deal-with-the-issue-with-a-sense-of-urgency-13813681.html</link>
			<description>Illegal immigration from Bangladesh to India is a complex issue with significant economic, social, and security implications for India. The flow of migrants, estimated to be several million to as many as 15 million, has led to demographic changes and tensions in border areas.   To address this challenge, India needs a multifaceted strategy.  This includes amending Indian legislation to introduce a national refugee law that distinguishes between refugees and illegal migrants, implementing  'crimmigration' principles, strengthening border controls, and increasing investment in police and immigration authorities. 

A crucial step is establishing a bilateral agreement with Bangladesh for the readmission of nationals residing illegally in either country after verification.  India could also benefit from collaborating with international organizations like the UNHCR, IOM, and ICMPD, who possess expertise in managing migration issues.</description>

			<title>Anti-India narrative on social media: Why itâ€™s time for government to counter online negativity</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/anti-india-narrative-on-social-media-why-its-time-for-government-to-counter-online-negativity-13813668.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the growing problem of anti-India sentiment on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter). 

It highlights how misinformation and biased representations are being used to shape negative perceptions of India globally.  The author points out that India's large online presence is not effectively used to counter these narratives and calls for a more unified and assertive response from Indian citizens and the government. 

The article cites examples of successful counter-narratives and emphasizes the need for platforms that promote constructive dialogue and offer more control over the portrayal of India online. 



Finally, it urges a multifaceted approach that includes addressing internal divisions, engaging constructively with criticism, and leveraging the power of social media to showcase India's strengths and achievements.</description>

			<title>No second guessing: Why SCO remains important for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/no-second-guessing-why-sco-remains-important-for-india-13813608.html</link>
			<description>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has significantly evolved since its inception in 2001. Initially focused on security cooperation in Central Asia, the SCO has expanded its agenda to include trade, economic, and energy cooperation. China has emerged as a dominant force within the SCO, investing heavily in Central Asian infrastructure and leveraging its influence to advance its interests. 

India, which joined the SCO in 2017, is a unique member given its democratic values. While India maintains good relations with most SCO members, relations with China remain strained.

			<title>Why Uyghur groups have contradictory stances on Israel-Hamas war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-uyghur-groups-have-contradictory-stances-on-israel-hamas-war-13813376.html</link>
			<description>Following Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), a Germany-based group advocating for Uyghur rights, condemned the attacks and expressed solidarity with Israel. This stance has drawn criticism from the Muslim world, who see it as contradicting Islamic principles and ignoring the Palestinian struggle. The WUC's position is further questioned given its alleged funding from Western countries, including the US government through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and US Zionist organizations. Critics argue this funding may be influencing the WUC's pro-Israel stance, attempting to divert global attention from Palestine.  In contrast, some Uyghur groups based in Turkey, potentially influenced by the Turkish government's stance, have expressed solidarity with the Palestinians. The differing positions highlight the complex geopolitical considerations and potential for conflicting interests within the Uyghur community.</description>

			<title>How Trump 2.0 may be good news for India-Russia relations</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-trump-2-0-may-be-good-news-for-india-russia-relations-13813362.html</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the potential impact of a potential Trump return to the US presidency on India's foreign policy, particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine.  The author argues that a "Trump 2.0" scenario might be more advantageous for India than an Indian-origin US President, mainly due to Trump's indifference towards the Ukrainian conflict.

The author points out that Trump's isolationist stance and preference for prioritizing US interests could lead to him withdrawing US aid from Ukraine and potentially engaging with Russia, similar to his actions during his previous term. This could create a more favorable landscape for India to navigate its relationships with both Russia and the US, allowing for greater flexibility in strategic dealings.  

However, the author also acknowledges the potential complexities arising from Trump's unpredictable nature and past strained relations with Russia.</description>

			<title>How an Israel-Hezbollah war can spillover to larger West Asian conflict, divert focus from Gaza</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-a-israel-hezbollah-war-can-spillover-to-larger-west-asian-conflict-divert-focus-from-gaza-13813313.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, highlighting the group's growing military strength and Iranian support.  Since the conflict in Gaza began, Hezbollah has launched rockets into Israel, retaliating for Israeli airstrikes and asserting solidarity with Palestinians. 

Despite a precarious balance, both sides are wary of a full-scale war, understanding its potential devastation.  Hezbollah, considered more formidable than Hamas, possesses a substantial arsenal of rockets and has gained experience in combat through its involvement in Syria. 

Israel, while strategically targeting Hezbollah, remains cautious due to the group's deep roots in Lebanon and its influence within the country's political landscape.  

The article emphasizes the danger of wider conflict, particularly with Iran's active role in supporting Hezbollah and other militant groups. It concludes by warning that unchecked proxy conflicts could destabilize the region, urging for de-escalation through a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza.</description>

			<title>India-GCC meet: How Modi-era diplomacy has bridged the gulf between India and West Asia</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-gcc-meet-how-modi-era-diplomacy-has-bridged-the-gulf-between-india-and-west-asia-13813247.html</link>
			<description>India's West Asia policy, characterized by strategic autonomy and a de-hyphenation approach, has yielded significant success. Prime Minister Modi's frequent visits have strengthened relationships with regional countries, elevating them from transactional to strategic partnerships. India's focus on energy security, economy, trade, expatriate welfare, maritime cooperation, and mutual respect has resonated across the region.

India successfully navigates complex geopolitical situations, maintaining relationships with both Iran and Israel while advocating for peace in the Middle East. Its growing international stature has extended expectations for India's involvement in regional conflicts, exemplified by its efforts to mediate the Russia-Ukraine war.  

Furthermore, India actively engages through multilateral frameworks like I2U2 and IUSU, fostering economic cooperation through initiatives like the IMEEC. The India-GCC foreign ministers' meeting, aiming to deepen institutional cooperation and explore a free trade agreement, underscores the importance of India's partnership with the Gulf region.</description>

			<title>How Chinese J-20 fighters in Xinjiang and Tibet are a concern for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-chinese-j-20-fighters-in-xinjiang-and-tibet-are-a-concern-for-india-13813077.html</link>
			<description>India-China relations remain strained following the 2020 Galwan Valley clash. China has been aggressively building infrastructure along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and recently deployed its advanced fifth-generation J-20 stealth fighter aircraft to Shigatse Air Base in Tibet and Hotan Air Base in Xinjiang. 

These bases are strategically located close to the LAC and India's existing air bases. Shigatse is just 150 kilometers from the Indian Air Force's (IAF) Hasimara base, which houses Rafale aircraft. Hotan is 130 kilometers north of the Indian claim line.  The deployment of J-20s, along with other advanced PLAAF assets like bombers and drones, signifies China's growing military capabilities in the region and presents a potential challenge to Indian air dominance.

While the IAF has a significant numerical advantage in the region with airbases at lower altitudes and a combat-tested fleet of fighter jets, including the Rafale,  India is investing in infrastructure upgrades and bolstering its airpower to counter this threat.  Simultaneously, India is emphasizing indigenous development of its own fifth-generation fighter, the  Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), while also working towards acquiring additional multi-role fighters.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/after-bangladesh-crisis-is-india-now-resetting-its-ties-in-southern-neighbourhood-13813065.html</link>
			<description>Recent high-level visits by Indian officials to the Maldives and Sri Lanka demonstrate India's commitment to regional security and stability. 

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to the Maldives focused on addressing the nation's economic crisis and strengthening bilateral ties. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval's trip to Sri Lanka emphasized India's collaboration with all political candidates and parties in promoting regional security through initiatives like the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC).

Both visits addressed pressing concerns, with India pledging support for Sri Lanka's economic recovery and working to counter China's growing influence in the region. 

Despite internal challenges and political considerations, India aims to foster stronger economic and strategic partnerships with its neighbors, emphasizing a strategic approach that prioritizes regional stability and cooperation.</description>

			<title>Decoding reasons behind Putinâ€™s â€˜endorsementâ€™ of Kamala Harrisâ€™ presidency</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/decoding-reasons-behind-putins-endorsement-of-kamala-harris-presidency-13813022.html</link>
			<description>Vladimir Putin's humor, often described as dark, cynical, and deadpan, is a recurring element in his public persona. His jokes frequently have a hidden political agenda, as seen in his comments about Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, and renewable energy.  Putin uses humor to troll, make veiled criticisms, and reinforce his message of Russian strength and self-reliance.  

His remarks, often lacking in political tact,  have sparked controversy and raised questions about his worldview. Despite the unconventional nature of his humor, it seems to resonate with his supporters and solidify his image as a powerful and unapologetic leader.</description>

			<title>US presidential election: Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and stakes for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-presidential-election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-and-stakes-for-india-13812998.html</link>
			<description>The 2024 US Presidential election has significant implications for India's diplomatic and economic future. The outcome will shape India's relationship with the US, a key strategic partner.  India's ties with the US have strengthened over the years, encompassing trade, defense, technology, and cultural exchanges. 

Donald Trump's  policies during his presidency aligned with some of India's strategic interests, but his unpredictable nature and protectionist tendencies could create uncertainty. Kamala Harris, while having a symbolic connection to India through her heritage, has a less clear stance on issues crucial to India. 

The 2024 election presents a dilemma for India as both candidates offer different approaches to the relationship. Balancing its strategic partnerships in a volatile geopolitical landscape will be crucial for India's future.</description>

			<title>Pakistan: How Faiz Hameedâ€™s court martial is Gen Asim Munirâ€™s risky shot to get Imran Khan</title>

			<description>Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed, former ISI chief, is facing court martial proceedings initiated by the Pakistani army amidst accusations of exceeding legal and constitutional bounds while in service. He is alleged to have acted on instructions from political elements for personal gain and violated the Pakistan Army Act after retirement. The army cites "multiple instances of violation" and links the charges to the May 9, 2024 protests against the army's detention of Imran Khan. This unusual move, using the Field General Court Martial (FGCM),  historically reserved for wartime offenses,  highlights the deep tensions within the Pakistani military. This case comes amidst a broader crackdown on Imran Khan by the current army chief, General Asim Munir, who seeks to silence Khan's influence.</description>

			<title>Time for Taiwan to turn the narrative around</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/time-for-taiwan-to-turn-the-narrative-around-13812827.html</link>
			<description>China falsely portrays itself as a dominant power and aims to coerce Taiwan into submission through fear. It exploits the global lack of interest in countering its narrative, using state media, weasel-wording from "experts," and the constant repetition of its claims. 

A popular misconception is that dictators initiate wars to divert attention from domestic problems, a notion that benefits Beijing's propaganda. This stereotype ignores historical realities and perpetuates a defeatist narrative.

Taiwan's president recently challenged China's narrative, highlighting its weakness and baseless claims. To counter China's disinformation, Taiwan and its allies must proactively promote a message of strength and resolve, defending Taiwan's right to exist.</description>

			<description>A 2017 assault on a Malayalam film actress sparked a seven-year movement exposing exploitation within the industry.  Allegedly motivated by revenge, the attack highlighted a culture of male dominance and complicity within the film world, as seen in the Hollywood scandal involving Harvey Weinstein.  Women in the Malayalam film industry, facing retaliation for speaking out, have called for change, demanding adherence to safety guidelines and creation of secure work environments.  This movement echoes broader societal issues where women continue to face safety concerns and discrimination.  It's a call for men to be part of the solution, promoting gender equality and upholding safety for all.</description>

			<title>Mahrang Baloch: The harbinger of feminist wave in Balochi nationalism</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/mahrang-baloch-the-harbinger-of-feminist-wave-in-balochi-nationalism-13812771.html</link>
			<description>The Balochistan uprising has gained new momentum under the leadership of Mahrang Baloch, leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. Baloch women have taken a prominent role in the movement, demanding autonomy and an end to injustices perpetrated by the Pakistani state. 

These include forced disappearances, extra-judicial killings, and economic deprivation. Baloch nationalism, rooted in historical grievances dating back to 1948, has been fueled by the perceived apathy of the Pakistani establishment. Mahrang Baloch's peaceful, yet assertive approach, coupled with her personal experiences of loss due to state violence, has resonated with the people of Balochistan. 

Her movement highlights the urgency for a resolution to the Baloch conflict, advocating for democracy, human rights, and an end to state oppression.</description>

			<title>World merrily forgets Uyghur cause as China mobilises mega-propaganda machine</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/world-merrily-forgets-uyghur-cause-as-china-mobilises-mega-propaganda-machine-13812489.html</link>
			<description>A 2024 report by the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) detailed "serious human rights violations" in Xinjiang, China,  where an estimated million Uyghurs are detained in what China calls "re-education camps." The report urged China to address these abuses but Beijing has vehemently denied the allegations and countered with its own propaganda,  including state-sponsored tours and the publication of White Papers. 

Despite international reports and calls for action, including sanctions from the US, China continues to tighten control over Xinjiang,  muzzling dissent and restricting information flow.  Many countries, particularly Islamic nations, have aligned with China's narrative, seemingly swayed by Chinese diplomatic efforts and economic incentives. 


The international community's failure to effectively address China's actions in Xinjiang has led to a situation where China has successfully shaped global perceptions in its favor, leaving the plight of Uyghurs largely unaddressed.</description>

			<title>Amid wars in Ukraine and Gaza, are US, Iran in a â€˜Drone Raceâ€™?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/amid-wars-in-ukraine-and-gaza-are-us-iran-in-a-drone-race-13812464.html</link>
			<description>The article analyzes Iran's growing reliance on drone technology as a means of exerting influence in the Middle East and beyond. It highlights Iran's delivery of Shahed drones to Russia, used in the Ukraine conflict, framing it as a proxy war with the US, which is supplying drones to Ukraine. The author argues that Iran's drone program is driven by a desire to counter US and Israeli power and strengthen its position in the region. 

The article points to Iran's history of developing drones, drawing on expertise gained during the Iran-Iraq war and by reverse-engineering captured US drones. It also notes that Iran emphasizes its commitment to supporting Palestinian resistance through drone deployments, further complicating its role in the region.  The author concludes that Iran's assertive stance and rapid drone development pose a significant challenge to US interests in the Middle East.</description>

			<description>Recently, Prime Minister Modi visited Brunei and Singapore, strengthening India's engagement with ASEAN nations. This marked the first bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Brunei since its independence and elevated the India-Brunei relationship to an "Enhanced Partnership."  In Singapore, the partnership was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership."

 The visits focused on enhancing cooperation in various areas, including trade, gas, space, and capacity building.  

Significant agreements were signed, including one on semiconductors, highlighting Singapore's expertise in this field and India's aspirations in chipmaking. Both nations recognized the growing importance of diversification in supply chains, with Singapore increasingly interested in India's economic growth story.  

The visits also addressed strategic concerns, with the joint statement mentioning the South China Sea and acknowledging the role of the Quad.</description>

			<title>Facing the toughest challenge of her political career, Mamata Banerjee is making rookie mistakes</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/kolkata-rape-case-protests-in-west-bengal-mamata-banerjee-making-mistakes-13812346.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the widespread protests in Kolkata following the rape and murder of a junior doctor. The protests, driven by the urban middle class, demand justice and the resignation of key officials, including the police commissioner and the chief minister.

Despite  attempts by the TMC government to deflect blame and discredit the protestors, the movement persists and gains momentum.  The anger stems not only from the horrific crime but also from allegations of police misconduct, including pressure tactics on the victim's family and a crackdown on social media dissent. 

The author highlights the unprecedented nature of the protests, noting the unique participation of women and the apolitical nature of the movement, which has shaken the foundations of Mamata Banerjee's authority. The government's response, characterized by repression and a refusal to address the core issues, is seen as counterproductive and potentially exacerbating the situation.</description>

			<title>Indiaâ€™s neighbourhood challenge: No easy answers</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/indias-neighbourhood-challenge-no-easy-answers-13812339.html</link>
			<description>India's pursuit of friendly relations with its neighbors, despite historical complexities and geopolitical realities, faces inherent challenges. India's size and power, coupled with its neighbors' sensitivities about sovereignty and desire for external balancing, create friction. Pakistan's hostility, China's increasing influence in the region, and the complex dynamics within smaller nations like Bangladesh and Nepal add to the difficulty.  Although a stable neighborhood would be advantageous, India has achieved significant international progress amidst these challenges. India's approach should balance fostering closer ties with its neighbors while realistically addressing China's growing presence and Pakistan's persistent antagonism. Long-term strategies should focus on economic development, connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges with neighboring countries, while firmly outlining concerns and red lines.</description>

			<title>Jamaat genie out of bottle: How Yunus has failed to tame radicalism in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/jamaat-genie-out-of-bottle-how-yunus-has-failed-to-tame-radicalism-in-bangladesh-13811975.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's secular image clashes with a history of Islamist politics and violence.  While efforts were made to establish secular governance after independence, subsequent regimes incorporated Islamic values into the state, often led by political figures like Ziaur Rahman who promoted Bangladesh as an Islamic state. This shift, coupled with the rise of Islamist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami, contributed to increased radicalism. Numerous surveys reveal a growing support for sharia law among Bangladeshis.  

The 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of violent extremism, with groups like Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) carrying out attacks. Later, organizations like Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), ISIS, and al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) gained a foothold, targeting minorities and foreigners.Following the recent ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government, violence against minorities, particularly Hindus, has escalated. The interim government, led by Mohammad Yunus, has been criticized for its inaction and for lifting bans on radical Islamist groups. This situation raises concerns about Bangladesh's trajectory, mirroring its neighboring country Pakistan in its embrace of radical Islam.</description>

			<title>The Strait of Opportunity: India-Singapore ties, a classic win-win case</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-strait-of-opportunity-india-singapore-ties-a-classic-win-win-case-13811960.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit strengthens the growing relationship between India and Singapore. Singapore has invested heavily in India, becoming the largest source of foreign direct investment. The trade relationship is complementary, with Singapore exporting high-quality goods and India providing raw materials and talent.  A shared concern about China's influence drives strategic convergence, evidenced by long-standing defense ties including the annual SIMBEX naval exercise.  Both nations are collaborating in health, technology and finance.  Singapore's financial sector and stock exchange offer opportunities for Indian companies, while GIFT city in Gujarat presents an onshore option for Singapore.</description>

			<title>End of â€˜uninterrupted dialogueâ€™: How Indiaâ€™s policy dilemma towards Pakistan is over</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/end-of-uninterrupted-dialogue-how-indias-policy-dilemma-towards-pakistan-is-over-13811926.html</link>
			<description>India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar recently stated that the era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan is over.  This follows Pakistan's invitation to Prime Minister Modi to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Islamabad, an invitation India is unlikely to accept. The strained relationship is marked by the absence of diplomatic representatives in both capitals and a lack of cross-border trade.  Pakistan's obsession with the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, has further hindered dialogue. 

Despite calls from some quarters for reconciliation, the Indian government remains firm on its stance regarding Kashmir. The upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir are seen as a step towards normalizing the situation in the region.</description>

			<title>Why space diplomacy is a critical component of India-Brunei relations</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-space-diplomacy-is-a-critical-component-of-india-brunei-relations-13811903.html</link>
			<description>India and Brunei have elevated their bilateral ties to an Enhanced Partnership, focusing on collaboration in energy, technology, and specifically space. 

This comes amidst India's Act East policy and signifies the strategic importance of Brunei's location in the Indo-Pacific region. While Brunei currently lacks an active space program, it seeks international collaboration, leading to a recent MoU on cooperation in satellite and launch vehicle operations. This builds upon an existing arrangement from 1997 where ISRO established a telemetry tracking and command station in Brunei.  

India sees opportunities to expand its space influence in the region, countering China's Space Silk Road initiative by engaging smaller Southeast Asian nations. Brunei's equatorial location makes it attractive for establishing a launchpad, further deepening India's space diplomacy efforts in the region.</description>

			<title>IC 814 Kandahar hijacking: The perspective from Islamabad</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ic-814-kandahar-hijacking-the-perspective-from-islamabad-13811775.html</link>
			<description>This article recounts Ruchi Ghanashyam's experience as India's first woman diplomat in Pakistan during the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC-814 in 1999. As her husband, Ambassador Ghanashyam, was the official sent to Kandahar, Afghanistan to negotiate the hostages' release, Ruchi faced a heightened sense of anxiety and uncertainty during the tense days following the hijacking.  

Despite the historical context of previous hijackings and the precarious situation in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, Ruchi found solace in her belief that the Pashtun tradition of hospitality would offer protection to her husband. She details the depleted staff at the Indian High Commission, the Pakistani media's speculation, and her personal encounter with a Pakistani journalist who questioned Ghanashyam's identity and role. The article concludes with Ruchi reflecting on the event, questioning whether their actions stemmed from bravery, naivety, or simply the demands of their work.</description>

			<title>UC Berkeley vigil for Bangladesh Hindus: Lessons for survival</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/uc-berkeley-vigil-for-bangladesh-hindus-lessons-for-survival-13811680.html</link>
			<description>A recent vigil at UC Berkeley highlighted the growing concern for Hindus facing aggression and persecution, especially in Bangladesh.  While media coverage often minimizes or rationalizes these events, many Hindus feel unheard and powerless.

The article argues that a shift towards emphasizing Hindu success in economic and social spheres over clearly proclaiming a deity-centric worldview has been detrimental.  It criticizes Hindu leaders for embracing a narrative of assimilation rather than defending their traditions and religious beliefs forcefully. The authors believe this approach has weakened Hindus' ability to respond to  Hinduphobia and leaves their children vulnerable to the anti-Hindu rhetoric they face in Western societies. 
 
They call for Hindus to reclaim their ancestral strengths and stand by their gods and traditions openly, arguing this is the only way to truly combat the growing threat to their faith.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the close relationship between India and Singapore, highlighting similarities in history, culture, and demographics. Singapore, despite being a small city-state, boasts a strong economy and high quality of life, serving as a role model for India.

It points out the need for the Indian diaspora to contribute more to India through investments and entrepreneurship, drawing a comparison to the role of the Chinese diaspora in China's economic growth.

			<title>Geopolitical consequences of â€˜orchestrated revolutionâ€™ in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/geopolitical-consequences-of-orchestrated-revolution-in-bangladesh-13811550.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's recent political upheaval, marked by the removal of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the appointment of Muhammad Yunus as interim leader, has significant geopolitical implications. The crisis is seen as an orchestrated revolution, potentially fuelled by external actors like the US and China, each seeking to advance its strategic interests in the region.

The US, interested in asserting its influence in the Indo-Pacific and countering China's growing presence, is suspected of backing the change in leadership. China, meanwhile, while wary of US involvement, may welcome a shift that aligns with its own ambitions and weakens India's ties with Bangladesh. Pakistan, with its historical links to radical groups in Bangladesh, is also believed to have played a role in the unrest, potentially gaining leverage through support for radical elements within the new government.

Bangladesh's strategic location, controlling a portion of the Bay of Bengal and serving as a gateway to Southeast Asia, makes it a crucial player in the region's geopolitics. The ongoing crisis raises concerns about a potential new Cold War-like rivalry between the US and China, with Bangladesh becoming a focal point of this conflict. 


The radicalization of Bangladeshi politics under the new government further complicates the situation, potentially contributing to instability in the region and hindering cooperation on issues like economic development and countering terrorism.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the significance of the upcoming US presidential elections for India.

			<description>The article discusses potential outcomes of the upcoming US presidential election and its implications for global policy.

			<title>Colombo Security Conclave: Amid growing Chinese challenge, India renews its commitment to regional security</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/colombo-security-conclave-amid-growing-chinese-challenge-india-renews-its-commitment-to-regional-security-13810945.html</link>
			<description>India, with its growing economic prowess and strategic geographical location, views the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as its neighbourhood. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "SAGAR" vision emphasizes security and growth for all in the region. Recognizing the IOR's importance for global trade and security, India is actively involved in initiatives like the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC).

The CSC, initially a trilateral dialogue between India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, has expanded to include Mauritius, Bangladesh, and Seychelles, highlighting India's growing regional influence.  The CSC focuses on maritime security, counter-terrorism, combating human trafficking, transnational organized crime, and humanitarian assistance.

India's increasing naval presence and contributions to regional security are driven in part by concerns over China's growing influence in the IOR. China's "String of Pearls" strategy and its naval expansion pose a challenge to India's strategic interests.  Despite these challenges, India's commitment to  cooperative security measures like the CSC is crucial for ensuring stability and prosperity in the region.</description>

			<title>Egypt deploys forces in Somalia: How it may end up creating a new conflict in the Horn of Africa</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/egypt-deploys-forces-in-somalia-how-it-may-end-up-creating-a-new-conflict-in-the-horn-of-africa-13810803.html</link>
			<description>Tensions are escalating in the Horn of Africa due to an agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland, which recognizes Somaliland's independence in return for port access. 

This agreement has sparked controversy, with Somalia condemning it as a violation of its sovereignty.  Egypt has recently signed a defense pact with Somalia and deployed troops, aiming to bolster Somali security and potentially counter Ethiopian influence.  

This development increases the risk of conflict between Egypt and Ethiopia, who are already at odds over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile River. The situation is further complicated by the presence of Yemen's Houthis in Somalia and instability caused by terrorist groups like Al-Shabaab.


The potential for a major conflict in the region is a serious concern, threatening regional stability, international security, and humanitarian well-being.</description>

			<title>Shadow Warrior | The geo-political fallout from Bangladesh: What should India do?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/shadow-warrior-the-geo-political-fallout-from-bangladesh-what-should-india-do-13810744.html</link>
			<description>The fall of the Hasina government in Bangladesh presents a significant challenge for India. The change in leadership, coupled with rising anti-India sentiment and the increased threat of extremist groups, raises concerns about India's security and economic interests.  

The new government's stance on issues like trade, security, and border management remains uncertain, potentially impacting the positive bilateral relations built over the past decade. Bangladesh's increasing vulnerability to climate change, with millions potentially seeking refuge in India, further complicates the situation. 

The coup has also created an opportunity for China to expand its influence in the region, adding to India's geopolitical concerns. The situation highlights the need for a recalibrated India-Bangladesh policy that prioritizes stable relationships and addresses shared challenges while countering external threats.</description>

			<title>Baloch uprising: Pakistan is on the verge of implosion</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/baloch-uprising-pakistan-is-on-the-verge-of-implosion-13810695.html</link>
			<description>The Baloch insurgency in Pakistan is a long-standing issue stemming from the forced merger of Balochistan with Pakistan in 1948.  The Baloch people have consistently resisted Pakistani rule, facing repression, human rights abuses, and a lack of political representation. The recent attack on Pakistani infrastructure by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) highlights the escalating conflict and demonstrates the BLA's resolve. Pakistan's attempts to quell the insurgency through force and divide-and-rule tactics have been ineffective. 

The involvement of China in the CPEC project, which passes through Balochistan, has further inflamed tensions, with Baloch people perceiving it as a threat to their natural resources. Political instability in Pakistan is compounded by protests in other regions, suggesting a potential for the country's disintegration. The rise of Dr Mahrang Baloch as a peaceful leader bolstering the Baloch nationalist movement adds another layer to the complex situation.</description>

			<title>China will have to pay the price for its overtures in Balochistan</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/china-will-have-to-pay-the-price-for-its-overtures-in-balochistan-13810493.html</link>
			<description>Recent attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, Pakistan, highlight the growing resentment towards the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The BLA views China as an accomplice to Pakistan's suppression of the Baloch movement for independence.  These attacks, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the death of prominent Baloch leader Nawab Bugti, who opposed Chinese interests in the region, are seen as a reaction to China's disregard for local grievances and its support for Pakistan's policies targeting Baloch people.  The Balochs view China's activities in their region as exploitative and reminiscent of the oppression faced by Uyghurs in Xinjiang, whom they have expressed solidarity with. China's close relationship with Pakistan and its labeling of Baloch resistance as terrorism further fuels discontent.</description>

			<title>Humayunâ€™s Tomb museum | How an unprepared prince became the emperor of second chances</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/humayuns-tomb-museum-how-an-unprepared-prince-became-the-emperor-of-second-chances-13810463.html</link>
			<description>Emperor Humayun, son of Babur, faces a life filled with both triumphs and tribulations as ruler of the Mughal dynasty.  Humayun's early reign is marked by challenges, including battles against rivals and the rise of Sher Shah Suri, who ultimately forces him into exile. Despite these setbacks, Humayun perseveres, finding sanctuary in Persia and eventually reclaiming his throne in Delhi. Although his reign is short-lived, marked by a tragic death in a fall, Humayun's resilience and determination solidify his place in Mughal history. 

A new museum dedicated to Humayun at his impressive tomb in Delhi, highlights the emperor's life story through a comprehensive narrative that incorporates detailed insights into the architectural design of the tomb and its surroundings. The museum also showcases fascinating artifacts, paintings, and manuscripts, offering visitors a glimpse into the art, culture, and daily life of the Mughal era.</description>

			<title>Ramification | How instability in Myanmar fosters drug trade, affects Indiaâ€™s security</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-instability-in-myanmar-fosters-drug-trade-affects-indias-security-13810413.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the enduring link between conflict, drugs, and instability in Myanmar's Shan State.  It highlights the region's long history of drug production and trafficking, starting with the powerful figures like Olive Yang, Lo Hsing-Han, and Khun Sa. 

The article analyzes how even after attempts to control the trade and bring democracy, groups like the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and  the Arakan Army (AA) have become deeply involved in the illicit drug market.  

The consequences extend beyond Myanmar, affecting neighboring countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India, with a surge in Yaba (methamphetamine) trafficking posing significant security threats. 

The proliferation of new drug brands and a lack of central control due to the fragmented political landscape further complicate the situation, making it even more challenging to combat this pervasive issue.</description>

			<title>Sullivanâ€™s Beijing visit: Why US needs a grand strategy to deal with China</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/sullivans-beijing-visit-why-us-needs-a-grand-strategy-to-deal-with-china-13810411.html</link>
			<description>The absence of a clear US grand strategy leaves it vulnerable to China's growing influence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. While China faces economic challenges, its geopolitical ambitions remain strong, driven by the need to maintain the Communist Party's legitimacy. 

The US focus on the Ukraine conflict has inadvertently benefited China, allowing it to strengthen its position in the South China Sea and apply pressure on Taiwan. The US trade deficit with China further highlights its vulnerability.  The potential return of Donald Trump, with his unpredictable policies, could disrupt US-China relations.  

The article warns that the absence of a coherent US strategy risks escalating tensions and instability, potentially leading to military conflict. Great power competition, it argues, rarely ends gracefully.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the alarming rise in student suicides in India. Student suicides have increased by 4% compared to the overall suicide rate which has risen by 2%.  The article highlights the immense pressure on Indian students, particularly those aspiring for careers in demanding fields like engineering and medicine. It points  to the competitive nature of the education system, the emphasis on entrance exams like JEE and NEET, and the influence of coaching centers as contributing factors. 

The article also emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue of mental health among students. It calls for changes in the education system, including prioritizing mental health, providing counseling services, and engaging parents to create a more supportive environment.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-jamaats-rise-is-bad-news-for-bangladeshs-global-standing-and-indias-regional-security-13810161.html</link>
			<description>The recent political developments in Bangladesh, including the departure of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami, have sparked concern about the country's stability and future. Jamaat-e-Islami, known for its Islamist ideology and history of violence, poses a significant threat to Bangladesh's secular fabric and the safety of its minorities, particularly Hindus. The party's potential to destabilize the region, embolden insurgent groups, and harm Bangladesh's international relations is a cause for worry. 


The international community is closely watching the situation, hoping for a return to secularism and a government that protects the rights of all citizens.</description>

			<title>US Sutra | The reinvention of Kamala Harris: Reality or hype?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-sutra-the-reinvention-of-kamala-harris-reality-or-hype-13810119.html</link>
			<description>The Democratic National Convention (DNC) marked Vice President Kamala Harris's ascendance as the party's presidential candidate.  Her speech aimed for relatability, highlighting diversity and inclusivity. 

The DNC presented a stark contrast to the Republican platform, emphasizing a "soft-socialist" approach versus Trump's focus on American dominance. Harris's economic plan drew criticism for being flawed and simplistic, while concerns arose regarding her stance on immigration and its impact on vulnerable citizens. Despite media bias in her favor, polls remain tight, highlighting the significance of undecided and independent voters.  Given the razor-thin margins in recent elections and persistent controversies surrounding electoral integrity, the upcoming election is poised to be highly contested and consequential.</description>

			<title>â€˜Invaluableâ€™ partner? American meddling in Indian politics and regional interventionism hasnâ€™t served New Delhiâ€™s cause</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/invaluable-partner-american-meddling-in-indian-politics-and-regional-interventionism-hasnt-served-new-delhis-cause-13810071.html</link>
			<description>Demonstrating a shift in power dynamics after recent elections, the US has been increasing engagement with Indian opposition leaders. American diplomats have met with opposition figures in various states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. These meetings, while portraying the US as simply fostering subnational diplomacy, raise concerns about potential interference in India's domestic politics. 

This trend is happening against the backdrop of ongoing tensions between India and the US regarding Bangladesh. While India has expressed concerns about the treatment of minorities in Bangladesh, the US took a more interventionist stance, which according to some accounts, contributed to the ousting of the then-prime minister.  

Further exacerbating these concerns is the US's complicated relationship with Myanmar, where their support for rebel groups has fueled instability and regional insecurity, a factor impacting India's northeastern states.


Despite the US's framing of the relationship as "invaluable," these actions demonstrate a tendency to prioritize their strategic interests over India's, raising questions about the reliability of the American partnership.</description>

			<title>Myanmar: India should engage with resistance forces before China takes a lead</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/myanmar-india-should-engage-with-resistance-forces-before-china-takes-a-lead-13809909.html</link>
			<description>Myanmar's junta is facing increasing losses against resistance forces and could be on the verge of collapse. The junta has lost control of key trade routes and territory to ethnic armed organizations, local militias, and the People Defence Force. This situation has led to humanitarian crises, with refugees fleeing violence to neighboring countries. 

India, concerned about instability along its border with Myanmar, has so far maintained a cautious approach, engaging with the junta while avoiding contact with resistance groups. As the situation deteriorates, India faces a dilemma:  continue balancing relations with the junta or take a more active role in supporting the resistance and establishing humanitarian corridors. 

The collapse of the junta could lead to a balkanization of Myanmar, further complicating regional security and stability. India needs to prepare for this scenario and consider collaborating with other countries, such as Japan and ASEAN members, to foster dialogue and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.</description>

			<title>Maldives: President Muizzuâ€™s plan to end dollar shortage is a risky gamble</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/maldives-president-muizzus-plan-to-end-dollar-shortage-is-a-risky-gamble-13809828.html</link>
			<description>Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu's decision to mandate dollar payments for government dues from businesses earning in foreign currency aims to address the nation's dollar crunch. This move, though potentially beneficial, has ignited debate about its effectiveness and potential disincentives for investors.

While the government cites the need for fiscal discipline and revenue generation, critics argue that it might hamper investment and economic growth. Muizzu's government also faces scrutiny regarding potential evidence of a coup attempt linked to a bank's debit card withdrawal limit incident, adding to the political complexities.   

The government's focus on clamping down on illegal forex exchanges and hawala transactions, coupled with addressing drug smuggling and sociological issues, indicates a multi-pronged approach to tackling the dollar crisis.

Muizzu's success hinges on striking a balance between revenue generation and investor confidence, while navigating political challenges and social issues. The outcome of these measures remains to be seen and will significantly impact his government's long-term economic and political viability.</description>

			<title>AI and racism: How artificial intelligence promotes racist rants against Indians</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ai-and-racism-how-artificial-intelligence-promotes-racist-rants-against-indians-13809805.html</link>
			<description>The increasing integration of AI into human lives raises concerns about potential biases and the perpetuation of societal prejudices. AI systems, while powerful, are trained on data generated by humans, which often reflects existing stereotypes and discriminatory practices. 

A study revealed that large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini exhibit racist stereotypes against speakers of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Additionally, the automatic translation of derogatory Chinese terms for Indians by Google Translate raises serious concerns about algorithmic bias.  Such instances highlight the urgent need for intervention from governments and tech companies to address racial bias in AI systems and ensure they are developed and deployed ethically.  Failing to do so risks exacerbating existing inequalities and creating a more divided future.</description>

			<title>How Bangladesh crisis points at global power play in Bay of Bengal</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladesh-crisis-points-at-global-power-play-in-bay-of-bengal-13809740.html</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the political instability in Bangladesh and its connection to the larger geopolitical rivalry between China and the US in the Bay of Bengal.  It argues that while Muhammad Yunus's interim government may appear to offer a solution, the underlying cause of the crisis is foreign interference, particularly from the US and China. 

China, through its Belt and Road Initiative, aims to expand its influence in the Bay of Bengal, investing heavily in ports and infrastructure. This raises concerns for India, which views the region as its backyard and has historically maintained strong ties with Bangladesh. The article highlights China's strategic investments in Mongla and Chittagong ports, its presence in Myanmar, and its potential to challenge India's security interests. 

In response, India is bolstering its relationship with Bangladesh through infrastructure projects, trade, and diplomatic engagements. It is also working closely with Japan to counter China's growing influence in the region. The article concludes that India needs to be strategic and proactive in protecting its interests in the Bay of Bengal, as the region is becoming a focal point of a larger geopolitical conflict.</description>

			<title>How Pakistani counter-terrorism operations flared up Baloch insurgency</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-pakistani-counter-terrorism-operations-flared-up-baloch-insurgency-13809526.html</link>
			<description>The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) launched Operation Herof, a large-scale attack on Pakistani security forces and infrastructure.  This followed Pakistan's military operation in Balochistan, which the BLA claims is intended to suppress the Baloch people. 

The BLA took responsibility for attacks on army bases, vehicles, and the main railway line to Quetta. They claimed to have killed over a hundred soldiers and released photographs of slain militants. 

Pakistan responded by blaming the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) despite evidence suggesting local involvement, and cabinet approved increased funding for operations. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif offered dialogue but faced criticism for the Pakistani military's actions against Baloch people. 

The situation is exacerbated by internal tensions, with the Baloch Chief Minister advocating genocide as a solution.  International actors, such as the US and China, offer counterterrorism cooperation to Pakistan, but their involvement may further complicate the situation for the Baloch people.</description>

			<title>Chinese aggression in South China Sea will push Philippines more into American arms</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinese-aggression-in-south-china-sea-will-push-philippines-more-into-american-arms-13809462.html</link>
			<description>The Philippines is facing increasing tensions with China in the South China Sea, with confrontations escalating over disputed territories and maritime claims.  Manila accuses Beijing of employing "gray zone" tactics, including the deployment of vessels near Philippine-controlled areas and harassment of Philippine ships. This has prompted the Philippine government to strengthen its military ties with the United States, allowing US forces access to additional bases in the country. Philippine President Marcos seeks to modernize the country's military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression and protect Philippine sovereignty. 

While China remains the Philippines' top trading partner, growing mistrust and the territorial disputes have strained bilateral relations. The Philippines seeks international support to uphold the 2016 South China Sea Arbitration ruling, which invalidated China's expansive maritime claims.  As tensions rise, the Philippines risks becoming a focal point of the wider regional power struggle between China and the US.</description>

			<description>Despite a recent increase in Olympic medals, India's performance still falls short of expectations.  The author argues for policy stability to support long-term athlete development and highlights the need to prioritize aquatic sports, athletics, and gymnastics.  They suggest increased federation accountability, strengthened state-corporate partnerships, greater involvement of the Defence Services, and a national-level planning conclave for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.  The author proposes a "Kreedapath" program similar to Agnipath for short-term sports enlistment and calls for a "Target Olympic Grassroot Scheme" to identify talent at the grassroots level.  Ultimately, they emphasize the importance of committed sports policy stability for India to achieve Olympic success.</description>

			<title>Why China must recall history before replacing Tibet with â€˜Xizangâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-china-must-recall-history-before-replacing-tibet-with-xizang-13809349.html</link>
			<description>The article examines China's claim over Tibet, arguing that it contradicts historical facts and evidence. 

The author points out Tibet's longstanding cultural and religious ties with India and its previous status as an independent nation, citing the 1913-14 Simla conference as proof of Tibet's right to negotiate treaties.  

China's attempts to control the reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, particularly the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, are criticized.  The author highlights the case of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the recognized reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, who was abducted by Chinese authorities in 1995. 

The article contrasts the immense popularity and reverence for the Dalai Lama with the limited support for the Chinese-selected Panchen Lama. 

Finally, the author condemns China's brutal suppression of the Tibetan rebellion in 1958, citing declassified military records that reveal the aerial bombardment of fleeing Tibetans by the People's Liberation Army Air Force.</description>

			<title>Caste in an old mould: Are we going backward?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/caste-in-an-old-mould-are-we-going-backward-13809124.html</link>
			<description>The discourse around caste in India appears to have regressed despite a lack of concrete evidence suggesting a worsening economic situation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SCs/STs).  

A period from 2005 to 2014 focused on individual empowerment and addressing deprivation through mechanisms like the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), which emphasized household-level indicators rather than solely relying on caste. 

This shift aimed to move away from the limitations of using a collective category like caste to define deprivation, recognizing the potential for both exclusion and inclusion errors. Prominent voices like Milind Kamble, Chandra Bhan Prasad, and D Shyam Babu advocated for  economic empowerment as a means to reduce caste's relevance.  

However, recent trends indicate a resurgence of the "old mould" view of caste, with a renewed emphasis on caste-based identity.</description>

			<title>Jake Sullivanâ€™s China visit: Sino-American ties and the question of Bidenâ€™s legacy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/jake-sullivans-china-visit-sino-american-ties-and-the-question-of-bidens-legacy-13809070.html</link>
			<description>US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan's visit to China is aimed at stabilizing the relationship between the two countries. The meeting follows a series of diplomatic efforts since  the tensions escalated after the Chinese spy balloon incident. Sullivan is expected to discuss areas of concern, including China's military activities around Taiwan, while also pushing for the resumption of military-to-military talks and collaboration on issues like fentanyl production. 

This visit signifies a continued effort by the Biden administration to engage in diplomacy and find common ground despite ongoing disagreements and geopolitical competition.  Ultimately, the goal is to manage the complex relationship and prevent further escalation of tensions.</description>

			<title>Why West Asia cannot afford an Israel-Hezbollah war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-west-asia-cannot-afford-an-israel-hezbollah-war-13809005.html</link>
			<description>Tensions escalated between Hezbollah and Israel following a rocket attack and subsequent airstrikes. Both sides exchanged messages indicating they  do not desire all-out war but remain prepared. The situation has displaced hundreds of thousands of people and worsened the humanitarian crisis.  The conflict raises concerns about regional stability, global energy security, and international diplomacy. 

 India, with significant stakes in the region's stability, has historically favoured a diplomatic solution and is urging for de-escalation while  maintaining balanced relations with involved parties. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining if the current hostilities will de-escalate or escalate into a larger conflict.</description>

			<title>Balochistan attacks show Pakistan is a failed state</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-balochistan-attacks-show-pakistan-is-a-failed-state-13808931.html</link>
			<description>Recent attacks on August 26-27, 2024, by Baloch insurgents, codenamed "Op Haruf," resulted in the deaths of at least 23 civilians and 14 security personnel. The violence, including the targeting of civilians, security pickets, and the destruction of infrastructure, was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and executed near the Punjab border.  The attacks, which coincided with the martyrdom day of Nawab Akbar Bugti, highlighted serious intelligence lapses by Pakistani security agencies.  The attacks demonstrate the intensity of the Baloch insurgency and underscore the failure of military force alone to solve the underlying issues driving the conflict. Political leaders have primarily focused on reprisals, neglecting previous efforts to address the grievances of the Baloch people, such as the Aghaz e Huqooq package.  

A deeper understanding of the causes of Balochistan's disaffection, including human rights violations, socio-economic disparities, and the denial of political rights, is necessary to achieve lasting peace.</description>

			<title>Can Trump do a Truman? When opinion polls err and media is biased</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/can-trump-do-a-truman-when-opinion-polls-err-and-media-is-biased-13808769.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the accuracy of opinion polls, drawing parallels between polls before the 2020 and 1948 elections and highlighting how incorrect predictions can be.  

Though some recent polls show a lead for VP Kamala Harris, the article cautions against jumping to conclusions based on this, reasoning that recent polls do not guarantee election results. It cites 1948 and 2016 elections that defied poll predictions.  It also points out that media often biases its reporting 

The article argues that journalists often overstate the certainty of polls, which can mislead readers as polls aren't 100% accurate. The Truman-Dewey 1948 election. 2016 saw similar discrepancies with polls predicting Hillary Clinton's win.  The article then again emphasizes that polls should not be treated as guaranteed predictions. 

The article concludes by suggesting that, just like media sometimes overemphasize poll results when they favor their narrative, predicting the election outcome.</description>

			<title>Sri Lankan presidential poll: Dynast, incumbent and challenger, but no frontrunner yet</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/sri-lankan-presidential-poll-dynast-incumbent-and-challenger-but-no-frontrunner-yet-13808725.html</link>
			<description>Sri Lanka is preparing for a presidential election on September 21st, amidst political instability. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who assumed office after the 2022 protests that ousted Gotabaya Rajapaksa, is seeking re-election as an independent candidate. 

The main opposition, led by Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), is forming alliances with various parties to challenge him.  The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) initially planned to field Dhammika Perera, but after his withdrawal, has nominated Namal Rajapaksa, son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.  

Other notable candidates include Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Anura Kumar Dissanayake representing the National Peopleâ€™s Power (NPP).  The election will be closely watched as it could signal the direction of Sri Lankan politics following the recent turmoil. Achieving a first-round majority for any candidate remains  unlikely without significant coalition building.</description>

			<title>From Ukraine to Bangladesh: Analysing instability, regime change and the not-so-hidden American hand</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-ukraine-to-bangladesh-analysing-instability-regime-change-and-the-not-so-hidden-american-hand-13808653.html</link>
			<description>This article examines the activities of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a US Congress-funded body, and its role in promoting regime change in countries like Bangladesh and its influence on India's democratic processes. It argues that NED, while claiming to support democracy, operates like a tool of US soft power, often inciting division and supporting violence. 

The article highlights NED's funding of NGOs critical of the Indian government, which has led to concerns about foreign interference in India's internal affairs. It cites examples of NED's influence in shaping global narratives about India's democracy and its alleged involvement in the toppling of governments like Imran Khan's in Pakistan.  The article also discusses the internal debate within the US regarding NED's funding and ideological leanings, noting the criticism it faces from both Republicans and the public.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-pm-modis-ukraine-visit-suited-both-optics-and-interests-13808631.html</link>

			<title>How the USâ€™ bipartisan democracy fails to represent plural voices of present-day America</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-the-us-bipartisan-democracy-fails-to-represent-plural-voices-of-present-day-america-13808400.html</link>
			<description>The US two-party system, while historically promoting stability, is increasingly failing to represent the diverse modern electorate.  The system's rigidity marginalizes the voices of many, particularly the lower middle class, Hispanics, Indian Americans, and African Americans,  leaving them politically disengaged. 

The binary nature of the system forces diverse communities into broad, often conflicting, policy platforms, failing to address their specific needs. Racial and ethnic minorities, despite the symbolic presence of figures like Obama and Harris, remain politically disenfranchised due to a system that discourages the emergence of new parties to better represent their interests. 


Reforming this system requires not only encouraging new political parties but also rethinking representation in the US. Public financing of campaigns could create a more inclusive system. Addressing this issue is crucial for the US to live up to its democratic ideals and prevent democracy from perpetuating inequality.</description>

			<title>Shadow Warrior | The tragedy of Wayanad and the vulnerability of Western Ghats</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/climate-tragedy-of-wayanad-and-the-vulnerability-of-western-ghats-13808331.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the ecological problems in Kerala, focusing on the recent landslides in Wayanad and their causes.

A range of factors contribute to the instability of the region, including population pressure, overtourism, and environmental destruction. Deforestation has weakened the soil, making it vulnerable to heavy rainfall. The article points to climate change, excessive rainfall, and soil erosion as further contributors to the landslides. 

Historical events like the eruption of Parasurama legend, the 1341 flood in Kodungalloor, and the devastating floods of 1924 are cited as evidence that Kerala has always been prone to geological events. 

The author argues that the government needs to take stronger action to address the situation through stricter land use regulations, better disaster management strategies, and a shift toward sustainable tourism practices. They emphasize the importance of reforestation, community engagement, and addressing the root causes of ecological damage.</description>

			<title>PM Modiâ€™s Ukraine and Poland visits: Broadening the base of Indian diplomacy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-ukraine-and-poland-visits-broadening-the-base-of-indian-diplomacy-13808300.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Poland and Ukraine signifies India's efforts to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape created by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

Recognizing the multi-faceted nature of the situation, India has stressed the need for dialogue and diplomacy while maintaining its historically close ties with Russia. This delicate balancing act has drawn both praise and criticism, with the West urging India to take a stronger stance against Russia.  

Modi's visits aimed to reiterate India's commitment to peace and stability while highlighting the global impact of the conflict, particularly on food and energy security. While negotiations with both countries succeeded in outlining shared principles, differing perspectives on key issues, such as Zelensky's '10-point peace formula', remain apparent.

India's focus on expanding its diplomatic engagement with Central and Eastern Europe, as exemplified by the visit to Poland, reflects a broader strategy of diversifying its partnerships and strengthening its global standing.</description>

			<title>The war of narratives: Why India needs a domestic social media universe</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-war-of-narratives-why-india-needs-a-domestic-social-media-universe-13808258.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that control over social media narratives is crucial for national sovereignty in today's digital age.  It cites the example of Bangladesh, where social media played a significant role in recent political upheavals, highlighting the potential for manipulation and regime change. 

The article compares this to the influence wielded by the US through Hollywood in the past, emphasizing how narratives shape global perceptions. It then focuses on China's proactive approach, building its own social media ecosystem to control domestic narratives and safeguard its sovereignty.  

The author concludes by urging India to learn from these examples and develop its own independent digital infrastructure to protect its sovereignty and control its own narrative.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv and Poland aimed to contribute to peace efforts in the Ukraine conflict.  Modi emphasized dialogue and diplomacy, urging both sides to find a peaceful resolution. While acknowledging the complexity of the situation, India reaffirmed its commitment to global welfare and offered support for Ukraine's reconstruction.

During his visit, Modi gifted medical aid and pledged to strengthen bilateral ties in areas like trade, agriculture, and defense.  India has consistently called for adherence to international law and has supported initiatives like the Black Sea grain deal. The author argues that India's stance on purchasing Russian oil, while criticized by Zelensky, should be seen in the context of Europe's continued reliance on Russian gas and the need to prioritize energy security. The article concludes by highlighting India's role as a trusted mediator and its commitment to peacemaking.</description>

			<title>How radicalism in Bangladesh threatens Indiaâ€™s â€˜Chicken Neckâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-radicalism-in-bangladesh-threatens-indias-chicken-neck-13808083.html</link>
			<description>The recent ousting of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has created a serious geopolitical problem for India.  Under Hasina's leadership, Bangladesh was a stable ally and a safe haven for its minorities, particularly Hindus. The current situation, seemingly spurred by fabricated student protests, is highly suspicious as it aligns with historical patterns of Pakistan destabilizing regions due to its intolerance of secularism.

The turmoil in Bangladesh has unleashed violence against minorities, a disturbing echo of the atrocities committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. It is now feared that Pakistan's influence, possibly through the ISI and Jamaat-e-Islami, is gaining ground in Bangladesh, threatening India's northeastern border.  

This new development could force India to confront not one, but two hostile neighbors, potentially opening a new front of instability and cross-border terrorism.  With the strategically vital Siliguri Corridor at risk, India must strengthen its defenses and diplomatic efforts to counter this emerging threat.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-israel-iran-war-can-ruin-peace-chances-for-gaza-destabilise-middle-east-13808072.html</link>
			<description>The assassination of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders has heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, raising fears of a regional war. Iran has vowed retaliation, leaving the world to speculate on the form it will take. This escalating conflict has significant global implications, potentially disrupting oil supplies, triggering an economic crisis, and fueling a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. 

India, heavily reliant on the Gulf region for energy, has a vested interest in de-escalation and regional stability. Potential disruptions to trade routes and the safety of Indian citizens in the region pose serious challenges. India's diplomacy and its strong ties with both Iran and Israel could play a crucial role in mediating the conflict and preventing further bloodshed.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/rajnath-singhs-us-visit-indo-american-defence-ties-on-the-upswing-13808044.html</link>
			<description>Recent developments have strengthened the strategic partnership between India and the US, particularly in the defense sector. The signing of the Security of Supplies Agreement (SOSA) will facilitate closer defense industry cooperation, while the Reciprocal Defence Procurement Agreement (RDP) is expected to follow, promoting joint production and sourcing. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for liaison officers will also bolster defense ties.

These agreements build upon existing collaboration, including the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), which have enhanced intelligence sharing, logistics support, communications, and geospatial intelligence access, respectively.  

The US has designated India as a Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 (STA-1) country, enabling India to acquire advanced technologies. The US-India Business Council (USIBC) and the India-US Defence Policy Group (DPG) facilitate dialogues and strengthen collaborations between the two nations.  

This deepening partnership enhances joint security interests in the Indo-Pacific region and reflects the growing convergence of strategic goals between the two democracies.</description>

			<title>PM Modiâ€™s Ukraine visit: Key takeaways for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-ukraine-visit-key-takeaways-for-india-13808031.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visits to Russia and Ukraine demonstrated India's commitment to peace and its pursuit of independent foreign policy. India has consistently called for dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as evidenced by Modi's statements to Putin emphasizing the inappropriateness of war in the current era. While India has abstained from resolutions supporting either side and provided humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, it has also increased its imports of Russian oil and gas, a move criticized by the West.  

 India's role in potential peace efforts is significant, as it is a leading voice of the Global South and has been invited by Ukraine to host a peace summit.  However, the success of such initiatives hinges on the willingness of both Russia and Ukraine to engage in meaningful dialogue and compromise.</description>

			<title>Japan: Where did Fumio Kishida go wrong?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/japan-where-did-fumio-kishida-go-wrong-13807924.html</link>
			<description>Fumio Kishida, facing declining public support and internal party pressure, chose to step down as Prime Minister of Japan. Economic stagnation, despite his "New Capitalism" initiative, coupled with scandals within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led to falling approval ratings.  

Kishida's focus on foreign policy, particularly strengthening ties with the US amidst rising tensions with China, was seen by some as neglecting domestic concerns.  His attempts at digitalization and economic revitalization faced public resistance, and policies aimed at addressing inflation failed to gain traction.

Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister, is among those vying to succeed Kishida, who is leaving office after a three-year term as LDP leader. The LDP seeks to present a united front and regain public trust  under new leadership ahead of upcoming general elections.</description>

			<title>How India-Japan 2+2 dialogue isnâ€™t just about countering â€˜China threatâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-india-japan-22-dialogue-isnt-just-about-countering-china-threat-13807880.html</link>
			<description>The recent 2+2 ministerial dialogue between India and Japan highlighted the growing strategic convergence between the two nations.  Both countries share concerns over China's expansionist policies in the Indo-Pacific region, aligning with Japan's  "Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)" vision. 

Defense cooperation has intensified, with Japan  considering removing bottlenecks for sharing advanced technology with India.  

Economic ties are also strengthening, with Japan emerging as the largest development partner for India's northeast and Bangladesh. Projects like the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail line and industrial corridors demonstrate Japanese commitment to India's development. 

Despite challenges such as potential changes in Japanese leadership and a shift in Japan's stance towards China, both countries  find ample motivation for deeper cooperation, driven by India's emerging market and Japan's desire for technological and investment opportunities.</description>

			<title>Ramification | Why Myanmar is not a walkover for China</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-why-myanmar-is-not-a-walkover-for-china-13807856.html</link>
			<description>Since the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, the country's situation has remained unstable, posing concerns for neighboring countries like India and China. China, particularly, is worried as its significant investments in Myanmar's infrastructure projects, intended to bypass the Strait of Malacca, are threatened by the junta's inability to control the situation. 

The emergence of Operation 1027, led by ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) against the junta, reflects this growing tension. Though China strategically supported the initial operation, it has expressed reservations about a subsequent operation. Compounding the issue is the Tatmadaw's distrust of China and its alignment with Russia for a new deep-sea port, potentially undermining China's strategic ambitions. 

While India shares concerns with China regarding Myanmar's instability, it maintains goodwill with various stakeholders, including the junta, the National Unity Government, and some EAOs. Indiaâ€™s approach prioritizes engagement with all parties and safeguarding its interests while providing humanitarian aid.</description>

			<description>PM Modi's recent visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since the country's independence, carried significant weight amidst the ongoing conflict.  India, while advocating for peace and diplomacy,  explored opportunities for strategic collaboration with Ukraine, particularly in defense manufacturing, which has been disrupted due to the war. 

Discussions focused on  achieving a peaceful resolution, defense and economic cooperation, and India's role in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction.

			<description>The rising political influence of the Indian-American community is a key factor in the upcoming US elections. With a significant and growing population, they are being actively courted by both Democratic and Republican parties.

Kamala Harris's historic vice presidency adds to their visibility and the Hindu vote is seen as crucial, particularly in swing states. Organizations like the Hindu American PAC are advocating for their concerns, mirroring the successful strategies of previous India-focused lobbies.

Indian-Americans are making their mark on American politics and are poised to become even more influential in the future.</description>

			<title>Flood row: Is anti-India rhetoric camouflaging Bangladeshâ€™s own shortcomings?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/flood-row-is-anti-india-rhetoric-camouflaging-bangladeshs-own-shortcomings-13807456.html</link>
			<description>A recent devastating flood in Bangladesh has triggered accusations against India, with some blaming the Indian government for releasing water from the Dumbur reservoir in Tripura.  However, experts like Professor Mashfiqus Salehin argue that the primary cause of the flooding was the heavy rainfall in the catchment areas, not the dam's water release.  He points out that the dam is located far from the Bangladeshi border and that India has been sharing real-time flood data with Bangladesh. Salehin also emphasizes that Bangladesh's inadequate flood management infrastructure is a contributing factor to the severity of the situation. While India has acknowledged Bangladesh's concerns, it maintains that the flooding is primarily due to heavy rainfall.  The focus should be on improving flood preparedness and fostering collaborative efforts between India and Bangladesh to manage shared water resources.</description>

			<title>Getting Indian Army future-ready: Why lean, mean, modern military is need of hour</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/getting-indian-army-future-ready-why-lean-mean-modern-military-is-need-of-hour-13807503.html</link>
			<description>The Indian Army is facing a manpower shortage, prompting discussion about necessary reforms. The article examines how the US and China have successfully reduced their military manpower, highlighting the factors and strategies involved.  

The US downsized its forces following the Cold War, leveraging technological advancements to offset troop reductions. China, similarly,  reduced its army size after improving its technological capabilities and securing its borders, allowing it to focus on modernization and strategic thinking.

The article emphasizes that military modernization and human resource reforms are interconnected and require careful planning, financial commitment, and long-term strategies. Given India's complex security situation, including border disputes and internal challenges, the need for a comprehensive assessment and a well-defined roadmap for both modernization and manpower optimization is crucial.</description>

			<title>How Ukraineâ€™s Kursk incursion is a bold Queenâ€™s Gambit</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ukraines-kursk-incursion-is-a-bold-queens-gambit-13807480.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is a bold strategic move that has caught Moscow off guard.  The attack, which breaches Russian territory and targets a key military district, undermines Russia's image of invulnerability and pressures the Kremlin.  However, Ukraine's success depends on its ability to sustain the offensive, as resources are stretched thin.  While the Kursk operation has symbolic value, the crucial battleground remains in Donetsk, where Ukraine faces a difficult and attritional fight.   The long-term outcome hinges on Ukraine's ability to balance the gains from the Kursk operation with the demands of the war in Donetsk.</description>

			<title>Head-on | PM Modi in Kyiv as Russia-Ukraine war enters endgame</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-pm-modi-in-kyiv-as-russia-ukraine-war-enters-endgame-13807455.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kyiv is seen as a potential opportunity for India to play a significant role in mediating a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  

While acknowledging the need for India to stand against any threats to its territorial integrity posed by a growing alliance between Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, Lord Mandelson argues that India's economic and geopolitical influence positions it to broker a peace deal.  

The visit comes at a time when Western support for Ukraine might diminish due to growing economic fatigue and a potential change in US leadership. Rebuilding Ukraine's infrastructure will be a costly endeavor, and India's position as a bridge between the US-led West and the Russia-China bloc could prove valuable in navigating this complex geopolitical landscape.  Modi's recent comments emphasizing the necessity of this era being "not of war" highlight India's desire to promote peace and stability.</description>

			<title>Attack against Hindus in Bangladesh: Why Western media repeatedly lies, and we cannot do anything about it</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/attack-against-hindus-in-bangladesh-why-western-media-repeatedly-lies-and-we-cannot-do-anything-about-it-13807444.html</link>
			<description>This article critiques Western media's portrayal of events in Bangladesh following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the subsequent violence against the Hindu minority.  

The author argues that Western media outlets have downplayed the extent of the violence and have even blamed Hindus for the attacks by emphasizing their political affiliation with the former government. They cite examples of reports that falsely claim a lack of attacks on Hindus or that shift the blame to misinformation and propaganda. The author also highlights instances where Western media outlets have avoided criticizing the West Bengal Chief Minister for serious lapses in procedure following the brutal rape and murder of a doctor, framing the issue as a symptom of Indian patriarchy instead.  

The author concludes by stating that as long as Western hegemony over global discourse remains unchallenged, India and Hindus will continue to be marginalized and misrepresented.</description>

			<title>Time to reassess Indiaâ€™s neighbourhood challenges amid Bangladesh crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/time-to-reassess-indias-neighbourhood-challenges-amid-bangladesh-crisis-13807279.html</link>
			<description>India's complex neighborhood relations stem from its historical, cultural, and civilizational ties with its neighbors, creating both opportunities and challenges.

India's pursuit of regional primacy has sometimes been perceived as hegemony, leading to resentment.  The country faces ongoing challenges such as anti-India sentiment in certain nations, fueled politically. India's past practice of favoring specific political sides within its neighbors has exacerbated these issues. 

The growing economic and political influence of China further complicates matters, as South Asian nations increasingly see China as a counterbalance to India.  China's active policy of engaging with India's neighbors, including resolving border disputes with most, presents a direct challenge to India's regional standing.  

India's entanglement in border disputes and its susceptibility to regional instability due to ethnic conflicts and refugee flows also pose unique challenges. The US, while traditionally present in the region, has at times pursued policies that have indirectly benefitted its rival, Pakistan, further complicating India's security environment. 

Managing these multifaceted challenges requires India to adapt its foreign policy, embrace pragmatic solutions, and actively engage with a wider range of stakeholders in its neighborhood.</description>

			<description>The Harris-Walz campaign aims to defeat Donald Trump by contrasting their optimistic vision of America with his darker portrayal. They are focusing on energising the electorate, particularly by targeting key demographics like young voters, minorities, women, and moderates.

Their strategy emphasizes unity and opportunity, addressing economic issues like inflation while promoting policies to benefit working class families. Harris's economic agenda includes measures to lower financial burdens on families, such as eliminating medical debt, providing subsidies for first-time homebuyers, and expanding access to affordable healthcare.  

 While Trump remains a formidable opponent due to his populist messaging, media savvy, and control over his narrative, the Harris-Walz campaign believes that a powerful and persuasive vision for America can  transcend his polarizing platform and secure a decisive victory.</description>

			<title>A talk for talks: Why PM Modiâ€™s Ukraine visit is a milestone moment for peace</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/a-talk-for-talks-why-pm-modis-ukraine-visit-is-a-milestone-moment-for-peace-13807144.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Ukraine signals a potential attempt by India to initiate dialogue between Russia and Ukraine amidst a devastating war.  While the situation is complex, given the heavy casualties, economic ripple effects, and geopolitical tensions, India has domestic reasons for seeking a peaceful resolution, including the impact of soaring oil prices and disruptions in its supply chains.

Ukraine's defense industry, historically linked to Russia, is undergoing a transformation, potentially creating new opportunities for India in terms of defense cooperation.  However, reaching a negotiated settlement faces challenges, as both sides seek to claim victory and secure favorable terms. India will play a crucial role in mediating between the warring nations, leveraging its relationships with both sides to facilitate talks and ultimately contribute to ending the conflict.</description>

			<title>Dealing with growing radicalisation in South Asia</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dealing-with-growing-radicalisation-in-south-asia-13806884.html</link>
			<description>Islamist radicalism presents a growing threat to peace and stability in South Asia, stemming from historical roots of violence and forced conversions. The region's diverse religious landscape, combined with socio-economic grievances and political instability, provides fertile ground for extremist ideologies to flourish. 

Pakistan serves as a significant breeding ground for Islamist radical groups, while Afghanistan's Taliban resurgence has emboldened similar movements. India faces challenges from both internal and external Islamist threats, with groups exploiting religious tensions and the country's large Muslim population for recruitment. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives have also experienced increasing Islamist radical activity, highlighting the region's vulnerability. 

Addressing this complex issue requires multifaceted approaches, including community engagement, investment in education, counter-narratives, security measures, inclusive governance, and international cooperation.  Efforts must target the root causes of radicalization, address grievances, and promote tolerance and understanding.  Collaborating to counter online radicalization and disrupt extremist networks is crucial for mitigating the threat to regional and global security.</description>

			<title>PM Modiâ€™s Independence Day speech: The long and short of it</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-independence-day-speech-the-long-and-short-of-it-13806873.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech from the Red Fort, while comprehensive, lacked the usual impact. The excessive length of 98 minutes, coupled with the scorching weather, resulted in a lackluster delivery. The speech delved into too much detail about government achievements, neglecting the opportunity to present a few broad and relevant messages for the nation.  

It missed the chance to address pressing issues like unemployment, inflation, and farmers' plight, and lacked concrete schemes with deadlines to demonstrate the government's commitment to solutions.  This missed opportunity could have been used to regain lost ground after the BJP's setback in the last national elections.</description>

			<title>What if Dhaka now seeks Hasinaâ€™s extradition under existing bilateral agreement?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/what-if-dhaka-now-seeks-hasinas-extradition-under-existing-bilateral-agreement-13806816.html</link>
			<description>The recent mass protests and, subsequent regime change in Bangladesh has sparked a discussion about India's role in the situation. Despite the political turmoil, India has maintained a united front with Bangladesh, acting responsibly and confidently in its approach. 

Some argue that India has overextended its support towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, potentially overlooking other political players in Bangladesh. However, India's stance stems from the need to maintain stability in the region and its long-standing ties with the elected government.


 

Now that former Prime Minister Hasina has sought refuge in India, the question arises about the potential for her extradition. Bangladesh's new interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has stressed the need for order and democracy, while simultaneously calling on India to uphold the rule of law. 

The situation remains delicate, with India walking a tightrope between supporting its ally and addressing the concerns of the Bangladeshi people and its new leadership.</description>

			<title>Decoding India-Malaysia reset: Change of heart or calculated move?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/decoding-india-malaysia-reset-change-of-heart-or-calculated-move-13806738.html</link>
			<description>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to India signifies a renewed emphasis on bilateral ties. Malaysia seeks India's support for its BRICS membership, aiming to diversify its trade and investment landscape amidst escalating US-China tensions. The relationship, previously strained, has seen a revival under the current leadership.  

India's economic growth and strategic positioning make it an attractive partner for Malaysia and other nations seeking to balance China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. India's approach, contrasting with China's hierarchical model, emphasizes peaceful coexistence and multi-state systems.  

The two countries share deep civilisational ties, with a significant Indian diaspora in Malaysia.  They are committing to strengthen these ties through cultural exchange, including promoting Ayurveda and establishing scholarships.</description>

			<title>US Sutra | Democratic National Convention: Biden out, Harris in, but Clintons and Obamas still in control</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-sutra-democratic-national-convention-biden-out-harris-in-but-clintons-and-obamas-still-in-control-13806697.html</link>
			<description>Biden, concluding his political career, relinquished the spotlight at the Democratic National Convention, speaking late at night before departing for vacation. Harris, seemingly poised to succeed him,  received a coronation-like atmosphere. Despite displays of unity and optimism,  concerns linger about Harris' economic acumen, evidenced by her calls for price controls.  She faces scrutiny for her policy proposals, particularly their feasibility and potential consequences.  Trump's campaign will likely capitalize on these vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment, led by figures like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, aims to secure another victory in the White House. Whether Biden's departure will pave the way for Harris or embolden new GOP strategy remains to be seen.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-a-chinese-report-on-american-hands-in-regime-changes-is-worth-considering-13806543.html</link>
			<description>A new report by the Chinese Foreign Ministry paints the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) as a tool of US foreign policy, accusing it of meddling in the internal affairs of other nations.  The report alleges that the NED supports pro-US forces, manipulates elections, and incites division to undermine stability. Specific examples cited include the NED's alleged funding of Uyghur and Tibetan diaspora groups and its criticism of Indian democracy. The report concludes by calling on countries worldwide to be aware of the NED's activities and protect their own interests.</description>

			<title>How social inequality fuels â€˜godmenâ€™ culture</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-social-inequality-fuels-godmen-culture-13806496.html</link>
			<description>India has a long tradition of revered saints. However,  a number of self-proclaimed godmen have also emerged, exploiting the vulnerable and poor. These individuals accumulate wealth, power, and influence, often facing accusations of  sexual assault and other crimes. They attract followers from marginalized communities who seek solace and an alternative to the existing social hierarchy. Despite lacking credibility and operating outside legal boundaries, they often enjoy political protection. Addressing this issue requires not only legal measures but also deep societal reforms to tackle poverty, inequality, and caste-based discrimination.</description>

			<title>Could Moneyball methodology improve Indian cricket?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/could-moneyball-methodology-improve-indian-cricket-13806487.html</link>
			<description>This article suggests that the Indian Premier League (IPL) should adopt a "Moneyball" approach to its player rankings.  The current system, while utilizing points based on runs, wickets, and fielding, is criticized for being too simplistic and failing to account for factors like strike rate, economy rate, and consistency.  

The author, along with colleagues, developed a new metric using multivariate regression that considers batting efficiency, bowling control, wicket-taking, and fielding impact.  This revised method demonstrated a strong correlation with team win percentages and more accurately reflects the value of diverse player contributions.  The article uses examples from the 2021 season to illustrate how the new system would have recognized players like KL Rahul and AB de Villiers more effectively.   


The ultimate goal is to create a more competitive and nuanced IPL ranking system that aligns with the strategic importance of various player attributes in cricket.  The hope is that this change will further elevate the quality of the IPL and potentially solidify India's dominance in international cricket.</description>

			<title>Why Yunusâ€™ government canâ€™t overlook jihadi groups exploiting Bangladeshâ€™s turmoil</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-yunus-government-cant-overlook-jihadi-groups-exploiting-bangladeshs-turmoil-13806417.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh faces a precarious future following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Her decision to label Islamist groups as militant, while stemming from a genuine concern for rising extremism, triggered a volatile political climate. Clashes between these groups and security forces have intensified, creating an environment of uncertainty.

Extremist groups, previously subdued, are capitalizing on this instability. Resurgent militant organizations, including those associated with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, are re-emerging, spreading their propaganda and calling for the establishment of an Islamic state. This resurgence is further fueled by sectarian violence against minority communities, driving a wedge in the already fragile social fabric. 

The political vacuum has also attracted outside influences, with allegations of foreign involvement in the regime change, though these remain unproven. The situation in Bangladesh resembles that of Pakistan, highlighting the risk of internal instability destabilizing the region.

India, closely watching the developments, recognizes the potential impact on its own security and stability. As Bangladesh grapples with these challenges, the international community, including India, must remain committed to supporting efforts to maintain peace and prevent extremist elements from gaining a foothold.</description>

			<title>South China Sea: How growing Chinese assertiveness finds strong Philippine response</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/south-china-sea-how-growing-chinese-assertiveness-finds-strong-philippine-response-13806334.html</link>
			<description>Relations between China and the Philippines have been strained by recurring maritime skirmishes in the South China Sea, particularly around the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese coast guard vessels have escalated their actions, engaging in ramming and water cannon attacks on Philippine ships attempting to resupply the BRP Sierra Madre, a grounded Philippine warship stationed on the shoal.  

This escalating tension stems from competing territorial claims. While China asserts historical sovereignty over the vast majority of the South China Sea, the Philippines, citing the UNCLOS, maintains its sovereign rights within its exclusive economic zone. Attempts at dialogue through the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism (BCM) have yielded limited success, with each side reiterating its position and refusing to concede. 

The PCA's 2016 ruling in favor of the Philippines, coupled with renewed security ties between the Philippines and the US, suggests a shift in the Philippines' approach, becoming less receptive to China's coercive tactics. China's reliance on a  "carrots and sticks" approach is no longer effective, and Beijing must be prepared to deal with a more assertive Manila.</description>

			<title>Iran, Ukraine and now Bangladesh: How US â€˜interventionismâ€™ subverts democracy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/iran-ukraine-and-now-bangladesh-how-us-interventionism-subverts-democracy-13806128.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the potential for US covert regime change in Bangladesh, referencing alleged US attempts to influence Bangladesh's leadership and control of key strategic assets like ports. The article draws parallels to past covert operations, particularly the 1953 coup in Iran and the alleged US involvement in the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, highlighting the complexities and risks associated with such interventions. 

It argues that despite the US government's pursuit of regime change, such efforts often have unintended consequences. The article cites research showing that foreign-imposed regime change can lead to economic decline, reduced democracy scores, and weakened civil liberties. It concludes by emphasizing the potential for instability in the Indian subcontinent if US covert operations in Bangladesh are successful and urges India to proactively engage diplomatically in response.</description>

			<title>Can Ukraineâ€™s Kursk offensive help Kyiv achieve strategic dividend?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-can-ukraines-kursk-offensive-help-kyiv-achieve-strategic-dividend-13806052.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine's surprise ground offensive into Russia's Kursk region has captured significant territory and marked the first instance of foreign troops occupying Russian land since World War II. 

The operation, executed with secrecy, has raised strategic questions about potential aims. Ukraine could be seeking to weaken Russian forces, divert their attention from other fronts, or leverage captured territory in future negotiations.  The incursion has also prompted debate about the use of Western weaponry in a conflict that directly challenges Russian sovereignty.

While Russia hasn't ruled out nuclear threats, it is actively countering the offensive, securing gains in eastern Ukraine and preparing for potential eviction of Ukrainian forces. The situation draws parallels to historical examples like the German invasion of Kursk during World War II, highlighting the potential risks of overextension and the need for strategic planning and resource management.   The long-term implications of this audacious Ukrainian move remain uncertain, leaving questions about whether it will escalate the conflict, push Russia toward negotiations, or reshape the dynamics of the war entirely.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the current state of global turmoil, citing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, economic woes in China, political instabilities in various nations, and environmental challenges.  

Drawing upon the writings of Sri Aurobindo, the author argues that this  "Hour of God" demands introspection, purification, and bold action. India, though politically stable, needs to embrace  Decentralized governance, innovation, and its core values to navigate these turbulent times. The article emphasizes the need for India to resist  external pressures and forge its own path, relying on its strengths and historical wisdom.</description>

			<title>How hosting Olympics may not be a good option for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-hosting-olympics-may-not-be-a-good-option-for-india-13805831.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that India should reconsider its bid to host the 2036 Olympics.  It points out that hosting the Games has often resulted in financial losses for countries, citing examples like Greece and Rio de Janeiro.  The author suggests that the costs associated with building and maintaining Olympic infrastructure outweigh any potential revenue or economic benefits.  

India's experience with the 2010 Commonwealth Games, marred by corruption and financial mismanagement, further reinforces the argument against hosting the Olympics.  The article proposes that instead of pursuing the costly and risky endeavor of hosting the Olympics, India should focus on developing a strong sports culture at the grassroots level by investing in smaller sports facilities.  

It concludes by emphasizing the need for realism and pragmatism in India's approach to sports development.</description>

			<title>Why PM Modi's visit to Ukraine and Poland will be closely watched</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pm-modis-visit-ukraine-and-poland-will-be-closely-watched-13805817.html</link>
			<description>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a significant visit to Poland emphasizing the long-standing friendship between the two nations. This visit followed a trip to Russia  and precedes a planned meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While India maintains close ties with both countries, it is seeking to balance its relationships amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  India has engaged in trade with both Russia and Ukraine, particularly in defense equipment.

Modi's visit aims to understand the perspectives of both sides and promote peace. Poland, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, has provided substantial military aid and has seen a significant influx of Ukrainian refugees.</description>

			<title>How American strategy of â€˜colour revolutionsâ€™ teaches third-world democracies a lesson</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-american-strategy-of-colour-revolutions-teaches-third-world-democracies-a-lesson-13805774.html</link>
			<description>The US, despite claiming to be a global leader for good, has a deeply problematic history of interfering in the internal affairs of other nations.  Its support for "Color Revolutions" and coups has resulted in widespread instability, economic decline, and the rise of authoritarian regimes.  

Instead of engaging in diplomatic efforts with legitimate governments, the US often works with opposition groups and fuels unrest, as seen in Bangladesh where the recent overthrow of the democratically elected government is being attributed to US encouragement. This disregard for democratic principles and the tendency to prioritize strategic interests over human rights has destabilized regions and undermined international trust.</description>

			<title>Shadow Warrior | How Big Tech, mass media nexus 'manufactures consentâ€™ favouring vested interests</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/shadow-warrior-how-big-tech-mass-media-nexus-manufactures-consent-favouring-vested-interests-13805760.html</link>
			<description>The Western media often manufactures consent by promoting the viewpoints of powerful interests through market forces, gaslighting, and self-censorship. This can lead to abrupt shifts in narratives, as seen with historical figures like Manuel Noriega and Saddam Hussein, as well as more recent examples like Sheikh Hasina. 

Big Tech platforms accelerate this process, enabling the swift construction of narratives and the silencing of dissent.  Social media giants, including Wikipedia, are susceptible to manipulation by biased editors or those with vested interests, perpetuating misinformation as fact.  The author argues that India must protect itself from this Western influence by building its own indigenous solutions and limiting access to these platforms.</description>

			<title>Why Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s extradition to Bangladesh isnâ€™t a realistic scenario</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-sheikh-hasinas-extradition-to-bangladesh-isnt-a-realistic-scenario-13805587.html</link>
			<description>The recent coup in Bangladesh, resulting in the ousting of Sheikh Hasina and her subsequent refuge in India, has sparked controversy regarding potential extradition charges against her. While charges of murder, abduction, and genocide have emerged, they lack sufficient legal standing and are considered dubious post-Hasina's departure.

India, already hosting a significant number of Bangladeshi immigrants, including the Rohingyas, is unlikely to extradite Hasina.  

The coup leaders, under a provisional government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, face challenges in legitimizing their authority and establishing stability. The future political landscape remains uncertain with the emergence of a new student-led political party. 
                                    
India's strong economic ties and strategic importance to Bangladesh suggest that seeking Hasina's extradition would be detrimental to both nations, potentially benefiting adversaries like China and Pakistan.</description>

			<title>Letâ€™s demand the end of child marriage: Our children are not for sale</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/lets-demand-the-end-of-child-marriage-our-children-are-not-for-sale-13805554.html</link>
			<description>In India, child marriage remains a prevalent issue despite significant progress in recent years. Though 3 girls are married off every minute in India, child marriage cases are rarely registered. The practice is deeply rooted in social and cultural norms, often driven by poverty and a lack of education for girls. Child marriage has devastating consequences for girls, including physical and mental health risks, limited educational opportunities, and vulnerability to sexual exploitation. 

To combat this issue, Bhuwan Ribhu, a child rights activist, advocates for a multi-pronged approach that includes strengthening laws, raising awareness, promoting education, empowering girls, and holding perpetrators accountable. He emphasizes the need for a clear message from the state and society that children are not for sale and that child marriage is a crime. Ribhu believes that addressing child marriage in a concentrated manner within districts with the highest prevalence rates can create a tipping point towards ending the practice nationwide.</description>

			<title>Japan: As Kishida steps down amid sinking popularity, LDP faces a leadership crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/japan-as-kishida-steps-down-amid-sinking-popularity-ldp-faces-a-leadership-crisis-13805547.html</link>
			<description>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and PM.  The decision is driven by several factors, primarily his declining popularity, a record low of 15.5% in July 2024, due to the ongoing LDP financing scandal and concerns about his leadership. Kishida's attempts to reform the LDP by reducing the influence of factions and promoting a cleaner image have been unsuccessful. Recent domestic events, including a megaquake warning that disrupted his diplomatic engagements, also contributed to the decision. 

Kishida steps down hoping to pave the way for a new LDP leader to revitalize the party and regain public trust for the upcoming October 2025 general election. Several potential candidates have emerged, including Ishiba Shigeru, Kono Taro, and Noda Seko.</description>

			<description>South Asia's economic instability presents an opportunity for India to strengthen its position. While the region grapples with challenges like political turmoil and unsustainable debt, India's economy is thriving, attracting foreign investment and offering a stable platform for growth.

India's economic reforms and competitive edge, coupled with the limitations of Chinese investment, are making it the natural choice for businesses and investors.  Countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are struggling to find alternatives to partnership with India, realizing that economic collaboration is key to escaping poverty and achieving prosperity.</description>

			<title>How Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s ouster will impact Indiaâ€™s Act East policy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-will-impact-indias-act-east-policy-13805507.html</link>
			<description>The recent military-backed ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh has created uncertainty in the region and its impact on India-Bangladesh relations. The coup, whose motivations are complex and involve student discontent and a lack of connection with the younger generation, has implications for Bangladesh's political landscape and its future trajectory.

This shift in power raises concerns for India, as it has enjoyed close ties with Hasina's administration, marked by progress in trade, connectivity, and defense cooperation.  A destabilized  Bangladesh poses challenges for India's Northeast region, given its shared borders and the ongoing issues in Myanmar, Manipur, and the Naga accord.  The situation could also destabilize BIMSTEC, a regional grouping seen as an alternative to SAARC.</description>

India emphasizes the importance of representation, urging for increased participation of the Global South in international institutions. Key issues discussed include responding to the priorities of the Global South, recognizing their differentiated responsibilities, respecting sovereignty, and reforming global institutions. The summits have fostered cooperation on areas like sustainable development, climate change, health, and technology.

			<title>Why ISROâ€™s third and final development flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle is significant</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-isros-third-and-final-development-flight-of-small-satellite-launch-vehicle-is-significant-13805371.html</link>
			<description>ISRO successfully launched the SSLV-D3 mission, marking the completion of development flights for the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle.  This launch is significant as SSLV is designed to carry 500kg satellites to Low Earth Orbit and offers a more cost-effective solution compared to the PSLV for smaller payloads. With the success of SSLV-D3, ISRO now has a fully operational launch vehicle capable of meeting the growing demand for launching small satellites, both commercially and strategically. 

SSLV's quick turnaround time (72-hours assembly) and ability to launch multiple satellites in diverse orbits make it attractive for businesses and research institutions.  Additionally, the mission showcases advancements in ISRO's technology, including the improved IMS-1 satellite bus system and the integration of advanced technologies like Microsatellite Antenna arrays and flexible solar panels. 
 ISRO plans to transfer SSLV technology to private companies, further bolstering India's space sector.</description>

			<title>Why India should worry about a Kamala Harris presidency</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-should-worry-about-a-kamala-harris-presidency-13805290.html</link>
			<description>While an Indian-American president like Kamala Harris would be a historic achievement, concerns arise about its potential impact on US-India relations. Unlike past administrations that prioritized cooperation with India, Harris's potential approach appears more aligned with partisan stances and online activism. 

Her selection of Tim Walz as a running mate, after a controversial campaign, suggests a willingness to cater to the far-left faction within the Democratic party.  This could lead to prioritizing anti-India sentiments and policies regarding Hinduphobia, denigration of Indian democracy, and support for Khalistan separatism. Furthermore, her lack of experience and commitment to strong US-India ties, coupled with a State Department influenced by biased human rights groups, could result in the exacerbation of existing tensions and diplomatic crises.  A Harris presidency could significantly damage the US-India relationship, marking a significant downturn since the Cold War era.</description>

			<title>How ex-ISI chiefâ€™s arrest shows Pakistan Armyâ€™s paranoia</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ex-isi-chiefs-arrest-shows-pakistan-armys-self-destructive-paranoia-13805206.html</link>
			<description>The arrest of Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the first ever intelligence chief of Pakistan to be arrested, highlights concerns about the direction of the Pakistani army.  Hameed's career was marked by his involvement in various controversial operations, including the backing of right-wing groups and alleged interference in political affairs.

His arrest, along with other recent incidents like the resignation of Lt Gen Ayman Bilal Safdar and the crackdown on those sympathetic to Imran Khan, point towards a growing internal conflict and paranoia within the army. This  erosion of discipline and integrity in the military, coupled with allegations of corruption and misuse of power, raises serious concerns about the stability of Pakistan. The article suggests that the current army chief, Gen Asim Munir, is driving this trend, creating a climate of distrust and fear. The author concludes that India should consider these developments carefully as they impact security and stability in the region.</description>

			<title>Maldives turnaround shows why India's setback in Bangladesh will not be permanent</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/maldives-turnaround-shows-why-indias-setback-in-bangladesh-will-not-be-permanent-13805140.html</link>
			<description>Despite pessimism in India following the shift in Bangladesh's leadership away from the pro-India Sheikh Hasina, maintaining engagement remains crucial.  Similar sentiments occurred earlier this year regarding India-Maldives relations, which saw a cooling period after Mohamed Muizzu, a leader who campaigned on an "India Out" platform, took office. However,  India continued to provide development assistance and engage diplomatically. This pragmatism ultimately paid off, with ties between India and the Maldives now showing a marked improvement.  

India's  engagement with the Maldives exemplifies  the importance of continued diplomacy in the neighborhood, despite challenging political shifts. This approach should also be applied to Bangladesh, where India can maintain beneficial relations regardless of the ruling party. India's support, both economic and security-wise, remains vital for Bangladesh, and prioritizing engagement will ultimately serve Indian strategic interests in the region.</description>

			<title>RG Kar rape and murder case: Mamata Banerjee, this is a time for answers and accountability, not political manoeuvring</title>

			<description>A violent mob attacked RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, destroying property and threatening medical staff. Eyewitnesses say the mob, armed with weapons, vandalized the hospital for 40 minutes while police were largely absent, even hiding themselves from the attackers.

Opposition leaders and the state's governor accused the police of complicity and the ruling party of orchestrating the attack to cover up evidence in the recent rape and murder of a trainee doctor.  The incident sparked outrage, with women across the state protesting for justice. 

The Calcutta High Court transferred the case to the CBI and criticized the Kolkata Police for their handling of the investigation.  West Bengal's chief minister has called for swift justice but is facing criticism for her attempts to deflect blame and use the incident for political gain.</description>

			<title>China at economic crossroads: Why Beijing cannot afford to â€˜slow downâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/china-at-economic-crossroads-why-beijing-cannot-afford-to-slow-down-13804933.html</link>
			<description>China's economic growth is slowing, raising concerns among policymakers and investors.  Despite recent measures to stimulate the economy, including boosting consumption and supporting private investment, China's second-quarter growth fell short of expectations.  Several challenges threaten China's economic future, including trade tensions, a corporate debt crisis, a cooling property market, and a shrinking workforce due to an ageing population. To avoid falling into the middle-income trap, China needs sustained growth of 6-7% over the coming decade.  Economic success is crucial to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party's rule and the "Chinese Dream" of prosperity.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh crisis: How America-China rivalry may push Dhaka in a corner</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-how-america-china-rivalry-may-push-dhaka-in-a-corner-13804916.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing a turbulent period following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation amidst nationwide protests. Triggered by the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs, the demonstrations escalated into violence, leading to hundreds of deaths.  While the Supreme Court adjusted the quota, the protests continued, demanding Hasina's removal and exposing concerns about her governance. 

A controversial military-backed interim government now heads the nation. Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Laureate and Hasina critic, leads the interim government with a cabinet assigned major portfolios. The situation remains tense, with protestors continuing their actions and the military's role raising questions about the future of democracy in Bangladesh. 

The country faces significant geopolitical challenges, with international powers like China and the US capitalizing on the instability. India, concerned about the impact on its strategic interests, is watching developments closely.</description>

			<title>Beyond the Lines | The uprising of 1946: The story behind Indiaâ€™s freedom at midnight</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-the-uprising-of-1946-the-story-behind-indias-freedom-at-midnight-13804708.html</link>
			<description>The 1946 Royal Indian Navy Mutiny was a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence. Sparked by poor treatment and inspired by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army, sailors in Bombay revolted, quickly expanding to other naval bases and even air force establishments. The mutiny garnered widespread public support, highlighting the increasingly volatile situation within the British Empire.  

Although the British government eventually quelled the uprising, it significantly rattled the Raj, forcing them to consider their options in India. The mutiny was a testament to the Indian people's desire for freedom, showcasing their willingness to fight for independence. Ironically, while the uprising threatened to overshadow the existing political movement, key Indian leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel failed to fully embrace or endorse the mutinous actions. The missed opportunity to unify the country behind a popular and assertive movement further fragmented the path to independence. John Freeman, the British High Commissioner,  acknowledged the mutiny's potential to spark another large-scale rebellion like the 1857 uprising. Despite its importance, the 1946 mutiny is often overlooked in discussions of India's independence, serving as a reminder of  a potent but ultimately thwarted moment in history.</description>

			<title>Never-ending war: Why Israel will ultimately have to deal with the Palestinian question</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/never-ending-war-why-israel-will-ultimately-have-to-deal-with-the-palestinian-question-13804651.html</link>
			<description>The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has escalated significantly, spreading conflicts to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and even Iran. Israel blamed the Hamas attacks on October 7th for its current aggressive posture, which includes targeted assassinations of key figures within Hamas and other Iranian-backed groups.  This escalation is a response to perceived vulnerabilities after the October 7th Hamas attack. 

Israel believes that its Arab neighbors' normalization with Israel should have minimized Iranian influence in the region. However, the conflict with Palestinians remains an obstacle to achieving greater regional stability. While assassinations may appear to be victories, true security can only be achieved through a lasting peace agreement with Palestinians.</description>

			<title>Of narratives and narrative settings: How Kamala Harris may not be good news for America, India and the free world</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/of-narratives-and-narrative-settings-how-kamala-harris-may-not-be-good-news-for-america-india-and-the-free-world-13804544.html</link>
			<description>This article analyzes the sudden shift in public perception surrounding Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential pick. Despite previously low approval ratings and criticism from various media outlets, Harris is now being portrayed as a champion of democracy and liberalism. 

The article attributes this turnaround to a deliberate effort to position her as a foil to the perceived threat posed by Donald Trump.  Harris's  vague and  "progressive" stance on foreign policy issues, particularly regarding  Israel and India, is highlighted as a potential concern. 

The author suggests that narrative manipulation, especially by global powers, plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing election outcomes. The article warns that the world should brace for turbulent times ahead due to these evolving  power dynamics.</description>

			<title>Ramification | Bangladesh: How Muhammad Yunus is wearing a crown of thorns</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-bangladesh-how-muhammad-yunus-is-wearing-a-crown-of-thorns-13804451.html</link>
			<description>Following protests triggered by a High Court ruling reinstating a quota system, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh to India. This change in leadership has sparked concern, particularly regarding the rise of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its ally, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI).

JeI, with ties to past atrocities during Bangladesh's liberation war,  is seen as a threat to religious and political minorities. A possible resurgence of JeI, coupled with existing instability, raises fears of lawlessness and renewed violence. 

India, watching closely, faces the challenge of navigating this volatile situation. They must support minorities and advocate for democratic processes while engaging with the new interim government led by Muhammed Yunus. 


Finding a balance between supporting democratic ideals and ensuring stability becomes crucial for India's interests and the well-being of the region.</description>

			<title>Ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameedâ€™s arrest shows the mess Pakistan finds itself in</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameeds-arrest-shows-the-mess-pakistan-finds-itself-in-13804377.html</link>
			<description>Pakistani Army Chief Gen Asim Munir initiated disciplinary action and a Field General Court Martial against former DG ISI Lt Gen Faiz Hameed. This action stems from a Supreme Court case filed last year involving an allegation of extortion against Hameed. Though the court forwarded the matter to the government for investigation, the allegations of post-retirement violations of the Army Act against Hameed appear broader in scope.  

This arrest comes amid jubilation in Pakistan over athlete Arshad Nadeem's gold medal win at the Paris Olympics. Munir's timing has sparked speculation about the action being a pre-emptive move against potential dissent within the military, overshadowing the national celebration. 

The article highlights the ongoing tensions between Munir and former PM Imran Khan,  drawing parallels to past instances where the Pakistani army derailed peace initiatives with India. It concludes by emphasizing Pakistan's continued instability, linking it to its antagonistic stance towards India and its inability to keep pace with India's progress.</description>

			<title>Budget and after: Time to prioritise agriculture, health and education</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-and-after-time-to-prioritise-agriculture-health-and-education-13804261.html</link>
			<description>The provided article argues that achieving the goal of Viksit Bharat is impossible unless the needs of India's poorest, particularly those in rural areas, are addressed.  The author emphasizes that the benefits of India's economic growth are not distributed equally, as evidenced by low per capita income and a large agricultural population struggling with low productivity. 

They highlight the need for a new agricultural revolution, urging for investment in technology, infrastructure, and R&amp;D to boost farm incomes. The article criticizes current government subsidies and schemes, deeming them as palliatives rather than solutions and calls for a negotiated Minimum Support Price to incentivize farmers. 

Ultimately, the author advocates for policymakers to prioritize agricultural reform, healthcare, and education to uplift the majority of India's population and ensure inclusive growth.</description>

			<title>How regime change in Bangladesh is an immediate setback for India in the neighbourhood</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-regime-change-in-bangladesh-is-an-immediate-setback-for-india-in-the-neighbourhood-13804241.html</link>
			<description>A new interim government has been established in Bangladesh under Muhammed Yunus, following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina's administration.  Yunus, a respected figure with links to the US, faces the challenges of restoring order and managing the country's political landscape in an environment marked by street protests and judicial instability. 

India's primary concern is the restoration of stability, the safety of its Hindu minority, and the potential for increased Chinese influence. While the US has called for a democratic transition, its silence regarding the minoritiesâ€™ security has drawn criticism from India.

The former Indian Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal argues that the US's approach to Bangladesh does not align with India's strategic interests, particularly in the context of growing Chinese involvement in the region. He highlights the potential for the new government to adopt a more China-friendly stance, posing a challenge to India's security and its Act East policy.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/human-rights-debacle-in-britain-west-must-end-double-standard-13804133.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the double standards of Western countries regarding human rights. It argues that Western media and governments selectively highlight human rights violations in the Global South while downplaying or ignoring similar issues within their own borders. 

The author cites examples of anti-minority riots in the UK, US sanctions against Belarus, and reports from international organizations criticizing human rights practices in the West.  Despite these reports, the author observes a lack of vocal response from the Global South, suggesting that more consistent criticism from developing nations could expose and challenge the West's hypocrisy on human rights. The article concludes by urging Western governments to abandon their double standards and uphold human rights consistently.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh crisis: How India should deal with Islamist radicalisation and proxy play in the region</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-how-india-should-deal-with-islamist-radicalisation-and-proxy-play-in-the-region-13804103.html</link>
			<description>The recent upheaval in Bangladesh, marked by the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, creates a complex geopolitical situation in South Asia. This shift threatens regional stability and India's security interests due to Bangladesh's strategic location and importance. 

China's growing influence in Bangladesh, fueled by infrastructure investments and military cooperation, presents a major challenge for India. Simultaneously, the rise of radical Islamist groups exploiting the political instability further complicates the landscape. India must navigate this volatile situation cautiously.

India needs to engage in diplomatic dialogue with the new regime in Bangladesh while prioritizing the safety of its citizens and Hindus in the country.  Leveraging its historical and cultural ties, India should focus on strengthening economic cooperation and enhancing connectivity projects.  Moreover, India must remain vigilant against Chinese geopolitical ambitions and actively counter Islamist radicalization in the region to safeguard its own interests.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-indias-tripolar-strategy-to-balance-us-russia-and-china-13804034.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's upcoming visit to Ukraine amidst shifting global dynamics highlights India's delicate balancing act. The visit, following Modi's meeting with Putin, signals India's attempt to navigate the complex relationships between the US-led West and the Russia-China axis. 

The world order has been significantly altered by the rise of China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and regional instabilities. India, asserting strategic autonomy, engages with both blocs while seeking to leverage its economic growth and potential as a mediator.

Recent moves such as allowing selected Chinese investments in India and conciliatory statements from both countries indicate a potential thaw in India-China relations, driven by shared economic interests. 

Modi's meeting with Zelenskyy underscores India's position as a key player striving to maintain peace and foster dialogue in this increasingly fractured global landscape.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/kamala-harris-galvanises-presidential-race-will-it-be-enough-to-trump-the-donald-13803946.html</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris's rise to the forefront of American politics has taken an unexpected turn. 

After a period of relative obscurity as Vice President, she has become the Democratic nominee following President Biden's withdrawal from the race. She has quickly energized the party base, raising a record amount of campaign funds and assembling a strong team. Harris has focused her campaign on highlighting the contrasts between herself and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, painting him as a threat to democracy and emphasizing her commitment to issues like women's rights and gun control. This assertive approach has shifted the momentum in the race, making it a genuine contest. Despite the challenges ahead, Harris has proven herself to be a formidable candidate, posing a serious challenge to Trump's reelection bid.</description>

			<title>â€˜An Islamist-sponsored, state-sanctioned apartheidâ€™: Why time is ripe to amend regressive and repressive waqf laws</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/an-islamist-sponsored-state-sanctioned-apartheid-why-time-is-ripe-to-amend-regressive-and-repressive-waqf-laws-13803836.html</link>
			<description>This article argues that India's Waqf Act, which governs Muslim religious endowments, is discriminatory and needs to be amended. 

The author contends that the Act has been progressively tilted in favor of Waqf Boards, granting them excessive power and undermining the rights of non-Muslims.  They cite examples like the Waqf Board's jurisdiction over land and property disputes, its composition dominated by Muslims, and the removal of time-bar limitations in claiming waqf property. 

The article further criticizes the hypocrisy of political parties, particularly those who oppose recent amendments to the Waqf Act while simultaneously advocating for appeasement of Muslims. The author concludes that these laws perpetuate  discrimination and  "apartheid" against the Hindu majority.</description>

			<title>How Bangladesh crisis resembles closely with West-orchestrated â€˜colour revolutionsâ€™ and Arab Spring</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladesh-crisis-resembles-closely-with-west-orchestrated-colour-revolutions-and-arab-spring-13803791.html</link>
			<description>The recent coup in Bangladesh, which ousted the democratically elected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has raised concerns about the country's political future. Parallels can be drawn between this event and colour revolutions in other parts of the world, such as those in the post-Soviet space and the Arab Spring.  The coup was orchestrated by the Bangladesh Army, with support from radical Islamist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).  

While the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus aims to restore order and hold elections, its legitimacy is questionable. The prominent role of JeI and BNP, both known for anti-minority sentiments, raises fears for the safety of Bangladesh's Hindu population, which has already seen a decline in numbers over the years. 

This political instability has the potential to significantly impact Bangladesh's socio-economic progress and has wider geopolitical ramifications.</description>

			<title>The silent suffering of minorities in Bangladesh calls for international recognition, justice</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-silent-suffering-of-minorities-in-bangladesh-calls-for-international-recognition-justice-13803750.html</link>
			<description>Hindus in Bangladesh face a severe and systematic decline  in their  numbers due to persistent violence and discrimination. Despite a secular facade,  Hindus suffer during religious celebrations, with 2021â€™s Durga Puja seeing widespread attacks on communities,  including killings and cases of gang rape. The governmentâ€™s response has been inadequate, with assailants often enjoying impunity. 

The international community's silence on this issue further exacerbates the problem.  

 Urgent and decisive action is needed to protect Hindus, ensure justice for victims, and address systemic discrimination.</description>

			<title>Post Haniyeh killing, Israel faces Hamas 2.0 in a grinding war of attrition</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/post-haniyeh-killing-israel-faces-hamas-2-0-in-a-grinding-war-of-attrition-13803699.html</link>
			<description>Hamas is proving to be highly resilient in the ongoing conflict with Israel. Despite significant casualties, the  organization has bolstered its ranks through recruitment, aided by the devastation in Gaza which has fueled anger and frustration among the population.  Hamas's adaptation to guerrilla warfare tactics, particularly its extensive network of tunnels, has also proven challenging for the IDF. 

 The group's "beehive leadership" structure ensures continuity even with the loss of key figures. Israel's attempts to clear and hold territory have been hampered by the lack of an established infrastructure for reconstruction and the prevalence of underground booby traps and IEDs.  
The combination of harsh living conditions, resentment of Israel, and Hamas's effective utilization of this environment paints a grim picture for Israel's ability to achieve a decisive victory.  Hamas continues to pose a significant and enduring challenge to Israeli security, relying on its deep roots in the Palestinian community and a cunning adaptation to guerrilla tactics.</description>

			<title>President Murmuâ€™s state visit to East Timor: How the Delhi-Dili link is an emerging aspect of Indiaâ€™s â€˜Act Eastâ€™ policy</title>

			<description>Indian President Droupadi Murmu's state visit to Timor-Leste, a first for an Indian head of state, signals the growing importance of Timor-Leste in India's strategic calculations. The visit follows Timor-Leste's admission as an ASEAN observer and its future full membership, integrating it into India's "Act East" policy. 

Both countries have expressed strong commitment to deepening relations across various sectors, including technology, agriculture, health, and capacity building. This multifaceted engagement is further strengthened by upcoming resident missions in each other's capitals and the potential for Timor-Leste to benefit from the India-ASEAN Fund. The visit included the signing of three MoUs promoting cultural exchange, visa-free access for diplomats and officials, and program sharing through broadcasting entities.</description>

			<title>The Yunus Paradox: Nobel laureateâ€™s peaceful vision vs the growing fundamentalism in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-yunus-paradox-nobel-laureates-peaceful-vision-vs-the-growing-fundamentalism-in-bangladesh-13803640.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is currently in a state of political upheaval following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been formed to steer the country through this period of instability. This transition comes amid increasing Islamist influence, particularly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which has a history of violence and close ties to militancy.  The rise of Jamaat-e-Islami is a significant concern for India, as it threatens Bangladesh's secular identity and poses a potential security risk. 

The situation is further complicated by China's growing influence in the region, with its Belt and Road Initiative potentially drawing Bangladesh into a closer partnership with China, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, challenging India's regional dominance. This new geopolitical landscape  presents a serious challenge for India and requires a proactive and strategic response to protect its interests.</description>

			<title>AI-driven crimes are gaining ground: Hereâ€™s what we can do to curb them</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ai-driven-crimes-are-gaining-ground-heres-what-we-can-do-to-curb-them-13803442.html</link>
			<description>AI is increasingly used in criminal activities, posing a significant threat globally.  Deepfakes facilitate disinformation, while AI enhances phishing and social engineering attacks. Cybercriminals leverage AI to identify vulnerabilities and launch sophisticated attacks. AI-driven malware adapts to evade detection, and voice cloning enables financial fraud.

The autonomous nature of AI systems complicates liability, making it difficult to determine who is responsible for criminal acts. Attributing actions to specific AIs in complex, interconnected systems is another major challenge. 

Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes international cooperation to establish regulations and norms for AI development and usage, revising legal frameworks to address AI-related crimes, investing in technical solutions to detect and mitigate malicious AI, and fostering an ethical AI culture.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh: Why the idea of glorious â€˜student protesterâ€™ is misguided</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-why-the-idea-of-glorious-student-protester-is-misguided-13803437.html</link>
			<description>While student protests can be heroic, they can also be morally problematic, naive and even dangerous. History provides numerous examples of student movements that turned violent or aligned with harmful ideologies.  The  1968 US protests reflect class divisions, as university students, often privileged, clashed with the "silent majority."  Similarly,  in France, student unrest did not reflect the broader population's support.  The simplistic view of student protesters as inherently good needs critical evaluation, especially when  considering movements that advocate violence or overthrow existing systems.</description>

			<title>Minority report: Bangladesh crisis shows why CAA is relevant</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/minority-report-bangladesh-crisis-shows-why-caa-is-relevant-13803401.html</link>
			<description>The recent upheaval in Bangladesh has highlighted the plight of the Hindu minority, who have been disproportionately impacted by violence and persecution. The student-led protests, initially focused on job quotas, escalated into unrest fueled by the radical Jamaat-e-Islami, which has a history of opposing Bangladesh's independence and advocates for the implementation of Islamic law.  

The violence against Hindus underscores the fragility of linguistic nationalism and exposes the deep-rooted religious divisions within Bangladesh.  Despite claims of Bengali unity, the reality on the ground reveals a vulnerable community facing systematic discrimination and displacement. 

The situation in Bangladesh emphasizes the urgency of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India, which offers refuge to persecuted minorities from neighboring countries.  The CAA serves as a humanitarian gesture, providing a safe haven for those facing religious persecution and seeking asylum.</description>

			<title>Panipat, Marathas and the identity of Neeraj Chopra</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/panipat-marathas-and-the-identity-of-neeraj-chopra-13803394.html</link>
			<description>A tweet by Jyotiraditya Scindia sparked discussion about Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra's ancestry, suggesting he possessed "Maratha spirit."  This led to attention being drawn to the Rod Marathas, a community residing in Haryana with customs and culture similar to the Marathas.  

Research points to the community's origins in the aftermath of the 1761 Battle of Panipat, where a contingent of Maratha soldiers and non-combatants, fleeing the Afghan victory, settled in the region. While Chopra's family denies a direct link, the existence of the Rod Marathas offers a unique example of a historical event shaping a distinct community centuries later.</description>

			<description>Following the resignation of Bangladesh's long-serving Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, international powers are jostling for influence in the strategically important South Asian nation. China has significantly increased its military and economic ties with Bangladesh, viewing it as a counterbalance to India. 

The US, on the other hand, has expressed support for regime change in Bangladesh,  criticizing elections that they alleged were unfair and pushing for closer ties with the opposition party, BNP. A potential US military base in Bangladesh raised concerns in India and remains a point of contention.

Meanwhile, India is trying to maintain its influence in Bangladesh, despite the growing presence of China and the US.  The future trajectory of Bangladesh's relationship with these powers will have significant implications for regional geopolitics.</description>

			<title>How great powers fuelling the arms race in West Asia threaten global security</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-great-powers-fuelling-the-arms-race-in-west-asia-threaten-global-security-13803221.html</link>
			<description>The United States and Russia actively engage in the international arms trade, supporting opposing sides in critical geopolitical regions. The US has a strong military partnership with Israel, providing substantial aid and advanced weaponry to counter Iranian influence in the Middle East.  Russia, conversely, arms states often at odds with US interests, including Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah. 

This rivalry fuels an arms race, increasing regional instability and raising the risk of escalating conflicts. The influx of advanced weaponry makes peaceful resolution of disputes more challenging, while state-sponsored actors like Hezbollah introduce further unpredictability. This dynamic extends beyond the Middle East, impacting global security as seen in conflicts like the war in Ukraine.  
 
The international community faces a challenge in managing this competition and preventing further escalation.  Promoting dialogue, cooperation, and disarmament is crucial to avoid a more unstable and conflict-ridden world.</description>

			<title>New government in Bangladesh: Itâ€™s advantage America</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/new-government-in-bangladesh-its-advantage-america-13803171.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's resignation has significantly impacted Bangladesh's political landscape and its relations with India. The period of unprecedented cooperation during her tenure, marked by economic growth, security cooperation, and regional connectivity, is now uncertain.  A new government, potentially more aligned with the West, raises questions about the continuity of these efforts and presents both opportunities and challenges for India. 

Maintaining economic cooperation, securing collaboration on counter-terrorism, and ensuring the progress of regional connectivity initiatives will be crucial. India should prioritize engaging with the new government, emphasizing stability, development, and mutual interests while promoting a balanced foreign policy in Bangladesh.</description>

			<description>The Boeing Starliner experienced multiple delays and technical issues during its recent mission to the International Space Station, stranding astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore for over two months.  Despite initial successes like docking with the ISS, problems arose, including helium leaks and software glitches, forcing NASA to postpone the astronauts' return. Though NASA and Boeing maintain confidence, concerns linger due to past failures with Starliner's thrusters and the necessity to use SpaceX's Dragon capsule as a potential alternative. The incident has highlighted the challenges Boeing faces in the space sector, especially compared to SpaceX, raising questions about its future involvement in space aviation.</description>

			<title>How Israelâ€™s assassination strategy evolved to become tech-savvy and precise</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-israels-assassination-strategy-evolved-to-become-tech-savvy-and-precise-13803133.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses Israel's history of targeted killings, particularly against Iranian figures. It uses the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran as a jumping-off point to explore the Israeli agency's history, ranging from the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004 to the use of AI to kill Mohsen Fakrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist, in 2020. 

The article highlights the evolving tactics of Israeli intelligence, from parcel bombs in the 1980s to sophisticated AI-controlled assassinations. It also touches on the moral and strategic dilemmas involved in these operations, referencing the debate surrounding the assassination of Ali Akbar Mohtashmipur, a key figure in the formation of Hezbollah.</description>

			<description>The author argues that the coup in Bangladesh was followed by a resurgence of religious persecution and a threat to freedom of speech.  Citing attacks on the Hindu community and the lynching of an actor and producer, the author expresses concern that a new generation of autocrats and religious zealots is rising. They highlight the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader, fearing his acceptance might legitimize the new regime.  While Yunus has called for an end to violence against minorities, the author questions whether he will truly have influence in curbing the escalating authoritarianism.</description>

			<title>International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples: A mischievous attempt to hide West's barbaric face</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/international-day-of-the-worlds-indigenous-peoples-a-mischievous-attempt-to-hide-wests-barbaric-face-13802902.html</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the UN's "International Day of the Worldâ€™s Indigenous Peoples," arguing that it is a Western attempt to deflect responsibility for historic atrocities against indigenous populations. It highlights the  date's connection to the massacre of the Powhatan tribe in America in 1610,  claiming it was chosen to mask colonial guilt.

The author asserts that India should not participate in this observed day, arguing that all Indians are indigenous to the subcontinent.  Instead, they propose celebrating figures like Mata Shabari, Jharkahan heroes like Bhagwan Birsa Munda, or Rani Gaidinliu, who embody Indian indigenous pride.  The author concludes by arguing that "Janjatiya Gaurav Divas" (Tribal Pride Day), established by the Indian government, is a more appropriate celebration of India's indigenous heritage.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the growing tensions in the South China Sea, particularly focusing on China's assertive actions.  

Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, facing Chinese territorial claims and military buildup, are strengthening their maritime cooperation.  Joint exercises, diplomatic initiatives, and enhanced coast guard ties represent a united front against China's expansionism. Notably, recent clashes between Filipino and Chinese coast guard vessels highlight the volatility of the situation. The article also mentions the "Squad" - a new security arrangement involving the US, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines - further emphasizing the international concern regarding China's actions in the region.</description>

			<title>Hasinaâ€™s departure leaves Awami League in disarray, Mujibâ€™s legacy in dispute</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/hasinas-departure-leaves-awami-league-in-disarray-mujibs-legacy-in-dispute-13802823.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure from Bangladesh after facing popular unrest and student demonstrations has left the Awami League in a precarious position. Her sudden exit, reminiscent of past dynastic collapses, contrasts with her father's legacy, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who died valiantly in a coup. 

While the Bangladesh Army orchestrated Hasina's escape, her departure has heightened concerns about the future of the Awami League and potential shifts in Bangladesh's political landscape. Critics suggest Hasina exhibited autocratic tendencies and failed to adequately empower the party, leading to its current vulnerability. The student movement that forced her exit mirrors previous instances of successful student activism in overthrowing dictatorships in Bangladesh.

Hasina's departure may embolden forces critical of India and potentially spark an exodus of Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, jeopardizing the already strained Indo-Bangladesh relationship.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh may be in for a long period of internal upheaval</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-may-be-in-for-a-long-period-of-internal-upheaval-13802706.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing a deep political crisis following mass student protests and the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  The country has a long history of political instability, marked by military coups, violence, and a deep mistrust between the two main political parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The army has a long tradition of intervening in politics, and the current army chief's intentions remain unclear.  Adding to the turmoil, student power has grown significantly, fueled by Islamic radicalization and a desire for change. The release of BNP leader Khaleda Zia further complicates the situation.  
External actors, like Pakistan, may also be seeking to exploit the instability for their own purposes.  With a weak interim government led by the aging Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh faces a uncertain future and a high risk of prolonged internal conflict.</description>

			<title>Why Iran's next move will be critical in deciding the fate of West Asian crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/irans-next-move-is-awaited-amid-escalations-in-middle-east-13802727.html</link>
			<description>A series of targeted assassinations of Iranian proxy leaders by Israel, including Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's Fuad Shukr, has significantly escalated tensions in the Middle East.

While Israel remains officially silent, the actions are widely attributed to the Mossad and suggest a shift towards a more focused strategy of targeting key Iranian figures.  Iran, facing a major security breach and a blow to its credibility, is expected to respond.  

The US, balancing its support for Israel with concerns about escalating conflict, is bolstering Israel's defenses but also pushing for negotiations and a ceasefire. Hezbollah, less capable of conventional warfare, may opt for standoff attacks.  The global community faces potential economic fallout from the heightened tensions, with pressure on oil prices and global trade routes.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/western-naivete-about-sikh-extremism-encourages-terror-betrays-genuine-sikhs-13802609.html</link>
			<description>The article draws parallels between Sikh extremism and past experiences with Islamist extremism. 

It argues that, similar to how some Muslim organizations exploited democratic freedoms for their own agendas, pro-Khalistan activists are using   Sikh communities for political gain.  The author cites pro-Khalistan activism's history of violence and intimidation within Sikh communities and  their demands for an independent state that include Pakistani territory, suggesting foreign influence.  The author suggests that Canada and the US should learn from the UK's experience, which identified and addressed the problem of extremists hijacking religious institutions for political purposes.   Finally, the article  concludes that tolerating Khalistan extremism undermines the very religious freedom it seeks to protect.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Despite previous support for Hasina, Hindus faced violence, attacks on their homes and temples, and looting, reminiscent of past atrocities  The article contrasts this with the indifference of some Hindus in India who remain unaware or choose to downplay the situation. It highlights a lack of support for Bangladeshi Hindus both within their own community and from their coreligionists in India.  The author draws parallels to the tragedy of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust and the enduring memory it holds as a stark reminder of the consequences of apathy and silence in the face of persecution.</description>

			<title>Who will really be running Bangladesh now?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/who-will-really-be-running-bangladesh-now-13802429.html</link>
			<description>Recent protests in Bangladesh led to the dissolution of Parliament and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader.  These protests, spearheaded by self-proclaimed student leaders, were initially focused on challenging quotas for government jobs for the families of freedom fighters. However, the protests evolved into a broader movement aimed at removing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government.

Yunus, known for his work with the Grameen Bank, was chosen by these student groups, raising questions about their legitimacy and potential foreign influence.  Some suspect Islamist groups, possibly backed by China, played a role in orchestrating the unrest. 

The situation raises concerns about the future direction of Bangladesh, with questions surrounding Yunus's ability to govern effectively alongside potentially conflicting political interests. The involvement of past political figures and the unclear motivations of the student movement create a complex and uncertain political landscape in the country.</description>

			<description>Following the targeted assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, Israel faces a looming retaliatory strike from Iran and its proxies.

Iran, the key player, possesses a substantial arsenal of missiles, including medium- and long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel.  It also has a collection of  drones, such as the Shahed series, which have been used in previous attacks.

Hezbollah, equipped by Iran, boasts a large inventory of missiles, rockets, and anti-tank weapons, along with advanced drones. They have proven their ability to threaten Israel's defenses during the current conflict.

The Houthis, backed by Iran, are also armed with missiles and drones, including the Qadr family and Chinese C-802 anti-ship missiles. They can strike targets within Israel's  range using these assets.

Hamas, while lacking a conventional military, utilizes guerilla tactics and possesses short-range rockets and anti-tank weapons.  The militias in Iraq and Syria,  directed by Iran, present an additional threat through attacks against US forces.

Israel, with its sophisticated air defense systems and US support, is preparing for a fierce response. The unfolding situation raises concerns about regional escalation and the potential for a broader war.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh is in the throes of Islamist pogrom against minority Hindus, and our liberals are busy obfuscating reality</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-is-in-the-throes-of-islamist-pogrom-against-minority-hindus-and-our-liberals-are-busy-obfuscating-reality-13802267.html</link>
			<description>Amidst a student-led movement in Bangladesh aimed at ousting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, concerns are rising over the escalating violence against the Hindu minority. Reports suggest Islamist groups, including the banned Jamaat-e-Islami and its affiliates, are exploiting the chaos to target Hindus, leading to widespread attacks on their homes, businesses, and temples. 

Despite a history of persecution, some Indian liberals have chosen to downplay the severity of the situation, even calling accounts of violence "exaggerated" or "spun." This silence is attributed to a desire to protect the narrative of Muslims as victims and prevent any potential Hindu mobilization in India.

Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi people, including Hindus who participated in the initial protests, are now facing a terrifying reality as they are targeted and left vulnerable. Reports indicate that law enforcement is overwhelmed and unable to protect the minority community.</description>

			<title>US Sutra | Tim Walz as Kamala Harrisâ€™s running mate: Will it bolster the Democratic campaign?</title>

			<description>Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz as her running mate after evaluating several options. His experience as a two-term governor of a key Midwestern state and twelve years in the House of Representatives make him a strong contender. 

Walz's centrist views balance Harris's progressive stance, and his background as a white male veteran is seen as appealing to a wider demographic. 

The choice was also strategic, as it aims to secure support in crucial swing states and counter Trump and Vance's appeal to certain voters. Some criticize Walz's record on issues like immigration, but the campaign believes his experience and demeanor will be assets.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh crisis: A play of invisible Chinese hand?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-a-play-of-invisible-chinese-hand-13802059.html</link>
			<description>Recent events in Bangladesh, including the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, suggest potential Chinese involvement in a potential coup. This development aligns with China's expanding engagement with Islamic extremist groups globally. 

China's initial focus was on using Pakistan as a counter to India, coupled with diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC).  The country has moved towards supporting non-state actors, such as collaborating with Pakistan-backed terrorists in Kashmir and recognizing the Taliban to counter ISIS-K and East Turkistan rebels. 

In the Middle East, China has supported Hamas and other Palestinian groups, raising concerns about its intentions. In Bangladesh, Hasina, who cracked down on Islamist groups,  is seen as a pro-India leader, making her an undesirable ally for Beijing. 


The situation in Bangladesh complicates India's economic and security interests in the region, potentially hindering its trade initiatives and leaving it vulnerable to increased migration and violence. China's growing alliance with Islamic extremist groups, initially a tactic to deflect criticism over its Uyghur policies, is now destabilizing democracies and reshaping the geopolitical landscape.</description>

			<description>India and Bangladesh share a complex relationship, with India closely monitoring Bangladesh's internal developments.  Sheikh Hasina's leadership, despite facing challenges, has been supported by India due to her strong stance against cross-border infiltration. However, recent events in Bangladesh, following a disputed election, raise questions about India's strategy.  Some argue India could have encouraged a more inclusive approach,  potentially mitigating the current political instability.  

The situation in Bangladesh has parallels to historical events, such as the 1975 crisis in India, and highlights the risks of political turmoil for regional stability. India faces the challenge of navigating these turbulent times diplomatically, carefully balancing its relationships with various global powers.</description>

			<title>From hope to despair: Testing time for democracy in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-hope-to-despair-testing-time-for-democracy-in-bangladesh-13801957.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, resigned and fled to India amid widespread student protests that escalated into violence and resulted in the deaths of over 300 people.  

The protests, initially focused on quota reforms in government jobs, took a radical turn with the involvement of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir.  These groups, known for their anti-Awami League stance and historical links to collaborators with Pakistan during the 1971 Liberation War,  incited violence and sought Hasina's removal. 

The army intervened, imposed an interim government, and banned Jamaat, leading to further unrest. The situation has worsened, with attacks on Hindus, looting, and the release of jailed opposition leader Khaleda Zia, signaling a potential rise of the BNP in alliance with Jamaat. 

The article warns that Bangladesh's future looks uncertain, with a possible return to military rule as the army, now in control, consolidates its power in collaboration with or confrontation against Jamaat-BNP.</description>

			<title>Tensions run high in Bangladesh, but New Delhi must engage with Dhaka</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/tensions-run-high-in-bangladesh-but-new-delhi-must-engage-with-dhaka-13801709.html</link>
			<description>The sudden resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, following widespread protests over a quota system for government jobs, marks a significant political shift in the country.  The protests, fueled by public discontent and exploited by opposition groups, escalated into riots and violence, leading to a significant loss of life.

The Hasina government's initial response was seen as heavy-handed, contributing to the escalation of the situation.  The army's eventual intervention, though prompted by a plea from retired officers and public pressure, suggests a breakdown of civilian authority.

India, which shares a close relationship with Bangladesh, must navigate this volatile situation carefully. Strengthening ties with all political forces and the Bangladeshi army, while emphasizing developmental cooperation, will be crucial for ensuring stability in the region. Hasina's downfall highlights the growing influence of popular unrest on political outcomes in South Asia.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-coup-seems-straight-out-of-cia-playbook-why-india-should-be-more-watchful-and-alert-13801515.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that the US-backed political upheaval in Bangladesh, leading to the removal of Sheikh Hasina, is a strategic blunder. It suggests that the US, fixated on promoting democracy even in contexts where it may be detrimental, overlooked the potential consequences of destabilizing Bangladesh.  

The author contends that this instability benefits Pakistan and China, who are now poised to gain influence in the region.  The instability in Bangladesh is seen as a major security threat to India, particularly its northeastern states and West Bengal. The article concludes by warning India to be vigilant against potential CIA-backed destabilization efforts within its own borders.</description>

			<description>The fall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government in Bangladesh raises concerns about India's security. The new political forces, Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP), are anti-secular and potentially aligned with Pakistan's interests. There are also reports of US involvement in the regime change, possibly motivated by strategic considerations in the Indo-Pacific region. This development adds to India's existing challenges with China and Pakistan, creating a hostile environment on its eastern border.</description>

			<title>Why Bangladesh crisis demands a pragmatic approach from Mamata Banerjee</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-bangladesh-crisis-demands-a-pragmatic-approach-from-mamata-banerjee-13801431.html</link>
			<description>The recent turmoil in Bangladesh has triggered fears of another refugee crisis in West Bengal. West Bengal, which shares a long border with Bangladesh, has historically absorbed waves of migrants, though this continuous influx puts a strain on the state's resources and infrastructure. 

The arrival of refugees can lead to demographic shifts, increased competition for jobs, and pressure on public services like healthcare and education. This can exacerbate existing social and economic tensions, particularly regarding religion and communal harmony.

While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has expressed a willingness to welcome refugees, this approach is being criticized as potentially risky and unsustainable. 

Concerns include the potential strain on West Bengal's already dense population, the impact on the state's economy, and the risk of increased communal tensions and security threats. 


A more pragmatic and cautious approach is being advocated, emphasizing the need for coordination between the state and central governments, as well as with the international community, to address the root causes of the unrest in Bangladesh and manage the refugee crisis effectively.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh protests: Sheikh Hasina was Indiaâ€™s best bet, but now is the time for a backup plan</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-protests-sheikh-hasina-was-indias-best-bet-but-now-is-the-time-for-a-backup-plan-13801233.html</link>
			<description>In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned amidst significant civil unrest that began as protests against a reinstated quota system for government jobs but escalated to encompass broader issues like economic instability and corruption.  The unrest resulted in numerous casualties and led to demands for accountability from the government. Hasina's departure comes as a setback for India, which viewed her pro-India stance and close strategic partnership as crucial in a region marked by shifting loyalties and China's growing influence. Concerns now arise that external forces, particularly China, may capitalize on the situation to weaken India's standing in the region.</description>

			<title>Eminent citizens, donâ€™t mix morality with national interest! Why India shouldnâ€™t cut its defence ties with Israel</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/eminent-citizens-dont-mix-morality-with-national-interest-why-india-shouldnt-cut-its-defence-ties-with-israel-13801133.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses a letter signed by some Indian citizens calling for the cancellation of arms export licences to Israel amidst the ongoing conflict with Hamas. The author argues that stopping these exports would harm India's budding military-industrial complex, which has seen significant growth under the "Make in India" initiative. 

The author points out that India's defense exports have reached record levels and that the sector generates employment and contributes to research and development.  They also highlight the strategic partnership between India and Israel in defense, noting that Israel is a valuable technology partner for India's growing defense sector. The author criticizes the letter signatories for selectively raising moral concerns while ignoring similar issues involving China and Pakistan, suggesting that their motives may be driven by opposition to India's increasing defense capabilities rather than genuine concern for peace.</description>

			<title>Why equality is so illusive, yet so necessary</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-equality-is-so-illusive-yet-so-necessary-13800984.html</link>
			<description>Darrin McMahon's "Equality" explores the complex and evolving concept of equality throughout history. From ancient societies to modern movements, McMahon analyzes how different civilizations have grappled with ideas of equality, often in contradictory ways.  While ideals of equality have inspired transformative movements like the Civil Rights Movement, McMahon argues that achieving true equality is an ongoing struggle. He highlights the inherent tension between the human capacity for cooperation and our tendency towards hierarchy and dominance. McMahon emphasizes that the pursuit of equality requires constant vigilance and a willingness to challenge systems of inequality.  

He concludes that while true equality may be elusive, the human imagination's capacity to envision it remains a powerful force.</description>

			<title>No, Quad hasnâ€™t lost its relevance; India is forcing it to become more broad-based and thatâ€™s a good thing</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/no-quad-hasnt-lost-its-relevance-india-is-forcing-it-to-become-more-broad-based-and-thats-a-good-thing-13800894.html</link>
			<description>India's intentions regarding Quad are complex and multifaceted. Recent meetings between Indian and Chinese officials have fueled speculation about a possible thaw in bilateral relations, leading some to question India's commitment to Quad. 

However, India's cautious engagement with China, including restricting Chinese FDI and focusing on border infrastructure development, reflects a strategic stance aimed at balancing China's growing influence in the region. Quad, while evolving to address a broader global agenda, remains a crucial part of this balancing act.

India is concurrently deepening its security and economic ties with Southeast Asian nations, directly countering China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. This multi-pronged approach, encompassing plurilateral, multilateral, and bilateral frameworks, demonstrates India's commitment to regional stability without forcing Southeast Asian nations to choose sides in a great power conflict. This nuanced strategy, while overlooked by some in the West, highlights India's preference for a multi-dimensional approach to regional security.</description>

			<title>Ismail Haniyehâ€™s killing: Iran caught between the devil and the deep blue sea</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ismail-haniyehs-killing-iran-caught-between-the-devil-and-the-deep-blue-sea-13800733.html</link>
			<description>The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh presents Iran with a difficult dilemma. While the Islamic Republic feels compelled to respond to protect its stability and regional influence, it lacks the resources for a direct confrontation with Israel and a potential US intervention. Iran's weakened economy, strained by sanctions, further limits its options.  Instead, it is likely to escalate actions through proxies in Lebanon and elsewhere, potentially resorting to targeted missile attacks.  While a full-scale war is not in Iran's interest, the high-stakes situation fueled by Israel's nuclear threat and potential miscalculation leaves the region vulnerable. Iran is facing a complex challenge in balancing its desire for retaliation with the realities of its diminished capabilities.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/exercise-pitch-black-key-takeaways-for-indian-air-force-13800723.html</link>
			<description>Exercise Pitch Black 2024, a major international air combat training event hosted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), took place from July 12 to August 2 in Darwin and Tindal, Northern Territory. This year's edition, the largest in its 43-year history, involved 20 nations, over 140 aircraft, and 4435 personnel.  The Indian Air Force (IAF) participated with Su-30 MKI fighters, C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, and IL-78 Air-to-Air Refuelling aircraft. 

The exercise focused on large-force employment, including air-to-air combat, air-to-surface strikes, and offensive and defensive counter-air operations. Participants gained valuable experience engaging with advanced aircraft like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. 

Pitch Black 2024 underscored the importance of multinational cooperation for regional security and provided IAF with a valuable opportunity to enhance interoperability and refine combat doctrines in a realistic combat environment.</description>

			<title>Why time is ripe to shun â€˜One-China policyâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-time-is-ripe-to-shun-one-china-policy-13800693.html</link>
			<description>The US's recent support for Tibet, including the signing of the 'Resolve Tibet Act,' highlights a shift in the country's approach to China.  Historically, Tibet functioned as a sovereign state, possessing the necessary attributes of a nation, even entering into agreements with powerful Chinese dynasties. China's forceful occupation of Tibet in 1950-51,  subsequently disrupting peaceful India-Tibet relations, is widely recognized as an act of aggression. In light of  China's ongoing expansionist agenda and betrayal of India's security interests, it is argued that India should adopt a more assertive stance. This includes recognizing the Tibetan Government in Exile, supporting international efforts for Tibetan autonomy, and realigning diplomatic relations to reflect the realities on the ground. Ultimately, supporting Tibet's self-determination is seen as crucial for safeguarding India's own national security.</description>

			<title>How the idea of 'truce' is absent in French politics and Paris Olympics</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/emmanuel-macron-french-politics-and-paris-olympics-13800645.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the political climate in France amidst the 2024 Summer Olympics.  President Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections has resulted in political instability, described as "chienlit," a term for chaos. 

Despite this, the Olympics opening ceremony received praise for its innovative displays and highlighting female heroes. However, a controversial portrayal of Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" featuring drag queen disciples drew criticism and accusations of blasphemy.

Macron, facing  a fractured parliament, is seeking a new prime minister who can bridge the political divide. He acknowledges his majority lost the election but remains determined to navigate this complex situation.  The article concludes by comparing France's political challenges to General de Gaulle's famous quote about the country's diverse cheese varieties.</description>

			<title>Mewat: Once a region with mixed identities, now marred by communal tensions</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/mewat-once-a-region-with-mixed-identities-now-marred-by-communal-tensions-13800520.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the historical and cultural complexities of Mewat, a region in northwestern India encompassing parts of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. 

The region has a history marked by conflict, violence, and forced religious conversions dating back to the 13th century under Sultan Balban. 

Despite attempts to force conformity, the Meos, the region's dominant population, have retained elements of their original Rajput identity and customs. The region today faces challenges of underdevelopment, crime, and extremist ideologies, with the Tablighi Jamaat's influence contributing to a rise in orthodoxy. 

The author highlights instances of mixed cultural expressions, like the Octagonal tomb in Tijara, which locals refer to as a temple dedicated to a Hindu king.  

While violence erupted in Nuh in 2023, a recent instance of communal harmony during a religious procession offers a glimmer of hope for a more peaceful future.   The article concludes by emphasizing the need for inspired leadership and collective effort to overcome the region's challenges.</description>

			<title>PM Modiâ€™s expected visit to Ukraine: Rhetoric and reality</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-expected-visit-to-ukraine-rhetoric-and-reality-13800510.html</link>
			<description>The ongoing war in Ukraine, approaching its 900-day mark, has resulted in devastating consequences.  Thousands of civilian and military personnel have been killed or wounded, millions displaced, and the country's infrastructure severely damaged.  Despite significant military aid from the West, the conflict shows no signs of abating, with Ukraine seeking more advanced weaponry and Russia holding firm.  A potential peace deal negotiated in early 2022 collapsed, allegedly due to opposition from the US and UK.

While India has maintained cordial ties with Ukraine, providing humanitarian aid and facilitating student evacuations, its relationship with Russia remains a key consideration. Prime Minister Modi's upcoming visit to Ukraine is shrouded in mystery, with questions about its purpose and potential outcomes.  

Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have been largely unsuccessful, raising concerns that the situation may worsen.  It remains unclear whether Prime Minister Modi's visit will achieve any tangible results or contribute to a meaningful resolution.</description>

			<title>Iran and Israel: Conundrum of targeted killings and Netanyahuâ€™s quest to escape humiliation</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/iran-and-israel-conundrum-of-targeted-killings-and-netanyahus-quest-to-escape-humiliation-13800444.html</link>
			<description>The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran has heightened tensions in the region.  While Israel has made strides in targeting Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, the killing of Haniyeh risks further escalation.  Iran, facing humiliation and calls for revenge from its leaders, is expected to respond through its proxies, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. 

The international community is concerned about a wider conflict and is working to de-escalate the situation. However,  Israel's actions, driven by a desire to eliminate the threat from Iran and its allies, continue to raise the risk of a major war.  The situation remains volatile, with both sides maneuvering for strategic advantage and facing pressure from international actors to avoid a catastrophic conflict.</description>

			<title>World Development Report 2024: India must focus on inclusive growth to escape â€˜middle-income trapâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/world-development-report-2024-india-must-focus-on-inclusive-growth-to-escape-middle-income-trap-13800429.html</link>
			<description>The World Bank's 2024 Development Report highlights the "middle-income trap," where countries struggle to reach high-income status.  The report warns that 108 middle-income countries, including India, face significant challenges in escaping this trap. 

It suggests a "3i" strategy: investments, infusion of technology, and innovation. While investing and technology infusion are recommended for low and lower-middle-income countries, upper middle-income countries like India are urged to prioritize all three "i's," particularly innovation and research and development to leverage their demographic dividend and human capital.

The report acknowledges India's specific challenges, including socio-economic inequality and the need for robust institutional development.  While recognizing the potential inherent in India's youth, the report emphasizes the need for inclusive growth and leveraging the "public-private-academia" convergence to achieve "Vikisit Bharat" by 2047.</description>

			<title>Why Israel's conventional operations are successful but it is unable to repeat that in hybrid war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-israels-conventional-operations-are-successful-but-it-is-unable-to-repeat-that-in-hybrid-war-13800391.html</link>
			<description>The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) achieved several decisive victories in conventional wars during the latter half of the 20th century.  After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, however, the nature of conflict shifted.  The rise of Iranian-backed proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas brought about a new era of "forever in war" characterized by terrorism and asymmetric warfare. 

The IDF, accustomed to conventional tactics, struggled to adapt to these new challenges.  They have faced repeated setbacks, most prominently in 2006 against Hezbollah and the ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza.  This failure to craft a winning strategy has led to high civilian casualties and questionable tactics.  The author suggests that Israel's military approach has become too focused on violence, neglecting diplomacy and efforts to isolate terrorists within their own societies.  In contrast, India's approach to proxy warfare, while acknowledging the constant threat from adversaries, emphasizes pragmatic solutions and conflict termination.</description>

			<title>Beyond the Lines | Road to Ruin: Why Pakistani premiers pursue unwinnable wars against India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-road-to-ruin-why-pakistani-premiers-pursue-unwinnable-wars-against-india-13800168.html</link>
			<description>The Kargil war in 1999 exposed Pakistan's miscalculations in its military strategy against India.  Historical context shows Pakistan repeatedly engaging in wars it couldn't win, using pretexts like Kashmir to justify conflicts and maintain its military's relevance. Despite acquiring nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan underestimated India's resolve, misjudging that the nuclear deterrent would prevent a counteroffensive. 

Pakistan's failed military campaigns, including Kargil, have consistently resulted in political turmoil. Ayub Khan, though victorious in 1965, faced backlash and lost his position. Yahya Khan, humiliated in 1971, was forced out, and Pervez Musharraf's Kargil operation led to the downfall of Nawaz Sharif. These instances demonstrate a clear correlation between military misadventures against India and the collapse of Pakistani leadership.</description>

			<title>Need of a single window system to ensure youth skilling and employment</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/need-of-a-single-window-system-to-ensure-youth-skilling-and-employment-13800139.html</link>
			<description>India faces a significant issue of youth unemployment despite economic growth.  Various government initiatives aim to address this, including funding for small businesses, vocational training, and rural employment schemes. However, the effectiveness of these schemes remains unclear due to a lack of reliable data. Recent studies reveal alarming unemployment rates, especially among educated youth.  While some progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty among youth, vulnerability remains high due to a significant portion of youth employed in the informal sector under poor conditions.  

The government's focus should be on bridging skill gaps, ensuring secure employment, and reducing vulnerable work participation. Successful international models like the European Union's Youth Guarantee scheme can provide inspiration. India could implement a similar program at the district level, coordinating existing skill development and employment schemes to offer comprehensive support to youth seeking gainful employment or entrepreneurship.</description>

			<title>Why collaboration model would work better for India in curbing Chinese footprints in neighbourhood</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-collaboration-model-would-work-better-for-india-in-curbing-chinese-footprints-in-neighbourhood-13800060.html</link>
			<description>The Indian Ocean Region, despite its militarization, remains relatively peaceful. China, however, is increasing its presence through various means, including naval deployments, dual-use infrastructure projects, and fishing activities. This has raised concerns about Chinaâ€™s intentions and its potential to exert influence over smaller nations in the region. 

India, on the other hand, pursues a trust-based approach, focusing on capacity-building, humanitarian assistance, and regional cooperation initiatives. However, India's democratic processes and slower decision-making can hinder its effectiveness compared to China's more assertive model. 
  
To counter China's growing influence, India needs to accelerate its engagement and demonstrate its commitment to the region through concrete actions and tangible benefits. Building trust and forging strong partnerships with its maritime neighbors is crucial for India to successfully implement its 'Neighbourhood First' policy and maintain a balance of power in the Indian Ocean.</description>

			<title>Hamas â€˜beehiveâ€™ leadership ensures survival despite Haniyehâ€™s killing</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/hamas-beehive-leadership-ensures-survival-despite-haniyehs-killing-13799960.html</link>
			<description>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Tehran, following a pattern of assassinations targeting Hamas' leadership.  Haniyeh, despite being the organization's international face and advocating for negotiations with Israel, played a significant role in the recent escalation of violence.  

His death is unlikely to cripple Hamas as it follows a structure designed to replace leaders, with senior members like Khaled Mashal and Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza leader, considered as potential successors. Sinwar, known for his ruthlessness, has earned the nickname "The Butcher of Khan Younis" and was last seen in a video emerging from a tunnel complex. 

The article details other prominent Hamas figures who have also been eliminated by Israel over the years, emphasizing Hamas' ability to regenerate its leadership despite these losses. It concludes that the cycle of violence will likely continue as Hamas demonstrates resilience and adapts to new leadership.</description>

			<title>Netanyahu seeks total war: Hezbollah is a sideshow, Iran is the real target</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/netanyahu-seeks-total-war-hezbollah-is-a-sideshow-iran-is-the-real-target-13799944.html</link>
			<description>Israel is escalating its conflict with Iran and its proxies, demonstrating a willingness to conduct targeted assassinations and airstrikes deep within enemy territory. 

While these actions aim to weaken Hezbollah and Hamas, they risk provoking a wider conflict, particularly with Iran. Israel's strategy appears to be driven by a desire to force Iran's reaction, potentially justifying a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.  This aggressive posture, while projecting strength, lacks a clear strategic endgame and could lead to unforeseen consequences.  The perpetuation of conflict also serves Netanyahu's political interests by consolidating his base and diverting attention from domestic issues.</description>

			<title>How Ismail Haniyehâ€™s killing may weaken Hamas but not its ideology</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ismail-haniyehs-killing-may-weaken-hamas-but-not-its-ideology-13799756.html</link>
			<description>Recently, Ismail Haniyeh, the top leader of Hamas, was killed in an attack in Tehran. Hamas blamed Israel for the attack, while Israel celebrated the event. Haniyeh was a key figure in Hamas' political operations and was involved in ceasefire negotiations with Israel. His death has been met with anger by Palestinians, and there are concerns that it could lead to a further escalation of the conflict.  The assassination is a significant blow to Hamas, but the group's ideology is unlikely to change, and it remains committed to its goals, including the liberation of Jerusalem. 


The killing has sparked international concern, with some urging Israel to pursue a diplomatic solution and avoid further violence.  Ultimately, the consequences of Haniyeh's death remain to be seen, but the situation in the region is highly volatile.</description>

			<title>From Ukraine to Armenia, drones take centre stage in modern warfare</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-ukraine-to-armenia-drones-take-centre-stage-in-modern-warfare-13799697.html</link>
			<description>Drones have significantly changed modern warfare, offering precision, surveillance, and operational flexibility.  Cost-effective compared to manned aircraft, they've been instrumental in conflicts like Nagorno-Karabakh and the Russia-Ukraine war. Technological advancements allow for secure control and precise strikes,  making drones a powerful tool. However, the rise of AI in warfare, particularly Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), raises serious ethical concerns. LAWS can identify, select, and engage targets without human intervention, leading to questions about accountability and the potential for unintended harm. International discussions aim to regulate these systems, but achieving consensus is challenging due to differing national interests and the ambiguity surrounding LAWS definitions.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-japan-south-korea-trilateral-partnership-will-withstand-the-test-of-time-13799676.html</link>
			<description>The US, Japan, and South Korea recently formalized their trilateral security cooperation with a historic memorandum signed by their defense ministers. This move comes amidst growing regional tensions,  particularly  North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the increasing US-China rivalry, and a more assertive China in the East and South China Seas. 

The agreement outlines key areas of cooperation, including real-time data sharing on North Korean missile launches, joint military drills, and enhanced intelligence sharing. This strengthens the security umbrella for all three countries and aims to deter North Korean aggression.  The trilateral cooperation also reflects a shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</description>

			<title>Indiaâ€“China â€˜de-escalationâ€™: New progress or new normal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-china-de-escalation-new-progress-or-new-normal-13799546.html</link>
			<description>Recent meetings and statements between Indian and Chinese officials highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding the India-China border dispute. While discussions on maintaining peace and making progress have taken place, China's actions, including the construction of a bridge near the Line of Actual Control, raise concerns. 

Historically, China has prioritized its strategic and economic interests during border negotiations, and its current focus on maritime security, coupled with the militarization of its borders, adds complexity to the situation. India must remain vigilant and firm in asserting its position, preventing any "new progress" by China from becoming the "new normal" in this contested region.</description>

			<title>Vietnamese PMâ€™s India visit: How civilisational roots, geopolitical interests cement New Delhi-Hanoi ties</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vietnamese-pms-india-visit-how-civilisational-roots-geopolitical-interests-cement-new-delhi-hanoi-ties-13799495.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's visit to India aims to further strengthen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in 2016.  The two countries have witnessed a significant increase in bilateral trade, and defense cooperation is a key focus. India gifted a warship to Vietnam in 2023, demonstrating its commitment to deepening ties. Discussions during the visit are expected to include the acquisition of Indian BrahMos missiles and Akash surface-to-air missile systems. 

Beyond strategic interests, shared civilisational history and cultural connections contribute to the growing trust between India and Vietnam.  Both nations recognize the importance of multipolarity in the evolving global order and seek to build partnerships with like-minded powers to ensure lasting peace and security.</description>

			<description>The recent Third Plenum of China's Communist Party, presided over by Xi Jinping, outlined the country's policy direction for the next five years.  The plenum emphasized a "new development philosophy" focused on high-quality growth driven by education, innovation, and technological self-sufficiency.  Economic reforms aimed at strengthening the socialist market economy while maintaining state control were also highlighted, along with a commitment to green energy and fiscal reforms.  National security received significant attention, underscoring the Party's commitment to strengthening its control over the military and defense capabilities. 

The plenum's focus on state control and national security, coupled with the current economic slowdown, has raised concerns both domestically and internationally about the direction of China's future.</description>

			<title>Why US policies fail to resonate with Arab public opinion</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-policies-fail-to-resonate-with-arab-public-opinion-13799262.html</link>
			<description>Decades of US involvement in the Middle East, characterized by aid and military alliances, have not earned widespread Arab support. US policies often clash with regional sentiments, particularly its stance on Israel, leading to distrust.  

The US has struggled to define clear goals and adapt to shifting dynamics, such as Iran's growing influence in Iraq. The frustration with US policies allows authoritarian regimes to manipulate public opinion by linking conflicts with the Palestinian cause. US interventions, perceived as heavy-handed and contributing to instability and refugee crises, further fuel anti-American sentiment. Iran and its allies amplify these grievances through propaganda, solidifying their position while US actions damage its credibility.  

China's increasing diplomatic engagement in the Middle East, epitomized by its role in mediating conflicts, contrasts with the US's inconsistent approach and benefits China's popularity. The US faces a challenge maintaining its influence as regional powers seek diverse partnerships amid a shifting geopolitical landscape.</description>

			<title>â€˜Chanda mama no longer door keâ€™: Artemis dawns new space age as world gets ready with big moon plan</title>

			<description>The Artemis program, led by NASA, aims to establish a permanent human presence on the moon.  This involves landing the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface by 2026, and building a lunar space station called "Gateway" by 2027.

The program seeks to utilize lunar resources like water and rare minerals, potentially powering rockets and future space exploration.  Forty-three countries, including India, have signed the Artemis Accords, a set of principles for sustainable and transparent space activities.  

While the US, with partners like SpaceX and Boeing, leads the initiative, China is also advancing its own lunar program focusing on resource exploration and utilization.  Artemis is seen as a stepping stone for future human missions to Mars and beyond.</description>

			<title>Quadâ€™s quiet achiever: Indiaâ€™s growing footprint in the Indo-Pacific</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/quads-quiet-achiever-indias-growing-footprint-in-the-indo-pacific-13799029.html</link>
			<description>The recent Quad foreign ministers' meeting in Tokyo emphasized several key points.

Firstly, while India holds the chair this year, hosting responsibilities are flexible and driven by convenience, prioritizing pre-existing convenings. 

Secondly, implementation of Quad initiatives, including those in the IORA region, Pacific Islands, and ASEAN, remains crucial, with a focus on disaster resilience,  digital economy, and critical emerging technologies.

Thirdly, strategic challenges, particularly China's influence in the South China Sea, dominated discussions. The Quad supports ASEAN centrality and a robust code of conduct with China but remains concerned by China's actions.

Fourthly, attention shifted from the Ukraine crisis to the Gaza conflict, with all four members advocating for peace. 

Finally, the Quad balances its work towards regional good with military coordination to address regional issues, reflecting India's nuanced approach - strategic congruence without formal coalition membership.</description>

			<title>Why India needs to balance security concerns with neighboursâ€™ sovereign considerations</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-needs-to-balance-security-concerns-with-neighbours-sovereign-considerations-13798861.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses India's approach to its regional security concerns and its interactions with neighboring countries, particularly in the context of China's growing influence. 

India's "Neighbourhood First" policy aims to build strong ties with its neighbors based on people-centric interactions rather than personality-driven ones. While India addresses regional security concerns, it faces criticism from neighboring nations for expecting them to align with its security perceptions without sufficient consultation.

The article highlights instances where India's actions have  caused friction with its neighbors, such as its defense agreements with countries like the US and pressure on them regarding China. 

Despite these challenges, the author suggests that the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) offers a platform for collective security dialogue and building trust among Indian Ocean rim nations, ultimately mitigating external influence and fostering a more cooperative regional security environment.</description>

			<title>Unravelling the complexity of ADHD</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/adhd-numbers-are-rising-alarmingly-unravelling-the-complexity-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-13798850.html</link>
			<description>ADHD is often diagnosed alongside other mental health conditions. Studies show that a large percentage of individuals with ADHD also experience conditions like anxiety, depression, and oppositional defiance disorder. These co-existing conditions can exacerbate each other and lead to challenges in daily life.  

One reason for this overlap is that symptoms of ADHD and other conditions can be similar, potentially leading to misdiagnosis.  Additionally,  genetic factors may contribute to the link between ADHD and conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  

Recognizing the complexity of these co-existing conditions is crucial for effective treatment.  A combined approach involving medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.</description>

			<title>Why India canâ€™t afford not to engage with junta in Myanmar</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-cant-afford-not-to-engage-with-junta-in-myanmar-13798768.html</link>
			<description>India's relationship with Myanmar's military junta is complex and fraught with challenges.  While the junta's grip on power weakens, it remains a crucial ally for India due to its volatile region, porous border, and influence from Chinese-backed militias. India supports the junta primarily for strategic reasons, including counterbalancing China's influence, ensuring regional stability for initiatives like BIMSTEC, and tackling the narcotics trade.  

Despite ethical concerns, India believes engagement with Mynamar is necessary and seeks a diplomatic path towards a future democratic framework. This delicate balancing act requires a combination of pragmatism and principle, as India navigates the complexities of Myanmar's situation.</description>

			<title>The many diplomatic nuances of PM Modiâ€™s expected visit to Ukraine</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-many-diplomatic-nuances-of-pm-modis-expected-visit-to-ukraine-13798785.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's potential visit to Ukraine stems from several factors.  Ukraine desires international sympathy for its plight, and a visit from a major non-Western nation like India would be significant. India, with its close ties to Russia, has been urged to play a mediating role in the conflict.

Modi's recent visit to Russia angered the US, prompting India to consider this visit as a gesture of peace and diplomacy to Zelenskyy. This visit could also strengthen India's position on the world stage, counterbalancing China's involvement in peace initiatives.

India supports a peaceful resolution to the conflict and  acknowledges existing mediation efforts by countries like China. Modi's visit, therefore, could be seen as a continuation of India's diplomatic efforts to find a solution that satisfies all parties involved.</description>

			<title>Bidenâ€™s â€˜coup for a coupâ€™ to avenge his ouster from White House race</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bidens-coup-for-a-coup-to-avenge-his-ouster-from-white-house-race-13798622.html</link>
			<description>Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race came after a series of setbacks, including a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump and declining poll numbers.  

Facing pressure from within his own party, including high-profile Democrats who wanted him to step aside, Biden ultimately conceded defeat. He claimed his decision was made in the "defense of democracy" and to "pass the torch to a new generation," endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. 

Despite his stated reasons, Biden's move was widely seen as a face-saving attempt after his fitness for office was increasingly questioned.  Several polls indicated that alternative Democratic candidates, including Harris, were performing better against Trump. 

Biden's endorsement of Harris was seen by some as a strategic move to avoid an open nomination process that could have threatened party unity and led to a more contested race. 

While Harris now holds the Democratic nomination, many remain skeptical of her ability to defeat Trump in the general election.</description>

			<description>Tarun Tahiliani has defended his designs for the Indian contingent at the Paris Olympics, emphasizing that they are not meant to be haute couture.  Despite criticism about the use of digital prints instead of traditional weaves, Tahiliani maintains that the designs represent modern India and acknowledges the teamâ€™s preference for wearing what they are familiar with. 

He further states that the uniforms have received positive feedback from industrialists and believes the different perspectives are natural. The designer stands by his choices, emphasizing that the focus should be on the athletes' performance rather than the aesthetics of the uniforms.</description>

			<title>Dealing with Pakistan: How India can chart out a security roadmap for Kashmir</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dealing-with-pakistan-how-india-can-chart-out-a-security-roadmap-for-kashmir-13798397.html</link>
			<description>This article outlines a multifaceted strategy for India to counter Pakistan's terrorism. It emphasizes strengthening security at infiltration points, particularly along the Jammu and Punjab border, and reviving human intelligence networks (HUMINT). 

The author argues for a community outreach program to address alienation and concerns of various groups. Cracking down on Islamist outfits, reviving Village Defence Committees, and dismantling local support systems are also deemed crucial.  A "carrot and stick" policy is proposed, incentivizing patriotism while applying tough measures against extremists. 

The article concludes by advocating for strong diplomatic pressure on Pakistan, leveraging India's economic and military advantages, and potentially escalating to military action as a last resort to demonstrate the high cost of terrorism.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/jaishankar-meets-wang-yi-in-laos-is-thaw-in-china-india-ties-possible-13798381.html</link>
			<description>India's External Affairs Minister, Jaishankar, met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of an ASEAN meeting in Laos. The discussions focused on resolving the ongoing border dispute along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). 

Jaishankar emphasized the need for mutual respect, interest, and sensitivity between the two nations for normalcy to be restored. Both sides agreed to hold an "early meeting" of the Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) to further discuss border issues. 

While previous attempts at de-escalation have seen limited success, both countries expressed hope for a swift resolution to the standoff, which has negatively impacted their bilateral relations.</description>

			<title>No â€˜Viksit Bharatâ€™ without unleashing Green Revolution 2.0</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/no-viksit-bharat-without-unleashing-green-revolution-2-0-13798327.html</link>
			<description>The focus should shift from discussions about capital gains tax to foundational reforms that benefit the majority of Indians. India's economic growth, while impressive, hasn't trickled down effectively, leading to significant income disparity. 

Agriculture, crucial for a large portion of the population, requires urgent attention.  Investments in technology, infrastructure, and research are needed to boost productivity and income for farmers.  

Subsidies, while seemingly helpful, primarily benefit consumers, not farmers.  Additionally, the government must consider a negotiated Minimum Support Price (MSP) system to incentivize crop diversification and provide basic income security.

Boosting agricultural incomes will have a positive ripple effect on the entire economy, especially the consumer market in rural India. Policymakers must prioritize reforms in agriculture, health and education to ensure a more equitable and prosperous society.</description>

			<title>Trump 2.0: What it may mean for India-US relations</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/trump-2-0-what-it-may-mean-for-india-us-relations-13798240.html</link>
			<description>A potential second Trump presidency could significantly impact India's relationship with the US. While Trump's economic nationalism might hurt Indian exporters through tariffs, it could also lead to increased US investment in India as companies seek alternatives to China.  Migration policies are expected to be stricter, potentially impacting Indian IT professionals, students, and families seeking visas. 

However, defense and military cooperation could further strengthen, benefiting India through technology sharing, arms sales, and strategic alignment against China in the Indo-Pacific.  India's shared interests with the US in countering Chinese influence and terrorism could also lead to closer collaboration.  Ultimately, the nature of the relationship will depend on strategic diplomacy and actions taken by both countries.</description>

			<title>Paris Olympics 2024: Shame on Tarun Tahiliani for India contingent's ikat-inspired uniforms!</title>

			<description>Tarun Tahiliani's Olympic uniforms for the Indian contingent faced sharp criticism for their unflattering design and lack of creativity.  Ace badminton player Jwala Gutta highlighted the impracticality of the sarees for athletes, pointing out the discomfort and lack of pre-draped options.  She also criticized the choice of colors and print, arguing that they didn't represent the beauty of Indian culture.  Many felt Tahiliani, known for his expertise in other areas, did not do justice to the ikat weave, which could have been showcased more effectively.  Critics compared the uniforms to cheap imitations found in local markets, lamenting the missed opportunity to represent India with a truly magnificent ensemble.</description>

			<title>â€˜Counter disinformationâ€™ or betraying trust? US embassyâ€™s meddling in Indiaâ€™s domestic politics deserves greater scrutiny</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-embassy-meddling-in-indias-domestic-politics-india-us-relation-13798149.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the US's attempt to influence India's domestic politics through seemingly benign initiatives. 

It argues that while the US emphasizes a partnership of equals, its actions, particularly those undertaken by the US embassy in India,  reveal a deeper agenda. The author highlights a workshop on "impactful content" hosted by the embassy, led by controversial figures linked to organizations with ties to the US deep state. 

The article suggests these efforts, framed as countering disinformation, are actually attempts to manipulate public discourse and weaken the ruling BJP party, which the US views as a challenge to its liberal hegemony. 

Further, it draws parallels to the Biden administration's alleged censorship of dissenting voices on social media platforms, implying that the US is employing similar tactics in India.  The author concludes by expressing concern that these actions undermine the trust between the two nations, despite their proclaimed strategic partnership.</description>

			<title>Hamas-Fatah deal: Truth behind Chinaâ€™s role as â€˜global peace mediatorâ€™</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/hamas-fatah-deal-truth-behind-chinas-role-as-global-peace-mediator-13797990.html</link>
			<description>China recently brokered a peace agreement between Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, in Beijing. The agreement, welcomed by China and some factions, calls for a unified Palestinian government once war in Gaza ends. However, critics argue that the agreement is superficial and overlooks the deep distrust between the factions.  

China's media is portraying this as a major diplomatic achievement, highlighting its role in mediating the Saudi-Iran rapprochement and suggesting its potential involvement in other conflicts. However, critics point out that the Saudi-Iran detente has yet to yield substantial results, and that China's support for Hamas and other groups designated as terrorists by many countries raises questions about its true intentions. 

Some Indian commentators are also lauding China's peacemaking efforts, but critics argue that this overlooks China's own support for terrorism and its double standards on the issue.</description>

			<title>Ongoing study reveals house sparrows in Uttarakhand follow human migration</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ongoing-study-reveals-house-sparrows-in-uttarakhand-follow-human-migration-13797968.html</link>
			<description>A new study by the Wildlife Institute of India has revealed that house sparrow populations in the Uttarakhand Himalayas migrate along with the local villagers.  The sparrows leave the high-altitude villages when villagers move to lower elevations for winter and return with them in the summer. This  demonstrates a strong bond between the birds and humans.  The study also found that sparrows living at higher altitudes are larger in size due to adaptations to the cold climate. Researchers are using bird banding to track the sparrows' movements and learn more about their nesting habits and food sources in these challenging environments.</description>

			<title>More than just the Games: The big message the Olympics convey</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/more-than-just-the-games-the-big-message-the-olympics-convey-13797953.html</link>
			<description>The Olympic Games, dating back to ancient Greece,  remain a significant global event despite changing times. The Games promote sportsmanship and the pursuit of athletic excellence, transcending cultural and political boundaries. 

They have historically facilitated dialogue and reconciliation between nations, as seen in instances like the participation of South Africa in 1992 and the marching of North and South Korea under one flag in 2000. 

Beyond their symbolic value, the Olympics provide economic benefits to host countries, boost tourism, and raise global awareness of diverse sports.  The cyclical nature of the Games, supported by sponsors, media, and fans, generates substantial revenue that is largely reinvested in the Olympic movement, ensuring its continued legacy.</description>

			<title>America's Resolve Tibet Act and India as third polarity in Sino-Tibetan negotiations</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/americas-resolve-tibet-act-and-india-as-third-polarity-in-sino-tibetan-negotiations-13797921.html</link>
			<description>The Resolve Tibet Bill, signed into law by US President Joe Biden, expresses bipartisan support for Tibetan human rights and recognizes the historical inaccuracies of China's claims of Tibet's ancient ties to the country.  

The bill, however, reiterates the US's "One-China Policy," potentially undermining its effectiveness in achieving genuine autonomy for Tibet.  China vehemently protests the bill, reaffirming Tibet's status as an "inalienable part" of China. The Dalai Lama advocates for a middle-way approach, seeking autonomy within China, while emphasizing the need for international law and recognition of Tibet's historical status as an independent state.  There are concerns over increasing repression in Tibet, including the recent closure of a prominent Tibetan vocational high school.  India, with its ongoing border dispute with China, has a crucial role to play in any future negotiations regarding Tibet's fate.  Observers believe that Tibetans should consider India as a key partner in their discussions with China.</description>

			<title>Chinese checkers in West Asia: Why peace remains elusive in Gaza</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinese-checkers-in-west-asia-why-peace-remains-elusive-in-gaza-13797760.html</link>
			<description>The recent developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, marked by China hosting Palestinian factions and Netanyahu's address in Washington, highlight contrasting approaches to peace. 

China, seeking to position itself as a mediator, is working towards Palestinian unity, aiming for a unified approach under the PLO. This while Israel, led by Netanyahu, continues to focus on security concerns and firmly opposes any handover of Gaza to Hamas.  The US, though officially supporting the Two-State Solution, has faced challenges in achieving progress due to intransigence on both sides. 

While Netanyahu successfully garnered support in the US Congress by emphasizing Israelâ€™s security needs, Senator Sanders remained critical of both Netanyahu and US policies. 

China's efforts could potentially shift the balance, but achieving a lasting peace remains a complex challenge demanding nuanced solutions and compromise from all involved parties.</description>

			<title>Modernisation and aatmanirbharta: Decoding the defence budget allocation 2024</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/modernisation-and-aatmanirbharta-decoding-the-defence-budget-allocation-2024-13797711.html</link>
			<description>India's FY 2024-25 defence budget stands at Rs. 6.21 lakh crore, a slight decrease compared to the interim budget. Despite this, it remains the highest allocation among all ministries at 13% of the total budget.  New Delhi aims to boost domestic defence manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports. 

Recent years have seen a push towards indigenisation with over 12,300 items already localised. India's defence exports reached Rs. 21,083 crore in FY 2023-24, a significant increase. The government aims to raise military hardware exports to Rs. 50,000 crore by 2028-29. 



Experts suggest increasing the defence budget to at least 25% of the total expenditure to meet the country's security challenges, including those posed by China and regional instability. The author also highlights the need to separate pay allowances and pensions from the core defence budget for better allocation and growth in the sector.</description>

			<description>Pakistan continues to promote terrorism against India while facing its own internal security challenges.  Despite facing economic difficulties and a resurgence of terrorism in regions like Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, Pakistan remains committed to using terrorism as a tool against India. 

Recent terrorist attacks in Pakistan have highlighted the country's internal security struggles. This, however, hasn't deterred Pakistan from its anti-India stance. Army officials, while emphasizing their ongoing efforts against terrorists, have also raised concerns about the negative impact of "digital terrorism" and accused India of seeking to exploit Pakistan's vulnerabilities.  Despite India's increasing focus on China as a strategic rival, Pakistan continues to view India as its primary concern. Experts argue that normalizing relations with India is crucial for Pakistan's future, as its ongoing enmity with India hinders its economic, social, and political progress.</description>

			<title>How DRDOâ€™s successful Ballistic Missile Defence test is critical to Indiaâ€™s security</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-drdos-successful-ballistic-missile-defence-test-is-critical-to-indias-security-13797658.html</link>
			<description>India successfully conducted a flight test of its Phase-2 Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system on July 24, 2024. This test demonstrated India's capability to intercept incoming ballistic missiles within a short timeframe of four minutes, highlighting the system's rapid detection, tracking, and decision-making capabilities.  

The BMD program comprises two components: a exo-atmospheric system (Prithvi Air Defence or PAD) and an endo-atmospheric system (Advanced Air Defence or AAD). The  Phase-2 test involved the AD-2 interceptor missile successfully intercepting the target missile at an altitude of less than 15 km.  

This development is crucial given India's security concerns from neighboring nuclear-armed nations, Pakistan and China. 



This success, combined with the procurement of Russian S-300 and S-400 missile defense systems, significantly bolsters India's defense capabilities and strategic posture.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-trumps-return-to-white-house-can-change-dynamics-in-west-asia-and-europe-13797343.html</link>
			<description>Given the current political climate and recent events, Donald Trump's potential return to the White House in November is likely to significantly influence US foreign policy. 

Analyst anticipate greater focus on  relations with China, potentially leading to trade tensions and a shift away from  priorities in Europe and the Middle East. Regarding the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, Trump might prioritize negotiations to end the conflict, potentially reducing US military support for Ukraine.

In the Middle East, a second Trump presidency could see continued backing for Israel, a harder line against Iran, and further escalation of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/global-blind-spot-chinas-uyghur-crisis-and-the-smokescreen-of-anti-india-propaganda-13797308.html</link>
			<description>China is expanding its surveillance and suppression of Muslims, starting with practices in Xinjiang and now targeting the Hui community in mainland China. This campaign, called "Sinification," aims to diminish cultural and religious distinctions among minorities and promote a unified national identity. The tactics include restricting religious practices, monitoring youth, and forbidding headscarves for civil servants. This escalation follows a pattern of previous persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, where over a million have been detained in "re-education camps" and subjected to indoctrination, torture, and forced renunciations of their faith.  Despite the human rights abuses, China deflects criticism by leveraging its economic power and investments in Muslim-majority nations.  The international community must hold China accountable not only through words but also through concrete actions that support the Uyghur people's rights to freedom and dignity.</description>

			<title>The spillover impact of student protests in Bangladesh and implications for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-spillover-impact-of-student-protests-in-bangladesh-and-implications-for-india-13797236.html</link>
			<description>Student-led protests erupted in Bangladesh following the Supreme Courtâ€™s reinstatement of a controversial 30% quota for government jobs reserved for descendants of 1971 Liberation War freedom fighters. 

The protests, which have turned violent, leading to deaths and injuries, demand the permanent scrapping of the quota system and accountability from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The government responded with internet shutdowns, mobile network restrictions, and curfews, while also detaining prominent protesters and opposition leaders. 

The protests have impacted trade between India and Bangladesh, prompting the Indian government to advise its nationals and facilitate the return of over 4,500 Indians. India has also heightened security along its border with Bangladesh amid concerns about spillover effects. The situation has raised questions about the future of Bangladesh's internal stability and its relationship with India, particularly in light of Chinaâ€™s growing influence in the region.</description>

			<title>25 years of Kargil: Lessons on high altitude aerial combat against a bigger enemy this time</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/25-years-of-kargil-lessons-on-high-altitude-aerial-combat-against-a-bigger-enemy-this-time-13797181.html</link>
			<description>The Kargil conflict serves as a prototype for India's potential future battlefield scenario against China. The conflict highlighted weaknesses in India's intelligence gathering and preparedness, particularly regarding Pakistan's infiltration plans. Despite initial setbacks and losses, the Indian Air Force (IAF) adapted its strategy, utilizing precision bombing techniques with laser-guided bombs and achieving decisive victories. 

The Kargil War led to a comprehensive review of India's national security apparatus, resulting in the establishment of several key institutions and upgrades to military capabilities.  

India faces a significant challenge in closing its military capability gap with China, especially in air power.  While China is rapidly modernizing its military, India has experience operating in high-altitude environments and has been actively upgrading its fleet of fighter jets, transport aircraft, and missile systems. To effectively counter potential Chinese aggression, India must further strengthen its ISR capabilities, expand its fighter squadron strength, improve air defense systems, and invest in a robust drone fleet.</description>

			<title>Ramification | Bangladeshâ€™s quota protests: A test for Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s leadership</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-bangladeshs-quota-protests-a-test-for-sheikh-hasinas-leadership-13797034.html</link>
			<description>Protests in Bangladesh over a reinstated quota system, which reserves government jobs for certain groups, have escalated into violence, leaving over 150 dead. The protests began after the High Court reinstated the quota system, but the Supreme Court later suspended the order.  

The situation has been inflamed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's use of the term "Razakar" â€“ a derogatory term for those who sided with Pakistan during Bangladesh's independence war â€“ to describe the protestors, who are mostly students. 

The protests have presented an opportunity for the Opposition to criticize Sheikh Hasina's government, and many Opposition leaders have been arrested.  The resurgence of Jamaat-e-Islami, a proscribed outfit with transnational links and opposition to Bangladesh's creation, has raised concerns about the potential threat to regional peace and security.  

India, meanwhile, is watching the developments closely, concerned about the potential impact on its own security and its Act East Policy.</description>

			<title>Great power politics: BRI and IMEEC at the crossroads of global influence</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/great-power-politics-bri-and-imeec-at-the-crossroads-of-global-influence-13797030.html</link>
			<description>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the India, Middle East, Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) are major economic initiatives that reflect the changing global power dynamics. China's BRI aims to reshape the global order, while the US-backed IMEEC seeks to counter China's influence.  

The rise of China and its economic ambitions have led to a shift in international relations, with the US employing strategies like IMEEC to maintain its hegemony. While both initiatives share goals of connectivity and economic growth, IMEEC might be more successful due to the US's democratic values, transparent financial sector, and global trust. Conversely, BRI faces accusations of debt-trap diplomacy and a lack of transparency.  India has positioned itself outside both frameworks, advocating for a more inclusive world order.</description>

			<title>Reality check: Can India do anything about American interference in politics?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/reality-check-can-india-do-anything-about-american-interference-in-politics-13796897.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the influence of the West, particularly the US, on Indian politics through cultural means.  The author argues that the US uses its soft power to promote its agenda by inviting and cultivating relationships with Indian influencers who are critical of the current Indian government. The article compares this to past instances of Western influence, citing examples of the Soviet Union and American involvement in India during the Emergency.

Despite acknowledging the challenges, the author suggests that India can use its global Indian community as a counter-force,  highlighting their influence in various fields. The article concludes by emphasizing the ongoing cultural war being waged by the West and the need for India to develop its own strategies to counter it.</description>

			<title>Is Iraq the missing piece in Indiaâ€™s corridor strategy?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/is-iraq-the-missing-piece-in-indias-corridor-strategy-13796760.html</link>
			<description>India unveiled the India-Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEEC), aiming to establish a trade route connecting India to Europe via the UAE, the Mediterranean, and onwards. However, this route faces concerns, particularly from Iran, which sees IMEEC as a threat to its economic influence through the International North-South Transport Corridor. 

The article advocates for India to consider Iraq as a strategic alternative for trade security. Historically, India and Iraq have shared strong ties, evident in the large number of Indian laborers and expatriates working in various sectors of Iraq. The trade volume between the two nations has also doubled since 2020.  

With Iraq enjoying increased stability and a dynamic business environment, the article proposes that India should strengthen its presence there. This includes fostering educational exchanges between universities, encouraging Indian businesses to participate directly in Iraqi projects, and exploring a third trade route through the country.</description>

			<title>Chinaâ€™s inward turn: A path to stability or stagnation?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-inward-turn-a-path-to-stability-or-stagnation-13796645.html</link>
			<description>China's recent economic and political events highlight growing instability within the country. Although pushing for self-reliance and national security, China's export-driven economy faces resistance globally and weak domestic consumption. This, coupled with a struggling property market and persistent corruption in the military, raises concerns about China's future stability.  

Despite recent purges aimed at addressing corruption, the Chinese military appears to be compromised. The Belt and Road Initiative, once a symbol of China's global ambitions, is now facing backlash. While China attempts to maintain a facade of strength, its leadership faces serious challenges balancing economic growth with political control. This inward focus risks jeopardizing essential international partnerships and could ultimately stifle China's economic success.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/jammu-terror-attacks-time-to-plug-security-loopholes-and-send-pakistan-a-strong-message-13796485.html</link>
			<description>The article honors Captain Brijesh Thapa, one of four soldiers killed in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir.  Brijesh, a third-generation Army officer, embodied the spirit of the Indian Army, prioritizing his country and his unit's safety above all else. The article recounts his father's heartfelt tribute and the somber funeral ceremony. 

It explores the ethos of the Indian Army, citing several other fallen soldiers like Lieutenant Manoj Pandey and Captain Vikram Batra, who exemplified bravery and selflessness. The author emphasizes the importance of remembering these sacrifices and urges the government to address the underlying causes of terrorism and strengthen security measures to prevent future incidents.</description>

			<description>Facing mounting pressure and declining popularity, Joe Biden finally withdrew from the presidential race on July 21st. His decision came after a series of events, including a poor debate performance, concerns about his physical and cognitive health, and a poll indicating his loss in November.  Public figures like George Clooney and endorsements being withheld by key donors further pressured Biden to reconsider.  Following the July 13th assassination attempt on Donald Trump, which bolstered the Republican's standing, and a diagnosis of COVID-19, Biden made the announcement. 

He endorsed his Vice President, Kamala Harris, who has since received widespread support from fellow Democrats, including prominent figures like Bill and Hillary Clinton. While Harris is seen as the presumptive nominee, the lack of a transparent and competitive primary process has been viewed by some as a missed opportunity.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024 creates a template for reforms in Modi 3.0</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-creates-a-template-for-reforms-in-modi-3-0-13796349.html</link>
			<description>The Union Budget focuses on five key areas: fiscal discipline, capital expenditure, regulatory simplification, job creation, and next-generation reforms. 

The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9 per cent of GDP in FY25 and further to 4.5 per cent or less by FY26.  A significant portion of the budget, Rs 11,11,111 crore, is allocated to capital expenditure to leverage the multiplier effect of infrastructure development.

The budget emphasizes streamlining regulations and simplifying policies to improve the ease of doing business and living.  

Job creation is prioritized through an Employment Linked Incentive scheme with targeted initiatives to provide incentives for both employers and employees.


Finally, the budget outlines reforms for next-generation economic enhancements, focusing on land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship, and leveraging technology to stimulate high growth and employment.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024: A progressive approach to growth and welfare</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-a-progressive-approach-to-growth-and-welfare-13796198.html</link>
			<description>The Union Budget for FY 2024-25 emphasizes a balanced approach, combining high capital expenditure with substantial welfare spending. This strategy aims to maintain robust GDP growth while keeping the fiscal deficit in check. Despite global economic uncertainties, India's economy remains a bright spot, with low and stable inflation.

The budget prioritizes inclusive growth, focusing on the well-being of the poor, women, youth, and farmers. A key highlight is the Prime Minister's package, which encompasses five schemes to enhance employment, skilling, and opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over five years. 

The allocation of Rs 1.48 lakh crore to education, employment, and skilling demonstrates the government's commitment to building a future-ready workforce.   Through internships, employment-linked incentives, and skill loans, the government aims to empower youth, increase access to education, and generate new job opportunities. This forward-looking approach positions India for continued economic growth and development.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024: Constructive welfare and not sops is the mantra for Viksit Bharat</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-constructive-welfare-and-not-sops-is-the-mantra-for-viksit-bharat-13796108.html</link>
			<description>The budget focuses on a steady growth trajectory of 7% per year to achieve "Viksit Bharat" by 2047. It emphasizes a strong foundation through enabling measures rather than populist handouts. The government aims to improve farm income, youth skills, and create employment opportunities. The fiscal deficit is projected to be 4.9% of GDP, a commendable figure likely to attract foreign investment.  Tax on foreign companies has been reduced to match Indian domestic companies. 

Infrastructure allocation remains steady, and minor changes to personal income tax will benefit the middle class.  Capital gains tax adjustments, while minimal, raise concerns about future potential hikes. 

The focus on rural development, agriculture, and skilling is notable, with specific investments in natural farming, pulses and shrimp farming. The budget also aims to support the MSME sector and improve digital public infrastructure.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024 lays blueprint for Viksit Bharat: Centre is facilitator, private sector, MSMEs drivers of growth</title>

			<description>The recent budget prioritizes government facilitation over direct financial responsibility.  Instead of grants or investments, the government aims to incentivize and guarantee, as seen with potential loans for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. 

Similar approaches apply to youth employment, with incentives for employers and employees over direct job provision. The  MSME sector receives loan guarantee schemes.  To further illustrate this approach, the governmentâ€™s new internship initiative involves no direct financial burden, instead relying on companies to utilise their CSR funds for training and allowances. This budget signals a shift towards facilitating growth rather than directly funding it.</description>

			<title>Eco Survey 2024: Amid high growth Indiaâ€™s future appears bright, but a â€˜grand allianceâ€™ to tame unemployment is required</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/eco-survey-2024-amid-high-growth-indias-future-appears-bright-but-a-grand-alliance-to-tame-unemployment-is-required-13795928.html</link>
			<description>The Economic Survey of 2023-24 highlights both positive and concerning aspects of the Indian economy.  While the nation boasts a strong and stable economy, with projected growth between 6.5-7% and controlled inflation, there are significant challenges. Private sector capital formation remains slower than desired, foreign direct investment may face headwinds, and employment remains a concern. 

The survey acknowledges the lack of reliable data on job creation, which hinders a clear understanding of the labor market situation. It emphasizes the need for a "grand alliance" between the central government, state governments, and the private sector to address these challenges and promote sustained high growth.  This alliance would focus on boosting private sector job creation, particularly in manufacturing and services, and fostering innovation through collaboration between governments, the private sector, and academia.</description>

			<title>US Sutra | Biden withdraws from presidential race, but road remains bumpy for Democrats</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/biden-withdraws-from-presidential-race-but-road-remains-bumpy-for-democrats-13795718.html</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden unexpectedly announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.  The decision came 100 days before the election, after calls from within the party for Biden to step down, and follows Donald Trump's announced candidacy and selection of JD Vance as his running mate. 

While Biden cited fulfilling his current duties as president as his reason for withdrawing, the move leaves Democrats scrambling to prepare for the November election. Harris, who will face scrutiny over her record and performance as vice president, is now the frontrunner but faces an uphill battle against the popular Trump.  
 
Many Democrats expressed disappointment with the late announcement, while Republicans seized the opportunity to attack Biden and his legacy. Trump, in particular, remained critical of the former president.  Despite the support of some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the move has created uncertainty and divisions within the party.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-empowering-women-farmers-with-technology-to-transform-indias-agricultural-economy-13795665.html</link>
			<description>This article stresses the importance of empowering women in agriculture through technology to achieve a more equitable and sustainable food system. It highlights the significant contributions of women in agriculture despite facing systemic barriers in accessing resources, technology, education, and financial services. 

The article argues that bridging the technological gap for women farmers is crucial for boosting productivity, increasing incomes, and ensuring their full participation in the agricultural sector's growth. It emphasizes the need for targeted policy interventions, including gender-sensitive credit facilities, training programs, and inclusive extension services, to address these disparities. The authors also advocate for increased women's representation in decision-making processes within agricultural institutions.</description>

			<title>The horror of Razakars haunts Bangladesh again</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-horror-of-razakars-haunts-bangladesh-again-13795631.html</link>
			<description>Protests in Bangladesh over the quota system in government jobs have turned violent, resulting in numerous casualties and arson attacks. The High Court's decision to restore a quota for the families of freedom fighters sparked the unrest. 

The Supreme Court later reduced the quota, but protests continue, fueled by inflammatory rhetoric that invokes the term "Razakar," a derogatory term for pro-Pakistani collaborators during the 1971 Liberation War. 

Critics accuse the protesters of being politically motivated and aim to discredit the Awami League government. The violence spread beyond Bangladesh, with incidents reported in the UK and UAE.</description>

			<title>Microsoft's July 19 global outage highlights the critical need for stringent quality checks</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/microsofts-july-19-global-outage-highlights-the-critical-need-for-stringent-quality-checks-13795550.html</link>
			<description>A recent global IT disruption, affecting airlines, banks, and other sectors, was caused by a logical error in Crowdstrike's Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. The error, stemming from a configuration file update, caused Windows systems to crash repeatedly, resulting in a widespread Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).  While EDR solutions are designed to protect against evolving cyber threats by monitoring for suspicious behaviors, the Crowdstrike incident highlights the critical need for rigorous quality checks in software development. A misstep in the kernel-level code of the EDR sensor triggered the system crashes, showcasing the potential for even seemingly minor errors to have cascading consequences. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of balancing speed of deployment with stringent quality assurance, especially in critical IT infrastructure.</description>

			<title>The ICJ ruling on Gaza war and imbecility of rules-based order</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-icj-ruling-on-gaza-war-and-imbecility-of-rules-based-order-13795484.html</link>
			<description>The ongoing wars in Eurasia and the Middle East highlight the failure of the international rules-based order. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently ruled that Israel's settlement in the West Bank is illegal, but this advisory ruling is unlikely to change the situation on the ground. Both Israel and Hamas face limitations and challenges, and the region faces a volatile future with the potential for war to expand.  Efforts for a ceasefire remain stalled due to lack of determination, equity, and enforceability.  Millions are displaced, and countless lives are lost, with civilian casualties increasing the risk of further radicalization. The economic consequences are also significant, impacting countries beyond the immediate conflict zone.   Ultimately, there is no clear winner in this conflict, and the situation poses a major challenge for the international community.</description>

			<title>Sanity prevailed: Karnataka has done right thing by hitting pause button on local job quota bill</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/karnataka-has-paused-local-job-quota-bill-a-right-step-13795355.html</link>
			<description>The article criticizes employment reservation laws, using the example of Haryana's 2020 Act and Karnataka's recently proposed bill. It argues that such laws are unconstitutional, deter foreign investment, hinder labor market flexibility, and stifle innovation. 

The author points to the success of Silicon Valley, fueled by immigration, as a counterpoint to the argument for local employment reservation.  The article suggests that open labor markets, allowing for skilled workers from diverse backgrounds, are crucial for economic growth and innovation.  

It concludes by expressing relief that Karnataka has paused its bill, highlighting the damaging consequences of restricting talent based on residency.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/two-contrasting-museums-that-showcase-mumbais-spirit-13795346.html</link>
			<description>Mumbai offers a diverse range of exploration opportunities, including two contrasting museums.

			<title>Budget 2024: Time to propel â€˜Skill Indiaâ€™ as an employment engine</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-time-to-propel-skill-india-as-an-employment-engine-13795326.html</link>
			<description>The upcoming Union Budget is expected to focus on skill development and employment, recognizing the need for a skilled workforce in key sectors. The government aims to empower vulnerable populations through skill training, particularly school dropouts, to address the unemployment crisis and drive economic growth.  

However, concerns exist regarding the effectiveness of existing programs like Skill India, with issues like delayed implementation and a lack of placement support. Data reveals a rising number of educated unemployed individuals, highlighting the urgency for concrete measures to bridge the skill gap. Experts emphasize the need to align skill development with industry demands, improve job-focused education, and prioritize upskilling initiatives for gig workers.  A significant budget allocation for skills training, especially for disadvantaged youth, is crucial for  India's economic growth and social empowerment.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-long-is-the-long-arm-of-the-american-deep-state-13795297.html</link>
			<description>The attempted assassination of Donald Trump raises significant questions about security in the US.  It marks the first known attempt on someone aligned with the presidency since John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The incident brings renewed focus to America's "gun culture" and the Second Amendment. Trump supporters allege involvement of a "Deep State," echoing claims about the Kennedy assassination. This incident, coinciding with President Biden's recent COVID-19 diagnosis, further complicates the upcoming election.  While the assassin's motive remains unclear,  concerns linger about the potential for further violence and the implications for American democracy.</description>

			<title>Skyfall: The assassinâ€™s bullet that Donald Trump dodged with minimal damage has hit Joe Biden instead</title>

			<description>Last week, the US political landscape was dramatically reshaped. Donald Trump, after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt, emerged with a renewed image of invincibility, further galvanizing the Republican Party at its convention in Milwaukee. In contrast, President Joe Biden faced a mounting internal rebellion within his own party, with increasing calls for him to step down due to concerns over his age and declining mental acuity, exacerbated by a series of recent gaffes.

Democratic megadonors are threatening to withhold funding, and even influential figures like former President Barack Obama have expressed concerns about Biden's ability to win the upcoming election. 

Despite the pressure, Biden remains defiant, refusing to concede.  Meanwhile, Trump, capitalizing on his perceived resilience, is experiencing a surge in both grassroots support and financial contributions, with notable figures like Elon Musk pledging significant donations to his campaign. These powerful opposing narratives, one of resilience and comeback, the other of decline and internal conflict, effectively capture the unsettling dynamic unfolding in American politics.</description>

			<title>Why India can neither shun Russia nor ignore West</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-can-neither-shun-russia-nor-ignore-west-13795128.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's relations with Russia and the West, particularly in the context of the ongoing Ukraine war. Western criticism of India's continued engagement with Russia has been met with confusion and frustration in India.  The article argues that India's approach to balancing its relationship with both sides is driven by strategic interests, recognizing Russia's regional importance and the West's significant economic and political influence. While acknowledging the limitations of its relationship with Russia, particularly in terms of economic depth and future prospects, India is determined to maintain its autonomy and protect its interests.  The author cautions against both underestimating Russia's potential for disruption and overestimating India's power on the world stage, emphasizing the need for pragmatic diplomacy and focusing on India's internal development.</description>

			<title>Terror attacks in Jammu: Time to understand Pakistanâ€™s deep-seated anti-India mindset</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/terror-attacks-in-jammu-role-of-pakistan-in-militancy-in-jammu-and-kashmir-13795121.html</link>
			<description>This article analyzes the recent surge in terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, arguing that India's strategy towards Pakistan is fundamentally flawed.  

The author contends that India has traditionally underestimated Pakistan's motivations and capabilities, viewing the conflict as primarily geopolitical rather than religious. This has led to diplomatic miscalculations and a failure to grasp the depth of Pakistan's commitment to the "jihad" against India. 

He highlights Pakistan's extensive network of terror groups, their support system within Kashmir, and their ability to adapt tactics over time.  The author argues that the recent upsurge is not isolated but part of a long-term strategy by Pakistan to destabilize India.  He emphasizes the importance of a long-range vision, strategic understanding, and a lasting solution to the Pakistan problem to effectively counter this persistent threat.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024: Optimising resources for better educational outcomes</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-optimising-resources-for-better-educational-outcomes-13795085.html</link>
			<description>India faces a learning crisis where, despite increased education spending, many children lack fundamental reading and math skills.  

The NIPUN Bharat Mission aims to improve foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) by 2026. However, inefficient funding disbursement and a limited focus on impactful areas hinder its success. 

To maximize the mission's impact, the government should shift to three-year rolling disbursements, allowing states more time for effective planning and resource utilization.  Further, states should prioritize investments in early childhood education, teacher training, school-based assessments, and awareness campaigns.  
 
 Enhancing early childhood education, training teachers, utilizing data-driven assessments, and fostering public awareness are key to ensuring every child achieves FLN proficiency and contributes to national development.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/nepal-has-a-new-prime-minister-and-it-may-be-good-news-for-china-13795067.html</link>
			<description>KP Sharma Oli has been sworn in as the Prime Minister of Nepal for his fourth term, leading a coalition government with the Nepali Congress. Known for his anti-India and pro-China stance, Oli aims to strengthen ties with Beijing. He has a history of escalating tensions with India, particularly over border issues and Tibet.  

China views Nepal as strategically important due to its proximity to Tibet, where it seeks to suppress Tibetan independence movements. Oli's government is expected to push for closer alignment with China's Belt and Road Initiative and its Global Security Initiative, potentially causing friction with the US and India. The US, meanwhile, seeks to counter China's influence in the region through support for Tibetan rights and initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which China sees as a challenge to its regional strategy.</description>

			<title>Beyond third plenum: Chinaâ€™s slowing economy demands a more consensus-based approach from Beijing</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-third-plenum-chinas-slowing-economy-demands-a-more-consensus-based-approach-from-beijing-13795041.html</link>
			<description>China's economic slowdown is a major concern, marking a shift from its previous double-digit growth.  The country's GDP growth is projected to decline to 4.5 percent this fiscal year and further to 3 percent by 2029. The real estate sector, once a major driver of the Chinese economy, is in distress.  Government stimulus measures haven't been successful in reviving demand. 

Global factors, including a high trade deficit and international backlash against China's geopolitical actions, are also contributing to the slowdown. China's reliance on low-cost labor is diminishing, and its aging population poses a significant challenge. 

President Xi Jinping's strategy for reform focuses on high-quality development through advanced manufacturing and technology. However, China faces challenges in competing in the global market for high-tech products. Its aggressive foreign policy has also strained relationships with key trading partners like India.</description>

			<title>How Chinaâ€™s growing clout in South Caucasus can be challenging for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-chinas-growing-clout-in-south-caucasus-can-be-challenging-for-india-13794912.html</link>
			<description>Recent developments in the South Caucasus, particularly China's growing involvement, have significant geopolitical implications. China's direct flight from Urumqi to Yerevan highlights its increasing presence in the region, seen as a counter to US influence. 

China's strong ties with Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iran, coupled with substantial economic investments, position it as a major player. India's interests in the region hinge on realizing the potential of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and mitigating the influence of Turkey, Pakistan, and China. 

China's support for a rival corridor route through Zangezur, backed by Turkey, threatens India's connectivity goals. Amidst this complex landscape, Russia could emerge as a potential ally for India, given its strong regional standing and influence.</description>

			<title>A risky bet: Should India go ahead with the Teesta project with Bangladesh?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/a-risky-bet-should-india-go-ahead-with-the-teesta-project-with-bangladesh-13794820.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's recent diplomatic push for funding in China was met with a limited response, prompting her to look towards India for financial support for the Teesta River redevelopment project.  Should India agree to this project, it would not only address long-standing water-sharing disputes but also foster greater economic and infrastructural integration between the two nations. However, India must carefully balance the economic and diplomatic benefits with potential domestic political repercussions and the risks associated with Bangladesh's economic vulnerabilities and ongoing socio-political challenges, including a rising radical Islamic population. Despite these complexities, strategic engagement with Bangladesh through the Teesta project presents a valuable opportunity for India to consolidate its regional influence.</description>

			<title>From â€˜non-Articâ€™ to â€˜near-Arcticâ€™: Growing China Factor in the India-Russia Far East cooperation</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-non-artic-to-near-arctic-growing-china-factor-in-the-india-russia-far-east-cooperation-13794736.html</link>
			<description>The 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit between Russia and India emphasized cooperation in trade, economic, and investment spheres, especially in the Russian Far East and Arctic regions.  

This summit comes amidst heightened activity and geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic, driven by climate change and resource competition.  

While Russia is seeking closer ties with China, India is striving to balance its relationship with both nations. 

China's increasing presence in the Arctic through investments, research stations, and diplomatic outreach has raised concerns among Western nations, including the US, which views it as a potential challenge to its interests. India, with its Arctic policy and existing diplomatic relations with Arctic Council members, can play a stabilizing role in the region.  

India recognizes the opportunity the Arctic presents for securing access to critical minerals and aims to engage actively in Arctic affairs through a "Whole of Government Approach"  to  maximize its potential benefits.</description>

			<title>Amid hope for change, can Iranâ€™s new President revive nuclear deal with West?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/amid-hope-for-change-can-irans-new-president-revive-nuclear-deal-with-west-13794716.html</link>
			<description>Iran held presidential elections in July 2024, resulting in the victory of Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist and former health minister. Pezeshkian's election signals a shift from hardline conservatives and brings optimism about reviving the Iran nuclear deal.  

Javed Zarif, Pezeshkian's likely foreign minister and a key player in the 2015 nuclear deal, is expected to lead these efforts. Despite Iran upholding its nuclear commitments after the U.S. withdrawal in 2018, it has since increased uranium enrichment, raising concerns. Complicating the situation is the ongoing war in Gaza, strained U.S.-Iran relations, and potential geopolitical shifts in the region.

Although the previous rounds of talks made progress, the revival faces challenges, including U.S. sanctions on Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and disputes over Iran's ballistic missile program. Despite these hurdles, President Pezeshkian and Zarif seek to alleviate economic sanctions and restore stability through diplomatic channels.  The success of these efforts remains uncertain due to various political and regional factors.</description>

			<title>Head-on | Trump assassination bid could embolden anti-India forces</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-trump-assassination-bid-could-embolden-anti-india-forces-13794632.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rise of toxic politics in both the US and India, exemplified by verbal attacks against political figures like Donald Trump and Narendra Modi. 

It highlights concerns about the escalating rhetoric and its potential to incite violence, citing recent incidents in the US and UK. The author argues that this negativity can be harmful to both the attackers and the attacked, suggesting that focusing on issues and policy alternatives is a more productive approach. 


The article draws parallels between Trump's political strategy in the US and Modi's in India, both positioning themselves against established elites. It concludes by urging opposition parties in India to adopt a similar approach of focusing on issues rather than resorting to personal attacks.</description>

			<title>Dhaka Universityâ€™s â€˜revolutionaryâ€™ road: Agitation, violence not new on campus</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dhaka-universitys-revolutionary-road-agitation-violence-not-new-on-campus-13794524.html</link>
			<description>Following intense clashes on university campuses across Dhaka, the University Grants Commission has issued a closure order for all universities pending further instructions.  The protests erupted over job allocations, reignited when the High Court reinstated a quota system for children of freedom fighters, a system that was previously abolished in 2018. The Supreme Court has now suspended the High Court's order for four weeks. 

Dhaka University, at the heart of the violence, boasts a history intertwined with student activism and rebellion. Notable incidents include  the Language Movement of 1952, where the university played a pivotal role in securing Bangla as a state language, and the tragic events during the 1971 war of liberation where the Pakistani Army attacked the campus, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of students and faculty. 


Concerns are growing that the current unrest, stemming from the quota system, may be influenced by political agendas, taking advantage of student frustration with the government.</description>

			<title>Whoâ€™s the real fascist? Germanyâ€™s media crackdown exposes a double standard</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/whos-the-real-fascist-germanys-media-crackdown-exposes-a-double-standard-13794510.html</link>
			<description>Germany's left-leaning government, despite criticizing India for its alleged human rights violations, is cracking down on dissent within its own borders. The government shut down a right-wing magazine, Compact, labelling it anti-Semitic and raided its offices, freezing the bank accounts of its contributors. This action has sparked controversy, as it appears to contradict Germany's constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The government claims that Compact is a "nexus" for far-right extremist groups and poses a threat to the constitution. However, critics argue that the move is an attempt to silence opposition ahead of upcoming elections and suppress growing discontent with the government's handling of issues like immigration and the economy.</description>

			<title>Rising terror attacks in Jammu signal new threats</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/rising-terror-attacks-in-jammu-signal-new-threats-13793822.html</link>
			<description>Terrorist attacks in Jammu have risen sharply following the abrogation of Article 370, marking a shift in strategy from Pakistan-based groups.  Security agencies believe that multiple terrorist groups have infiltrated Jammu, potentially aiming to destabilize the region and disrupt upcoming assembly elections. This surge in violence is viewed as an attempt to revive terrorism in Jammu after a relative lull and to keep the Kashmir issue prevalent on the international stage. India is responding with increased security measures, including area dominance strategies, tightened border controls and operations against terrorist groups.  The government is also focusing on dismantling terrorist financing networks and curtailing support from local sources.</description>

			<title>Assassination bid makes Trump 2.0 all but certain</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/assassination-bid-makes-trump-2-0-all-but-certain-13794328.html</link>
			<description>An assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a Pennsylvania rally narrowly missed, killing one attendee and wounding two others. The incident occurred when an assailant, a registered Republican, fired at Trump from a nearby rooftop. While the Secret Service swiftly brought the situation under control, concerns were raised about a potential security lapse.  

The attack has sparked increased political tensions and is likely to impact the upcoming presidential race. Trump is expected to gain sympathy and support, potentially widening his lead over President Biden, who faces growing criticism over his age and handling of the presidency. Some Democrats, while loyal to Biden, suggest a need for a younger candidate to challenge Trump.</description>

			<title>Is China all set to overtake US in advanced technologies?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/is-china-all-set-to-overtake-us-in-advanced-technologies-13794141.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rapidly advancing technological power of China and its growing competition with the United States. It highlights various data points, including patent applications, research outputs, and manufacturing capabilities, to illustrate China's progress in key emerging technologies.

The report points to China's focus on government-backed research initiatives, a larger pool of STEM graduates, and a cost advantage that fuels its technological advancements. 

China is making significant strides in areas like high-speed rail, solar energy, electric vehicles, 6G communications, and even space and military technologies. While acknowledging the strength of American companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla, the article suggests that China is closing the gap and is on track to become a dominant force in global technology. 

The author emphasizes the Chinese government's long-term planning and its willingness to invest heavily in areas crucial for national development. China's rise as a technological power is seen as a major shift in global dynamics, challenging the US's long-held dominance and potentially leading to a multipolar world.</description>

			<title>Why no second chances for Vance?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-no-second-chances-for-vance-13794036.html</link>
			<description>JD Vance's nomination as Republican Vice Presidential candidate has sparked intense scrutiny and criticism from liberal commentators. Despite his disadvantaged background as a poor white man from the Rust Belt, Vance's rise to prominence, documented in his bestselling book "Hillbilly Elegy," resonates with a segment of American society often overlooked by mainstream media. 

Trump's selection of Vance, a young and unconventional candidate, signifies a generational shift within the Republican Party, aiming to appeal to younger voters, especially Gen Z and Millennials. Vance's outspoken stance on issues like Ukraine and his willingness to make provocative statements appeal to this demographic.  

Critics, however, point to Vance's past criticism of Trump and question his experience and qualifications. His selection highlights the internal divisions within the Republican Party and the ongoing battle between Trump's loyalists and his detractors. Vance's wife, Usha, who identifies as a Democrat and works in a "woke" law firm, adds another layer of complexity to his narrative, suggesting a nuanced perspective on politics and a potential bridge between different ideological camps.</description>

			<description>The recent attempted assassination of Donald Trump by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks resembles historical patterns of young individuals altering history through violence. The article draws parallels to Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, sparking World War I, and Fernand Bonnier de la Chapelle, who killed French collaborationist leader Francois Darlan in 1942.  The author speculates on the motivations behind such acts, suggesting that those deemed inconvenient by powerful figures may become targets for young, determined individuals. The article highlights  the lasting impact of these historical events and the recurring theme of young assassins influencing the course of history.</description>

			<description>A recent study highlighted the high sugar content in baby food products in developing countries compared to Europe. This raises concerns about children developing a taste for high sugar from a young age, leading to long-term health issues like obesity and type 2 diabetes. 

The study also points to the growing trend of ultra-processed food consumption in developing countries, driven by aggressive marketing by multinational corporations. These foods are often high in sugar, salt, and additives, contributing to the obesity epidemic and other health problems.  

The author calls on governments to strengthen regulatory frameworks for food products and encourage healthier dietary practices.</description>

			<description>The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump highlights the dangers of political revenge and the erosion of democratic norms.  The incident, occurring during a critical point in the election cycle where Trump's campaign was gaining momentum, raises concerns about the increasing acceptance of extreme measures in political discourse. 

This act of violence reflects a broader trend of escalating political extremism, fueled by deep divisions and intolerance. The incident underscores the fragility of democracy and the urgent need to protect democratic values, uphold the rule of law, and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. The author emphasizes the importance of civil discourse, respect for opposing viewpoints, and the media's responsibility to provide balanced and objective reporting to prevent further escalation of political violence.</description>

			<title>US Sutra | Donald Trumpâ€™s miraculous escape: Is the US presidential election a done deal</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-sutra-donald-trumps-miraculous-escape-is-the-us-presidential-election-a-done-deal-13793706.html</link>
			<description>On July 13th, a shooting occurred at one of Donald Trump's rallies in Pennsylvania. The former president was targeted by an assailant, who was subsequently shot and killed by law enforcement.  Though Trump sustained a minor injury, he continued his campaign and is now widely expected to secure the Republican nomination.

This incident has been likened to the 1981 assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, who went on to win re-election. 

The shooting has galvanized the Republican base, with many viewing Trump's resilience as a sign of strength and divine protection. It has also prompted questions about security at political events and the increasing polarization of American politics.</description>

			<description>In essence, the article highlights the contrast between Macron's failed attempt to emulate Charles de Gaulle and the enduring legacy of De Gaulle himself. 

Macron, despite aiming for the same kind of heroic image, falls short, failing to achieve the gravitas and lasting impact that De Gaulle possessed.

			<description>This article tells the story of a man who dedicated his life to helping road accident victims.

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/not-only-machines-but-men-behind-them-getting-indian-army-future-ready-13793530.html</link>
			<description>The Indian Army is undergoing a massive transformation, focusing on five pillars: force restructuring, efficiency, jointness, modernization, and human resource management. The article emphasizes the crucial role of technology in shaping future warfare, outlining its evolving impact from the Industrial Revolution to the 21st century.

It highlights technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous systems as defining features of contemporary conflicts.  Despite acknowledging the potential of these advancements, the article cautions against overreliance on technology, stressing that human factors like training, esprit de corps, and adaptability remain paramount.

The Indian Army faces the challenge of balancing cost-effective human resource reforms with investments in modernization, seeking the optimal allocation of resources to ensure future readiness without compromising on essential human elements.</description>

			<description>India is strengthening diplomatic ties with both Russia and the countries surrounding the Bay of Bengal.  PM Modi's recent visit to Moscow highlighted India's strategic partnership with Russia, aiming to counter Chinese influence in both Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is emerging as a key platform for India to build economic and political influence in the region. Through BIMSTEC, India seeks to create a trade corridor connecting South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, potentially rivaling China's growing economic footprint in the Indo-Pacific.</description>

			<title>Securing supply chains: Why critical minerals are important aspect of Indo-American partnership</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/securing-supply-chains-why-critical-minerals-are-important-aspect-of-indo-american-partnership-13793358.html</link>
			<description>The India-US partnership is being strengthened through the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) with a focus on critical minerals. This partnership aims to reduce reliance on imports and ensure a more secure supply chain for clean energy and defense sectors.

Both countries recognize the strategic importance of critical minerals, such as rare earth elements, lithium, and gallium.  

The US is increasing its capabilities in extracting and processing rare earth elements, while India is leveraging its substantial rare earth reserves and investing in research and development.

The iCET has led to initiatives like co-investments in lithium and rare earth projects, a bilateral critical minerals MoU, and advanced materials R&amp;D collaboration. This partnership is crucial for both nations to achieve self-reliance, enhance national security, and foster innovation in critical sectors.</description>

			<title>25 years of Kargil war: When Indian armed forces achieved near impossible</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/25-years-of-kargil-war-when-indian-armed-forces-achieved-near-impossible-13793301.html</link>
			<description>The Kargil conflict, which occurred in 1999, saw Pakistan infiltrate Indian territory across the Line of Control, prompting a fierce Indian response. Despite initial intelligence failures and limitations on military operations, Indian troops valiantly fought in the challenging mountainous terrain, culminating in the recapture of all lost positions. 

The conflict showcased the importance of airpower in high-altitude warfare, with the Indian Air Force carrying out targeted strikes and providing crucial support.  Pakistan's naval and air power remained subdued throughout the conflict.

The Kargil conflict solidified India's commitment to defend its sovereignty against any aggression, regardless of nuclear considerations.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/israel-lebanon-conflict-and-chances-of-a-full-scale-war-13793231.html</link>
			<description>The Israel-Lebanon conflict is a long-standing issue with roots dating back to Israel's creation. Cross-border tensions have escalated over the years, leading to multiple wars and interventions.  

Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia Islamist organization, has emerged as a key player, engaging in armed resistance against Israel and launching attacks. Recent events, including the 2023 Israel-Palestine conflict, have further intensified the situation. 

While a majority of Israelis favor an international political solution, a significant number support military action against Hezbollah. Israel's advanced weaponry and strong international alliances, including support from the United States, give it a military advantage. 

However, the unpredictable nature of war and the potential for international repercussions remain factors. The outcome of future developments in the Israel-Lebanon conflict remains uncertain.</description>

			<title>Trump assassination attempt: Why it's noteworthy for India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-lessons-for-india-13793174.html</link>
			<description>Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.  A gunman fired a shot that grazed his ear.  Despite the near-death experience, Trump remained defiant, calling for a fight amongst his supporters.  The incident has drawn attention to the toxic rhetoric surrounding Trump, particularly from his detractors who have repeatedly made threats against his life. Some commentators have observed that the media's portrayal of Trump as a dangerous figure may have contributed to the escalation of violence. The incident has also raised concerns about security for political figures, especially in a polarized political climate.</description>

			<title>Chinaâ€™s Panchsheel embrace: A smokescreen for aggression</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-panchsheel-embrace-a-smokescreen-for-aggression-13793123.html</link>
			<description>China recently hosted a conference to mark the platinum jubilee of the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence). Despite espousing these principles, China's actions, especially towards India, contradict its professed commitment.

China's occupation of Indian territories, its support for Pakistan's stance on Kashmir, and its aggressive posture towards India violate tenets of mutual respect, non-aggression, and peaceful coexistence. China's support for terrorism and its double standards on the issue further expose its hypocrisy. The author argues that China's current emphasis on the Panchsheel is merely a facade to deflect attention from its own wrongdoings and urges India to be wary of this tactic.</description>

			<description>Bhupinder Singh Rawat, nicknamed 'Scooter' for his exceptional speed, was a renowned Indian centre forward. Despite his short stature, he was incredibly agile and a threat to opposing defences. Rawat rose to prominence with the Gorkha Brigade, winning the Durand Cup in 1966 as the tournament's highest scorer.  He earned a place in the Indian team in 1969, showcasing his skills in the Merdeka Cup.  Known for his accuracy and placement, Rawat was a fan favourite who played for the Mafatlal football club for many years.  He passed away in June 2024, leaving behind a legacy as one of India's most talented and beloved footballers.</description>

			<title>Yes, Nehru played a role in Austriaâ€™s emergence as independent nation, but thatâ€™s just half the story</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/yes-nehru-played-a-role-in-austrias-emergence-as-independent-nation-but-thats-just-half-the-story-13792963.html</link>
			<description>After World War I, Austria became a landlocked country.  In the 1930s, with the rise of fascism, Austria saw a civil war and the formation of a fascist government.  Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, and the country became a key collaborator in the Nazi regime's crimes, including the construction of concentration camps like Mauthausen. 

Following the war, Austria promoted the "first victim" theory, claiming to have been merely occupied by the Nazis, thereby minimizing its role in the atrocities. This narrative was used to avoid reparations and accountability for Austria's actions.  Though now discredited, this theory persisted for decades,  leaving a complex and challenging legacy for Austria.</description>

			<title>Bloodied but unbeaten: Trump gets a shot at immortality</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/donald-trump-usa-assassination-attempt-13792934.html</link>
			<description>A recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania raises serious questions about security failings. While the Trump campaign alleges negligence within the Secret Service, the incident highlights a broader issue of political violence in the US, with a history of both successful and attempted assassinations targeting presidents, particularly Republicans.  This specific attack comes amidst heightened political tensions, with intense rhetoric against Trump from both political sides. The alleged shooter, a young man claiming Republican affiliation, fired several shots, injuring the Trump rally's attendees and narrowly missing the former president himself. The incident has sparked debate and scrutiny, with investigations underway and implications for the upcoming election.</description>

			<title>First anniversary of Chandrayaan-3 mission: When India pioneered landing on lunar south pole</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/first-anniversary-of-chandrayaan-3-mission-when-india-pioneered-landing-on-lunar-south-pole-13792950.html</link>
			<description>The Chandrayaan-3 mission, launched by India's Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2023, successfully landed a rover and lander system near the lunar south pole. This achievement made India the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and the first to land near the lunar south pole. 

Following a failed attempt during the Chandrayaan-2 mission in 2019, ISRO learned from its mistakes and designed a robust mission with multiple fail-safe measures.  The lander and rover functioned as intended for one lunar day, collecting valuable data on the lunar surface, including the confirmation of sulphur presence. 

The mission also detected calcium, aluminium, iron, titanium, manganese, chromium, and silicon. While the presence of oxygen was noted, conclusive findings regarding the presence of hydrogen are still pending analysis. ISRO aims to launch Chandrayaan-4, which will return lunar samples to Earth, in the coming years.</description>
