			<title>Why a Chinese report on American hands in regime changes is worth considering</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-a-chinese-report-on-american-hands-in-regime-changes-is-worth-considering-13806543.html</link>
			<description>The Chinese Foreign Ministry report "The National Endowment for Democracy: What It Is and What It Does?" criticizes the NED for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. 

The report alleges that the NED supports pro-US forces, manipulates elections, and incites division to undermine stability. It specifically accuses the NED of funding Uyghur and Tibetan groups considered anti-state by China, citing financial support to organizations like the World Uyghur Congress and individuals like Hidayet Oguzhan and Rushan Abbas. 

The report also highlights articles published in the Journal of Democracy, a publication associated with the NED, that question the effectiveness of Indian democracy. 


China calls on countries to be aware of the NED's true intentions and protect their national sovereignty and interests.</description>

			<title>How social inequality fuels ‘godmen’ culture</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-social-inequality-fuels-godmen-culture-13806496.html</link>
			<description>This article discusses the alarming rise of exploitative "godmen" in India,  highlighting their abuse of power and wealth. 

While India boasts genuine saints who promote inner peace and selflessness, a  disconcerting number of self-proclaimed gurus exploit poverty, caste inequality, and superstition for personal gain. 

Examples like Bhole Baba, Asaram Bapu, and Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh demonstrate how these figures amass wealth, influence, and impunity, often securing political protection despite accusations of sexual assault, murder, and other crimes.  The article argues that the root causes of this phenomenon are India's deep-seated social problems, including  caste discrimination and economic disparity, which make vulnerable populations susceptible to their manipulative tactics.  The author emphasizes the need for comprehensive social and economic reforms to address the underlying issues and prevent continued exploitation.</description>

			<title>Could Moneyball methodology improve Indian cricket?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/could-moneyball-methodology-improve-indian-cricket-13806487.html</link>
			<description>The Indian Premier League (IPL), a driving force behind India's cricketing success, uses awards and rankings to recognize player performance. However, the current system relies on limited and questionable metrics. 

Analyzing IPL data, a group of students developed a new Most Valuable Player (MVP) formula based on multivariate regression. This new system considers batting efficiency and consistency, bowling control and wicket-taking, and fielding impact, leading to a stronger correlation between MVP scores and team win percentages.  

The revised metrics highlight the importance of strike rate, economy rate, and fielding contributions, offering a more comprehensive assessment of player value. This Moneyball approach could elevate the competition within the IPL and potentially contribute to India's dominance in world cricket.</description>

			<title>Why Yunus’ government can’t overlook jihadi groups exploiting Bangladesh’s turmoil</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-yunus-government-cant-overlook-jihadi-groups-exploiting-bangladeshs-turmoil-13806417.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is facing a critical period of instability following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and the government's move to designate Islamist groups as militant organizations. This has led to violence, the resurgence of extremist groups like Jama'at Mujahideen Bangladesh and Ansar-al Islam, and a rise in sectarian tensions.

International players, including Pakistan and potentially the US, are suspected to be meddling in Bangladesh's internal affairs, seeking to exploit the situation for their strategic gains.  India, concerned about potential spillover effects on its security, needs to remain vigilant and supportive of efforts to maintain stability in Bangladesh.  


The situation highlights the fragility of Bangladesh's social fabric and the potential for further violence if extremist forces gain a foothold.</description>

			<title>South China Sea: How growing Chinese assertiveness finds strong Philippine response</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/south-china-sea-how-growing-chinese-assertiveness-finds-strong-philippine-response-13806334.html</link>
			<description>China and the Philippines continue to clash over territorial claims in the South China Sea, despite a recent understanding aimed at reducing tensions.  Chinese coast guard vessels are increasingly engaging in aggressive maneuvers around the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, including ramming and water cannon attacks on Philippine supply ships.  

China asserts historical sovereignty over the region, while the Philippines relies on the 2016 UNCLOS Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China's 9-dash-line claim. 

Recent developments, including a renewed Philippines-US Mutual Defence Treaty and a Philippine commitment to pursue lawful activities in the disputed waters, suggest the Philippines is taking a stronger stance against Chinese pressure. Beijing needs to adapt its strategy, recognizing the Philippines' increased assertiveness and the limitations of its deterrence tactics.</description>

			<title>Iran, Ukraine and now Bangladesh: How US ‘interventionism’ subverts democracy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/iran-ukraine-and-now-bangladesh-how-us-interventionism-subverts-democracy-13806128.html</link>
			<description>The article examines accusations of US covert regime change efforts in Bangladesh, focusing on the strategic motivation behind such actions and their potential consequences. 

The strategic importance of Bangladesh's location, particularly its ports and access to the Bay of Bengal, is highlighted as a reason for potential US interest in influencing the country's political landscape. The article draws comparisons to past US interventions, such as the 1953 coup in Iran and the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, emphasizing the potential for instability and unforeseen repercussions. 

Drawing on historical examples and academic research, the article argues that while regime change may seem like a strategic advantage in the short term, it often leads to long-term instability, weakens democratic institutions, and triggers resentment among the populace. 


Finally, the article underscores the potential risks this intervention poses to Bangladesh and the region, urging India and other stakeholders to closely monitor the situation and work towards maintaining regional stability.</description>

			<title>Can Ukraine’s Kursk offensive help Kyiv achieve strategic dividend?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-can-ukraines-kursk-offensive-help-kyiv-achieve-strategic-dividend-13806052.html</link>
			<description>Ukraine's surprise ground offensive into Russia's Kursk region has captured international attention. This audacious move, involving the seizure of significant territory, has shifted the narrative of the war and created a strategic dilemma for Russia. 

The Ukrainian operation raises several questions: What are Ukraine's aims - to weaken Russia's forces, gain leverage in potential negotiations, or something else?  How will Russia respond? Will it escalate the conflict, try to repel the incursion, or use the situation to pressure for negotiations?  The success of this operation, as well as its potential consequences, remains to be seen.</description>

			<title>The Hour of God: Jaishankar’s ‘grim forecast’ and time for India to uphold its values</title>

			<description>The article discusses the current global turmoil and draws parallels to a 1920s manuscript by Sri Aurobindo titled "The Hour of God." Sri Aurobindo predicted periods of upheaval where nations unprepared for change would suffer.  

The author cites events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Hamas war, and political instability in various regions as examples of this present crisis.  Echoing Sri Aurobindo, the article emphasizes the need for India to stay true to its values of personal freedom and decentralized governance, urging bold policies and increased innovation.  India is positioned to navigate this turbulent era by staying independent of global pressures and focusing on its own strengths.</description>

			<title>How hosting Olympics may not be a good option for India</title>

			<description>This article argues against India bidding to host the 2036 Olympics.  The author highlights the financial risks associated with hosting the Games, citing numerous examples of countries that have incurred massive debts, including Greece and Rio de Janeiro. 

They also point to the low likelihood of India, which currently wins few medals, being successful in hosting the Olympics profitably. Instead, the author proposes focusing on building grassroots sports infrastructure to develop a stronger sporting culture at the national level before considering a bid to host the Olympics.</description>

			<title>Why PM Modi's visit Ukraine and Poland will be closely watched</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pm-modis-visit-ukraine-and-poland-will-be-closely-watched-13805817.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine marks a significant diplomatic move, as it is the first time an Indian PM has visited Poland in 40 years. 

Modi aims to build stronger ties with both countries, focusing on defense and strategic alignment with Poland.  His visit to Ukraine follows a controversial trip to Russia, where he received Russia's highest civilian honor. 

India seeks to establish a mediating role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while also pursuing bilateral economic interests.  The relationship with Ukraine is marked by historical ties, trade agreements, and India's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. Meanwhile, India’s relationship with Poland is witnessing a resurgence, with increasing defense collaboration and trade partnerships.


Modi's visit comes at a delicate time, with Poland being a staunch supporter of Ukraine and critical of India's continued engagement with Russia.</description>

			<title>How American strategy of ‘colour revolutions’ teaches third-world democracies a lesson</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-american-strategy-of-colour-revolutions-teaches-third-world-democracies-a-lesson-13805774.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that US foreign policy, particularly its interventions in other countries, has often been detrimental.  

The author points to instances like Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iran, where US-backed regime changes resulted in instability and suffering. The piece criticizes the US for prioritizing its own interests over genuine diplomacy and supporting anti-government groups, even those with questionable backgrounds or ties to radical ideologies. 

The recent coup in Bangladesh is used as a case study, alleging that US involvement in undermining the elected government has contributed to a rise in extremism and instability in the region. Comparing the US approach to India’s more conservative foreign policy, the author suggests that the US’s focus on regime change often backfires, leaving countries worse off and serving its own strategic goals at the expense of democracy and human rights.</description>

			<description>The article discusses how Western media, driven by powerful interests, manipulates narratives to shape public opinion.  It highlights the speed and efficiency of this manipulation in the digital age, citing examples like the sudden change in portrayal of figures like Manuel Noriega and Sheikh Hasina.  The author argues that platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia, driven by algorithms and potentially biased editors, contribute to this process, creating a system of "truth by repeated assertion." The author concludes by advocating for a drastic solution, emulating the Chinese firewall to protect against Western influence and fostering indigenous knowledge systems.</description>

			<title>Why Sheikh Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh isn’t a realistic scenario</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-sheikh-hasinas-extradition-to-bangladesh-isnt-a-realistic-scenario-13805587.html</link>
			<description>Following a military-engineered coup, Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, sought refuge in India. Charges of murder and other crimes have been brought against her, but these lack substantial legal grounding and were filed after her departure.  India, which enjoys strong diplomatic ties with Bangladesh, is unlikely to extradite Hasina, given her past contributions to the country's stability and economic growth. India is also concerned about potential human rights violations and the safety of Bangladeshi Hindus following the coup. It remains to be seen how the new interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, will manage the situation and whether it has the legitimacy to pursue Hasina's extradition. India's position is crucial for Bangladesh's security and economic well-being, and any strain in relations could benefit rival powers.</description>

			<title>Let’s demand the end of child marriage: Our children are not for sale</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/lets-demand-the-end-of-child-marriage-our-children-are-not-for-sale-13805554.html</link>
			<description>India, despite its progress, remains home to the largest number of child brides globally, with one in three residing in the country. Child marriage, primarily affecting girls in rural areas and poorer households, leads to pregnancy complications, limited education opportunities, and long-term social and psychological consequences.  

While acknowledging government efforts to curb this practice, child rights activist Bhuwan Ribhu emphasizes the need for stronger legal action, societal awareness, and political will. He highlights the importance of investing in education for girls, prosecuting all those involved in child marriages, and creating a child-centric community. Ribhu proposes the PICKET strategy, focusing on Policy, Investment, Convergence, Knowledge, Ecosystem, and Technology, as a roadmap to end child marriage in India and ultimately contribute to a global solution.</description>

			<title>Japan: As Kishida steps down amid sinking popularity, LDP faces a leadership crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/japan-as-kishida-steps-down-amid-sinking-popularity-ldp-faces-a-leadership-crisis-13805547.html</link>
			<description>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), citing declining popularity and ongoing scandals as key factors. Kishida's approval ratings have plummeted to record lows, and his attempts to address internal party issues and financial irregularities have been met with public criticism. 

He hopes his resignation will pave the way for a new LDP leader with a fresh image to unite the party and improve its standing with voters ahead of the next general election in 2025. Several potential candidates, including former defense minister Ishiba Shigeru and current digital minister Kono Taro, are vying for the leadership position. The race is expected to be competitive, with the winner becoming the next prime minister of Japan due to the LDP's majority in the Diet.</description>

			<title>How partnering with India is the only viable choice in South Asia</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-partnering-with-india-in-south-asia-is-the-only-viable-choice-13805516.html</link>
			<description>Despite the instability in South Asia, India is experiencing economic growth and presents a significant opportunity for the region. India's robust 7% growth rate and strategic reforms are attracting foreign investment, making it a prime destination for businesses compared to its struggling neighbors. 

China's infrastructure-heavy investment model has proven ineffective, leaving countries like Pakistan with unsustainable debt.  Meanwhile, other South Asian nations like Bangladesh and Nepal face economic and political challenges.   Continued political resistance to collaborating with India risks perpetuating poverty in the region. Ultimately, engaging with India's economic prowess is essential for South Asian prosperity.</description>

			<title>How Sheikh Hasina’s ouster will impact India’s Act East policy</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-will-impact-indias-act-east-policy-13805507.html</link>
			<description>The recent change in leadership in Bangladesh, following a student-led upheaval, has significant strategic implications for India and the region.  The political instability stems from rising dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's authoritarianism and economic decline. This situation marks a departure from the strong civil-military relations Bangladesh has seen since its independence. 
The article highlights the country's long history of military intervention in politics and the challenges of defining national identity, particularly in terms of secularism versus Islamism.  The instability in Bangladesh could impact India-Bangladesh relations, potentially jeopardizing the progress made in trade, connectivity, and defence cooperation. Moreover, a destabilized Bangladesh could weaken BIMSTEC and pose a broader security challenge to India, as it borders five Indian states.</description>

			<title>Why ISRO’s third and final development flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle is significant</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-isros-third-and-final-development-flight-of-small-satellite-launch-vehicle-is-significant-13805371.html</link>
			<description>ISRO successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) on its third and final development flight, marking the vehicle as fully operational. This launch is significant as it allows ISRO to capture the growing market for launching small satellites, a niche previously served by the larger and more expensive Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). 

The SSLV-D3 mission carried the EOS-08 satellite, equipped with advanced technologies for surveillance, environmental monitoring, and future space missions.  It also carried a cubesat for Space Kidz India, promoting space awareness among students.  

This launch not only tests the SSLV's capabilities but also showcases ISRO's advancements in satellite bus systems and onboard technologies. The SSLV's quick turnaround time and ability to launch multiple satellites make it a valuable asset for both commercial and strategic purposes, opening new avenues for India's space program.</description>

			<title>Why India should worry about a Kamala Harris presidency</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-should-worry-about-a-kamala-harris-presidency-13805290.html</link>
			<description>A Harris presidency could significantly harm US-India relations, deviating from the bipartisan consensus that has characterized the relationship since 2001.  The author argues that Harris's potential foreign policy approach, influenced by the Democratic party's progressive wing and online activism, would prioritize Hinduphobia, denigration of Indian democracy, and Khalistan separatism, undermining the interests of Indian Americans who generally support strong US-India ties.  

The author contrasts Harris with Biden's administration, which has navigated sensitive issues with India diplomatically. They contend that Harris, unlike Biden, would be more susceptible to pressure from human rights groups and left-leaning bureaucrats, leading to a more adversarial relationship with India.   
  
A Harris presidency, according to the author, could result in the worst crises in US-India relations since the Clinton administration and the actions of Henry Kissinger.</description>

			<title>How ex-ISI chief’s arrest shows Pakistan Army’s paranoia</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ex-isi-chiefs-arrest-shows-pakistan-armys-self-destructive-paranoia-13805206.html</link>
			<description>The arrest of former Pakistani ISI chief Faiz Hameed signals a concerning trend within the Pakistani army.  Hameed, known for his role in various political interventions and alleged corruption, is now accused of treason, highlighting the increasing paranoia within military ranks. 

This move by the current Army Chief, Gen. Asim Munir, marks a departure from past norms by targeting his own officers. The arrest of Hameed is expected to trigger a domino effect, potentially involving other senior officials, including former Army Chief Qamar Bajwa. This internal strife within the army raises serious questions about its stability and governance. The army's reputation for discipline and integrity, once a cornerstone of its authority, appears to be eroding due to frequent military involvement in politics and endemic corruption. The situation presents a significant challenge for Pakistan's security and stability, and demands careful attention from India as it considers any future engagements with its volatile neighbour.</description>

			<title>Maldives turnaround shows why India's setback in Bangladesh will not be permanent</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/maldives-turnaround-shows-why-indias-setback-in-bangladesh-will-not-be-permanent-13805140.html</link>
			<description>Although the recent change in leadership in Bangladesh, with the 'pro-India' Sheikh Hasina ousted, has led to some pessimism in India, a history of pragmatic diplomacy shows that engagement is key. The article uses the example of the Maldives, where anti-India sentiments initially led to tensions, ultimately followed by a turnaround and renewed cooperation.  

India's consistent support, including development assistance and debt relief, proved crucial in mitigating the Maldives' economic difficulties, leading to a shift in the political landscape. The author suggests that a similar pattern might emerge in Bangladesh, highlighting India's continued engagement with both the new government and members of the previous regime. 


The shared economic, security, and developmental interests between India and Bangladesh are undeniable, making sustained engagement vital for long-term regional stability and prosperity.</description>

			<title>RG Kar rape and murder case: Mamata Banerjee, this is a time for answers and accountability, not political manoeuvring</title>

			<description>The article discusses the violent attack on RG Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata by a mob following the rape and murder of a trainee doctor. Eyewitness accounts and reports suggest the police remained largely inactive, with officers offering minimal resistance and even seeking refuge while the mob vandalized the premises. 

The article criticizes the state government's handling of the situation, alleging a cover-up of administrative lapses. The Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, has claimed that the perpetrators were BJP and DYFI workers, but the author questions her assertion. The Calcutta High Court has transferred the case to the CBI, given the lack of progress and concerns about evidence tampering.  The  author calls for accountability and transparency from the government, emphasizing the need to address the concerns of women who feel vulnerable and endangered in light of the horrific crime.</description>

			<title>China at economic crossroads: Why Beijing cannot afford to ‘slow down’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/china-at-economic-crossroads-why-beijing-cannot-afford-to-slow-down-13804933.html</link>
			<description>China's economic growth is slowing, raising concerns among policymakers and investors. Despite a 20-point plan to stabilize and boost the economy, growth in the second quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations.  

Several challenges contribute to this slowdown, including trade tensions, a debt crisis in the corporate sector, a cooling property market, and a struggling manufacturing sector.  Furthermore, China faces an aging population, the need for state-owned enterprise reform, and competition with the West in emerging technologies.

There are worries that China may fall into the middle-income trap, a situation where growth stalls preventing a country from reaching high-income status.  To avoid this, sustained growth rates of 6-7% are needed, making the current trend a serious concern for Chinese leaders who rely on economic prosperity for their legitimacy.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following mass protests sparked by the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs. The protests, initially student-led, escalated into a nationwide movement against Hasina's government, exposing issues of corruption and authoritarianism. General Waker Uz Zaman, the Chief of Army Staff, declared a military takeover, released opposition leader Khalida Zia from house arrest, and appointed Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of an interim government. The interim government faces the challenge of restoring peace and preparing for new elections.  

The political landscape in Bangladesh is shifting, with potential geopolitical implications for neighboring countries like India and Pakistan.</description>

			<title>Beyond the Lines | The uprising of 1946: The story behind India’s freedom at midnight</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-the-uprising-of-1946-the-story-behind-indias-freedom-at-midnight-13804708.html</link>
			<description>In 1946, a mutiny within the Royal Indian Navy erupted in Bombay, fueled by poor treatment, working conditions, and the desire for independence.  Spreading to other bases across India, the mutiny received widespread support from the local population. The British, facing an unprecedented level of resistance from their own forces, realized the precariousness of their rule. 

The uprising, likened to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by the British High Commissioner John Freeman, significantly hastened the British departure from India. Though some national leaders distanced themselves from the mutiny, its impact was undeniable, demonstrating the widespread discontent and solidifying the path towards independence. However, the potential for uniting the nation under a single movement for freedom was ultimately squandered.</description>

			<title>Never-ending war: Why Israel will ultimately have to deal with the Palestinian question</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/never-ending-war-why-israel-will-ultimately-have-to-deal-with-the-palestinian-question-13804651.html</link>
			<description>The ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, now over ten months old, has escalated into regional conflicts involving Hezbollah, Iran-backed militias, and even Iran itself. 

Israel, emboldened by its technological superiority, has assassinated key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, claiming to weaken their capabilities. This, however, has increased the risk of a wider war, potentially drawing in Iran and its proxies. The international community, including Israel's allies, have criticized Israel's actions, particularly the high civilian casualties in Gaza, and have accused Israel of potential genocide. 

While Israel believes its  integrations with Arab states would have marginalized extremist groups, the Palestinian conflict remains its biggest challenge.  The lack of peace and deep-seated trauma on both sides make finding a solution increasingly difficult.</description>

			<title>Of narratives and narrative settings: How Kamala Harris may not be good news for America, India and the free world</title>

			<description>The article discusses the rapid shift in public perception surrounding Kamala Harris, from being viewed as a liability to becoming a symbol of hope for democracy and liberalism. 

Despite low approval ratings and previous criticism, Harris is now praised by media outlets that once condemned her. The article attributes this shift to a carefully orchestrated narrative campaign, particularly in light of Donald Trump's presidency and the perceived threat he poses to the established order. 

Harris's perceived competence and her alignment with progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Ilham Omar raise concerns about potential changes in U.S. foreign policy, particularly concerning India and Israel. 

The article concludes by highlighting the manipulation of narratives in elections, using Trump and the recent Indian elections as examples, and suggests that the world faces uncertain times ahead.</description>

			<title>Ramification | Bangladesh: How Muhammad Yunus is wearing a crown of thorns</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-bangladesh-how-muhammad-yunus-is-wearing-a-crown-of-thorns-13804451.html</link>
			<description>The ousting of Sheikh Hasina from power in Bangladesh following protests sparked by a quota system reinstatement has created a tense situation. Bangladesh's interim government, headed by Muhammed Yunus, has been met with violence and a backlash against minorities, particularly Hindus. 

The BNP and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), known for its links to Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war atrocities and its support for establishing an Islamic state, are seen as influential forces in this new political landscape.  India is closely monitoring the situation, concerned about  JeI's potential to destabilize the region and its ties to global jihadi organizations.  With potential for unrest and democratic backsliding, India faces the challenge of supporting democratic processes and protecting the interests of minorities in Bangladesh while navigating the evolving political dynamics.</description>

			<title>Ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed’s arrest shows the mess Pakistan finds itself in</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameeds-arrest-shows-the-mess-pakistan-finds-itself-in-13804377.html</link>
			<description>The Pakistani military took the unprecedented step of arresting and charging former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed with violating the Pakistan Army Act, both before and after his retirement. This action, initiated by the current Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, stems from a Supreme Court order regarding allegations of extortion against Hameed.

The timing of the arrest, shortly after Pakistan celebrated javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem's historic Olympic gold medal, highlights the internal power struggle within Pakistan.  Mushir argues that the arrest overshadows the national jubilation and reflects Pakistan's ongoing turmoil. He further connects the arrest to a broader pattern of military interference in attempts at peace with India, citing past instances under Prime Ministers Vajpayee and Modi.</description>

			<title>Budget and after: Time to prioritise agriculture, health and education</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-and-after-time-to-prioritise-agriculture-health-and-education-13804261.html</link>
			<description>To achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat, India needs to address the needs of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Despite being the fifth largest economy, India's per capita income is low and the benefits of growth are unequally distributed. 

Agriculture, employing a large portion of the population, requires significant attention. Stagnant growth in the sector necessitates investment in technology, infrastructure, R&amp;D, and value addition through food processing.  Subsidies and social safety nets, while crucial, should be complemented by initiatives that empower farmers and increase their incomes.   

Focusing on agriculture, health, and education as key priorities will benefit the majority of the population and drive inclusive growth, creating a stronger foundation for sustainable progress.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-regime-change-in-bangladesh-is-an-immediate-setback-for-india-in-the-neighbourhood-13804241.html</link>
			<description>Following the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government by a student-led movement, an interim government led by Muhammed Yunus has taken charge. While Yunus enjoys international recognition for his work with Grameen Bank, he is politically aligned against Hasina, facing charges of violating labour laws.

Concerns for India center around restoring stability, safeguarding the Hindu minority now vulnerable to anti-Indian and Islamic elements, and addressing the possibility of closer relations between Bangladesh and China. 

China's growing influence in Bangladesh, already evident through the Belt and Road Initiative and military partnerships, is a cause for concern for India.  The US has been critical of Hasina's government on democratic grounds, a stance that differs from India's, and has not explicitly addressed the security of minorities in Bangladesh. This divergence in approach between the US and India regarding Bangladesh highlights a potential strategic disconnect.</description>

			<title>Human rights debacle in Britain: West must end double standard</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/human-rights-debacle-in-britain-west-must-end-double-standard-13804133.html</link>
			<description>This article critiques the West's double standard on human rights. It argues that while Western media and governments are quick to condemn human rights abuses in the Global South, they are silent or dismissive when similar issues occur within their own borders or allies.  

The article cites examples of anti-immigrant riots in the UK, US and Canadian actions in Belarus and Gaza as evidence of this hypocrisy. It also points to reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International detailing human rights violations within the UK, US and Canada, emphasizing disregard for these reports by respective governments.  The author calls for greater vocalization of these issues by the Global South to expose this hypocrisy and urge Western powers to adopt consistent human rights standards.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh crisis: How India should deal with Islamist radicalisation and proxy play in the region</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-how-india-should-deal-with-islamist-radicalisation-and-proxy-play-in-the-region-13804103.html</link>
			<description>The recent political turmoil in Bangladesh, triggered by the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, presents a complex geopolitical challenge for India.  

Bangladesh's importance to India stems from its strategic location, cultural ties, and shared interests. However, the vacuum created by Hasina's exit risks influencing regional stability and could potentially see a rise in radical Islamist activities. 

Both China and the US are vying for influence in Bangladesh, presenting India with a strategic balancing act. While China offers economic and military incentives, India must leverage its historical ties and geographical proximity to maintain a positive relationship.  

India must engage diplomatically with the interim government in Bangladesh, emphasizing shared concerns regarding China, terrorism, and minority rights. Additionally, ensuring the safety of Indian citizens and Hindus in Bangladesh, monitoring borders, and continuing to cooperate on regional security initiatives are paramount.</description>

			<title>Head-on | India’s tripolar strategy to balance US, Russia and China</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-indias-tripolar-strategy-to-balance-us-russia-and-china-13804034.html</link>
			<description>Ahead of his visit to Kyiv, Prime Minister Modi's trip to Ukraine is viewed as a crucial step in navigating a shifting global order.  The visit comes amid heightened global tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a growing strategic alliance between Russia and China. India seeks to maintain strategic autonomy, balancing its relationships with both the US-led West and the China-Russia bloc.  

Recent engagements between India and China, including conciliatory statements on border issues and a tentative thaw in economic ties, suggest a potential for greater cooperation.  This realignment could be driven by China's need to find new markets and India's emergence as a significant economic power. Modi's meeting with Zelenskyy will likely focus on addressing the ongoing conflict and India's role as a potential mediator within the fractured world order.</description>

			<title>A new star has emerged on the US horizon; it is called Kamala Harris</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/kamala-harris-galvanises-presidential-race-will-it-be-enough-to-trump-the-donald-13803946.html</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris's political ascent has been rapid, propelled by a combination of opportunity and shrewd maneuvering. Since being named Biden's running mate, she rose to the candidacy with remarkable energy and organization, uniting the Democratic party behind her.  

She has successfully challenged Donald Trump's dominance in polls and mobilized a significant financial resource for her campaign. Harris's message focuses on safeguarding democracy and advocating for the middle class, women's rights, and gun safety. Despite facing a formidable opponent in Trump, her campaign approach, coupled with his own struggles, has shifted the tide of the 2024 election race.</description>

			<title>‘An Islamist-sponsored, state-sanctioned apartheid’: Why time is ripe to amend regressive and repressive waqf laws</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/an-islamist-sponsored-state-sanctioned-apartheid-why-time-is-ripe-to-amend-regressive-and-repressive-waqf-laws-13803836.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that India's Waqf Act, designed to protect Muslim religious and charitable endowments, is discriminatory and outdated. 

The author contends that the Act, established after Independence, has been progressively amended to favor Waqf Boards and grant them unfettered power over waqf properties, even those claimed by non-Muslims. 

They highlight provisions that allow the Waqf Board to determine if property is waqf, are exempt from statutes of limitations, and allow it to encompass non-Muslim dedications. The author criticizes the Muslim-dominated composition of these Boards and contrasts their autonomy with state oversight of Hindu temples.  

The article concludes by calling for the amendment of the Waqf Act, arguing that its current form undermines secularism and promotes an "apartheid" system against the majority population.</description>

			<title>How Bangladesh crisis resembles closely with West-orchestrated ‘colour revolutions’ and Arab Spring</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladesh-crisis-resembles-closely-with-west-orchestrated-colour-revolutions-and-arab-spring-13803791.html</link>
			<description>The recent coup in Bangladesh, orchestrated by the military with support from radical Islamist parties like Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) has raised concerns about the future of democracy in the country. The ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who oversaw significant socio-economic progress,  paves the way for an unstable political landscape. This coup, reminiscent of "colour revolutions" in Eurasia and the Arab Spring, could lead to the rise of a theocratic state.

The interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is likely to face immense challenges as the powerful BNP, JeI, and the military seek dominance.  Khaleda Zia, the BNP leader, is expected to resist Yunus's authority, further complicating the situation. The coup is also a major threat to Bangladesh's minority Hindu population, who have faced persecution in the past. The fragile peace and stability of Bangladesh hang in the balance as the nation navigates this turbulent political transition.</description>

			<title>The silent suffering of minorities in Bangladesh calls for international recognition, justice</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-silent-suffering-of-minorities-in-bangladesh-calls-for-international-recognition-justice-13803750.html</link>
			<description>Hindus in Bangladesh face chronic fear and insecurity due to prevalent violence and discrimination.  Since 1947, their population has significantly dwindled, now standing at approximately 8%. 

They are routinely targeted during religious celebrations like Durga Puja, with unfounded rumors often leading to attacks on temples and communities, resulting in deaths, and horrific acts of sexual violence against women. The government's response to these atrocities is often inadequate, perpetuating a cycle of impunity for the perpetrators. 

This systematic persecution, met by deafening silence from the international community, threatens the very fabric of Bangladeshi society. Urgent action is required to protect the Hindu community and ensure their safety and dignity.</description>

			<title>Post Haniyeh killing, Israel faces Hamas 2.0 in a grinding war of attrition</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/post-haniyeh-killing-israel-faces-hamas-2-0-in-a-grinding-war-of-attrition-13803699.html</link>
			<description>Hamas, despite the substantial damage inflicted by the Israeli operation, remains a potent force. Its recruitment efforts are bolstered by Israel's actions, with anger and frustration among Gazans providing fertile ground for radicalization.  Hamas's transition to guerrilla tactics, utilizing its intricate tunnel network and urban knowledge, presents a significant challenge for the IDF, who are unaccustomed to prolonged urban warfare. 

The organization's 'beehive' leadership structure ensures continuity even amidst losses. Although militarily weakened, Hamas's resilience stems from its deep roots in the Palestinian population, which view them as defenders against Israeli occupation. Hamas's success, however, comes at a high cost for the Palestinian people, who are trapped in a cycle of violence and suffering.</description>

			<title>President Murmu’s state visit to East Timor: How the Delhi-Dili link is an emerging aspect of India’s ‘Act East’ policy</title>

			<description>President Droupadi Murmu's state visit to Timor-Leste, a first for an Indian head of state, signifies growing strategic importance for India.  Timor-Leste recently became an ASEAN observer and aims to be a full member soon, making it a key player in India's Act East Policy. 

India intends to open a resident mission in Dili, reciprocating Timor-Leste's likely future mission in New Delhi. The visit saw cultural and diplomatic exchanges, including a high-level welcome, the bestowal of Timor-Leste's highest honor on President Murmu, and a televised interview on President Horta's popular show.  

Three Memorandums of Understanding were signed, focusing on cultural cooperation, visa-free access for diplomats, and broadcasting collaboration.  The visit opens doors for enhanced development cooperation through ASEAN-India funds and reinforces the potential for economic partnerships, particularly in sectors like education and healthcare.</description>

			<title>The Yunus Paradox: Nobel laureate’s peaceful vision vs the growing fundamentalism in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-yunus-paradox-nobel-laureates-peaceful-vision-vs-the-growing-fundamentalism-in-bangladesh-13803640.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is going through a major political shift following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Noebel laureate Muhammad Yunus leads an interim government while efforts are made to restore order and prepare for new elections.  

However, the rise of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, which has ties to militancy, poses a threat to Bangladesh's secular foundation and India's security interests. The party's resurgence could lead to an increase in anti-India sentiment, cross-border terrorism, and instability in the region. Additionally, the growing influence of China and Pakistan in Bangladesh complicates the situation further, challenging India's regional standing.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ai-driven-crimes-are-gaining-ground-heres-what-we-can-do-to-curb-them-13803442.html</link>
			<description>AI's growing integration into criminal activities presents a significant threat. Deepfakes enable disinformation, while AI-powered phishing and social engineering attacks are increasingly sophisticated.  Cybercriminals use AI to identify vulnerabilities and launch targeted attacks, and AI-driven malware adapts rapidly to evade detection.  

The autonomous nature of AI complicates traditional liability models, making it challenging to assign responsibility for crimes involving artificial agents.  

Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach: international cooperation to establish AI development norms, a revised legal framework that considers AI's unique characteristics, investments in AI for detecting and mitigating criminal AI, and fostering an ethical AI culture.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-why-the-idea-of-glorious-student-protester-is-misguided-13803437.html</link>
			<description>The article argues against an uncritical acceptance of student protesters as inherently positive forces.  While acknowledging their historical heroism, it cites examples of student movements that have been morally corrupt, naive, or even dangerous.  

The author points to instances like the Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s, the Red Brigades in Italy, and  certain student movements in India,  to illustrate how student activism can be manipulated by external forces or result in harmful actions.  The article concludes by emphasizing the need to critically evaluate student protests rather than blindly assuming their noble intentions.</description>

			<title>Minority report: Bangladesh crisis shows why CAA is relevant</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/minority-report-bangladesh-crisis-shows-why-caa-is-relevant-13803401.html</link>
			<description>Recent violence and turmoil in Bangladesh have highlighted the dire situation for the Hindu minority.  The exodus of Sheikh Hasina and the rise of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which has strong historical ties to Pakistan and anti-Bangladesh sentiments, have led to targeted attacks on Hindus. 

The events in Bangladesh shatter the myth of Bengali nationalism as a unifying force, exposing the fragility of cultural and linguistic unity in the face of religious extremism. This underscores the global persecution of Hindus, who have been increasingly marginalized and targeted for their faith. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India, which offers refuge to persecuted minorities, becomes even more relevant in light of these events.</description>

			<title>Panipat, Marathas and the identity of Neeraj Chopra</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/panipat-marathas-and-the-identity-of-neeraj-chopra-13803394.html</link>
			<description>The  Rod Marathas are a community based in Haryana, with origins tracing back to the aftermath of the Battle of Panipat in 1761.  After the Maratha defeat,  a few hundred soldiers and non-combatants managed to escape and settled in the region, giving rise to this distinct community. 

Today, the Rod Marathas share cultural similarities with their namesake from Maharashtra, including language, rituals, and even architectural styles. 

Their history connects them to the now peaceful region where a landmark memorial, the Kala Aam, commemorates the loss of Maratha commander Sadashiv Rao Bhau.  While Neeraj Chopra’s connection to the community has been debated, the story of the Rod Marathas exemplifies how historical events can lead to the creation of new communities in unexpected locations.</description>

			<title>With US keen on military base and China eyeing deep sea port, India must engage with Bangladesh smartly</title>

			<description>The article discusses the geopolitical tensions surrounding Bangladesh, particularly concerning the recent political upheaval and China's growing influence.  

After the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who maintained a balanced relationship with both India and China, there is concern about Bangladesh becoming more aligned with China. China has invested heavily in Bangladesh's infrastructure and military, supplying advanced weapons systems and building strategic facilities. This has raised concerns in India, especially as Baladiganag, located near Bangladesh, had close ties with China and could potentially  threaten India's security.

The US has also been eyeing Bangladesh for potential military bases, but its efforts were met with resistance from Hasina. 

  The article concludes by urging India to remain proactive in its engagement with Bangladesh, strengthening bilateral ties, and promoting regional cooperation to counter China's growing influence in the Bay of Bengal region.</description>

			<title>How great powers fuelling the arms race in West Asia threaten global security</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-great-powers-fuelling-the-arms-race-in-west-asia-threaten-global-security-13803221.html</link>
			<description>This article examines the geopolitical implications of the US and Russia supplying arms to opposing sides in the Middle East. The US strongly backs Israel with substantial military aid, including advanced weaponry like F-35 fighter jets and missile defence systems, aiming to counter Iran's influence and secure its ally's security. Conversely, Russia arms countries opposed to US interests, like Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah, providing sophisticated weaponry such as the S-400 air defence system. This arms race increases regional instability and risks escalating conflicts, as demonstrated by the perpetual tension between Israel and Iran.

The article argues that this rivalry reflects a broader global power struggle between the US and Russia, extending beyond the Middle East. This competition intensifies the danger of misunderstanding and escalation, raising concerns for global peace and stability.  It concludes by emphasizing the need for the international community to promote dialogue and cooperation to prevent further destabilization.</description>

			<title>New government in Bangladesh: It’s advantage America</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/new-government-in-bangladesh-its-advantage-america-13803171.html</link>
			<description>The resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, following widespread protests, creates uncertainty for Indo-Bangla relations.  Historically close, the countries have enjoyed cooperation in various sectors, including trade, security, and regional connectivity.  However, the emergence of a potentially US-leaning government necessitates careful navigation by India. 

Ensuring the continuity of economic partnerships, security cooperation, and regional connectivity projects will be crucial. India must engage proactively with the new government, emphasizing stability and mutual interests while encouraging a balanced foreign policy for Bangladesh. The future of the relationship hinges on navigating this transition with foresight and a shared vision for regional prosperity.</description>

			<title>Sunita Williams stuck in space: Is it all over for Boeing?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/sunita-williams-stuck-in-space-is-it-all-over-for-boeing-13803174.html</link>
			<description>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, carrying astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, experienced multiple delays and technical issues since its launch in June.  Initially intended for a week-long mission to the International Space Station (ISS), the return date has been pushed back multiple times due to helium leaks and software glitches. NASA has not yet approved the Starliner for flight under non-emergency circumstances, leading to discussions about using SpaceX's Dragon capsule for the astronauts' return. 

This situation highlights Boeing's struggles in the space sector, with significant cost overruns and delays accumulating over the past few years. In contrast, SpaceX has emerged as a more successful competitor in NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 


The article concludes by questioning Boeing's future in the space aviation sector and suggesting that NASA consider diversifying its partnerships to include options like ISRO's Gaganyaan or the Dream Chaser spacecraft.  It emphasizes the safety of the astronauts as the paramount concern and hopes for their swift and safe return to Earth.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-israels-assassination-strategy-evolved-to-become-tech-savvy-and-precise-13803133.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses Israel's history of targeted killings, highlighting several prominent examples. It begins with the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004 and  examines the broader political context surrounding Israel's assassination policy. 

The article then delves into the tenure of former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who championed targeted killings as a cost-effective way to counter Iran's nuclear program. It explores specific cases like the assassination attempt on Ali Akbar Mohtashmipur in 1984 using a parcel bomb, and the recent targeted killing of Mohsen Fakrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist,  using artificial intelligence. The article concludes by noting the impact these assassinations have on Iran and the international community.</description>

			<title>Why Muhammad Yunus should have reconsidered his interim role</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-muhammad-yunus-should-have-reconsidered-his-interim-role-13803094.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the aftermath of the coup in Bangladesh, highlighting concerns about the rise of religious extremism and authoritarianism. The author argues that the coup, initially perceived as a generational shift, has revealed a dangerous undercurrent of religious violence targeting minority Hindus and artists. 

The appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader is viewed with skepticism. While Yunus's presence might appease the international community, the author questions whether he can effectively curb the violence and prevent the normalization of authoritarian rule.  The article concludes by pondering Yunus' legacy and the potential for his reputation to be exploited by a new generation of political and religious extremists.</description>

			<title>International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples: A mischievous attempt to hide West's barbaric face</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/international-day-of-the-worlds-indigenous-peoples-a-mischievous-attempt-to-hide-wests-barbaric-face-13802902.html</link>
			<description>The article critiques the  "International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples" (IDWIP), arguing that its celebration in India is inappropriate and carries a hidden agenda.  

The author contends that the date, August 9,  is insensitive as it marks a historical event of genocide against indigenous peoples by European powers. While acknowledging the plight of indigenous populations globally, the author emphasizes that India's own history doesn't align with the Western narrative of indigenous people as solely victims.  

The article suggests celebrating the contributions of prominent tribal figures in India's history instead. It concludes by highlighting that IDWIP represents Western atonement for past atrocities, while "Janjatiya Gaurav Divas" (Tribal Pride Day) in India celebrates the indigenous spirit inherent in all Indians.</description>

			<title>Philippines, Vietnam historic joint drills and South China Sea conundrum</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/philippines-vietnam-historic-joint-drills-and-south-china-sea-conundrum-13802858.html</link>
			<description>Vietnam and the Philippines recently conducted their first joint coast guard exercises in Manila Bay, a significant move against growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. The drills, which included search and rescue, fire control, and friendly sports competitions, highlight the two nations'  shared concerns over Beijing's expansionist ambitions in the region. 

Despite their own overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, both Vietnam and the Philippines are increasingly cooperating to counter Chinese actions. This comes after a recent violent confrontation between Chinese and Philippine coast guards in the Philippine-controlled waters of Second Thomas Shoal. 


The growing alignment between Vietnam, the Philippines, and the United States, through initiatives like the “Squad” security arrangement, has heightened tensions with China, which views these actions as a direct challenge to its regional influence.</description>

			<title>Hasina’s departure leaves Awami League in disarray, Mujib’s legacy in dispute</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/hasinas-departure-leaves-awami-league-in-disarray-mujibs-legacy-in-dispute-13802823.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's departure from Bangladesh following her resignation has left the Awami League party in a precarious situation, raising questions about its future.  Hissitianing echoes previous dynastic monarch removals  Hasina's sudden exit, after a resounding election victory just eight months prior, contrasts sharply with her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, who was assassinated during a coup.  

The Bangladesh Army facilitated Hasina's escape, opting for a less disruptive transition compared to a full-fledged coup. This move appears to align with the student-led movement demanding democracy and free elections, reminiscent of the 1990 downfall of General H.M. Ershad.

However, Hasina's leadership has been criticized for its autocratic tendencies and failure to secure the Awami League's future. Her ouster is likely to empower forces opposed to cultural syncretism and India, potentially impacting the delicate Indo-Bangladesh relationship.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh may be in for a long period of internal upheaval</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-may-be-in-for-a-long-period-of-internal-upheaval-13802706.html</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's political history has been turbulent, marked by coups, violence, and political instability. The recent ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by mass student protests has raised concerns about an indefinite civil war. 

Deep-seated mistrust between the two major political parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, fuels the conflict. The military's involvement in politics is another significant factor, with generals frequently seizing power.  The rise of student power, coupled with increasing Islamic radicalization, adds to the complexity.  Foreign powers, such as Pakistan, may also exploit the situation to their advantage.

With an aging and ailing Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus leading the interim government, there are doubts about his ability to manage the prevailing chaos. Bangladesh faces a period of internal upheaval with potentially serious consequences for neighboring India.</description>

			<title>Why Iran's next move will be critical in deciding the fate of West Asian crisis</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/irans-next-move-is-awaited-amid-escalations-in-middle-east-13802727.html</link>
			<description>A series of Israeli assassinations targeting Iranian proxy commanders in Lebanon, Syria, and potentially Qatar has heightened tensions in the Middle East. While Israel maintains silence, Iran accuses Israel's Mossad of being behind the killings, viewing it as a serious breach of security and a test to its regional influence.  

These attacks, believed to be part of a more calculated strategy by Israel, have ramifications for both Israelis and Iranians. Israel  experiences a boost in military morale and a political lifeline for Netanyahu, but faces potential Iranian retaliation. Iran, facing embarrassment and pressure to respond, is evaluating its options, including limited strikes, covert operations, or even terrorism.

The international community, particularly the US, is engaged in a delicate balancing act, providing Israel with military support while trying to contain the situation and prevent further escalation.</description>

			<title>Western naïveté about Sikh extremism encourages terror, betrays genuine Sikhs</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/western-naivete-about-sikh-extremism-encourages-terror-betrays-genuine-sikhs-13802609.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses  the parallels between Sikh extremism and Islamic extremism, drawing comparisons to the Air India 1985 bombing and the rise of Al Qaeda. 

The author argues that, similar to how Islamist extremists exploited  religious organizations and charities for their agenda, pro-Khalistan activists are hijacking peaceful Sikh communities.  The article criticizes Canada and the US for ignoring this issue, highlighting the UK's Bloom Review which identified this specific threat and called for action. 

It concludes that unlike  the US's post-9/11 understanding of Islamist extremism,  Sikh extremism remains largely unnoticed, urging a reevaluation of this growing threat and a focus on supporting authentic Sikh communities.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government.  

Hindu communities have long faced violence, discrimination, and attacks in Bangladesh, despite some periods of relative calm under Hasina's rule. The recent upheaval has resulted in widespread attacks on Hindus, their homes, and temples, leading to concerns for their safety and well-being.  The author highlights the troubling indifference of some Hindu individuals and groups in India towards the plight of their coreligionists in Bangladesh. 




He draws parallels with the Jewish experience during the Holocaust, emphasizing the importance of learning from history and recognizing the dangers of complacency in the face of persecution.</description>

The author questions the legitimacy of the student-led movement, highlighting their lack of formal representation and suggesting possible foreign influence, particularly from Islamist groups and China. 

Yunus's close ties to the US and his past interactions with Indian leaders are also explored, raising concerns about his potential allegiance. 

The author concludes by emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding Bangladesh's future leadership, questioning whether Yunus or the shadowy figures allegedly backing the student movement will wield real power.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the escalating tensions in the Middle East following a series of assassinations targeting key figures in Iran-supported groups.  These incidents, including the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, have led to a heightened risk of a regional war. 

Iran, vowing revenge, possesses a formidable arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis. 

Hezbollah has a vast cache of rockets and anti-tank missiles, while the Houthis specialize in  ballistic and cruise missiles, and drones. 

Hamas, while lacking conventional forces, relies on guerrilla tactics and a smaller arsenal of rockets. Israel, meanwhile, is relying on its robust air defenses to counter potential attacks. The situation remains precarious, with the possibility of a full-blown regional conflict looming large.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh is in the throes of Islamist pogrom against minority Hindus, and our liberals are busy obfuscating reality</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-is-in-the-throes-of-islamist-pogrom-against-minority-hindus-and-our-liberals-are-busy-obfuscating-reality-13802267.html</link>
			<description>The student-led movement in Bangladesh, which led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has descended into violence and persecution of the Hindu minority. Extremist Islamist groups, such as Jamaat-e-Islami, have capitalized on the chaos, targeting Hindu homes, businesses, and temples.  

Videos and testimonies depict horrific scenes of violence, including lynchings and desecration of religious sites. Despite these alarming reports, some Indian liberals are downplaying the situation, labeling it as "exaggerated" or an "attempt by Hindu right-wing" to create a narrative. 

The present crisis has historical roots, as Hindus were historically targeted during the Bangladesh liberation war, with widespread violence and sexual attacks documented. Though the ouster of Hasina brought initial celebrations, the subsequent violence and targeting of Hindus reveals a deeper, more sinister agenda driven by Islamist extremists who have seized the opportunity to unleash their hatred and create a climate of fear for the Hindu community.  

This recent violence against Hindus in Bangladesh raises serious concerns about the safety and security of the minority population and highlights the urgent need for international intervention to protect their rights.</description>

			<description>Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz as her running mate after evaluating several potential candidates. Walz, a two-term Minnesota governor and former congressman, offers experience, political savvy, and a center-of-the-road approach that contrasts with Harris's progressive stance. His selection aims to balance the ticket both geographically and ideologically, attracting white working-class voters and providing counterpoint to Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance. Walz's military service and Midwestern demeanor are seen as assets, while potential vulnerabilities regarding his record on issues like immigration and law enforcement may be exploited by the Republican campaign.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh crisis: A play of invisible Chinese hand?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-a-play-of-invisible-chinese-hand-13802059.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that China may be orchestrating a coup in Bangladesh against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina due to her stance against Islamic extremism and her pro-India leanings. 

The author cites China's increasing engagement with Islamic extremist groups globally, including Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, Hamas, and the Taliban, as evidence of its shifting strategy. This engagement, he suggests, is fueled by an aim to counter India and secure geopolitical advantage, potentially leading to instability in the region.  

The article concludes that China's alliance with Islamic extremist groups could backfire, as these groups often pursue their own interests regardless of their backers.</description>

			<description>India is deeply intertwined with Bangladesh's internal affairs due to their shared border, religious connections, and water resources. India's support for Sheikh Hasina's leadership, despite growing international pressure and domestic challenges, arose from concerns about cross-border infiltration and the potential for instability.  The recent elections, marred by opposition boycotts and allegations of authoritarianism, have raised questions about India's approach. The article suggests potential avenues India could have explored, such as encouraging a more inclusive political landscape in Bangladesh.

			<title>From hope to despair: Testing time for democracy in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-hope-to-despair-testing-time-for-democracy-in-bangladesh-13801957.html</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, resigned and fled to India amidst violent student protests. Initially sparked by quota demands in government jobs, the protests escalated, with the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir. These groups have a history of anti-Awami League sentiments and have been implicated in war crimes during Bangladesh's liberation in 1971.  

The violence resulted in numerous deaths, attacks on Hindu communities, and damage to public and private property.  The Bangladeshi Army intervened, establishing an interim government and raising concerns about a potential return to military rule.  The resurfacing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), with the release of jailed leader Khaleda Zia, further complicates the political landscape, creating a potential power struggle between the Army and Jamaat-BNP. 

The situation paints a worrying picture for Bangladesh's future, with democratic processes seemingly compromised and the rise of extremist elements posing a grave threat to stability.</description>

			<title>Tensions run high in Bangladesh, but New Delhi must engage with Dhaka</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/tensions-run-high-in-bangladesh-but-new-delhi-must-engage-with-dhaka-13801709.html</link>
			<description>A recent upheaval in Bangladesh has resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protests, initially sparked by a court ruling on quotas for the offspring of freedom fighters, escalated into widespread violence and demonstrations demanding Hasina's removal. 

Factors contributing to the unrest include allegations of government corruption, suppression of media freedom, enforced disappearances, and a controversial Digital Security Act.  The army, observing growing public discontent and after a plea from retired officers, intervened to ensure stability, ultimately giving Hasina an ultimatum to resign. 

The situation has attracted international attention, with the US and EU expressing their positions on the developments.  India faces potential implications from the instability,  including a possible influx of refugees and the need to navigate its relationships with various Bangladeshi political forces.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh ‘coup’ seems straight out of CIA playbook: Why India should be more watchful and alert</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-coup-seems-straight-out-of-cia-playbook-why-india-should-be-more-watchful-and-alert-13801515.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the United States' removal of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister of Bangladesh, arguing this decision plays into the hands of Pakistan and China.  The author criticizes the US's hypocritical stance on democracy, citing similar interference in the past.

The removal of Hasina, who the author believes provided stability and protected minorities, is framed as a CIA-led "revolution" that benefits chaotic outcomes and challenges India's security. 

The author sees the US move as a miscalculation, ultimately strengthening China's influence in the region and warns of potential similar machinations against India.</description>

			<title>India in a hostile neighbourhood: Way ahead for New Delhi</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-in-a-hostile-neighbourhood-way-ahead-for-new-delhi-13801446.html</link>
			<description>The fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in Bangladesh raises concerns about India's security. The opposition groups, Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP), are anti-secular and potentially aligned with Pakistan and possibly the US Deep State. These groups aim to establish an Islamic identity in Bangladesh, contrasting with its secular foundation.  

The US involvement, while seemingly promoting "democracy," could be driven by strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region, aiming to counter China and exert pressure on India.


India faces the prospect of hostile neighbours on all sides. To counteract this, it should strengthen ties with Southeast Asia,  Indo-Pacific powers, and the Middle East, leveraging its historical strengths in trade, military power, and cultural influence to secure its position and promote stability in the region.</description>

			<title>Why Bangladesh crisis demands a pragmatic approach from Mamata Banerjee</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-bangladesh-crisis-demands-a-pragmatic-approach-from-mamata-banerjee-13801431.html</link>
			<description>The recent turmoil in Bangladesh has created a potential refugee crisis in West Bengal, India.  West Bengal, with its long history of hosting refugees, faces significant demographic, economic, and social challenges. The influx could strain public services, exacerbate unemployment, and potentially heighten religious tensions.  While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's stance of welcoming refugees is commendable, it is argued that this approach is flawed and potentially risky. Critics contend that it ignores the potential strain on resources and security, and could lead to unintended consequences.

A more balanced approach, they suggest, requires careful planning, collaboration with the central government and international organizations, and measures to ensure the well-being of both refugees and the local population.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh protests: Sheikh Hasina was India’s best bet, but now is the time for a backup plan</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-protests-sheikh-hasina-was-indias-best-bet-but-now-is-the-time-for-a-backup-plan-13801233.html</link>
			<description>Political unrest in Bangladesh culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protests, initially sparked by a High Court decision reinstating a quota system for government jobs, escalated into a nationwide crisis exposing economic instability, corruption, and a pattern of government crackdowns. 

The unrest has raised concerns in India, as Hasina's government was considered a close ally. Her departure presents an opportunity for China, which has faced a strained relationship with Bangladeshi leadership. While the unrest appears to have organic roots, suspicions remain about potential foreign influence, particularly from China, seeking to advance its strategic interests in the region.  India now requires a cautious approach to navigate this shift in Bangladesh's political landscape and develop a contingency plan.</description>

			<title>Eminent citizens, don’t mix morality with national interest! Why India shouldn’t cut its defence ties with Israel</title>

			<description>The article discusses a letter signed by prominent Indian citizens urging the government to halt arms exports to Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas. The author argues that this move would be detrimental to India's burgeoning defense manufacturing sector, which has seen significant growth in recent years.  

India's collaboration with Israel in defense technology is highlighted as a valuable asset in bolstering India's military capabilities. The author criticizes the signatories of the letter for selectively applying moral and humanitarian concerns while neglecting similar issues in other conflicts, particularly those involving China and Pakistan.  She concludes that prioritizing national interest and commercial partnerships is crucial for India's defense aspirations.</description>

			<title>Why equality is so illusive, yet so necessary</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-equality-is-so-illusive-yet-so-necessary-13800984.html</link>
			<description>Darrin McMahon's book "Equality" explores the complex and multifaceted nature of equality throughout history.  

While universally desired, the concept of equality has been subject to reinterpretation and exclusion across diverse cultures, religions, and political ideologies. From ancient societies to modern thought, equality has been both a guiding principle and a tool of differentiation. 

McMahon highlights the inherent tension between the human capacity for cooperation and the tendency towards hierarchy and power.  He argues that achieving and sustaining equality requires constant vigilance against regressive systems of inequality.</description>

			<title>No, Quad hasn’t lost its relevance; India is forcing it to become more broad-based and that’s a good thing</title>

			<description>The article discusses India's role within the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) and its evolving relationship with China. 

Recent speculation regarding a potential China-India détente, fueled by high-level diplomatic meetings, has led to questions about India's commitment to Quad. The article argues that despite India's economic considerations regarding China, such as  concerns over a trade deficit and potential for increased Chinese FDI, its geopolitical strategy remains focused on balancing China's influence.

India's approach to Quad is described as broader than a mere security framework, encompassing technological collaboration, supply chain resilience, and humanitatian assistance.  The article emphasizes India's strengthening security ties with Southeast Asian nations to counter China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, citing specific examples like arms deals with Vietnam, joint exercises with the Philippines, and increased engagement with Indonesia and other ASEAN members.

Ultimately, the article argues that India's strategy in the Indo-Pacific is multi-faceted, aiming to deter Chinese aggression through a combination of bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral engagements. While acknowledging Quad's evolving role, the author emphasizes that India maintains its independence and avoids becoming entangled in a rigid security alliance.</description>

			<title>Ismail Haniyeh’s killing: Iran caught between the devil and the deep blue sea</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ismail-haniyehs-killing-iran-caught-between-the-devil-and-the-deep-blue-sea-13800733.html</link>
			<description>The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh poses a significant challenge for Iran.  The regime feels pressured to respond to protect its stability and influence in the region.  However, Iran is constrained by economic difficulties and the risk of a full-scale war with Israel and potentially the US.  A direct confrontation would be too costly, particularly given the threat to Iran's nuclear program.

Instead, Iran is likely to increase support for its proxies in Lebanon and other areas through actions like missile strikes.  The situation remains tense, with miscalculations by either Iran or Israel potentially escalating the conflict.</description>

			<title>Exercise Pitch Black: Key takeaways for Indian Air Force</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/exercise-pitch-black-key-takeaways-for-indian-air-force-13800723.html</link>
			<description>Exercise Pitch Black 2024, held from July 12 to August 2 in Australia, was the largest edition in the 43-year history of the exercise, involving 20 countries, over 140 aircraft, and 4435 personnel. The Indian Air Force (IAF) participated with Su-30 MKI fighter jets, C-17 Globemaster III, and IL-78 Air-to-Air Refuelling aircraft, alongside advanced aircraft like the F-35, F-22, F/A-18E/F, Gripen, and Typhoon.

The exercise focused on large-force employment,  including offensive and defensive counter-air operations, simulating complex combat scenarios with various threats, like SAMs. This provided valuable exposure and training for IAF pilots, allowing them to operate with different air forces, enhance interoperability, and learn new tactics. 

Participating in this multinational exercise strengthens India's position as a major player in regional security and underscores India's commitment to international defence cooperation and projecting air power over long distances.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-time-is-ripe-to-shun-one-china-policy-13800693.html</link>
			<description>The article argues that Tibet, with its history of sovereignty stretching back to the 7th century, has been unjustly occupied by China since 1950-51.  It contends that China's expansionist policies threaten India's security and points to recent US actions supporting Tibetan autonomy as aligning with India's interests.  
The author proposes several steps India should take, including  establishing diplomatic relations with the Tibetan government-in-exile, supporting other oppressed groups within China, and pushing for international recognition of Tibet's sovereignty.  They maintain that supporting Tibet is essential for securing India's national interest.</description>

			<title>How the idea of 'truce' is absent in French politics and Paris Olympics</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/emmanuel-macron-french-politics-and-paris-olympics-13800645.html</link>
			<description>Political instability, labeled as "chienlit" by Charles de Gaulle, has gripped France as President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly and called for snap elections shortly before the 2024 Summer Olympics. 

The inconclusive elections, resulting in a fragmented political landscape, have added to the already tense situation. 

Despite this internal turmoil, the Olympics proceeded, witnessing both praise for its innovative opening ceremony featuring female icons, and criticism for a controversial tableau portraying Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" with drag queens. 

Amidst the political maneuvering of Macron seeking a consensual Prime Minister, the Games continue, serving as a platform for international unity despite the backdrop of national uncertainty.</description>

			<title>Mewat: Once a region with mixed identities, now marred by communal tensions</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/mewat-once-a-region-with-mixed-identities-now-marred-by-communal-tensions-13800520.html</link>
			<description>This article explores the complex history and present-day challenges of Mewat, a region in northwestern India encompassing parts of Haryana and Rajasthan.  

Historically, the Meos, the region's inhabitants, were known for banditry and resistance to the Delhi Sultanate.  After forced conversion to Islam by Sultan Balban, the Meos continued to struggle with lawlessness despite a visible Islamic presence in the region.

The article examines how the region's heritage blends both Islamic and Hindu influences, evident in architectural styles and local narratives. Today, Mewat faces socio-economic problems, including low literacy rates, poverty, and high crime, which is attributed, in part, to the Tablighi Jamaat's influence.

Despite these challenges, the author notes a glimmer of hope, pointing to a recent religious procession in Nuh that was met with peaceful greetings, suggesting a potential for progress and unity in the future.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-expected-visit-to-ukraine-rhetoric-and-reality-13800510.html</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing war in Ukraine, approaching its 900-day mark, and analyzes the potential implications of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's planned visit to the country. It highlights the devastating human and economic costs of the conflict and criticizes the West's military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it prolongs the war. 

The author also reveals a potential peace deal that could have ended the conflict within 100 days but was allegedly scuttled by the US and UK. He questions the purpose of Modi's visit, given India’s historical ties with Russia and Ukraine’s criticism of India's stance on the war.  

The article concludes by expressing doubt about the visit yielding concrete results and urging readers to observe the unfolding events.</description>

			<description>The killing of  Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran has heightened tensions in the Israel-Hamas conflict.  While Israel has celebrated its success in eliminating key Hamas and Hezbollah figures, the assassination of Haniyeh has spurred threats of retaliation from Iran.

This incident underscores the volatile nature of the conflict, which involves a complex web of actors and alliances. Despite these escalating tensions, the international community is actively working to prevent a wider regional war.

The future remains uncertain, with both sides facing pressure to manage their responses and avoid a catastrophic escalation.</description>

			<title>World Development Report 2024: India must focus on inclusive growth to escape ‘middle-income trap’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/world-development-report-2024-india-must-focus-on-inclusive-growth-to-escape-middle-income-trap-13800429.html</link>
			<description>The World Development Report 2024 highlights the "middle-income trap," where countries face stunted growth after reaching a certain level of income.  The report warns that 108 middle-income countries, including India, face unique challenges in escaping this trap.  It suggests a "3i" strategy: investments, infusion of technology, and innovation. While India might benefit from the initial "2i"s, it's urged to prioritize innovation and research &amp; development, leveraging its  demographic dividend and human capital.  Addressing socio-economic inequalities is crucial to ensure inclusive growth and achieve the goal of "Vikisit Bharat" by 2047.</description>

			<title>Why Israel's conventional operations are successful but it is unable to repeat that in hybrid war</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-israels-conventional-operations-are-successful-but-it-is-unable-to-repeat-that-in-hybrid-war-13800391.html</link>
			<description>This article analyzes the evolution of Israeli warfare strategies since its founding. It highlights Israel's early victories in conflicts against Arab nations, attributing them to strategic military prowess. However, the author argues that Israel's post-1973 confrontations with Iranian proxies, particularly Hezbollah and Hamas, marked a shift towards a "forever in war" mentality characterized by terrorism.

The author asserts that the IDF's past successes are no longer translating into decisive victories, exemplified by the current conflict. This, coupled with Israel's exclusive reliance on military force over fostering non-partisan relations within opposing societies, has perpetuated the conflict. The author contrasts this with India's approach to hybrid warfare, emphasizing a more pragmatic and conflict-ending strategy.</description>

			<title>Beyond the Lines | Road to Ruin: Why Pakistani premiers pursue unwinnable wars against India</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-road-to-ruin-why-pakistani-premiers-pursue-unwinnable-wars-against-india-13800168.html</link>
			<description>The article examines Pakistan's repeated history of military misadventures against India, focusing on the Kargil War of 1999. It argues that this pattern stems from Pakistani leaders seeking to bolster their political standing through appeals to national pride and a perception of Indian threat. 

The author highlights how Pakistani leaders, including Ayub Khan, Bhutto, Yahya Khan, and Musharraf, capitalized on anti-India sentiment to justify wars, ultimately leading to their downfall. The Kargil War, in particular, is depicted as a strategic miscalculation that underscored Pakistan's conventional military weakness against India.  The author concludes by stating that each war waged by a Pakistani premier against India has resulted in their political demise.</description>

			<title>Need of a single window system to ensure youth skilling and employment</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/need-of-a-single-window-system-to-ensure-youth-skilling-and-employment-13800139.html</link>
			<description>India faces a significant youth unemployment crisis, with estimates varying widely due to data limitations. While the government highlights job creation, surveys by organizations like CMIE paint a contrasting picture, revealing high unemployment rates, particularly among educated youth. Young workers often find themselves in the informal sector with poor-quality jobs, facing challenges like low wages and inadequate working conditions. 

Addressing this issue requires coordinated efforts. The government should consolidate existing skill development and employment schemes under a single umbrella at the district level, providing a comprehensive support system for youth. Initiatives like the Youth Guarantee program implemented in the EU serve as successful models for empowering youth through education, training, and employment opportunities.</description>

			<title>Why collaboration model would work better for India in curbing Chinese footprints in neighbourhood</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-collaboration-model-would-work-better-for-india-in-curbing-chinese-footprints-in-neighbourhood-13800060.html</link>
			<description>India's "Neighbourhood First" policy faces challenges due to China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean region. 

China's naval presence, infrastructure projects like the Belt and Road Initiative, and economic dependencies are shaping the region in a way that could undermine India's interests. While India has focused on building trust and capacity-building with its maritime neighbors, it needs to move faster and be more effective in its approach. China's methods, while arguably more efficient, often involve debt-trap diplomacy and long-term dependencies.  India's need to rewrite "The Hare and the Tortoise" fable,  means that it must act more decisively and deliver tangible results to counter China's growing influence.</description>

			<title>Hamas ‘beehive’ leadership ensures survival despite Haniyeh’s killing</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/hamas-beehive-leadership-ensures-survival-despite-haniyehs-killing-13799960.html</link>
			<description>Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, was killed in a strike in Iran. This follows a pattern of Israeli targeted killings of Hamas leaders, including military figures like Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa.  

Despite the ongoing Israeli assassinations, Hamas has demonstrated resilience, replenishing its leadership with successors. Khaled Mashal, a former Hamas leader, is considered a likely candidate to replace Haniyeh.

Hamas's structure, characterized by a "beehive" like leadership, enables it to withstand the loss of key figures. Even with the elimination of top leaders, new individuals step in, perpetuating the organization's operations and goals.</description>

			<title>Netanyahu seeks total war: Hezbollah is a sideshow, Iran is the real target</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/netanyahu-seeks-total-war-hezbollah-is-a-sideshow-iran-is-the-real-target-13799944.html</link>
			<description>Israel is employing a strategy of total confrontation against its enemies, exemplified by recent targeted assassinations of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas officials. 

These precision strikes demonstrate Israel's ability to strike anywhere, sending a clear message of deterrence. With Hamas momentarily weakened, Israel is focusing on Hezbollah, considering a land invasion to cripple its military capability. This aggressive posture, driven by both security concerns and Netanyahu's political interests, aims to solidify his power base. However, this strategy risks escalating the conflict, particularly if provoked by Iran,  leading to a wider and more devastating war. Israel's aggressive actions highlight the need for a balanced approach that combines military strength with strategic foresight to avoid unintended consequences.</description>

			<title>How Ismail Haniyeh’s killing may weaken Hamas but not its ideology</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ismail-haniyehs-killing-may-weaken-hamas-but-not-its-ideology-13799756.html</link>
			<description>Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas's political bureau, was assassinated in Tehran. While Israel celebrated the killing, Hamas vowed revenge and declared open war to liberate Jerusalem. Haniyeh was a key negotiator in ceasefire talks with Israel, and his death is seen as a setback for the fragile peace efforts. 

Hamas is expected to retaliate, potentially leading to further escalation in the already tense region.  International concern surrounds the potential for a larger conflict, which could have global ramifications. The assassination raises questions about Israel's broader strategy, and its impact on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unclear.</description>

			<title>From Ukraine to Armenia, drones take centre stage in modern warfare</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-ukraine-to-armenia-drones-take-centre-stage-in-modern-warfare-13799697.html</link>
			<description>Drones are revolutionizing warfare, offering precision, surveillance, and cost-effectiveness compared to manned aircraft. The Russia-Ukraine conflict exemplifies their strategic importance, with both sides utilizing drones for reconnaissance, strikes, and asymmetric warfare.  Advances in navigation, communications, and AI further enhance drone capabilities, enabling autonomous operations and precise target selection.

However, the rise of autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) poses ethical dilemmas and calls for international regulations. LAWS can identify, select, and engage targets without human intervention, raising concerns about accountability and the potential for unintended consequences. International discussions and proposed frameworks aim to establish guidelines for the development and deployment of AI in warfare, emphasizing human control and ethical considerations.</description>

			<title>Why US-Japan-South Korea trilateral partnership will withstand the test of time</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-japan-south-korea-trilateral-partnership-will-withstand-the-test-of-time-13799676.html</link>
			<description>The US, Japan, and South Korea have formalized their trilateral security cooperation with a historic agreement. This comes amidst growing concerns regarding North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the rising tensions with China, and the ever-present security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The agreement, known as the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF), aims to enhance cooperation in areas such as intelligence sharing, joint exercises, and defense technology exchange. This move signifies a deepening of ties between the three countries, seeking to  bolster their collective security and deter aggression from North Korea and China.  

The agreement follows several high-level summits and the resumption of defense exchanges between Japan and South Korea, overcoming past historical tensions. The US sees this strengthened trilateral relationship as crucial to its strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific, prompting  the realignment of its military forces in Japan to better address regional challenges.  The pact also highlights a shared concern about China's assertiveness in the region, as the three nations reiterate their opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo.</description>

			<title>India–China ‘de-escalation’: New progress or new normal?</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-china-de-escalation-new-progress-or-new-normal-13799546.html</link>
			<description>Recent diplomatic exchanges between India and China highlight the ongoing border dispute and differing views on how to resolve it. Despite Chinese assurances of progress, India remains vigilant due to recent actions like the construction of a bridge near the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  

China's historical approach to border settlements, prioritizing its strategic and economic interests, coupled with its evolving security doctrines, suggests a complex calculation in its dealings with India.  China views India's growing ties with the US as a potential threat, and fears India could exploit the situation to advance its own territorial claims. Additionally, a potential conflict in the East and South China Seas could see India playing a crucial role, potentially blocking China's sea lines of communication. 

India must continue its firm stance and remain vigilant against Chinese misadventures, ensuring that any perceived progress does not become a new status quo.</description>

			<title>Vietnamese PM’s India visit: How civilisational roots, geopolitical interests cement New Delhi-Hanoi ties</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vietnamese-pms-india-visit-how-civilisational-roots-geopolitical-interests-cement-new-delhi-hanoi-ties-13799495.html</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's visit to India aims to strengthen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in 2016.  Bilateral trade, currently at $15 billion, is expected to grow further through investments and cooperation in sectors such as electronics, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, clean energy, and digital economy. 

Defense cooperation is a key focus, with India gifting a warship to Vietnam in 2023 and potential future acquisitions of BrahMos missiles and Akash surface-to-air missile systems.  

Cultural and civilizational similarities between India and Vietnam, including shared religious practices and historical connections, are seen as further strengthening ties.</description>
