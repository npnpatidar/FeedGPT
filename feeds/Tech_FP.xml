			<title>Nepal bans TikTok, implements new regulations for social media platforms</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/nepal-bans-tiktok-implements-new-regulations-for-social-media-platforms-13383772.html</link>
			<description>The Nepal government has decided to ban TikTok due to concerns over the app's negative impact on social harmony. The government also plans to establish ground rules for social media platforms in Nepal, requiring them to have representatives in the country to address user concerns. The ban on TikTok is expected to be implemented once technical preparations are completed. This move aligns with the government's introduction of directives on the operation of social networking, which mandates social media giants like Facebook, X, and YouTube to open liaison offices in Nepal. Non-compliance with these regulations may result in platform shutdowns. The government aims to promptly handle objectionable content and address user concerns.</description>

			<title>No iPads launched in 2023, Apple set for major overhaul in 2024 after an unprecedented year of no updates</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/apple-ipad-lineup-set-for-major-overhaul-in-2024-after-an-unprecedented-year-of-no-updates-13383602.html</link>
			<description>In 2023, Apple did not release any new iPad models due to production delays and scheduling challenges. This marked the first time in the company's history that they skipped an annual update for the iPad. However, in 2024, Apple plans to launch a variety of new iPads, including a 12.9-inch iPad Air.

Renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that 2024 will see a comprehensive overhaul of Apple's iPad lineup. This includes introducing a larger 12.9-inch option for the iPad Air, implementing OLED displays for the iPad Pro, updating the iPad Mini, and launching a new generation of the most affordable entry-level iPad.

Kuo remains cautious about projected unit sales, estimating that Apple will ship approximately 52-54 million iPads in 2024, a slight increase from the estimated 50 million units shipped in 2023. However, this falls short of the peak sales in 2022 during the pandemic, which reached 63 million units.

According to Kuo's timeline, the first-quarter of 2024 will see updates to the iPad Air lineup, including an updated 10.9-inch model and the introduction of a new 12.9-inch variant. In the second quarter, Apple plans to launch a new generation of iPad Pro models with a redesigned chassis, the latest M3 chip, and a shift to OLED displays.

In the second half of 2024, Apple is expected to refresh the iPad Mini and the base model iPad (11th generation). The current most affordable iPad, the iPad (9th generation), will be discontinued by the end of 2024, signaling the completion of the lighting port transition for the entire iPad lineup.</description>

			<title>Indian Government mulling over lowering import taxes, other duties on imported EVs for Tesla</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/indian-government-mulling-over-lowering-import-taxes-other-duties-on-imported-evs-for-tesla-13383482.html</link>
			<description>The Indian government is considering reducing import tariffs and duties on completely built-up electric vehicles (EVs) in order to attract Tesla, Elon Musk's EV company, to enter the Indian market. Currently, EVs with a price below $40,000 face a 70% import duty, while those priced above $40,000 face a 100% import duty. The government is reportedly contemplating a substantial reduction in these import duties, potentially bringing it down to 15% for all price ranges of electric vehicles. A meeting between Elon Musk and the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, is scheduled to discuss India's new policy on reduced tax rates for fully built EV imports. This move aims to encourage Tesla to establish its manufacturing unit in India. Talks between Tesla and the Indian government have been ongoing, with the government emphasizing local manufacturing and additional benefits as sticking points. The upcoming meeting intends to progress discussions positively and pave the way for significant developments in India's EV sector.</description>

			<title>Apple to allow sideloading apps shows iOS 17.2. Here’s why they are forced to comply with this dangerous step</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/apple-to-allow-sideloading-apps-shows-ios-17-2-here-is-why-apple-is-forced-to-comply-with-this-dangerous-step-13382852.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple's iOS 17.2 beta update's source code reveals that the company may allow users to sideload apps on their devices. This change comes as a response to the Digital Markets Act (DMA) imposed by the European Union, which requires tech companies to open up their services and platforms to other developers. The discovery of a new public framework called "Managed App Distribution" in the beta code suggests that Apple is introducing the capability to download apps from third-party app stores. While sideloading offers flexibility, it also poses risks such as exposing users to malicious software, compatibility issues, privacy violations, and piracy concerns. Despite these drawbacks, sideloading would give iPhone users the ability to download apps from external sources and provide iOS developers with an alternative to the App Store's revenue sharing model. Failure to comply with the DMA could result in fines for Apple. Although Apple has not officially announced this feature, the source code strongly indicates its implementation.</description>

			<title>Galactic Bizarre: 86 YO physics professor to send DNA to the Moon to have himself cloned by aliens</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/galactic-bizarre-86-year-old-physics-professor-to-send-dna-to-the-moons-to-have-himself-cloned-by-aliens-13382052.html</link>
			<description>An 86-year-old physics professor named Kenneth Ohm is sending his DNA to the Moon with hopes that aliens may find it and clone him, which has caught attention as a peculiar development in space exploration. Celestis, a Texas-based space company, has been launching cremated remains into orbit since 1997, including notable figures like Gene Roddenberry and physicist Gerard O’Neill. Ohm has chosen to send not only his cremated ashes but also his DNA to the Moon's south pole in a mission with Celestis. He envisions amusing scenarios of future civilizations encountering his DNA, but acknowledges the uncertainty with humor. While this idea may seem whimsical, preserving DNA for future inspections by terrestrial or extraterrestrial civilizations has rationality. Other individuals mentioned in the article have sentimental motivations for their space burials. Celestis' lunar plans include a memorial service on the Moon's surface, with capsules carrying remains and DNA left as a lasting tribute.</description>

			<description>According to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple plans to make iOS 18 one of its biggest and most significant updates in years. The update, which is about a year away, will heavily leverage artificial intelligence (AI).

The objective is to deliver the update with major new features, designs, and enhancements to performance and security. iOS 18 follows a series of relatively modest updates for iPhone and iPad users over the past few years, with the last significant update being iOS 14 in 2020. Despite the brief pause, the release of iOS 18 is not expected to be significantly delayed. The software is scheduled for introduction at WWDC 2024, approximately seven months from now.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/china-cries-foul-countrys-largest-chipmaker-ytmc-sues-micron-for-patent-infringement-13381682.html</link>
			<description>China's chipmaker, YMTC, has filed a lawsuit against U.S. rival Micron Technology, accusing them of infringing on eight of its patents. YMTC claims that Micron used its patented technology to gain and safeguard its market share without proper compensation. China has faced criticism in the past for disregarding international patents, with Chinese companies being accused of copying designs and schematics. Micron has not yet responded to the lawsuit. This legal dispute comes amid increasing U.S. restrictions on exporting chipmaking technology to China. Micron has previously been involved in legal disputes in China, which has resulted in a decline in its market share in the country. Nevertheless, Micron has expressed its commitment to the Chinese market by making investments and participating in trade expos.</description>

			<title>You will be shocked to know how much Apple spends to make iPhone 15 Pro Max that it sells for Rs 1.6 lakh</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/you-will-be-shocked-to-know-how-much-apple-spends-to-make-iphone-15-pro-max-that-it-sells-for-rs-1-6-lakh-13373232.html</link>
			<description>The iPhone 15 Pro Max is more expensive to produce than its predecessor, the iPhone 14 Pro Max, with a production cost increase of 8%. However, the Bill of Materials (BoM) for the iPhone 15 Pro Max remains under Rs 50,000. The increased production cost can be attributed to factors such as the use of the A17 Pro chip, which is built using a cutting-edge 3-nanometer process technology and costs an additional $30 per unit compared to the previous model. The inclusion of a new tetraprism lens for 5x optical zoom and a titanium alloy frame also contribute to the higher cost. Despite these increases, the iPhone 15 Pro Max maintains the highest profit margin in Apple's lineup due to factors like design control and the elimination of the 128GB version. It's important to note that research and development costs and shipping costs are not factored into this report.</description>

			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/chinas-largest-chipmaker-smics-quarterly-profit-value-fall-off-a-cliff-despite-huaweis-boost-13372022.html</link>
			<description>China's largest chip manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co (SMIC), reported an 80% decline in its quarterly profit due to weakened global demand in the foundry industry.

			<title>Major setback for Apple, faces tax bill of $14 billion in EU for artificially lowering taxes to 0.0005%</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/major-setback-for-apple-faces-a-tax-bill-of-14-billion-in-eu-13369722.html</link>
			<description>Apple is potentially facing a tax bill of 13 billion euros ($14 billion) in the EU after an advisor to Europe's highest court suggested that a lower tribunal's ruling in favor of Apple be reexamined. The EU accused Apple of artificially reducing its tax liability to as low as 0.005% in 2014. The case is part of the EU's efforts to combat unfair state aid given by EU countries to multinational companies. While this opinion is non-binding, the court typically follows such recommendations. The final ruling is expected in the coming months and will have significant implications for Apple's tax obligations in the EU.</description>

			<title>Soon, doctors may be able to diagnose Alzheimer's using just a simple blood test</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/world/doctors-may-be-able-to-diagnose-alzheimers-using-just-a-simple-blood-test-soon-13368072.html</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Researchers are working on developing blood tests that can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease, which has traditionally been a challenging and time-consuming process. While several blood tests for Alzheimer's are already in use for research purposes, they have not yet become standard practice for doctors. A coalition of UK medical research funders is leading a project to determine the most effective blood test for real-world diagnostic use. The goal is to have at least one blood test ready for routine use within the next five years. These blood tests focus on proteins associated with Alzheimer's, and they have shown comparable accuracy to spinal fluid tests currently used for diagnosis. The need for real-world assessment is important as clinical trials often lack diversity in their participant demographics. A reliable blood test could expedite the diagnostic process and could be especially useful for confirming the presence of amyloid buildup, which is important for certain treatments. While blood tests for Alzheimer's hold promise, it is important that they are used in a clinical context and under a doctor's guidance.</description>

			<title>End of an Era: Popular chat website Omegle forced to shut down for aiding ‘heinous crimes’</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/end-of-an-era-popular-chat-website-omegle-forced-to-shut-down-for-aiding-heinous-crimes-13367992.html</link>
			<description>Omegle, a popular video chat platform, is shutting down due to claims of abuse and involvement in heinous crimes. Founder Leif K Brooks stated that the website was no longer financially or psychologically sustainable. The platform gained significant popularity during the pandemic, particularly among children and young people. Omegle's closure was symbolized by an image of its logo on a gravestone, marking the end of an era in online communication. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing social media platforms, and Ofcom recently issued guidance for tech platforms under the UK Online Safety Act, focusing on addressing online grooming. Omegle has faced controversy, including a lawsuit where a user accused the platform of connecting her with a pedophile. While Omegle claimed it wasn't responsible for user actions, it has been under intense scrutiny. Brooks acknowledged the platform's shortcomings and the misuse by some users. Stress, financial burdens, and legal battles led to the overwhelming decision to close Omegle. The platform has been linked to over 50 cases involving pedophiles in multiple countries. Concerns about child safety led TikTok to ban sharing links to Omegle. The Internet Watch Foundation reported a drastic increase in explicit imagery involving children since the pandemic began, highlighting the need for online safety measures and regulation.</description>

			<description>WhatsApp, owned by Meta (formerly Facebook), is planning to display ads in certain areas of its mobile and desktop apps. In an interview, the head of WhatsApp, Will Cathcart, clarified that the app will not show ads in user inboxes or chats, but mentioned that potential ad placements could be in public channels and status updates. Cathcart also discussed the success of the WhatsApp Business API, which generated over $10 billion in revenue last year. Although WhatsApp currently relies on sources other than ads for revenue, experts suggest that ads within chats may be introduced in the future. WhatsApp is popular in India, Indonesia, and Brazil, and the company is committed to user privacy.</description>

			<title>Galactic Timber: NASA, Japanese researchers working on sending wooden satellite to space</title>
			<link>https://www.firstpost.com/tech/galactic-timber-nasa-japanese-researchers-working-on-sending-wooden-satellite-to-space-13365322.html</link>
			<description>NASA and Japanese researchers are collaborating to send a wooden satellite to space. The satellite, called Lignosat, is being crafted from magnolia wood by researchers at Kyoto University. Wood is being chosen for its unique advantages in the space environment, such as its ability to withstand drastic temperature fluctuations in space and its strength-to-weight ratio similar to aluminum. Additionally, wood can safely burn up in the Earth's atmosphere at the end of its operational life, reducing the issue of space debris. Scientists also speculate that wood may offer benefits for spacecraft interiors, potentially shielding astronauts from harmful radiation.</description>
