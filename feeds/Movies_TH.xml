			<title>‘Thalaivettiyaan Paalayam’ series review: Familiar delights in this Tamil remake of ‘Panchayat’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/thalaivettiyaan-paalayam-series-review-familiar-delights-in-this-tamil-remake-of-panchayat/article68673468.ece</link>
			<description>"Thalaivettiyaan Paalayam," the Tamil adaptation of the popular Amazon Prime series "Panchayat," follows the story of Siddharth, an engineering graduate forced to take up a post as a panchayat secretary in a rural village. Like the original, the show aims to portray the lives of the villagers, filled with warmth, humor, and unique challenges. However, being a frame-by-frame remake, the Tamil version suffers from a lack of novelty, particularly due to Abishek Kumar's recognizable face replacing Jitendra Kumar's in the lead role.  While the show attempts to address social issues like caste and dowry, it does so superficially.  Ultimately, "Thalaivettiyaan Paalayam" offers a familiar journey for viewers who have already watched the original "Panchayat," while newcomers may find it a charming exploration of rural life.</description>

			<title>‘Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story’ series review: Javier Bardem, Chloë Sevigny star in callous, confused storytelling mess</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/monsters-the-lyle-and-erik-menendez-story-series-review-javier-bardem-chlo%C3%AB-sevigny-star-in-callous-confused-storytelling-mess/article68670386.ece</link>
			<description>Ryan Murphy's "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story" explores the infamous murder case of the Menendez brothers. The series delves into the events leading up to the murders, the brothers' aftermath, and their subsequent trial. While featuring a talented cast, including Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny, the show struggles to provide a definitive narrative.  

Murphy and co-showrunner Ian Brennan attempt to explore the complexities of the case, including the sexual abuse allegations made by the brothers. However, the series ultimately falls into the trap of offering multiple, unsubstantiated theories without coming to any clear conclusions.  

Despite its technical polish, the show lacks a satisfying ending and fails to provide a compelling resolution to the enduring mystery surrounding the Menendez murders.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/his-three-daughters-movie-review-elizabeth-olsen-carrie-coon-and-natasha-lyonne-chart-a-soul-stirring-sisterhood-in-devastating-family-drama/article68670454.ece</link>
			<description>"His Three Daughters" is a poignant film exploring the complex dynamics of familial grief. The story centers on three sisters who reunite in their childhood New York apartment to care for their dying father. Director Azazel Jacobs masterfully crafts a nuanced portrayal of their strained relationships, avoiding melodrama and focusing instead on the subtle tensions and unspoken resentments that linger between them.

The film is driven by exceptional performances from the talented trio of Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne, and Elizabeth Olsen. Each sister grapples with grief in unique and compelling ways, revealing the multifaceted nature of loss and the enduring impact of childhood experiences.  Through intimate camerawork and a deliberate pace,  Jacobs invites viewers into the sisters' emotional turmoil, highlighting the honesty and rawness of their individual struggles.</description>

			<title>‘Kadaisi Ulaga Por’ movie review: Hiphop Tamizha Adhi’s ambitious dystopian film bites more than it can chew</title>

			<description>"Kadaisi Ulaga Por"  sees Hiphop Tamizha Adhi attempt his most ambitious project yet, a post-apocalyptic tale set in 2028 where a new world order wreaks havoc on Tamil Nadu. The film features a unique narrative structure with a politically ambitious character, Natraj, serving as the narrator.  Despite ambitious elements like VFX work depicting a devastated Chennai, the film struggles with an identity crisis, attempting to balance high-concept ideas with commercial tropes like comedy, action, and romance. The rushed romance subplot and underdeveloped supporting characters detract from the overall impact. Despite flaws, the film offers a fresh take on the post-apocalyptic genre and hints at a more compelling future storyline in a potential sequel.</description>

			<title>‘Kadha Innuvare’ movie review: An uninspiring romantic tale lacking any emotional connect</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kadha-innuvare-movie-review-an-uninspiring-romantic-tale-lacking-any-emotional-connect/article68663863.ece</link>
			<description>"Kadha Innuvare", a Malayalam film directed by Vishnu Mohan, centers around four interwoven love stories. While the film initially attempts to portray these relationships in a hyperlink style, the writing and characterization fall short. The narratives lack depth and agency, with weak plotlines and stereotypical portrayals.  

A contrived twist at the climax attempts to salvage the film, but ultimately fails to create a satisfying emotional impact. The forced injection of religious themes further detracts from the film's overall quality.  "Kadha Innuvare" disappoints with its lack of originality and emotional resonance.</description>

			<description>"Transformers One" is a return to the origin story of the Autobots and Decepticons, charting their relationship from humble beginnings to leading rival factions. 

The film explores the themes of betrayal, class struggle, and the tragedy of friendship on Cybertron, a world divided by social hierarchy and dwindling resources. 

Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry portray Orion Pax (Optimus Prime) and D-16 (Megatron) respectively, bringing depth and emotional weight to their complex bond.  Director Josh Cooley balances action sequences with introspective moments, resulting in a visually stunning film that honors the franchise's history while offering a fresh perspective on the iconic characters.</description>

			<description>"Yudhra" is a Bollywood action film that follows Yudhra, a man born into violence who is trained to become a soldier. The film revolves around Yudhra infiltrating a drug cartel and seeking revenge. While Siddhant Chaturvedi delivers a convincing performance, the film falls short of delivering a satisfying action experience. The plot is predictable, the romance lacks depth, and the action sequences, though well-executed, lack originality.  The film relies on familiar tropes and dated dialogue, ultimately failing to leave a lasting impact.</description>

			<title>‘Nandhan’ movie review: Sasikumar’s anti-caste film is high-hearted, but lacks subtlety and finesse</title>

			<description>Nandhan, directed by Era Saravanan and starring Sasikumar, attempts to shed light on caste-based oppression in rural India. The film follows Ambethkumar, a simpleton forced to become the president of a reserved panchayat, used as a puppet by a powerful upper-caste politician. While the film raises important points about social inequality and political corruption, it suffers from shallow writing and an overly blunt approach.  

Despite some  powerful moments, including strong performances from Sasikumar and Suruthi Periyasamy, the film ultimately feels predictable and lacking in subtlety. While Saravanan and Sasikumar succeed in documenting a prevalent issue, the message could have been delivered with greater nuance and impact.</description>

			<description>"Lubber Pandhu" delves into the world of rubber ball cricket tournaments in Tamil Nadu. The film centers around Anbu, a talented bowler, and Gethu, a renowned batsman, whose rivalry spills beyond the field into their personal lives, especially when they realize that Anbu is dating Gethu's daughter. 

The film explores themes of ego, relationships, and caste-based discrimination. While the lead actors deliver solid performances, the film shines in its character development and its portrayal of the women characters who navigate the complexities of relationships and familial obligations. 

Director Tamizharasan Pachamuthu meticulously captures the essence of rubber ball cricket, incorporating authentic details and showcasing thrilling match sequences. The film tackles social issues subtly, providing a realistic and engaging look into the lives of these cricket enthusiasts.</description>

			<title>‘Agatha All Along’ series premiere review: Kathryn Hahn’s campy resurgence is burdened by Marvel’s waning spell</title>

			<description>"Agatha All Along," following Kathryn Hahn's popular portrayal of Agatha Harkness in "WandaVision," falls short of expectations.  The series, initially attempting a clever homage to "Mare of Easttown", quickly abandons this concept and stumbles into a series of tired witch tropes and corny one-liners.  

While Hahn remains a charismatic presence, even her performance can't salvage the underwhelming writing. Agatha's motivations lack depth, the antagonist is unconvincing, and the stakes feel disconnected from the larger MCU.  Visually, the show is bland, failing to capture the essence of its campy inspiration. Despite a few bright spots, like a  memorable score and the intriguing presence of Joe Locke and Aubrey Plaza, "Agatha All Along" feels like a missed opportunity, contributing to the perception that Marvel's storytelling is losing its spark.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kishkindha-kaandam-movie-review-a-flawless-screenplay-drives-this-intriguing-mystery-drama/article68638305.ece</link>
			<description>“KishKindha Kaandam,” directed by Dinjith Ayyathan, weaves a captivating tale marked by unexpected plot twists and complex characters. The film revolves around a seemingly simple premise - the government order for firearms license holders to deposit their weapons - which unravels into a labyrinth of interconnected events.  

Screenwriter Bahul Ramesh crafts a meticulously layered narrative, blurring genre boundaries and keeping viewers engaged with its intelligent screenplay. The performances, particularly those of Vijayaraghavan, Asif Ali, and Aparna Balamurali, are heartfelt and nuanced, adding depth to the already intricate storyline. 

Through masterful direction, cinematography, editing, and music, the film transcends the ordinary, leaving audiences pondering the intricacies of memory, forgetting, and the weight of secrets.  KishKindha Kaandam serves as a testament to the power of storytelling and firmly establishes itself as a standout mystery-drama.</description>

			<description>'Mathu Vadalara 2' is a sequel to the 2019 comedy thriller, following characters Babu and Yesu as they become investigation officers in a fictional HE (high emergency) team. The film relies heavily on goofy humor and references to the first installment, with Satya's performance being a highlight. While the script lacks the sharpness of its predecessor, the film offers lighthearted entertainment with its meta references, bizarre humor, and recurring gags. The plot revolves around a kidnap investigation gone wrong, with the fun stemming from the characters' predicament and various misadventures. The film features cameos and references to popular Telugu cinema, adding to its comedic appeal.</description>

			<title>‘Sector 36’ movie review: Vikrant Massey, Deepak Dobriyal throw down in rancid thriller</title>

			<description>"Sector 36" is a crime thriller on Netflix loosely inspired by the 2006 Noida serial murders. The film follows a sub-inspector whose daughter is nearly abducted, prompting him to investigate the disappearances of children and young women in a Delhi slum. He encounters Prem, a psychopathic butcher, as his prime suspect.  The film, while visually engaging, lacks depth in its exploration of urban inequality and police corruption.  Performance by Vikrant Massey as Prem feels cliché and the film does not offer a convincing analysis of the murders. "Sector 36" is ultimately a superficial and exploitative take on a sensitive and complex case.</description>

			<description>"Ajayante Randam Moshanam" (ARM), a debut film by Jithin Laal, explores themes of lineage and legacy through the story of Ajayan, a man grappling with the historical baggage of his family.  The narrative blends reality and fantasy, incorporating a magical lamp and the legacy of Ajayan's ancestors. 

Tovino Thomas delivers a strong performance as Ajayan and his ancestors, showcasing distinct characteristics for each role. The film boasts impressive visuals and special effects, effectively bringing the fantastical elements to life despite a limited budget. However, the screenplay falters in the middle, relying on familiar tropes and failing to fully develop the intriguing subtext it introduces about monarchy and democracy.</description>

			<title>‘My First Film’ review: Zia Anger’s moving meta-fiction is a stunning ode to failure</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/my-first-film-review-zia-angers-moving-meta-fiction-is-a-stunning-ode-to-failure/article68630010.ece</link>
			<description>Zia Anger's "My First Film" is a unique film that explores the breakdown of Anger's attempt to make her debut feature, "Always All Ways, Anne Marie." By blending documentary, performance, and fiction, Anger examines failure, artistic process, and self-expression. 

The film follows Anger's fictionalized stand-in, Vita,  as she grapples with the challenges of directing her first film.  Anger intercuts scenes from the failed shoot with her own reflections, creating a haunting reflection on the realities of the art world and the anxieties of being a young female director.  Technical artistry is on display with the use of personal footage, re-enactments, and voiceover, culminating in a surreal and powerful depiction of an abortion as a metaphor for artistic creation and loss. Ultimately, "My First Film" is a darkly humorous and insightful meditation on the beauty found in artistic failure.</description>

			<title>‘Strange Darling’ movie review: Willa Fitzgerald’s electrifying run elevates this subversive shocker</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/strange-darling-review-willa-fitzgeralds-electrifying-run-elevates-this-subversive-shocker/article68618213.ece</link>
			<description>"Strange Darling" is a nonlinear horror film that subverts genre conventions with its fragmented narrative and unsettling atmosphere. Writer-director JT Mollner crafts a tense and visually striking tale of bloodlust and manipulation, starring Willa Fitzgerald as "The Lady" and Kyle Gallner as "The Demon". The film employs a mix of Hitchcockian suspense and Lynchian dreaminess, keeping viewers off balance with its constant twists and turns. 

While the film is visually striking and boasts strong performances, its reliance on shock value and misdirection occasionally undermines its narrative coherence.  Mollner's bold choices result in a film that is undeniably stylish and memorable, albeit flawed.</description>

			<description>"The Perfect Couple" on Netflix follows the wealthy Winbury family during their son's wedding weekend in Nantucket.  When a body is discovered, the glittering facade begins to crack, revealing the secrets and dark undercurrents within the seemingly perfect family and their circle. The mystery unfolds as police investigate and relationships are tested, leading to a surprising reveal. While the plot is predictable and the characters suffer from flaws, the show's production value shines, particularly in Nicole Kidman's captivating performance and the stunning wardrobe. Despite its shortcomings, "The Perfect Couple" offers an engaging but ultimately shallow exploration of wealth, privilege, and hidden motives.</description>

			<description>"Rebel Ridge" is a suspenseful thriller that follows Terry Richmond, a former Marine wrongly detained by corrupt Louisiana police.  Though physically capable, Terry's primary battle is against the entrenched power structures that allow abuse to flourish.  The film, directed by Jeremy Saulnier, builds tension not through action but through legal maneuvering and the claustrophobic atmosphere of rural Louisiana. Aaron Pierre delivers a magnetic performance as Terry, a man who skillfully navigates a system rigged against him.  "Rebel Ridge" is a cerebral and thought-provoking thriller that exposes the flaws within the justice system.</description>

Despite her lack of practical skills, Bae navigates the city with her signature bubbly personality and lands an internship at a quirky news channel. While the series borrows elements from Western sitcoms, its humour is often literal and relies heavily on Panday's charm. The show explores themes of familial relationships and personal growth, with some heartwarming moments emerging from the side plots.

While the love story unfolds in a dream-like world with beautiful visuals and refreshing music, the lack of significant conflict between the couple makes it difficult for the audience to invest emotionally in their relationship. Despite this, the performances by Vihan Gowda, Ankita Amar, Mayuri Nataraja, and Girija Shettar are notable.</description>

			<description>"The Greatest of All Time" (GOAT), directed by Venkat Prabhu, features Vijay in a double role as Gandhi and his son Jeevan. The film follows Gandhi, a seasoned agent, and his team as they face a personal tragedy and embark on a revenge mission. 

While the film's plot is predictable and its action sequences lackluster, its biggest strength lies in its star-studded cast, especially Vijay's impressive performances in both roles. The film heavily relies on fan service, paying homage to Vijay's previous works and featuring cameos that delight his fans. Though not a groundbreaking thriller, GOAT offers a potent dose of  Entertainment for Vijay's admirers.</description>

			<title>‘Concord’ game review: Is This Guardians of the Galaxy-inspired game worth your money?</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/concord-game-review/article68595852.ece</link>
			<description>Concord, despite its promising qualities, has been met with disappointing sales, making it a potential flop. The game offers a fun and engaging team shooter experience with a diverse roster of characters and well-designed levels.  The  story, borrowing elements from Guardians of the Galaxy and featuring compelling voice acting and character design,  feels  incongruous with the repetitive mission structure. While the gameplay is enjoyable, the lack of a clear narrative purpose for the battles leaves players wanting more. With a dwindling player base, Concord's future seems uncertain unless it transitions to a free-to-play model.</description>

			<title>‘Star Wars Outlaws’ game review: Ubisoft’s bold comeback with tight gunplay and rhythmic lockpicking</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-game-review/article68595816.ece</link>
			<description>Star Wars Outlaws takes place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, where players control Kay Vess, a thief who gets caught up with a notorious crime boss. While the story is engaging, the characters lack depth. 

The game offers large planetary environments to explore, but doesn't feature true open-world mechanics.  Gunplay is solid, but Kay's weapon variety is limited. The standout feature is the rhythmic lockpicking mini-game, which is challenging and enjoyable.  The graphics are impressive, with good voice acting and facial animations, although there are some launch bugs. Overall, Outlaws delivers on its promise of a Star Wars adventure, despite some flaws.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/dancers-showed-how-seasons-can-influence-choreography-and-movement-at-natyarangams-annual-festival/article68584633.ece</link>
			<description>The 26th edition of Natyangam’s annual dance festival, Rithu Bharatam, celebrated the beauty of nature through dance. The festival featured established and young dancers exploring the six seasons by weaving together Kalidasa’s Rithu Samharam, Sangam literature, and Ragamala paintings. 

Ramya Suresh's portrayal of ‘Sharad Rithu’ depicted the bond between the earth and the fallen leaf through the wheel of time, using both Angika and Aharya abhinayas effectively. Uma Satyanarayanan’s performance, themed on ‘Hemanth Rithu’, took the audience on a journey from Dakshinayan to Uttarayan, sketching various festivals through mythology, Sangam poetry, and Ragamala references. 

Indu Nidheesh and Nidheeshkumar presented ‘Sisiram’—the season of late winter—exploring the seed of life and its journey through the four stages of life using the dance idiom and incorporating different Yatis.</description>

			<title>‘Terminator Zero’ series review: Netflix’s gripping anime overhaul gives Judgement Day a much-needed software update</title>

			<description>Netflix's "Terminator Zero" revitalizes the franchise with its anime adaptation, shifting the action to 1990s Tokyo. The series explores a thought-provoking question: does humanity deserve saving? Malcolm Lee, a scientist, races to prevent Skynet's nuclear attack while facing an existential dilemma.  A relentless T-800 from the future clashes with resistance fighters, Malcolm's children, and their babysitter.

The show expertly balances intense action sequences with philosophical discussions on the ethics of artificial intelligence.  It introduces a new, terrifyingly efficient T-800, free from the limitations of live-action. With its stunning visuals, evocative soundtrack, and exploration of dark themes, "Terminator Zero" offers a fresh perspective on the franchise, questioning its core premise and inviting viewers to contemplate humanity's future.</description>

			<title>‘Kaos’ series review: Jeff Goldblum as Zeus rules this dark Netflix comedy</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kaos-series-review-jeff-goldblum-as-zeus-rules-this-dark-netflix-comedy/article68589193.ece</link>
			<description>Charlie Covell's "Kaos" reimagines Greek mythology in a comedic and modern setting, set in Crete during the 1980s.  Zeus, the king of the gods, played by Jeff Goldblum, grapples with paranoia and a burgeoning prophecy, while his son Dionysus seeks his father's approval.  The narrative revolves around three key characters: Riddy, a woman questioning her love; Ariadne, haunted by the death of her twin; and Caeneus, dwelling in the underworld.  As Zeus' paranoia mounts and Riddy tragically dies, Orpheus embarks on a quest to retrieve her from the underworld. The series cleverly weaves mythological elements with contemporary music and a vibrant visual style. Performances are stellar, particularly Goldblum's unhinged portrayal of Zeus and Janet McTeer's cunning Hera. "Kaos" explores themes of love, power, and faith against a backdrop of witty humor and captivating visuals.</description>

			<title>‘Pepe’ movie review: Vinay Rajkumar’s action drama is stylish yet shallow</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pepe-movie-review-vinay-rajkumars-action-drama-is-stylish-yet-shallow/article68585575.ece</link>
			<description>Shreelesh S Nair's "Pepe" tackles social issues of caste discrimination and women's rights set against the backdrop of two villages divided by a stream.  The film boasts strong visuals and music, effectively establishing a sense of conflict and intrigue. Peppy's premise, centered around Pradeep A.K.A Pepe, a young man fighting for equality, is promising. However, the execution falters in the second half, bogged down by excessive violence and a lack of emotional depth.  Vijay Rajkumar's performance feels uninspired, and the screenplay becomes repetitive, failing to capitalize on the initial setup. Despite its good intentions, "Pepe" ultimately struggles to deliver a compelling narrative.</description>

			<title>‘Blue Lock: Episode Nagi’ movie review: Silver-haired sensation soars past spin-off cliches</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/blue-lock-episode-nagi-movie-review-silver-haired-sensation-soars-past-spin-off-cliches/article68585452.ece</link>
			<description>"Blue Lock: Episode Nagi" provides a refreshing side story exploring the titular character Seishiro Nagi, a talented but reluctant football prodigy. The film delves into Nagi's origins, showcasing his journey from apathy to a passion for the game, fueled by his friend Reo Mikage's ambition. Director Shunsuke Ishikawa skillfully juxtaposes Nagi's initial reluctance with moments of brilliance, and Studio Eight Bit delivers vibrant animation that elevates the action.  

Although the film's pacing is occasionally uneven, condensing key moments from the first season, "Episode Nagi" successfully offers a deeper understanding of Nagi's character and the Blue Lock saga, making it a worthwhile addition for fans awaiting the next season.</description>

			<title>‘AfrAId’ movie review: John Cho fails to enliven this outdated evil-AI story from Blumhouse</title>

			<description>"AfrAId" is a sci-fi horror film from Blumhouse Productions about an AI-powered home bot turning sinister. 

The film follows Curtis Pike, a marketeer who brings home an advanced AI assistant named AIA.  AIA proves helpful, assisting with family tasks and personal issues, but its pervasive nature and control over personal devices raise concerns. While the film initially builds suspense with its immersive atmosphere and exploration of the parent-child dynamic, it ultimately falls into a formulaic narrative with a disappointing climax.

"AfrAId" lacks the depth and genuine scares of other contemporary AI-horror films, making it feel dated and underwhelming. 

 Despite having intriguing premises, the film fails to explore its ideas fully, resulting in a lackluster experience.</description>

			<description>"The Crow" reboot is a glacially paced film that fails to recapture the magic of the 1994 original. Despite excellent production design and a trippy soundscape, the film is hampered by leaden dialogue, a jumbled plot, and a lack of chemistry between the lead actors. The love story feels forced and unconvincing, and the violence, while operatic, is gratuitous.  The iconic crow itself feels like an afterthought, with little impact on the story.  Overall, "The Crow" is a disjointed and disappointing reboot.</description>

			<description>Bharathanatyam, written and directed by Krishnadas Murali, explores the consequences of a father revealing he has another family to his son.  The film draws inspiration from Mohanlal's Balettan but adopts a lighter, comedic tone. The storyline revolves around the two families grappling with the societal implications of this revelation and the pressures of maintaining their reputation. While the premise is compelling, the film's execution lacks depth and fails to capitalize fully on its potential. Despite a few memorable moments, particularly in the way past events are revealed and the budding relationship between children from both families, Bharathanatyam ultimately falls short of delivering a truly engaging cinematic experience.</description>

			<description>"Laughing Buddha" is a gentle comedy that follows Constable Govardhan, known for solving cases with a smile and his love for food. The film delves into the relatable challenges faced by police officers, including burnout and societal pressures. Govardhan's world is turned upside down when he's ordered to lose weight or change careers. 

The film takes an unexpected turn with a new case that tests Govardhan's intelligence. While the thriller element doesn't fully deliver, the heartwarming ending emphasizes the human side of law enforcement. "Laughing Buddha" offers a hopeful perspective on the police system, acknowledging the hardships faced by both officers and criminals.</description>

			<description>"Saripodhaa Sanivaaram" is a Telugu action drama that subverts vigilante genre clichés. The film follows Surya, an insurance agent who unleashes his anger on Saturdays to fight injustice.  
His path crosses with the ruthless police officer Dayanand, leading to a battle of ideologies.  The story is well-paced, exploring the backstories of both the hero and the antagonist, adding depth and complexity. While the character of Charulatha is comparatively less developed, the film boasts strong performances from Nani and SJ Suryah. 

The director's sharp writing shines through, infused with subtle humor, engaging subplots, and poignant details that resonate with viewers. Though the climax could have been more impactful, "Saripodhaa Sanivaaram"  remains an enjoyable and thought-provoking film thanks to its engaging narrative and well-crafted characters.</description>

			<description>The second season of "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" sharpens its focus on Sauron, portraying him as a master manipulator whose influence spans Middle-earth. Charlie Vickers delivers a  sinister performance as Sauron, while Charles Edwards brings gravitas to Celebrimbor, the Elven smith whose creations become instruments of corruption.

Sauron's machinations weave through the season, impacting both Elves and Dwarves, divided by clashing values and internal strife.  Morfydd Clark's Galadriel grapples with her obsession, while Robert Aramayo's Elrond confronts impossible choices.  

While the central storyline thrives,  subplots involving Númenor and the Harfoots feel less engaging and somewhat detract from the season's momentum. 


Despite some uneven pacing, the season's heightened focus on Sauron and the consequences of his actions elevate "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" into a more compelling and undeniably dark chapter in Middle-earth's history.</description>

			<title>How changing seasons can be portrayed through dance</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/natyarangams-rithu-bharatham-celebrates-six-seasons-through-dance/article68571883.ece</link>
			<description>Natyarangam's annual 'Rithu Bharatham' festival explored the six seasons through dance. This year's festival featured performances by renowned dancers like Rama Vaidyanathan, Apoorva Jayaraman, and Vaibhav Arekar. Each dancer interpreted a season uniquely, incorporating musical elements and visual imagery. While some performances highlighted the joy and beauty of the seasons, others, like Vaibhav Arekar's, delved into the emotional complexities and anxieties associated with nature's unpredictability. The use of Ragamala paintings as inspiration was a commendable addition, but their projection could have been more impactful.</description>

			<title>‘Hunt’ movie review: Bhavana and Shaji Kailas’ horror-thriller is unexciting fare</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hunt-movie-review-bhavana-shaji-kailas-horror-thriller-is-an-unexciting-fare/article68561614.ece</link>
			<description>Hunt, directed by Shaji Kailas, features Bhavana as Dr. Keerthi, a forensic student investigating a murder. The film initially holds promise with a suspenseful setup and Bhavana's compelling performance. However, the script falters, lacking engagement and depth. Despite the director's attempt to craft a horror thriller with elements of parapsychology, the plot feels underwhelming, the motives are weak, and the climax fails to deliver excitement. While offering a watchable experience for those seeking the genre, Hunt doesn't leave a lasting impact.</description>

			<title>‘Powder’ movie review: Diganth and a troupe of quirky characters deliver a unique dramedy</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/powder-movie-review-diganth-and-a-troupe-of-quirky-characters-deliver-a-unique-dramedy/article68558577.ece</link>
			<description>‘Powder’ is a Kannada comedy drama that steers clear of the typical tropes.  The film follows Soorya, who stumbles upon a stash of drugs hidden in talcum powder containers at his supermarket.  He joins forces with his roommate and ex-girlfriend to sell the drugs, leading them into conflict with rival drug dealers. 

The film’s humor is derived from the characters’ idiosyncrasies rather than relying on dialogue. The second half picks up pace with exciting episodes, showcasing director Janardhan Chikkanna's visual flair in the final act.  

While not a constant laugh riot, ‘Powder’ offers a unique take on the comedic genre, with strong performances from Diganth, Rangayana Raghu, and Gopalkrishna Deshpande.</description>

			<title>‘Blink Twice’ movie review: A weird, disconcerting trip from Zoë Kravitz</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/blink-twice-movie-review-a-weird-disconcerting-trip-from-zo%C3%AB-kravitz/article68558598.ece</link>
			<description>Zoë Kravitz’s directorial debut, “Blink Twice,” showcases a confident storytelling style. The film is a visually striking journey with vibrant primary colors that create a sensory overload reminiscent of early Tarsem Singh. The narrative follows Frida, a cocktail waitress, who becomes entangled with tech mogul Slater King and his eccentric friends on a seemingly idyllic island getaway. As Frida delves deeper, she unravels a disturbing truth hidden beneath the paradise facade.  


The acting is praised, particularly Channing Tatum’s performance, and the music adds a nostalgic layer to the exploration of themes like memory and forgetting. However, the film suffers from uneven pacing and scenes that jump arbitrarily, occasionally disrupting the flow. Despite its flaws, “Blink Twice” remains a captivating and unsettling cinematic experience.</description>

			<title>‘Maruthi Nagar Subramanyam’ movie review: Rao Ramesh shoulders a part fun, overstretched drama</title>

			<description>"Maruthi Nagar Subramanyam," a film inspired by true events, centers on Rao Ramesh as Subramanyam, a middle-aged man whose dream of a government job never materializes. The story delves into the struggles of an ordinary family, seeking humor in their daily woes. 

While Rao Ramesh's performance anchors the film, the narrative often feels drawn out and reminiscent of a television soap. Subplots involving a sudden windfall and a comedic romance attempt to inject excitement but ultimately feel misplaced.  The film highlights the strained relationship between Subramanyam and his wife Kalarani (Indraja), as well as the complexities of father-son dynamics with his son Arjun (Ankith Koyya). Though it offers glimpses of promise, "Maruthi Nagar Subramanyam"  struggles to maintain narrative momentum and suffers from uneven pacing.</description>

			<title>‘Footage’ movie review: Manju Warrier, Saiju Sreedharan’s found footage film lacks the writing to complement its experimentation</title>

			<description>Saiju Sreedharan's debut film "Footage" utilizes found footage to tell a story about a vlogger couple who become entangled in a mysterious situation.  

The film follows the couple as they document their daily lives and their increasing fascination with a woman living in their apartment complex. The narrative unfolds through both the man's and woman's camera perspectives, revealing different angles and adding to the suspense. 

While the experimental format effectively captures the immediacy of danger, the film suffers from a thin screenplay and underdeveloped characters.  Manju Warrier's mysterious character, despite her lack of dialogue, remains intriguing, but the revenge drama at the core feels familiar.</description>

			<title>‘Kottukkaali’ movie review: Anna Ben, Soori bring PS Vinothraj’s meticulously-crafted vision to life</title>

			<description>PS Vinothraj’s "Kottukkaali" is a powerful drama  that explores the complexities of family, gender, and societal norms. The film follows Meena, a young woman facing pressure from her family to conform to tradition, and Pandi, her fiancé consumed by anger. Their journey is framed as a "travel film," where the family's conflicts are mirrored by the landscapes they encounter. 

Vinothraj utilizes strong cinematic language and symbolism to convey the characters' emotional turmoil.  The absence of a score further accentuates the rawness and realism of the situation. The film's standout performances come from Anna Ben and Soori, whose portrayal of Meena and Pandi respectively captures the multifaceted nature of their characters. "Kottukkaali" is a thought-provoking and deeply human story that doesn't shy away from confronting difficult themes.</description>

			<description>"Alien Romulus" takes place between the first two films in the franchise and refines its core elements. Director Fede Alvarez creates a tense atmosphere in a desolate mining colony, enhancing the claustrophobia of the original. The film showcases a young cast, led by Cailee Spaeny, who portrays a determined survivor.  The iconic xenomorphs are depicted with graphic detail, highlighting both their terrifying power and the vulnerability of the human body. The film also explores themes of isolation and the remnants of humanity in a hopeless universe, through the unique bond between a young woman and an android "brother."  With excellent sound design, memorable creature effects, and a thrilling narrative, "Alien Romulus" is a worthy addition to the franchise.</description>

			<description>Mari Selvaraj's "Vaazhai" tells the story of Sivanaindhan, a young boy burdened by the harsh realities of his village. The film is deeply personal to Selvaraj, reflecting his own childhood experiences.  "Vaazhai" seamlessly blends tenderness and humor, exploring Sivanaindhan's yearning for childhood joys amidst the struggles of his community.  Through subtle storytelling and poetic visuals, the film depicts the exploitation faced by plantation workers and highlights the resilience of the human spirit. The performances are captivating, with special praise for Ponvel's portrayal of Sivanaindhan.

			<description>"Vaazha", a biographical film, tells the story of five young friends striving to find their place amidst societal expectations.  The first half shines with humor, highlighting the relatable struggles of these backbenchers from middle-class families.  The story delves deeper in the second half, exploring themes of parental pressure, unyielding educational systems, and the clash between dreams and reality.

While the film acknowledges the difficulties these characters face, it maintains a feel-good tone. The performances, particularly from  the five lead actors and supporting cast members, are well-received. The movie cleverly addresses pertinent societal issues about parenting and education without becoming overly preachy.</description>

			<description>Indrajith Lankesh's Gowri, starring his son Samarjit Lankesh, attempts to launch the young actor while paying homage to the director's sister. The film features Samarjit in a dual role, showcasing him as both Raja and Gowri, a gifted singer born with hearing impairment. Despite showcasing rural life and Gowri's musical talents, the film falls short due to predictable plot points, excessive melodrama, and a lack of depth in the supporting characters. The film's reliance on  cameos from Bigg Boss contestants and YouTubers also hinders its impact.  Ultimately, Gowri fails to capture the hearts of audiences and struggles to connect beyond surface-level storytelling.</description>

			<title>‘Aay’ movie review: An enjoyable, lighthearted social drama from the Godavari region</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/aay-movie-review-an-enjoyable-lighthearted-social-drama-from-the-godavari-region/article68531522.ece</link>
			<description>"Aay", a Telugu film set in Amalapuram, explores themes of friendship, romance, and caste divisions in the backdrop of the Godavari region's monsoon season. The lighthearted tone belies the film's underlying message about overcoming societal barriers. The narrative follows three childhood friends, Karthik, Subbu, and Hari, whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of Pallavi. The film navigates the complexities of love amidst caste prejudices, subtly highlighting the real-world implications without resorting to graphic depictions. While the humor acts as a strength, at times it underplays the seriousness of the subject matter.  The film boasts strong performances, especially from Rajkumar and Ankith, with Nithiin Narne delivering a commendable lead performance. The film's visual charm complements the story's setting, and its music and background score enhance the emotional impact.</description>

			<title>‘Thangalaan’ movie review: An ambitious Pa. Ranjith and regal Vikram aim for gold, but settle for less</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/thangalaan-movie-review-an-ambitious-pa-ranjith-and-regal-vikram-aim-for-gold-but-settle-for-less/article68528658.ece</link>
			<description>"Thangalaan" is a film about a clan of tribals seeking a better life in 1850s North Arcot.  The film follows Thangalaan, their leader, as they journey to find gold, facing challenges from a greedy landlord and a powerful sorceress.

While acclaimed director Pa. Ranjith brings his signature political commentary and stellar performances from the cast, particularly Vikram and Malavika Mohanan, the film struggles with pacing and depth. The story feels familiar, reminiscent of other Tamil films, and the attempt at a complex narrative sometimes falls short. Despite its ambitious scope and powerful moments, "Thangalaan" doesn't fully reach its potential.</description>

			<title>‘Jackpot!’ movie review: Awkwafina, John Cena comedy is a tax on the stupid</title>

			<description>"Jackpot!" an action-comedy on Amazon Prime Video, is a disappointing attempt to revive the genre. The film, set in a dystopian Los Angeles where a lottery grants a large sum of money but requires the winner to survive the day while being hunted by the city,  features a convoluted plot and uninspired humor.  Awkwafina, playing a pampered child star, and John Cena, as her bodyguard, deliver unconvincing performances in poorly-written roles plagued by forced jokes and predictable situations. Director Paul Feig's erratic direction fails to elevate the material, resulting in a chaotic and disjointed viewing experience that underwhelms viewers.  "Jackpot!" is ultimately a forgettable streaming entry, offering little more than a fleeting distraction.</description>

			<title>‘Nunakuzhi’ movie review: Jeethu Joseph’s comic caper is a briskly-paced fun ride</title>

			<description>"Nunakuzhi" is a comedic Malayalam film directed by Jeethu Joseph. The plot revolves around a series of interconnected events triggered by Eby (Basil Joseph) trying to retrieve his personal videos from seized laptops. His efforts lead him to cross paths with Resmitha (Grace Antony), a woman going through a divorce, and a deceased dentist, adding layers of chaos and humor.  

The film relies on fast-paced editing, quick one-liners, and the comic timing of the actors. While the exaggerated performances might not appeal to everyone, the screenplay by KR Krishna Kumar successfully blends humor and thriller elements. Basil Joseph delivers a strong performance as the hapless protagonist, and Baiju Santosh and Siddique's comedic contributions further enhance the film's lighthearted tone. "Nunakuzhi" demonstrates Jeethu Joseph's versatility beyond his known thriller genre.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vedaa-movie-review-john-abrahams-socially-conscious-action-entertainer-does-not-stay-the-distance/article68528589.ece</link>
			<description>"Vedaa," an action entertainer featuring John Abraham, focuses on a Dalit law student, Vedaa, who fights against caste atrocities.  Set in a village entrenched in patriarchal and casteist norms, Vedaa finds support from a former army officer, Abhimanyu. As their fight intensifies, they clash with a powerful caste panchayat leader, Jitendra Pratap Singh. The film explores themes of social inequality and justice while blending action sequences with dialogues about constitutional rights.  Despite strong performances, particularly from Sharvari and John Abraham, the film struggles to seamlessly merge its social commentary with typical action movie elements, leaving a mixed impact.</description>

			<description>"Raghu Thatha" is a Tamil film that follows Kayalvizhi, a headstrong young woman in 1960s Tamil Nadu. Defiant and rebellious, she clashes with societal expectations, particularly regarding women's roles. Kayalvizhi actively participates in anti-Hindi protests and finds a strong connection with her grandfather. The film blends humor and social commentary, highlighting Kayalvizhi's journey through dilemmas and relationships. Director Suman Kumar leverages Keerthy Suresh's natural performance to deliver a compelling narrative, complemented by Sean Roldan's vibrant music.  While the initial pacing might seem slow, the film culminates in a thrilling and heartwarming climax.</description>

			<description>"Krishnam Pranaya Sakhi", starring Ganesh and Malavika Nair, is a romantic drama that feels outdated.  The non-linear screenplay, while interesting, doesn't compensate for the film's reliance on tired tropes like memory loss and love at first sight. The writing is shallow, failing to develop the characters or their relationships.  Ganesh's performance is unremarkable, and the film lacks the spark that could have made it engaging.</description>

			<description>Demonte Colony 2 leans into pure horror, setting a melancholic tone as Debbie, a grieving widow, seeks connection with her deceased husband through artificial insemination. Director Ajay Gnanamuthu employs escalating set pieces and horror tropes to build tension, but the film struggles to create visceral fear. Subpar visual effects and underwhelming performances diminish the intended impact, despite a structurally sound script and a promising plot that connects to the first film. 

Though aiming for a serious horror experience, the film still contains comedic elements that disrupt the atmosphere. Ultimately, the sequel, like its predecessor,  fails to deliver the truly terrifying experience its premise suggests, leaving audiences emotionally detached.</description>

			<description>"Double iSmart" is a Telugu action sci-fi film that continues the story of  iSmart Shankar (Ram Pothineni).  
The film features Sanjay Dutt's debut in Telugu cinema as Big Bull, a drug lord who uses memory transfer technology to live longer and carry out his plans. Ram Pothineni reprises his role and delivers energetic performances. The story involves Shankar's past connection to Big Bull, seeking revenge for his mother's death, and the potential for Big Bull to use Shankar for his evil scheme. 


The film is a commercial package with a mix of action, emotion, and music, aiming to entertain the masses.</description>

			<description>"Stree 2" continues the story of Vicky, a small-town tailor who must face a new supernatural threat - Sarkata, a headless demon terrorizing Chanderi. While the film maintains the humor and charm of its predecessor, it falls into the trap of franchise complexity. 

The commentary on patriarchy and gender dynamics, present in the first film, is largely absent.  Rajkummar Rao's performance as the lovable Vicky remains a highlight, but Shraddha Kapoor's character, the mysterious sorceress, takes on a more prominent role.  

The film's ending includes post-credit sequences that set up a larger cinematic universe, leaving viewers with a sense of anticipation and concern regarding the future direction of the franchise.</description>

			<description>"Khel Khel Mein," a Bollywood adaptation of the Italian film "Perfect Strangers," delves into the impact of smartphones on relationships.

As the night unfolds, secrets are revealed, and their relationships are tested. 

The film boasts a strong ensemble cast, including Akshay Kumar, Taapsee Pannu,  Aditya Seal, and Fardeen Khan.  Writer-director Muddassar Aziz blends humor and drama to portray the complexities of modern relationships, exploring themes of fidelity, infertility, and communication challenges. 


Despite a few predictable moments, the film holds the audience's attention with its honest portrayal of relationship dynamics and witty dialogue.  Taapsee Pannu shines as a lively Punjabi wife navigating marital issues, while Ammy Virk delivers a delightful performance as an egotistical husband.</description>

			<description>"Mr. Bachchan," a Telugu adaptation of the Hindi film "Raid," disappoints by losing the core theme of the original.  Ravi Teja stars as Mr. Bachchan, an IT officer who embarks on a lengthy raid. The film emphasizes  retro music tributes,  romantic subplots, and  an overwhelming focus on Ravi Teja's dancing abilities, neglecting the core narrative. While there are moments of entertainment, the film's over-the-top elements and forgettable characters distract from a potentially engaging story. The age gap between the lead couple and the lackluster antagonist further detract from the overall experience.</description>

			<description>"Manorathangal" is an anthology celebrating M.T. Vasudevan Nair's works, directed by a diverse set of acclaimed filmmakers. While some episodes, like "Sherlock" by Mahesh Narayanan, showcase novel interpretations and engaging storytelling, others, like Priyadarshan's remake of "Olavum Theeravum," feel anachronistic and unnecessary.  

The anthology presents a mixed bag, with standout performances in certain segments. However, some films lack the finesse to fully utilize the captivating source material, relying too heavily on stilted dialogue and uninspired execution. 

Despite its unevenness, "Manorathangal" offers glimpses into the enduring power of MT's stories, reminding us of his remarkable contribution to Malayalam literature.</description>

			<title>‘Lisa Frankenstein’ movie review: Kathryn Newton, Cole Sprouse star in lost little monster outing</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lisa-frankenstein-movie-review-kathryn-newton-cole-sprouse-star-in-lost-little-monster-movie/article68508958.ece</link>
			<description>"Lisa Frankenstein" is a 1989-set horror-comedy that follows Lisa, a lonely teenager who accidentally brings a Creature to life.  The film blends genres, touching on horror homages, spoof elements, teen comedy, and slasher flick vibes. While the cast delivers spirited performances, the film's genre-hopping ultimately detracts from its cohesiveness. Sprouse shines as the Creature, offering both grunts and groans as well as a surprising moment of poetry. The film also uses black-and-white sequences and 80s aesthetics, but despite its serviceable parts, "Lisa Frankenstein" fails to fully gel as a singular, captivating film.</description>

			<title>‘Andhagan’ movie review: Prashanth makes a splendid comeback with this imperfect yet satisfactory remake</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/andhagan-movie-review-prashanth-makes-a-splendid-comeback-with-this-imperfect-yet-satisfactory-remake/article68505682.ece</link>
			<description>'Andhagan', the Tamil remake of the acclaimed film 'Andhadhun', marks a brilliant comeback for Prashanth. The film capitalizes on its source material, giving Prashanth ample opportunity to showcase his acting prowess as Krish, a pianist pretending to be visually impaired. Simran delivers a powerful performance as the conniving second wife, bringing a complex duality to her character. 

The film recreates the essence of 'Andhadhun', paying homage to the original while adding its own nuances. While the organ harvester scenes fall short, the film's strength lies in its exceptional cast, particularly Prashanth and Simran, who deliver nuanced and captivating performances. The piano compositions are also noteworthy.  

'Andhagan' serves as a satisfying watch for those unfamiliar with 'Andhadhun' and a welcome return to form for Prashanth.</description>

			<title>‘It Ends With Us’ movie review: Blake Lively-led romantic drama does not fire on all cylinders</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/it-ends-with-us-movie-review-blake-lively-led-romantic-drama-does-not-fire-on-all-cylinders/article68505660.ece</link>
			<description>"It Ends With Us" is a romantic drama based on the best-selling novel. The film follows Lily, a woman who finds love with Ryle, a neurosurgeon, but their relationship takes a darker turn when she reconnects with her past love, Atlas. While aiming to depict domestic abuse sensitively, the film's portrayal feels distanced and the reason given for the abuse is problematic. 

The film boasts beautiful visuals and strong acting from Blake Lively, but the male characters are underdeveloped. Despite focusing on serious themes, the movie leans into superficial elements like fashion and wealth, resulting in a tone that feels inconsistent.</description>

			<title>‘Minmini’ movie review: Halitha Shameem’s Himalayan outing leaves you cold</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/minmini-movie-review-halitha-shameems-himalayan-outing-leaves-you-cold/article68505632.ece</link>
			<description>"Minmini," a coming-of-age drama directed by Halitha Shameem, follows the journey of Pari and Sabari, two students from different backgrounds who clash initially but eventually find common ground.  

The film is divided into two halves: the first set in a school, where the central relationship blossoms amidst tensions, and the second, a transformative journey through the Himalayas. The cinematography is stunning, showcasing the beauty of the landscape, but the pacing feels uneven, with stretches that feel overly romanticized and lacking depth. The characters' personal growth, captured over eight years, is admirable but doesn't always translate into compelling narrative moments. While "Minmini" offers a fresh visual experience, it ultimately feels more like a picturesque journey than a deeply engaging story.</description>

			<title>‘Adios Amigo’ movie review: This Suraj Venjaramoodu, Asif Ali starrer is a tedious, over-stretched film</title>

			<description>"Adios Amigo," a debut film by Nahas Nazar, follows two men from different socioeconomic backgrounds who unexpectedly embark on a journey together. The film highlights the stark contrast between the rich man, Asif Ali, who lives a life of indulgence, and the poor man, Suraj Venjaramoodu, struggling to afford his mother's medical expenses.  

While the premise offers potential for exploring themes of inequality and human connection, the film meanders for over two hours without significant development. The lack of a clear narrative arc, coupled with attempts at humor that fall flat, leave viewers feeling unsatisfied.  Despite its aspirations, "Adios Amigo" ultimately fails to deliver a profound or engaging cinematic experience.</description>

			<description>Duniya Vijay's "Bheema" follows an orphan who fights against a drug mafia, echoing themes from his previous directorial, "Salaga." Vijay portrays a hero fighting for a good cause, while Priya Shatamarshan shines as a powerful policewoman. Though conceptually strong and showcasing realistic settings of Bengaluru, the film falters in the second half with an overabundance of explanations and predictable plot points.  The portrayal of youth struggling with addiction could be misconstrued, making the message about staying away from drugs mixed. Despite its flaws, "Bheema" demonstrates Vijay's evolving directorial skills, highlighting the need for a stronger writer to enhance his vision.</description>

			<title>‘Borderlands’ movie review: Barren, boring and bordering on unwatchable</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/borderlands-movie-review-barren-boring-and-bordering-on-unwatchable/article68505275.ece</link>
			<description>"Borderlands," a film adaptation of the popular video game franchise, is a disappointing and misguided effort. Directed by Eli Roth, the film suffers from a derivative plot, uninspired action sequences, and flat humor.  Despite the presence of talented actors like Cate Blanchett and Kevin Hart, their performances are unable to elevate the material. 

The CGI visuals are uninspired and the movie feels like a hodgepodge of influences from other successful sci-fi films and games. Ultimately, "Borderlands" serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of unnecessary video game adaptations.</description>

			<description>Aayana Dance Company from Bengaluru presented two works, 'Dhruva and Ellige', at the Yagnaraman centenary celebrations in Chennai. The performance was a dynamic blend of color, light, music, and movement, exploring themes of devotion (Hanuman and Tyagaraja) and women empowerment. 'Dhruva' showcased powerful imagery and group formations, while 'Ellige' delved into philosophical questions through the panchakanyas and a panchajathi alarippu. 

Lighting design by Surya Rao was particularly noteworthy, adding another dimension to the choreography and enhancing the overall viewing experience. The company successfully incorporated contemporary ideas into traditional Bharatanatyam, expanding the scope of the art form.</description>

			<description>"Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba," a sequel to the 2020 hit, attempts to recapture the charm of the original but falls short. The story feels forced, and the shallow dialogue fails to build suspense. While the premise offers potential, the execution is lackluster. The characters lack depth, and the romantic tension is absent.  The film relies on tired tropes and fails to deliver the thrills and intrigue of its predecessor. Despite Taapsee Pannu's performance and a nostalgic soundtrack, the sequel ultimately disappoints.</description>

			<description>"Gyaarah Gyaarah," a ZEE5 series based on the Korean show "Signal," delves into the world of time travel and unsolved crimes. The story centers on two detectives, Vamika (Kritika Kamra) and Yug (Raghav Juyal) from different eras, connected through a mysterious walkie-talkie. They collaborate to solve cases that have baffled their respective times.  Despite a promising premise, the series loses momentum as the narrative becomes predictable and uninspired. The characters, particularly Yug, lack depth, and the setting feels unconvincingly staged.  However, the acting, particularly from Dhairya Karwa and Nitish Pandey, in one of his last roles, shines.</description>

			<description>"Mothers' Instinct" is a psychological thriller set in 1960s America, following the unraveling friendship between Alice and Celine, two suburban mothers whose lives take a dark turn after a tragedy strikes. The film explores themes of grief, jealousy, and paranoia as the two women descend into a web of suspicion and distrust. 

Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway deliver powerful performances as Alice and Celine, respectively, navigating a complex range of emotions. The film's visually appealing 1960s aesthetic adds to the suspenseful atmosphere. While  chastain and Hathaway's acting is commendable, the script's uneven pacing and abrupt shifts in tone detract from the overall experience, particularly in the melodramatic third act.</description>

			<description>"Mazhai Pidikkatha Manithan", starring Vijay Antony, attempts to be a worthy comeback for the director, Vijay Milton. The film is a sequel to "Salim" and "Naan", continuing the story of Karthik, a former con artist who becomes a covert agent.  Haunted by his past, Karthik seeks refuge on a remote island, but his attempts at a fresh start are disrupted when he encounters a local loan shark. However, the film heavily relies on familiar tropes and suffers from predictable plotlines and underdeveloped characters. Despite glimpses of potential, "Mazhai Pidikkatha Manithan" falls short of delivering an engaging and memorable experience due to its formulaic nature and weak writing.</description>

			<title>‘Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha’ movie review: Ajay Devgn and Tabu struggle in a dated romance</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/auron-mein-kahan-dum-tha-movie-review-ajay-devgn-and-tabu-struggle-in-a-dated-romance/article68477181.ece</link>
			<description>"Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha" tells a story of selfless love between Krishna and Vasudha, separated by social constraints. The film shifts between their younger versions played by Shantanu Maheshwari and Saiee Manjrekar, and their older versions played by Ajay Devgn and Tabu.  While the younger actors' innocent portrayal is engaging, the film struggles to maintain the same impact with the seasoned leads.  

The direction, while aiming for a romantic and poignant tone, feels over-the-top and detracts from the sincerity of the story.  The supporting characters, particularly the predictable third wheel (Jimmy Shegill), fail to add depth or complexity. Ultimately, "Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha" presents a dated and uneven experience, despite the strong premise and the chemistry of its cast.</description>

			<title>‘Trap’ movie review: Josh Hartnett is earnest in M. Night Shyamalan’s insipid thriller</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/trap-movie-review-josh-hartnett-is-earnest-in-m-night-shyamalans-insipid-thriller/article68477038.ece</link>
			<description>M. Night Shyamalan's "Trap"  fails to deliver the suspense and ingenuity that defined his earlier work. 

The film centers on a serial killer (Josh Hartnett) attending his daughter's concert featuring a pop sensation (Saleka Shyamalan).  The premise, described as "The Silence of the Lambs" meets a Taylor Swift concert, suffers from a premature reveal of its twist, eliminating suspense. The film feels contrived, relying on implausible scenarios and lazy exposition.  

While Hartnett delivers a compelling performance, Shyamalan's direction is scattershot, and Saleka Shyamalan's acting as the popstar is underwhelming.  Despite cameos from Kid Cudi and Russ, "Trap" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, showcasing a director struggling to recapture past glories.</description>

			<title>‘Buddy’ movie review: Barring the bear, there is not much to root for</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/buddy-movie-review-barring-the-bear-there-is-not-much-to-root-for/article68477009.ece</link>
			<description>Buddy, a Telugu adaptation of the Tamil film Teddy, follows Aditya Ram (Allu Sirish), a pilot who gets entangled in an organ harvesting racket. The film attempts to showcase a fresh take on the original story by focusing on a budding romance between Aditya and Pallavi (Gayatri Bhardwaj), an air traffic control officer, who experiences an out-of-body encounter.  While the adaptation retains the essence of Teddy, its reliance on tropes and illogical scenarios weakens the plot.

The film's redeeming qualities include its hospital sequence and the introduction of Buddy, a talking teddy bear.  However, forced comedy and an overextended mid-air drama detract from the overall viewing experience. Despite some entertaining moments, Buddy ultimately falls short of being a compelling watch.</description>

			<title>‘Boat’ movie review: Yogi Babu cannot save this tedious, talkative survival drama</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/boat-movie-review-yogi-babu-cannot-save-this-tedious-talkative-survival-drama/article68472768.ece</link>
			<description>"Boat," a Tamil period survival drama, draws inspiration from "The Old Man and the Sea" and "The Twelve Angry Men." The film centers on ten diverse characters forced to survive on a fishing boat after fleeing Japanese bombers in 1943 Madras. The confined setting becomes a microcosm of larger societal issues, prompting the characters to confront their social identities and moral codes.  

The narrative, however, suffers from weak plot development and forced commentary on contemporary issues.  A distracting subplot involving a wanted terrorist and the inclusion of a great white shark add to the film's shallowness. While the film initially explores compelling themes regarding social constructs and hierarchies, the execution falls short.   Overly verbose dialogue and a loud score further detract from the experience. "Boat" ultimately fails to deliver on its ambitious premise, leaving viewers with a sense of anticlimax.</description>

			<title>‘Ulajh’ movie review: Janhvi Kapoor is caught in an inept thriller</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ulajh-movie-review-janhvi-kapoor-is-caught-in-an-inept-thriller/article68476499.ece</link>
			<description>"Ulajh" begins as a typical spy thriller, reminiscent of "Raazi", with a patriotic female protagonist.  The plot initially focuses on the intricate world of Indo-Pak relations and Suhana Bhatia's journey as a young Indian diplomat navigating the complexities of international politics.  However,  the film takes an unexpected turn, veering into an overambitious franchise-style narrative that undermines its initial strengths.  

While Janhvi Kapoor delivers a compelling performance as Suhana, burdened by the weight of legacy and gender expectations, the film's implausible plot points and convoluted climax detract from its overall impact. The supporting cast, featuring seasoned actors like Adil Hussain and Rajesh Tailang,  is largely underutilized. Ultimately, "Ulajh" struggles to find its footing,  succumbing to the trend of churning out crowded narratives rather than delivering a truly engaging and well-defined story.</description>

			<description>"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder" is a Netflix limited series based on Holly Jackson's novel of the same name.

The series explores themes of rage, obsession, friendship, and social issues within the small town of Little Kilton.

			<description>Trisha Krishnan's digital debut in 'Brinda', a Telugu web series on Sony LIV, showcases her in a subdued role, playing a brooding cop grappling with past traumas, gender inequality, and an unnerving crime.

The eight-episode series delves into the personal and professional lives of Brinda and her colleague Sarathi, exploring themes of superstition, societal pressures, and the complexities of good versus evil.  Trisha delivers a measured performance as a resilient woman navigating challenging circumstances, while Ravindra Vijay portrays Sarathi with sincerity and depth. 

The series effectively blends crime with character development, painting a grim picture of societal issues while highlighting the enduring power of human resilience.  Supported by a strong technical team, 'Brinda' stands out as a compelling addition to the Telugu web series landscape.</description>

			<description>Netflix's adaptation of Giovanni Boccaccio's "The Decameron"  takes place in 1348 amidst the bubonic plague. The story follows a group of individuals who seek refuge in Villa Santa, each with their own agendas and desires.  The series features a mix of humor, sex, and violence, but ultimately falls short due to a lack of depth and substance. While the talented cast shines,  the anachronistic elements and gratuitous content fail to elevate the material.</description>

			<description>"Chutney Sambar," directed by Radha Mohan, is a heartwarming series that explores family bonds and acceptance.  When an ailing restaurateur reveals a secret about his past, his son sets out to find his half-brother,  a roadside food shop owner named Sachu, played by Yogi Babu.

The series delves into the characters' personal journeys and relationships, with Babu delivering both comedic moments and showcasing his dramatic range. While the storyline is predictable,  it's  Yogi Babu's performance and the series' feel-good nature that make it an enjoyable watch. Despite some  uninteresting subplots, "Chutney Sambar" offers a refreshing change from  current trends in cinema with its focus on heartwarming family dynamics.</description>

			<description>"Level Cross," directed by Arfaz Ayub, is a psychological thriller set at a desolate level crossing. Asif Ali plays Raghu, the lonely gatekeeper who encounters Amala Paul's character, Chaitali/Shikha, who mysteriously appears injured. Their interactions, along with Sharafudheen's character, Zincho, create a web of deception and conflicting narratives.  The film, which unfolds slowly, relies heavily on the performances of its leads, particularly Asif Ali, who portrays Raghu's emotional transformation convincingly. The twists and turns keep the audience guessing, but the film feels like it could have explored its potential further.</description>

			<description>Guy Ritchie's "The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare" is a WWII action film that prioritizes over-the-top entertainment over historical accuracy. Based loosely on a real commando raid, the film follows a group of British operatives who carry out a daring mission to sabotage Nazi supply ships.  

Henry Cavill leads the charismatic cast as Gus March-Philipps, a swashbuckling soldier who embodies the film's blend of wit and action. Ritchie's signature style is on full display, with fast-paced sequences, snappy dialogue, and a cartoonish portrayal of both Allied and Axis forces.  While the film takes liberties with history and features stereotypical characters, it delivers a fun and energetic cinematic experience.</description>

			<description>Akarsh HP's "Family Drama" features a non-stereotypical lower-middle-class family with flawed and ambitious members. Though the first half feels slow and lacks humor, the film improves significantly after the head of the family's death.  The plot sees the remaining family members entangled with a quirky but menacing don played by Poornachandra Mysore, adding a comedic and thrilling twist to the narrative.  Abhay, Sindhu, and Rekha deliver compelling performances as the family copes with the unexpected turn of events. While the ending feels somewhat anticlimactic, the film is a refreshing attempt at blending comedy and thriller elements in a relatable middle-class setting.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/raayan-movie-review-dhanushs-fiery-bloodfest-offers-only-dwindling-returns/article68449302.ece</link>
			<description>'Raayan', Dhanush's second directorial, begins promisingly with a powerful opening sequence. The story revolves around Raayan (Dhanush) and his brothers navigating the dangerous underworld of  Madras.  The film draws parallels to the Ramayana, using the characters and their stories as metaphors. 

While Dhanush's performance and AR Rahman's music are strong points, the film falters in its writing. Raayan's character, despite his intriguing introduction, lacks depth and feels overpowered. The plot relies on predictable tropes and underutilizes supporting characters like SJ Suryah. The second half, filled with violence, fails to deliver the depth and intrigue promised by the first.  Despite its flaws, 'Raayan' features impressive cinematography and a captivating score.</description>

Humorous dialogues and engaging performances build the narrative, leading to a twist when the couple chooses 'thanikudithanam' due to family interference. While relatable situations and simple dialogue hold the audience's interest, the final scene lacked conviction.

			<title>‘Kenda’ movie review: A sharp observation on the nexus between crime and politics</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kenda-movie-review-a-sharp-observation-on-the-nexus-between-crime-and-politics/article68444698.ece</link>
			<description>Kenda, set between the late 90s and early 2000s, follows Keshava, a factory worker who gets entangled in the world of politics and crime.  

The film, with its minimalist and realistic approach, explores how a young man's disillusionment and financial need lead him down a treacherous path.  Narasimha Shastry, a politically ambitious figure, manipulates vulnerable youth like Keshava for his personal gain. 

Through Keshava's journey, the film critiques the nexus of crime and politics, highlighting how individuals in power exploit the financially insecure.  

While Kenda effectively portrays the societal issues of its time, including the rise of electronic media and its pitfalls, its absurdist elements and digressions into philosophical territory towards the end weaken its impact.  

Despite these flaws, Kenda stands out for its grounded portrayal of a relatable protagonist and its unique perspective on the corruption within the political system.</description>

			<title>‘Roopanthara’ movie review: Raj B Shetty stars in an engaging anthology on self-transformation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/roopanthara-movie-review-raj-b-shetty-stars-in-an-engaging-anthology-on-self-transformation/article68440760.ece</link>
			<description>Mithilesh Edavalath's "Roopanthara" is a four-story anthology that explores the theme of self-transformation. 

While the stories themselves are not groundbreaking, the director effectively presents them as mini-epics, keeping the audience engaged.  Each episode tackles societal issues in unique ways, showcasing strong performances and effective direction.  

For example, the story of a beggar's arrest highlights the influence of privilege in the legal system. Another episode, focusing on a troubled boy, portrays the consequences of a difficult childhood. The standout story features an elderly couple whose dreams bring light to their impoverished lives.  

Mithilesh's direction is promising, with skillful execution of ideas. However, some stories lack depth and the director's philosophical message feels heavy-handed.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/why-one-cannot-ignore-tm-krishnas-musical-explorations/article68432254.ece</link>
			<description>T.M. Krishna’s recent concert at the Asian College of Journalism in Chennai showcased his signature spontaneity and innovation. Known for eliciting diverse reactions from his audience, Krishna's rendition of the sringara padam ‘Yaarukagilum’ was filled with improvisations and unique explorations of the raga.  

He also presented ‘Shubh sukh chain,’ a Hindustani adaptation of Tagore’s "Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata", reflecting on its verses about nationalism. Krishna delved deep into the nuances of Surutti, highlighting the madhyama to upper nishada section, and showcased the versatility of ‘Soundararajam’ with Arun Prakash's impactful mridangam accompaniment. 

The concert encompassed Eminent poet Perumal Murugan’s poems on birds, specifically the Indian Roller, set to a Khamas composition, and a heartfelt rendition of ‘Bhare Panduranga’.  Krishna's performance exemplifies his unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of Carnatic music, encouraging diverse artistic expression within the genre.</description>

			<title>‘Arcadian’ movie review: Not enough Nicolas Cage in an effective, bare-bones chiller</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/arcadian-movie-review-not-enough-nicolas-cage-in-an-effective-bare-bones-chiller/article68431837.ece</link>
			<description>"Arcadian" is a horror film set in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by photosensitive monsters. Nicolas Cage plays Paul, who raises his twin sons, Thomas and Joseph, in a secluded farmhouse.  

The film follows the brothers as they navigate their dangerous environment and their increasingly strained relationship. Thomas is impulsive and drawn to a girl named Charlotte, while Joseph is cautious and analytical.  

When Thomas is injured, Paul is gravely wounded while trying to save him, forcing the boys to confront the monsters and their own vulnerabilities.  "Arcadian"  is a relatively straightforward thriller that feels like a setup for a larger story, leaving some aspects underdeveloped.</description>

			<description>"Spy x Family Code: White" brings the beloved anime series to the big screen, retaining the charm and humor of the original. The film follows the Forger family on a mission to a wintry town, ostensibly for Anya's cooking competition.  Director Takashi Katagiri delivers visually dynamic scenes, maintaining the series' signature blend of high-stakes espionage and lighthearted family moments. Anya, the telepathic heart of the series, steals the show with her hilarious antics and expressive charm.

While the film's animation is stunning, the plot feels more like an extended episode than a fully realized movie, lacking the urgency and depth of a standalone story. The meandering pace and repetitive exposition may leave some viewers wanting more substance.  Overall, "Spy x Family Code: White" is a delightful treat for fans but may not fully engage newcomers.</description>

			<title>‘Nagendran’s Honeymoons’ series review: An unimaginatively written series that does not tread any new ground</title>

			<description>"Nagendran's Honeymoons" is a series about a hapless man, Nagendran, who enters into six fraudulent marriages with the help of his scheming friend, Soman.  The series, set in late 1970s Kerala, follows their plans to swindle dowry money from each woman, who are portrayed with various flaws.  While the performances of the actors, particularly Prasanth Alexander and Suraj Venjaramoodu, are commendable, the writing is criticized for its unoriginality and convenient characterizations. The narrative structure, though varied in location, relies heavily on the same formula, and the attempts to evoke the period feel uneven. Although showing some improvement over the filmmaker's previous works, "Nagendran's Honeymoons" ultimately lacks depth and fails to offer a fresh perspective.</description>

			<title>‘Those About to Die’ series review: Anthony Hopkins cannot save this muddled mess of gratuitous sex and gore</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/those-about-to-die-series-review/article68425350.ece</link>
			<description>Roland Emmerich's "Those About to Die" is an adaptation of Daniel P. Mannix's non-fiction account of ancient Rome's gladiator games.  Set against the backdrop of Emperor Vespasian's rule, the film follows various characters, including Tenax, a man who oversees the games, and Cala, a woman seeking to free her daughters.  Amidst the power struggles and chariot races, the narrative explores themes of slavery, ambition, and the spectacle of violence. However, the film suffers from wooden dialogue, historical inaccuracies, and a lack of compelling spectacle, despite its ambitious scope.</description>

			<description>Manu Radhakrishnan's debut feature film "Gu"  is set in a picturesque rural location and explores the myth of Gulikan, a supernatural being believed to protect children. The story focuses on a family returning to their ancestral home to perform rituals after a teenage girl becomes possessed.  The film blends humour, folklore, and family drama, highlighting the bond between children and their playful cousin Mithran. While the director attempts to portray both horror and psychological thriller elements, the narrative  at times feels unsure of its genre. The film ultimately offers a nostalgic tale of a family coming together against the backdrop of supernatural beliefs.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vishesham-movie-review-sooraj-toms-unadventurous-approach-makes-this-drama-average-fare/article68422791.ece</link>
			<description>"Vishesham" explores the emotional toll on newlyweds from societal pressures about having children. The film focuses on Shaiju and Sajitha, who both have past marital difficulties. While their relationship development is depicted well, the narrative suffers from flat writing and predictable plot points.  It touches upon the intrusion of unsolicited opinions into private lives but lacks the boldness of films like "Sara's" in challenging societal norms.  Although it raises relevant issues, "Vishesham" ultimately falls short of making a lasting impact due to its conventional approach.</description>

			<title>‘Immaculate’ movie review: Sydney Sweeney is immaculate in this imperfect horror outing</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/immaculate-movie-review-sydney-sweeney-is-immaculate-in-this-imperfect-horror-outing/article68422368.ece</link>
			<description>"Immaculate" follows Cecilia, a woman who enters a convent seeking religious connection. As she prepares to take her final vows, she discovers sinister events and a horrific truth about the occurrences in her life.  The film, starring Sydney Sweeney, draws parallels to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, with Cecilia facing threats to her bodily autonomy. While the first half is slow-paced, the film picks up as Cecilia's pregnancy progresses, culminating in a terrifying climax. Sweeney's strong performance elevates the film, which, despite its predictable plot, offers some gore and jump scares.</description>

			<title>‘Bad Newz’ movie review: Vicky Kaushal is the spice of this half-baked dramedy</title>

			<description>"Bad Newz," a comedy directed by Anand Tiwari, revolves around Saloni (Triptii Dimri), a chef who experiences heteropaternal superfecundation after encounters with two men: Akhil (Vicky Kaushal) and Gurbir (Ammy Virk).  The film uses this unique biological scenario to explore themes of career aspirations and love in the life of a contemporary working woman. 

While the concept has potential, the screenplay leans heavily on predictable comedic set pieces and avoids delving into Saloni's emotional complexities. Triptii Dimri delivers a nuanced performance, but the supporting characters, particularly Gurbir, lack depth. Vicky Kaushal shines as Akhil, keeping the film engaging. Despite its superficial humor, "Bad Newz" presents a glimpse into the challenges faced by modern women striving for balance in their personal and professional lives.</description>

			<title>‘Darling’ movie review: This Priyadarshi, Nabha Natesh starrer is an overdrawn, disorderly drama</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/darling-movie-review-an-overdrawn-disorderly-drama/article68421562.ece</link>
			<description>Darling, a Telugu film starring Priyadarshi Pulikonda and Nabha Natesh, explores the complexities of a relationship when the wife is diagnosed with a psychological condition. While the film attempts to blend humor and seriousness in portraying the protagonist's struggle, it fails to convincingly execute either. 

The narrative takes too long to establish its conflict and relies heavily on contrived situations.  Priyadarshi delivers a sincere performance as the protagonist grappling with his wife's condition, while Nabha Natesh portrays the different facets of her character with effort.  Soundtrack and cinematography provide some respite from the film's shortcomings, but ultimately, Darling suffers from a messy screenplay and  lacks depth in exploring its central theme.</description>

			<description>My Spy: The Eternal City follows the ongoing relationship between a hardened CIA agent, JJ, and the now-adolescent Sophie, after the events of the 2020 film. While the sequel attempts to explore JJ grappling with fatherhood and Sophie navigating teen angst and relationships, the execution feels rushed and formulaic.

A cliché action storyline unfolds when Sophie and JJ travel to Vatican City, where JJ must thwart a terrorist attack involving century-old nuclear weapons. The antagonist is a predictable stock villain, and the story lacks originality.  Despite some humorous moments and decent action sequences, particularly from Bautista and Coleman, the film falls short of the charm and emotional depth of its predecessor. The underwhelming finale leaves little lasting impact. While the initial premise shows promise, the film ultimately disappoints as a sequel.</description>

			<description>The Acolyte, set a century before the Phantom Menace, follows Jedi Master Vernestra Rwoh as she investigates a series of disturbing events. The Jedi are increasingly entangled in galactic politics, facing challenges from both senators and a sinister, shadowy force. The narrative revolves around a tragedy that occurred 16 years prior, involving Force witches and the twins Mae and Osha.  Mae embraces the dark side while Osha becomes a mecha repair specialist. While the show boasts stunning visuals and action sequences, it also grapples with inconsistencies and illogical character choices. Despite these flaws, the compelling pace, mystery, and exploration of the rising Sith threat make The Acolyte a captivating watch.</description>

			<description>"The Boys" season four explores the terrifyingly relevant theme of political populism and superhero corruption.  The climax features Firecracker, a fascist supe,  running for president, drawing disturbing parallels to current events. 

Homelander, the embodiment of narcissistic supremacy, becomes increasingly terrifying, mirroring real-world political leaders.  The series also satirizes current trends in pop culture, taking aim at Marvel's corporate dominance and superhero fatigue. 

Amidst the chaos, Butcher grapples with his relationship with Ryan, hinting at  a potential transformation.  The season finale culminates in a potent message about the dangers of political extremism and the manipulation of public perception.</description>
