			<title>To abide or not: On the Karnataka case and corruption charges</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/to-abide-or-not-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-karnataka-case-and-corruption-charges/article68543330.ece</link>
			<description>The Karnataka Governor's decision to grant permission for prosecution against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption charges has sparked debate.  The legality of the Governor's action, independent of the Council of Ministers' advice, is questioned. Siddaramaiah contends that the Governor disregarded advice to refuse sanction.  The case revolves around land allotment by the Mysore Urban Development Authority, with allegations of impropriety. 

While the State government supports a judicial inquiry, the Governor deems it insufficient. The Chief Minister denies involvement in the land allocation process, maintaining it occurred during the previous BJP government. The Governor's action highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and the judiciary, and raises concerns about potential selective prosecution.</description>

			<description>The 70th National Film Awards brought fresh hope to the credibility of the prestigious ceremony. Winners like the Malayalam film "Aattam," which explores male behaviour post sexual abuse allegations, and the Kannada film "Kantara," which tackles environmental concerns through folklore, stand out for their unconventional narratives and societal relevance.  The awards also recognized stellar performances by Nithya Menen and Rishab Shetty, further highlighting the rising quality of content from South Indian cinema.  The selections seem to reflect a shift towards meaningful cinema that resonates with contemporary issues, vindicating the National Awards' original purpose.</description>

			<title>​Two States: On elections to Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Btwo-states-the-hindu-editorial-on-elections-to-jammu-and-kashmir-and-haryana/article68539796.ece</link>
			<description>The assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled from September 18 to October 1, will be closely watched as they test India's democratic processes. The elections, the first for J&amp;K since its reorganization in 2019, are significant as a new government could be a crucial step towards a lasting political solution. 

Security concerns and festivals are cited as reasons for staggered elections, with Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls to be announced later. The outcome will have implications beyond the two states, influencing national politics and signaling the BJP’s electoral strength a year before the general election.</description>

			<description>Sri Lanka is holding its ninth presidential election on September 21st with a record 39 candidates. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, running as an independent, hopes to leverage the political and economic stability achieved during his tenure.  He faces challenges from Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and Namal Rajapaksa of the SLPP.  The election comes after Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis in 2022, prompting a debt restructuring and the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  The candidates, including representatives of the Aragalaya movement, will seek to address public concerns about the economy and traditional politics.</description>

			<title>​Apathy continues: On Africa and the mpox vaccine response</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bapathy-continues-on-africa-and-the-mpox-vaccine-response/article68533111.ece</link>
			<description>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), following a declaration by the Africa CDC as a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS).  This marks the first time a regional and global health emergency has been declared for a disease outbreak in Africa. 

The current outbreak, driven by the more lethal clade 1b virus, has seen 2,863 confirmed cases and 517 deaths primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Concerns remain over vaccine supply, with only 0.21 million doses expected immediately against a need for 10 million.  Doses are currently authorized only in the DRC and Nigeria, highlighting the need for wider authorization and expedited global distribution.</description>

			<title>Neighbourhood troubles: On India and instability in the region</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/neighbourhood-troubles-on-india-and-instability-in-the-region/article68533413.ece</link>
			<description>Thailand's Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, at 37 the country's youngest Prime Minister. This follows the Constitutional Court's ousting of Srettha Thavisin due to ethical violations related to his Cabinet's appointment of someone convicted in a corruption case involving Paetongtarn's father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  

The Shinawatra family has a history of facing court dismissals, highlighting Thailand's political instability. Paetongtarn's path to reform and economic recovery is likely to be challenging due to the conservative establishment's influence and her limited experience. She is expected to rely heavily on her father's guidance.</description>

			<title>Freedom notes: On the Independence Day speech and beyond</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/freedom-notes-on-the-independence-day-speech-and-beyond/article68529138.ece</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day address emphasized continuity and authority in his third term. He championed a uniform civil code, 'one nation, one election,' and enhanced women's safety. 

Modi criticized attempts to destabilize the economy, echoing the BJP's stance on the Hindenburg Research report. He called for  one lakh first-generation young leaders in politics. Reviewing his previous terms, he highlighted progress in manufacturing and fighting corruption.  The article critiques the government's partisan approach on these issues, noting the lack of consensus building and the targeting of opposition figures in corruption inquiries. It emphasizes the importance of accountability and criticism as essential aspects of a functioning democracy.</description>

			<title>​Choppy waters: On shrinking exports</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bchoppy-waters-on-shrinking-exports/article68529172.ece</link>
			<description>India's merchandise exports fell 1.5% in July, marking their weakest performance since November 2023. While sectors like electronics, garments, and handicrafts showed growth, declines in petroleum, gems and jewellery, and chemicals hampered overall export performance.  

Imports surged 7.5% due to increased petroleum and consumer demand, leading to a 24% jump in the trade deficit. This was attributed to both a decrease in export growth and a rise in imports. The Commerce Ministry remains optimistic about India surpassing last year's export record, but uncertainties like geopolitical disruptions and weak global demand pose challenges.</description>

			<title>​Illusory blip: On inflation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Billusory-blip-on-inflation/article68524975.ece</link>
			<description>India's retail inflation eased to a 3.54% rise in July, its lowest in nearly five years. This slowdown was largely due to a 13-month low in food inflation, reaching 5.4%. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) aligned with the Reserve Bank of India's target for the first time since August 2019, the MPC expects inflation to rebound later in the year. This is attributed to base effects and the persistence of price pressures in food items like pulses, despite a decline in vegetable inflation. Services inflation also saw a rise, driven by higher transport and communication costs. Though the July figures offer some relief, experts caution against complacency, as Monsoon uncertainties and continued food price pressures may hinder a sustainable decline in inflation.</description>

			<title>​Violence, most foul: On Kolkata doctor rape and murder</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bviolence-most-foul-a-murder-in-kolkata/article68525010.ece</link>
			<description>The brutal rape and murder of a postgraduate medical student in a Kolkata government hospital has sparked national outrage. The incident, highlighting the systemic failures in ensuring safety within hospitals, has revealed a disturbing pattern of violence against healthcare professionals.  Public anger prompted authorities to act after initially attempting to cover up the crime. 

The case echoes previous attacks on doctors, including the murder of Dr. Vandana Das in Kerala and numerous assaults during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the urgent need for improved security and legislation to protect healthcare workers. The government must take proactive steps to prevent such tragedies and ensure the safety of those who dedicate their lives to saving others.</description>

			<title>​Step down: On upholding the integrity of SEBI</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bstep-down-on-upholding-the-integrity-of-sebi/article68521804.ece</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is facing allegations of bias and conflict of interest concerning its Chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch.  Hindenburg Research claims Ms. Buch and her husband made investments in offshore funds where Adani Group's Vinod Adani also invested, while their consultancy firms in Singapore and India potentially advised SEBI-regulated clients.  Ms. Buch claims her consultancy firms were inactive since her SEBI appointment, but Hindenburg disputes this, citing revenue figures. This unprecedented situation raises concerns about SEBI's impartiality in its ongoing investigation into the Adani Group for alleged stock market manipulation.  

The integrity of India's securities regulator is at stake,  leading to calls for Ms. Buch's resignation to allow for a thorough investigation.</description>

			<description>India's performance at the Paris Olympics fell short of expectations, securing one silver and five bronze medals, a decline from the previous Games. While new stars emerged in shooting and wrestling, the country's reliance on a few athletes was evident.  The lack of representation in disciplines like swimming and gymnastics, coupled with wrestler Vinesh Phogat's disqualification, highlighted areas for improvement.  Broadening the sport's base, increasing participation, and ensuring equitable funding distribution are crucial for future success.</description>

			<description>The Election Commission of India's recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir signals a push for assembly elections in the Union Territory.  The Supreme Court has directed the ECI to hold elections by September 30, 2024, emphasizing that direct elections cannot be delayed until statehood is restored.  J&amp;K's last Assembly election was in 2014,  and the region has been under central rule since 2019. The Centre is encouraged by the high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections, indicating a possible receptiveness to democratic processes. Holding Assembly elections is seen as a vital step towards restoring normalcy, addressing pressing issues like unemployment and infrastructure, and fostering healing in the region.</description>

			<title>More and better testing: On viral disease outbreaks and State responses</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-and-better-testing-the-hindu-editorial-on-viral-disease-outbreaks-and-state-responses/article68516674.ece</link>
			<description>The Zika virus outbreak in Maharashtra, with 88 confirmed cases as of early August, has raised concerns, particularly regarding pregnant women. Although rare, Zika can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome and poses a significant risk to fetuses, potentially leading to microcephaly and neurological impairments. Studies have shown a substantial risk of birth defects and complications associated with Zika infection during pregnancy.  The virus can also be transmitted sexually by infected men for at least two months, highlighting the need for awareness and preventive measures.  

The slow response in initiating testing capacity in Pune underscores the importance of robust and decentralized testing infrastructure, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of such systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala. Prompt testing and sequencing of potential pathogens are crucial for effective public health interventions and containing outbreaks.</description>

			<title>Rule and exception: On a reminder on the fundamentals of bail law</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rule-and-exception-on-a-reminder-on-the-fundamentals-of-bail-law/article68513079.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's bail grant to Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia emphasizes that bail should not be denied as punishment. Bail is generally granted in cases primarily based on documentary evidence, unless there's a flight risk, witness tampering, or significant trial delay. The court's order highlights the importance of speedy trials and cautions against judges "playing safe" by denying bail routinely.  Sisodia's case, involving prolonged detention and alleged political targeting, underscores the need for the judiciary to protect citizens' liberty and ensure fair trials without unnecessary pre-trial imprisonment. The court's emphasis on time-bound completion of trials is a crucial safeguard in situations where investigations are perceived to be politically motivated.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perfunctory-panacea-on-the-rashtriya-vigyan-puraskar/article68513100.ece</link>
			<description>The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP) replaces the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards for scientists under 45. The new award scheme includes the Vigyan Shri, Vigyan Ratna and Vigyan Team awards, with a cap of 56 total awards across categories.  While the RVP aims to streamline and elevate scientific recognition in India, emphasizing both individual and team achievements, some critics argue the awards should prioritize improved funding and infrastructure for research.  The list of awardees primarily represents scientists from elite institutions, highlighting the existing disparities in access to resources within the scientific community.</description>

			<description>Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, has called for calm amidst widespread violence and unrest following former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Clashes between political parties and extremist groups have targeted religious minorities and Awami League supporters. Yunus, chosen for his perceived neutrality, faces the challenge of restoring order, preventing military intervention, and facilitating peaceful elections. Building a temporary truce between political rivals, notably the Jamaat and BNP, is crucial, along with ensuring free and fair elections to regain public trust and stability. The success of Bangladesh's current transition hinges on addressing these critical challenges.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Breassuring-resolve-on-the-rbis-monetary-policy-committees-move/article68506053.ece</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee has maintained its benchmark interest rates for the ninth consecutive meeting. This decision stems from ongoing concerns about persistently high inflation, which has exceeded the targeted 4% for an extended period, impacting consumer confidence. 

Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the threat posed by elevated food prices, particularly given their significant weight in the Consumer Price Index and direct impact on household budgets.  Although vegetable prices had shown some softening in June, the MPC anticipates continued pressure on inflation, potentially extending into the festive season. The committee raised its inflation projections for the remaining fiscal year, signaling a less optimistic outlook.

They highlighted the risks of spillovers from food prices to other goods and services, as well as potential inflationary effects from mobile tariff revisions. The MPC reiterated the crucial link between price stability and sustainable economic growth.</description>

			<description>Vinesh Phogat's Olympic journey ended in heartbreak when she was found 100 grams overweight before her final bout in the women's 50kg category. Despite weighing in successfully the previous day, she gained weight overnight. Desperate attempts to shed the extra kilos proved futile. Though Vinesh had triumphed over reigning champion Yui Susaki and Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, the Unified World Wrestling's strict rules resulted in her elimination.  Her performance was seen as a symbol of resilience, particularly in light of the sexual harassment allegations against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, which the Indian contingent faced.  Vinesh's exit, leaving her without a medal despite her extraordinary efforts, has deeply saddened Indian sports fans.</description>

			<description>A U.S. court ruled that Google is a monopoly, finding that it violated antitrust laws by using exclusive deals with smartphone manufacturers to maintain its dominance in the online search market. Judge Amit P. Mehta stated that Google's practices stifled competition. 

The Department of Justice is now considering potential remedies, which could range from breaking up Google to eliminating its exclusive agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung. These decisions have significant implications for the future of Big Tech, as similar antitrust cases are pending against companies like Meta, Amazon, and Apple.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bunder-overlords-on-centre-delhi-government-relations/article68497296.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the Lt. Governor of Delhi holds independent authority in appointing aldermen to the Delhi Municipal Corporation. This decision, based on the law governing Centre-Delhi relations and previous judgments, underscores the Delhi government's vulnerability to central influence. 

The Court clarified that the Lt. Governor's power to appoint individuals with special knowledge in municipal administration isn't subject to the advice of the Delhi Council of Ministers. This power, rooted in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, stands apart from the general rule that the Lt. Governor acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers on most matters. This ruling highlights the potential for conflict between the elected government and the appointed administrator. 

While the Constitution Bench attempted to establish a framework for resolving disagreements, the Centre ultimately retains the final say in Delhi's governance due to Parliament's power to legislate and amend laws pertaining to matters under the Delhi Assembly's jurisdiction.</description>

			<description>Puja Khedkar's case exposes a deeply flawed system within the Union Public Service Commission recruitment process.  Khedkar used multiple deceptions, including faking a disability and community certificate, to secure a position she wouldn't have otherwise obtained. Her actions highlight a systemic vulnerability where impersonation and manipulation can easily undermine the fairness of competitive examinations.  The government must address this by overhauling the entire examination system, ensuring robust measures to detect fraud and protect the integrity of the process.  This incident also raises concerns about the disability certification process, demanding a review to safeguard genuine applicants and prevent exploitation.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bfrom-hope-to-despair-on-bangladesh-after-sheikh-hasina/article68493224.ece</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, narrowly escaped mob violence following months of student protests.  A once beloved leader credited with economic progress and fighting terrorism, Hasina faced growing resentment over alleged vote rigging, suppression of dissent, and politically motivated arrests. 

The student protests, triggered by quota system issues, ignited a wider anger stemming from years of curtailing democratic processes. Hasina's hardline approach alienated even those who had previously supported her, including Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Hasina’s forced exit raises concerns about the potential influence of Islamist groups and the future of Bangladesh’s secularism.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bhealing-a-nation-on-kamala-harris-and-the-us-campaign-race/article68492788.ece</link>
			<description>After President Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee to challenge former President Donald Trump in the November election. Harris, who secured a majority of party votes, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  Despite her late entry, she has gained a slight lead in national polls and raised a significant amount of campaign funds. 

The Trump campaign, having previously focused its attacks on Biden, is now pivoting to criticize Harris, resorting to disparaging language and questioning her racial identity. This strategy may inadvertently benefit Harris, allowing her to appeal to a broader electorate and potentially construct a more inclusive policy agenda. The world, seeking stability and democratic values, will be watching closely as the election unfolds.</description>

			<description>The assassinations of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran have significantly escalated tensions in the West Asia region. While Israel claims responsibility for Shukr's death, it hasn't confirmed its involvement in Haniyeh's killing. These incidents follow the already tense situation along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, leading to rocket exchanges between Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces. The killings raise concerns about Iranian retaliation against Israel, potentially triggering a larger conflict.  Haniyeh's death is particularly concerning as he was a moderate voice within Hamas and was involved in ceasefire negotiations with Israel.  Israel's actions, seen as blatant provocations, risk drawing the US into a regional war.</description>

			<title>On target: On the Olympics and Indian shooters</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-target-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-olympics-and-indian-shoote/article68489209.ece</link>
			<description>Manu Bhaker's historic bronze medal wins in the 10m air pistol and mixed 10m air pistol events at the Paris Olympics marked a resurgence for Indian shooting. Bhaker's success followed a period of drought in the sport after a string of medals in previous Olympic Games. 

Her achievements highlight the progress made in Indian shooting, building upon the early pioneering efforts of shooters like Anjali Bhagwat and Suma Shirur. The support system, including coaching from experienced figures like Jaspal Rana, has played a crucial role in nurturing young talent. Bhaker's performance, along with Swapnil Kusale's bronze and Arjun Babuta's fourth-place finish, demonstrated the capability of Indian shooters on the world stage.</description>

			<title>​Election overhang: On economic activity</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Belection-overhang-the-hindu-editorial-on-economic-activity/article68485015.ece</link>
			<description>India's core infrastructure sectors saw growth slow to a 20-month low of 4% in June.  

This slowdown was attributed to reduced state spending on public works following the general election and persistent heatwaves that dampened economic activity. Sectors like refinery products, electricity generation, and steel experienced contractions or significant decelerations in growth. However, coal production expanded at a robust pace. 

A private survey indicated that broader manufacturing activity eased slightly in July, but input costs surged, prompting manufacturers to raise selling prices at their fastest rate in over a decade, raising concerns about inflationary pressures.</description>

			<title>​Medieval-minded: On anti-conversion law in Uttar Pradesh, its amendments</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bmedieval-minded-the-hindu-editorial-on-anti-conversion-law-in-uttar-pradesh-its-amendments/article68485116.ece</link>
			<description>Amendments to Uttar Pradesh's anti-conversion law aim to increase jail terms for those convicted of "unlawful conversion."  The law, originally enacted in 2021, has been used to prosecute over 400 cases primarily concerning inter-faith marriages. 

The amended law includes harsher bail provisions,  similar to those in the NDPS and PMLA Acts, and expands the possibility of filing a complaint against alleged conversions to anyone, not just the victim or their family. This raises concerns about misuse by communal organizations targeting interfaith relationships.  Critics argue the law criminalizes interfaith marriages and violates fundamental rights.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that Scheduled Castes (SCs) can be sub-classified to provide preferential treatment to weaker sections. This decision overturns a 2005 judgment that prohibited states from modifying the SC list. 

The court acknowledged the diversity within SCs and recognized that historical and social disadvantages vary. States can now identify and grant benefits to the most backward groups within SCs. The verdict also addressed the "creamy layer" concept, suggesting its potential application to SCs, although specific norms remain to be determined. The focus remains on ensuring adequate representation for the most marginalized Dalit communities.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stealing-the-vote-on-the-venezuelan-presidential-election/article68477758.ece</link>
			<description>Nicolas Maduro won Venezuela's recent presidential election with 51% of the vote, extending his rule for another six years. However, the opposition, claiming widespread irregularities and a stolen vote, reports their candidate Edmundo González won by a significant margin. 

Anti-Maduro protests erupted following the official results which the opposition rejects. Maduro's victory comes amidst a devastating economic crisis that has seen Venezuela's economy contract by 80% in a decade, with extreme poverty and household poverty reaching 53% and 82% respectively.  

The crisis is attributed to factors including falling oil prices, sanctions, and Maduro's policies. Despite the opposition's allegations, Maduro has denied fraud. The US and some Latin American allies have called for transparency but Maduro still enjoys military support.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bprivate-consultation-on-the-broadcasting-services-regulation-bill-2023/article68473477.ece</link>
			<description>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has reportedly withheld the latest draft of the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, from public consultation. While an earlier draft was circulated publicly, the current version is only being shared with select stakeholders under confidentiality agreements. This approach raises concerns as it excludes online creators, parts of the media industry, and civil society, who are heavily impacted by media regulations. The Bill potentially strengthens an existing regulatory framework already criticized for discouraging free expression. The lack of transparency and limited stakeholder engagement raises questions about the government's intent and the potential for the Bill to be exclusionary and flawed.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India delivered a split verdict on the approval of genetically modified (GM) mustard, DMH-11. While Justice Nagarathna found the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)'s approval violated the precautionary principle, Justice Karol supported the GEAC's process. 

The case, which arose from a dispute between developers and environmentalists over the crop's potential environmental impact, will now be heard by a larger Bench. Notably, the Court ordered the government to formulate a comprehensive policy on GM crops.  This highlights the ongoing debate surrounding GM technology in India, which is influenced by both scientific and ideological considerations.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unnatural-disaster-on-the-wayanad-landslides/article68468839.ece</link>
			<description>Deadly landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, triggered by heavy monsoon rains, have claimed over 200 lives. While landslides are common during this season, their intensity and fatalities are unprecedented. Contributing factors include exacerbated river flow due to deforestation and weakened upstream soil stability from previous heavy rains. 

The tragedy highlights the compounding effects of climate change and inadequate disaster preparedness.  The state's vulnerability to landslides in ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbated by excessive rain and development, necessitates a shift in land use practices and increased environmental protection measures.  Failure to heed warnings and implement proper measures risks more devastating consequences in the future.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/problem-power-on-small-modular-reactor-plan/article68468861.ece</link>
			<description>The Indian government aims to collaborate with the private sector to explore small modular reactors (SMRs) as a potential source of nuclear energy. SMRs are smaller, potentially safer, and more cost-effective than traditional reactors. 

However, challenges remain in ensuring the commercial viability of SMRs, including addressing proliferation concerns and managing the significant amount of plutonium produced. 

The success of SMRs in India will depend on factors such as stable grids, market conditions, mass production capabilities, and the cost of safety and proliferation measures.</description>

			<title>Option or stratagem?: On Governors, powers and Bills</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/option-or-stratagem-on-governors-powers-and-bills/article68464847.ece</link>
			<description>Certain Governors have been sending Bills passed by State legislatures to the President for consideration, bypassing the assembly's legislative power. This raises concerns about the misuse of the provision for reservation of Bills, as it gives the Centre, acting through the President, a veto over State laws—a power not explicitly granted in the Constitution.  Kerala has challenged this practice in court, arguing it undermines federalism.  

The Supreme Court had previously ruled that Governors do not have a veto and must act on Bills promptly. However, some Governors, including those in West Bengal and Kerala, continue to bypass the assembly, delaying legislation for months and even refusing assent without justification.  The court's intervention is crucial to clarify the limits of a Governor's power and ensure the constitutional balance between the Centre and States.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bimpatience-with-jobs-on-the-budget-speech/article68464869.ece</link>
			<description>The recent Union Budget marked a significant shift in focus towards tackling India's employment crisis. A ₹2 lakh crore package was announced, aiming to assist 4.1 crore youth over five years. The package includes three employment-linked incentive schemes,  upgraded industrial training institutes aligned with industry demands, and a large-scale internship program. 

Acknowledging the crisis highlights a key concern raised by the opposition, particularly in light of vulnerabilities within the informal sector.  While the government's focus on boosting private investment through production incentives is commendable, critics argue that it falls short of directly addressing job creation. The success of this initiative depends on factors like private sector growth and consumption patterns.</description>

			<description>The recent IAS coaching center flooding incident in Delhi highlights the increasing problem of urban flooding, often exacerbated by human errors. Building regulations generally prohibit residential use of basements, but mixed-use buildings sometimes exploit them for income generation. 

The Delhi Master Plan mandates clearances from authorities for basement use in coaching centers, but enforcement remains lax.  The incident raises concerns about permit renewals, bribe demands, and insufficient flood resilience measures.  The article underscores the need for stringent implementation of building codes, including flood-resistant features, to prevent future tragedies.</description>

			<description>A rocket attack on a football ground in the Golan Heights, killing 12 young people, has escalated tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. While Hezbollah initially claimed to have targeted Israeli military outposts, they later denied involvement, a claim Israel dismisses. This incident follows a slow-burning war on Israel's northern border since Hamas's attack in October 2023. Both sides have engaged in escalating violence, with Hezbollah launching rocket attacks from Lebanon and Israel retaliating with airstrikes.  

The current situation risks spiraling into a wider conflict, with Hezbollah's strengthened military capabilities and potential Iranian involvement posing a significant threat.  Ending hostilities and de-escalating the situation is crucial to prevent further bloodshed and achieve lasting peace.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/competitive-federalism-on-the-niti-aayog/article68457865.ece</link>
			<description>The boycott of the NITI Aayog meeting by several states has raised concerns about the think tank's effectiveness and its role in "cooperative federalism".  Chief Ministers allege  a lack of allocations and projects for their states in the Union Budget, highlighting the absence of resource distribution powers for NITI Aayog.  

The shift from the Planning Commission to NITI Aayog has seemingly created "competitive federalism", with states feeling sidelined in crucial financial decisions.  The government's focus on "double engine" governance, which favors BJP-ruled states, further exacerbates this perception. 

Critics argue that the NITI Aayog needs to be re-imagined to restore some of the Planning Commission's functions to truly facilitate collaborative federalism.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/plastic-mess-on-indias-waste-problem/article68457840.ece</link>
			<description>India generates a massive amount of plastic waste annually, with only a fraction recycled. The EPR system, aiming to hold producers responsible for their plastic waste, relies on certificates issued to recyclers.  

Fraudulent certificates and cybersecurity breaches have plagued the system, casting doubt on the effectiveness of recycling efforts.  

To address this, the CPCB has initiated audits of recyclers and strengthened the EPR platform's security. Despite these measures, concerns remain regarding the system's long-term sustainability and the need to reduce plastic production. True progress requires a multi-faceted approach that tackles both waste management and the root causes of plastic pollution.</description>

Over 39,000 Palestinians have died in the ongoing conflict, with tens of thousands wounded and nearly the entire population displaced. 

Despite international condemnation and UN warnings of epidemics, the U.S. continues to provide military support to Israel. While the Biden administration expresses concern over civilian casualties, concrete action remains limited.  Mr Netanyahu's congressional address was met with applause, highlighting the support of U.S. elites, but simultaneous protests indicate a growing public dissent towards the war and U.S. involvement.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-sc-judgment-on-taxing-mining-activities-fiscal-federalism/article68450896.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that States have the power to tax mineral rights and mineral-bearing lands, overturning a long-held belief that this power was limited by Parliament's Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act of 1957.  

The Court found that the Act does not restrict States' taxation powers and that royalty payments are not considered taxes but contractual considerations. This decision strengthens fiscal federalism and provides States with a new avenue for revenue generation. While the ruling is welcomed by proponents of State autonomy, Justice Nagarathna dissented, expressing concern that it could lead to unhealthy competition among States, potentially increasing mineral costs and impacting the national market.</description>

			<description>The Union Budget for 2024-25, while allocating funds for national priorities, also highlights special provisions for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. Both states, led by parties crucial to the BJP's support after the 2024 general elections, received significant outlays. Andhra Pradesh, seeking ₹1 lakh crore, received ₹15,000 crore for developing its new capital, Amaravati, while Bihar received nearly ₹59,000 crore for infrastructure projects like roads, a power plant, and irrigation.  While acknowledging the need to address the fiscal challenges faced by these states, critics argue that neglecting infrastructure spending in opposition-ruled states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala risks hindering development in these economically advanced regions.</description>

			<description>The Paris Olympics 2024 is set to kick off amidst a world grappling with geopolitical tensions.  While the Games lack the COVID-19 restrictions of the previous edition, Russia's ban and Israel's participation despite controversy underscore global complexities.  The event brings together athletic powerhouses like the United States, China, and traditional rivals, along with smaller nations seeking to make their mark.  Tennis stars Nadal and Alcaraz represent Spain, while breakdancing's inclusion reflects the blurring lines between sport and entertainment.  Security concerns and lingering COVID-19 impacts remain top of mind for organizers, though the Olympics continue to offer a platform for hope, redemption, and global unity.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cleansing-neet-on-a-recast-test/article68441632.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India ruled on a disputed physics question in the NEET 2024 exam, reducing the number of toppers from 61 to 17.  The court, based on expert opinion from IIT Delhi, determined that the initially considered correct answer was wrong, impacting 4 lakh students. While counselling was delayed due to the need to revise scores, the court refused to cancel the entire exam. 

Despite the resolution, the NEET 2024 was marred by multiple controversies, including paper leaks and irregularities. The incident raises concerns about the integrity of the exam and the need for reform in the medical entrance process. The government is urged to address the high demand for medical careers and implement measures to ensure fair and transparent conduct of future NEET exams.</description>

Petitioners argued these directives were discriminatory and undermined India's secular nature.  The Court, acknowledging the need for immediate action, issued notices to the states involved in the yatra, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, and Madhya Pradesh. The case will be revisited on Friday. 
The Kanwar Yatra is a major pilgrimage for Shiva devotees, where participants walk hundreds of kilometers carrying water containers called kanwars.</description>

			<description>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget focused on addressing the concerns of India's unemployed youth. A ₹2 lakh crore package was proposed to create employment and skilling opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over five years. Key elements include a subsidy of one month's salary for new entrants in formal jobs, incentives for job creation in manufacturing, and a skilling program in collaboration with states and the private sector.  

The Budget also aims to support MSMEs through a credit guarantee scheme and easier access to business opportunities. Tax relief for salaried individuals and pensioners was another focus, along with some efforts to simplify the GST regime.  Despite these measures, social sector spending, including rural job guarantee (MGNREGA), saw notable reductions.</description>

			<description>President Joe Biden has unexpectedly withdrawn from the 2024 U.S. election, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Biden faced growing pressure from Democrats to step down due to concerns about his age and recent public performances. Harris is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, poised to potentially make history as the first person of color and Indian-origin President.  While she enjoys advantages like succession protocol and campaign funds, she also faces challenges, including lower name recognition and Republican attacks on her political stance.  Democrats are likely to rally around Harris, with potential running mates including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.  Despite these developments, Donald Trump's Republican campaign appears strong, particularly among independent voters in crucial swing states.</description>

			<description>Violent student protests in Bangladesh over the reintroduction of a controversial job quota system have resulted in at least 163 deaths. The protests, triggered by a High Court decision reinstating reservations for specific groups, were met with harsh responses from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.  

The crisis escalated as the government labeled protesters as collaborators with the Pakistani military during the 1971 Liberation War, leading to accusations of attacks by pro-government forces. The Supreme Court has since scaled back the quota system, making significant concessions to the protesters.  Despite the partial victory, the incident highlights the fragility of civil society-state relations in Bangladesh and the growing youth unemployment crisis which fuelled the unrest.  The government's handling of the situation has been criticized, with calls for accountability and a lasting solution through dialogue and reform.</description>

Such disruptions, often stemming from seemingly minor issues, can have cascading effects, disproportionately affecting sectors with limited redundancies. This incident underscores the responsibility of states, particularly in nations with digitally intensive economies, to ensure the resilience of their digital infrastructure.   

This requires a multi-pronged approach, including promoting open-source solutions, prioritizing data sovereignty, and fostering public trust through transparent software development practices and integrity testing. The July 19 outage serves as a potent reminder that digital infrastructure is not merely a technological marvel but a fundamental social and economic necessity that must be built with robust safeguards against failures.</description>

			<title>Wrongheaded policy: On the Karnataka jobs-for-locals bill</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-karnataka-jobs-for-locals-bill-wrongheaded-policy/article68423616.ece</link>
			<description>The Karnataka government's draft Bill proposing reservation in jobs for local candidates has raised concerns about its constitutionality. Similar Bills passed in other states, like Haryana and Andhra Pradesh, have faced legal challenges due to their violation of equality and freedom of movement guaranteed by the Constitution. These laws create artificial barriers to employment and are seen as protectionist policies.  The Karnataka Bill, which attempts to define "local" based on residency and Kannada proficiency, also faces challenges under Article 16(3) of the Constitution, which restricts reservation based on residence to public employment and mandates Parliamentary legislation. Instead of resorting to such divisive measures, the government should focus on enforcing labor rights for all workers, including migrant workers, to ensure a level playing field and address concerns about exploitation.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-the-republican-national-convention-trump-season/article68423626.ece</link>
			<description>Donald Trump's strong showing at the Republican National Convention solidified his expected nomination for the 2024 US presidential election. The event, a first in-person gathering since the COVID-19 pandemic, saw Trump deliver his first public remarks since a recent assassination attempt. Republican strategists emphasized the role of women, featuring figures like Melania Trump,  Lara Trump, Sarah Sanders, and Usha Chilukuri Vance. Trump's choice of  39-year-old  J.D.  Vance as his running mate signals a strategy to appeal to younger voters, while also resonating with white, male America and strengthening his campaign's presence in key Rust Belt states. Although polls currently favor Trump, the race remains fluid with three months until the election.</description>

			<description>The Maharashtra government's proposed Bill to combat left-wing extremism has drawn criticism for being unnecessary and potentially unconstitutional.  Critics argue that existing laws are sufficient to tackle the limited issue of left-wing extremism in the state. They express concern that the Bill's overbroad definitions, including the questionable term "urban Naxal," could be used to target lawyers, activists, and dissenters. Provisions allowing for the declaration of organizations as unlawful and criminalizing membership or assistance raise alarm about potential suppression of legitimate dissent and organized protests. The Bill's draconian measures, such as the seizure of property and eviction of occupants, further fuel concerns about its potential for abuse.</description>

			<title>Trade tact: On India’s trade policy focus</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trade-tact-on-indias-trade-policy-focus/article68418597.ece</link>
			<description>India's goods exports grew for the third consecutive month in June, reaching $35.2 billion, while imports rose 5% to $56.2 billion. This resulted in a trade deficit of $21 billion, a 9.4% increase from June 2023.  

Although the oil deficit narrowed slightly to $10 billion, a drop in petroleum exports and a surge in imports indicate domestic demand concerns. Gold imports fell significantly, while silver imports witnessed a sharp increase.  Gems and jewellery exports continued their decline.  

Overall, the import bill excluding oil and gold saw a 3% increase year-on-year, suggesting a recovery in domestic demand. The government is urged to focus on boosting exports and addressing disruptions in the bullion market. A revival in global demand and anticipated interest rate cuts offer opportunities for Indian exporters.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India has raised concerns about personal liberty in the context of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  The Court questioned the necessity for arresting individuals under the PMLA, highlighting the need for officers to demonstrate justifiable reasons for arrest. 

They also expressed concern over the frequent stays granted by higher courts on reasoned bail orders, emphasizing that such actions should be exceptions rather than routine practice. The Court underlined the importance of statutory compliance and judicial scrutiny in arrest decisions under the PMLA, stressing that arrests should not be arbitrary and should consider both incriminating and exonerating evidence.</description>

			<description>The Narendra Modi government faces the challenge of job creation in its third term, with increasing numbers of young job seekers and a changing economy driven by technology.  Studies highlight the severity of the issue, with stagnant manufacturing employment, slow transition from agriculture, and inadequate job creation rates.  Policy recommendations include a robot tax to incentivize job creation,  revival of the Indian Labour Conference, and increased public investment in agriculture.  The government needs to strategize a growth model that prioritizes job creation,  especially given the risk of social unrest if economic growth doesn't translate to employment gains.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bsurprise-acceleration-on-price-gains/article68410800.ece</link>
			<description>India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 5.08% in June, driven by a spike in food prices.  Year-on-year food price inflation jumped to 9.36%, primarily due to a 29.3% surge in vegetable prices and sharp increases in potatoes, onions, and tomatoes.  This uptick in food prices, marked by the fastest sequential acceleration in 11 months, has raised concerns for monetary policymakers as rising food prices can ripple through the wider economy.  The situation is further complicated by deficient rainfall in key agricultural regions, including Punjab, which could impact future food production and prices.</description>

			<description>Recent continental championships, the Euros and Copa America, demonstrated the enduring passion for international football. 

Spain's victory in the Euros showcased their tactical prowess and blend of experience and youth, while Argentina  clinched their 16th Copa America title in a closely contested tournament. 

The tournaments highlighted the emergence of talented youngsters like Lamine Yamal and Jamal Musiala, while established stars like Messi and Ronaldo continued to impress. Despite solid performances from Spain, Argentina, and various emerging teams, organizational issues marred the Copa America in the US, raising concerns ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</description>

			<description>During a political rally in Pennsylvania, former U.S. President Donald Trump was the target of an assassination attempt. The shooter, identified as Thomas Crooks, died after law enforcement returned fire. The incident occurred amidst heightened political tensions, coming as the 2024 presidential election nears. While there was bipartisan condemnation of the attack, concerns remain about the potential for increased polarization and the use of inflammatory rhetoric, particularly by Trump's campaign. The lasting impact on the election and the future of American politics remains to be seen.</description>

			<description>Carlos Alcaraz’s victory over Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon signifies a shifting power dynamic in men’s tennis.  At 21, Alcaraz joins a select group of recent players like Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev who pose a challenge to the long-standing dominance of the Big Three.  Alcaraz’s win marks the first time in two decades that three consecutive Majors haven’t been won by Federer, Nadal, or Djokovic. 

Alcaraz’s comprehensive victory, achieved for the second time in a row, coupled with his success on all three major surfaces, cements his place as a complete and dominant force in the sport.</description>

			<description>Recent by-election results across seven states suggest a decline in support for the BJP and a potential shift in voter sentiment. Opposition parties, including the Congress and TMC, secured victories in several seats, indicating public resistance to BJP politics. Notably, the Congress regained its original strength in Himachal Pradesh after winning two seats previously held by defectors who joined the BJP.  Similarly in Uttarakhand, a sitting BJP MLA who defected was defeated by the Congress. While the Congress faced losses in Madhya Pradesh, the overall trend suggests a challenge to the BJP's dominance.</description>

			<description>In a predictable development, Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a trust vote after his Communist Party withdrew support, triggering a coalition shift.  Khadka Prasad Oli of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) now returns as Prime Minister, forming a government with Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress. This power realignment mirrors Nepal's history of unstable coalition governments focused on maintaining power rather than principled leadership. 

This instability, rooted in the pursuit of power over ideology, has hindered progress and left Nepal struggling, despite post-monarchy reforms.  The author suggests a presidential system as a potential solution to address the chronic political instability.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Ba-wobbly-walk-on-the-modi-moscow-visit-india-russia-ties/article68396190.ece</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Russia, his first since 2019, aimed to strengthen bilateral ties and address economic cooperation. Despite emphasizing the "bilateral" nature of the visit, it drew international attention, particularly criticism from Kyiv and Washington due to its timing.  

The visit resulted in reaffirmation of the India-Russia relationship and an economic target of $100 billion in trade by 2030. Modi also secured assurances for the return of Indian recruits serving in the Russian army. Notably, the visit lacked announcements of new military purchases, possibly due to logistical delays and international concerns.  Modi’s statement regarding the need for a "solution beyond the battlefield" and his subsequent travel to Vienna underscored India's efforts to balance its stance in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</description>

			<description>A deadly bus accident in Uttar Pradesh, where 18 lives were lost, has raised serious concerns about road safety in India. 

Investigations suggest the bus lacked crucial safety features, highlighting the multidimensional nature of road safety, encompassing factors like vehicle maintenance, infrastructure design, and driver vigilance.  The high number of road accident fatalities in India necessitates stronger enforcement of existing safety standards, improved data collection, and increased public awareness of vehicle safety measures. Achieving comprehensive road safety requires a concerted effort from local authorities, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, and the public.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/secular-remedy-on-the-muslim-woman-maintenance-and-court-verdict/article68393434.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that divorced Muslim women can seek maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), clarifying the impact of the 1986 Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act.  

While the 1986 Act codifies certain rights for divorced Muslim women, including maintenance during Iddat, the court clarified that this does not override their right to seek maintenance under the CrPC.  Both provisions, it held, exist in parallel, allowing women to avail of the remedy most beneficial to their situation. 



This verdict upholds the secular nature of the legal system and ensures  Muslim women have the same access to maintenance as women of other religions.</description>

			<description>The 2024 NEET-UG exam has been marred by controversy, with allegations of a paper leak, malpractice, and technical failures.  

The Supreme Court has rescheduled a hearing to address these concerns, while a CBI investigation is underway. An IIT Madras report analyzed the results and found no evidence of widespread malpractice, attributing score increases to a syllabus reduction.  Despite this, public outcry and distrust in the system persist.  

Moving forward, transparency is crucial. Open discussion, addressing concerns, and acknowledging errors are essential to rebuilding trust. The government must ensure greater transparency in the examination process and address issues regarding security measures.</description>

			<description>West Bengal Governor C.V. Ananda Bose has escalated a conflict with the state government by demanding a report on action taken against two police officers. Bose alleges impropriety by Kolkata City Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal and Deputy Commissioner of Police Indira Mukherjee regarding a sexual harassment complaint filed against him by a Raj Bhavan employee. He also criticizes their handling of a meeting with individuals complaining about post-election violence. The Governor's request raises questions about his authority to initiate disciplinary action against central service officers serving the state government. 


This incident, along with other recent disputes between Bose and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, highlights the growing tension between Raj Bhavan and the state government, mirroring the broader conflict between the Centre and the state.</description>

			<description>India's growing gig economy, characterized by app-based work in sectors like ride-sharing and food delivery, lacks proper regulation and security for its workers.  While the Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024, offers a positive step towards addressing this issue, it stops short of granting gig workers the status of employees.  

The bill aims to prevent arbitrary dismissals, establish grievance redress mechanisms, and provide social security through a welfare board funded by the government and platforms.  Advocates highlight the need for mandatory registration to ensure worker visibility and call for a transaction-based welfare fee to ensure sufficient funding.  The bill's swift implementation is crucial, given the precarious situation of gig workers and the lackluster track record of similar initiatives in other states.</description>

			<description>Five Indian Army personnel were killed in an ambush by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir on July 8th, the fourth such incident in 48 hours. This attack occurred on the anniversary of Burhan Wani's death and highlights a worrying trend of terrorism shifting towards the Rajouri-Poonch region. 

The ambush, coupled with a previous attack on pilgrims in June, marks a concerning upsurge in violence after a period of relative calm. This new wave is attributed to various factors, including troop redeployment to the Ladakh border, the use of advanced technology by terrorists, and the push to involve local militants. Addressing this challenge requires a comprehensive strategy involving swift government action, stakeholder engagement, and improved security measures.</description>

			<description>Russia's missile strikes on June 8, 2023, which killed at least 42 civilians, including at least two in a Kyiv children's hospital, highlight the brutality of the ongoing invasion. While Russia claims to have targeted military objectives, the extensive civilian casualties raise serious doubts about their intentions. The attack coincided with a NATO summit where member countries are considering long-term support for Ukraine, including substantial military aid. Despite Russia making incremental territorial gains, their progress has been slow, and Ukraine has actively engaged in drone attacks against Russian targets, including ships and energy facilities. 

With no clear military solution in sight, calls for dialogue are intensifying. China and India both expressed support for talks, urging Russia to cease its attacks and enter serious negotiations.</description>

			<description>After a decade of tension, the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have proposed a three-tier mechanism to resolve outstanding issues since the state's formation. 

This collaborative approach aims to address disputes concerning water sharing, asset distribution, and the return of villages. The tiers involve committees of officials, ministers, and finally, the Chief Ministers themselves, escalating as necessary. This move signals a positive shift towards cooperation and conflict resolution, benefiting the intertwined economies and communities of both states.</description>

			<description>France’s New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, emerged as the largest bloc in the recent snap election, winning 182 seats. President Macron's centrist alliance trailed behind with 168 seats, while Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally secured 143 seats, exceeding expectations.  
 
This fragmented result leaves France facing political uncertainty as no party secured a majority. Macron’s centrist agenda faces challenges, while the success of the National Rally reflects a broader trend of the European right gaining ground.</description>

It marks the first meeting between Modi and Putin since the Ukraine war began, providing an opportunity to address its impact on their ties.  Concerns include Russia's growing reliance on China, potential disruptions to defence supplies and spares, and Indian recruitment by the Russian army.  Modi's visit comes amidst heightened geopolitical tensions, contrasting with the NATO summit in Washington. While India maintains its commitment to traditional ties with Russia, it has also engaged with the West, emphasizing dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the Ukraine conflict.</description>

			<description>Iran's recent presidential election, necessitated by the death of President Raisi, resulted in a surprise victory for Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate. Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a platform of change and engagement with the West, secured 53.6% of the vote against conservative rival Saeed Jalili.  

Despite declining voter turnout in previous elections, a  significant resurgence of voters in the run-off, fueled by hopes for  reform, contributed to Pezeshkian's triumph.  His victory presents an opportunity for gradual reforms and diplomatic engagement, potentially easing the Islamic Republic's economic and social tensions. It remains to be seen how Pezeshkian, with his limited executive experience, will navigate the country's theocratic structure and the challenges ahead.</description>

			<title>Walk the talk: On the Manipur crisis and reconciliation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/walk-the-talk-on-the-manipur-crisis-and-reconciliation/article68371229.ece</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally addressed the Manipur conflict in Parliament, acknowledging the crisis while asserting that law and order has been restored. He called for peace and stability, but also blamed the Congress for past handling of similar incidents. However, despite Modi's claims, Manipur remains far from normal with thousands displaced and unable to return home. Armed vigilantes operate freely, central agencies have taken over governance, and the state government lacks credibility. Modi's response, though belated, needs concrete action and leadership changes to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation.</description>

			<title>​Laboured change: On the U.K. general election result</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Blaboured-change-on-the-uk-general-election-result/article68371187.ece</link>
			<description>Keir Starmer's Labour Party secured a landslide victory in the UK general election, with 412 seats in Parliament.  This result signifies a decisive defeat for the Conservative Party after 14 years in power, with voters expressing dissatisfaction over Brexit, economic mismanagement, and various scandals. Starmer's agenda focuses on economic reform, including wealth creation for the working class, taxation of high earners, and investment in public services.  The election also saw the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which gained over 14% of the vote despite winning only four seats. Its success will likely pressure Starmer to address concerns about immigration.  Indian interests, particularly regarding the stalled India-UK Free Trade Agreement, will be closely watched as Starmer's government prioritizes economic recovery.</description>

			<title>​Dangerous precedent: On the U.S. President and majority ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bdangerous-precedent-on-the-us-president-and-majority-ruling-by-the-us-supreme-court/article68367117.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that Presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution, except for acts unrelated to their core constitutional duties. This decision, based on separation of powers, grants absolute immunity for core duties and presumptive immunity for official acts, while unofficial actions are not protected.  

The ruling doesn't directly address former President Trump's potential prosecution related to the 2020 election, but sets a threshold for future cases. Critics argue this verdict threatens democracy by shielding the President from accountability, potentially allowing for corrupt or illegal actions. While acknowledging the need to protect the Presidency from undue scrutiny, dissenting justices highlight the danger of unchecked power.</description>

			<title>Grave concern: On wild-type poliovirus type-1 cases in Pakistan, Afghanistan</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/grave-concern-on-wild-type-poliovirus-type-1-cases-in-pakistan-afghanistan/article68367144.ece</link>
			<description>The eradication of wild-type poliovirus type-1 (WPV1) by 2026 faces challenges as the virus shows signs of resurgence in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  

Despite a decrease in cases in 2023 compared to 2022, recent months have seen an uptick, raising concerns about potential surpassing of 2022 case numbers.  The circulation of the virus in the environment is also increasing, with positive environmental samples found in areas historically associated with polio outbreaks.  This resurgence is attributed to challenges with vaccination coverage, including fake finger marking practices, leaving unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children vulnerable.  The situation in Pakistan appears particularly concerning, with the spread of WPV1 detected there after being mainly confined to Afghanistan in 2022.  
The movement of Afghan refugees further exacerbates the risk of international spread.</description>

			<title>Avoidable tragedy: On the Hathras stampede</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/avoidable-tragedy-on-the-hathras-stampede/article68363621.ece</link>
			<description>A stampede at a religious gathering in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, resulted in over 120 deaths, primarily women and children seeking spiritual solace.  Overcrowding, with an estimated 2.5 lakh attendees in a venue meant for 80,000, and a rush to collect soil near the preacher are cited as potential causes.  

The incident highlights the Uttar Pradesh administration's unpreparedness, evident in the inadequate response and resources.  Past tragedies involving large gatherings suggest that with proactive measures, the loss of life could have been prevented. This tragedy calls for stringent action against the responsible parties, a just compensation package for the victims' families, and improved crowd management strategies for future events.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bspirit-of-accommodation-on-conduct-in-the-18th-lok-sabha/article68363795.ece</link>
			<description>The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha witnessed a resurgence of parliamentary debate, despite heightened tension between the government and the opposition.  Rahul Gandhi, as the newly designated Leader of Opposition, launched attacks on the NDA government, prompting a response from Prime Minister Modi who questioned the Congress's track record. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the Constitution while accusing each other of undermining it. 

The return of a strong opposition and coalition politics holds promise for restoring Parliament's role.  An increased opposition presence could lead to greater scrutiny of bills and act as a check on the government's legislative agenda. The session also saw a restoration of parliamentary traditions, including the election of Om Birla as Speaker and the continued observance of decorum.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mixed-signals-on-data-and-the-key-industrial-sectors/article68359646.ece</link>
			<description>India's eight core infrastructure sectors witnessed slowed activity in May due to a severe heatwave. While coal and electricity generation saw double-digit growth, sectors like crude oil, fertilizers, and cement contracted. The heatwave disrupted construction and power demand surged, impacting cement and steel output. The agricultural sector continued to face challenges, with a fifth consecutive month of fertilizer output decline.  

However, a recent survey suggests a rebound in manufacturing activity in June, driven by buoyant demand and increased hiring. Despite this positive trend, inflation and rising cost pressures remain concerns.</description>

			<description>Wimbledon 2024 marks a turning point in tennis history with the retirement of Roger Federer and declining form of the 'Big Four' (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray).  

Novak Djokovic, recovering from knee surgery, and Andy Murray, with a recent back operation, are competing with diminished capabilities. 

  The absence of the Williams sisters also signifies a new era. Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Wimbledon champion, and Jannik Sinner, the Italian with a recent Australian Open victory, are leading contenders among men.

 The women's competition is more open, with Iga Swiatek as the top seed but less experience on grass. Coco Gauff, a promising American, and others like Jessica Pegula and Ons Jabeur are vying for the title.</description>

			<title>Sense of uncertainty: On the new criminal laws, state of preparedness</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sense-of-uncertainty-on-the-new-criminal-laws-state-of-preparedness/article68355670.ece</link>
			<description>India has implemented three new criminal laws: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.  Concerns exist about the preparedness of the police, courts, and legal professionals for these changes, as training and implementation have been limited. The new laws' unfamiliar Hindi names and lack of widespread public discussion have also raised questions.  Certain provisions, such as the expanded police custody powers and the inclusion of 'terrorism' as an ordinary offense, have generated  uncertainty and worry about potential abuse.  While some procedural reforms are welcomed,  a general sense of uncertainty persists regarding the overall impact of these new laws.</description>

			<title>​Waiting for the reformist: On the Iran election</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bwaiting-for-the-reformist-on-the-iran-election/article68355722.ece</link>
			<description>Iran will hold a presidential run-off on July 5th between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and conservative Saeed Jalili after no candidate secured 50% of the vote in the first round.  Pezeshkian received 42.5% while Jalili garnered 38.8%. The election, triggered by the death of President Raisi, takes place amidst economic struggles and social unrest. 

The outcome is unlikely to significantly shift Iran's core policies, though the elected President can influence their implementation. Historically, reformists have struggled to deliver meaningful change due to the powerful influence of the Shia clergy and unelected institutions. Low voter turnout, at 39.9%, reflects public apathy and the limitations of Iran's political system.</description>

Virat Kohli shone with a crucial 76, while all-rounders Axar Patel and Hardik Pandya played key roles.  Jasprit Bumrah delivered a masterful bowling performance, while Arshdeep Singh demonstrated composure under pressure. South Africa, while falling short, impressed with their fight. The tournament also saw a fairytale run from Afghanistan, showcasing their resilience. India's victory marks an end of an era with the retirements of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja from T20s, as well as coach Rahul Dravid.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bweaponising-pmla-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-hemant-soren-case/article68351902.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Jharkhand's former Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Hemant Soren. The bail comes after his five-month imprisonment under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), stemming from a case alleging money laundering linked to land dealings.

The Jharkhand High Court, while granting bail, questioned the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) claims and methods. The court raised doubts about the ED's assertion that Soren had been plotting to build a banquet hall on the disputed land, based on a consultant's plan found on an accused's phone.  Furthermore, the court found the ED's accusation that Soren orchestrated a plan to have the land transferred to an individual to evade legal culpability to be unconvincing.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-fresh-start-on-the-goods-and-services-tax-council-meet/article68340666.ece</link>
			<description>The GST Council recently convened for the first time in nine months to address a backlog of industry requests and clarifications. The agenda included simplifying procedures, reducing litigation, and offering tax relief.  

Key decisions included exempting hostel accommodation costing up to ₹20,000 a month and railway passenger services from GST. A uniform 12% GST rate was approved for packing cartons, milk cans, and solar cookers.  

The Council also waived interest and penalty on tax dues for the first three years of GST, provided they are paid by March 2025.  It lowered pre-deposit requirements for appeals and introduced a new form for correcting errors in previous returns. The anti-profiteering clause was ended, and biometric Aadhaar authentication will be mandated for GST registrations.</description>

			<title>​Debt trap: On crisis in Kenya</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bdebt-trap-on-crisis-in-kenya/article68344717.ece</link>
			<description>Kenyan President William Ruto's decision to rapidly pass an IMF-backed finance bill increasing taxes has sparked violent protests.  The bill, intended to raise 200 billion Kenyan shillings ($1.55 billion) to address Kenya's $80 billion debt, faced strong public opposition, leading to at least 23 deaths and 200 injuries.  

Despite the riots, the government argued that its hands were tied due to the country's heavy debt burden, which consumes over half of its revenue. This crisis highlights the pitfalls of relying heavily on debt for development, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. The IMF deal has drawn criticism for placing an undue burden on ordinary Kenyans.   

President Ruto has since withdrawn the bill and promised austerity measures, but he faces the difficult task of balancing his people's needs with Kenya's creditor demands.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bunwarranted-arrest-on-the-case-of-arvind-kejriwal/article68340904.ece</link>
			<description>Arvind Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI in the Delhi excise policy case raises concerns about bad faith. The timing of the arrest, just before the Supreme Court was set to hear an appeal regarding his bail in a related money-laundering case, suggests an attempt to deny him release.  

While the allegations against Mr. Kejriwal are serious, the investigation has been lengthy, relying largely on statements from pardoned accused. The High Court's decision to uphold the stay on his bail, contrasting with the lower court's initial ruling, highlights the politicization of the judiciary. 


The arrest underscores the need for impartial investigations and for those in power to avoid targeting opponents through legal means.  Mr. Kejriwal's decision not to resign immediately following his arrest also fuels perceptions of potential interference.</description>

			<description>The recent resumption of fishing off India's eastern coast led to a clash between the Indian and Sri Lankan navies, resulting in the death of a Sri Lankan sailor. This incident reignited the long-standing dispute over fishing rights in the Palk Bay. 

Indian authorities have been working to secure the release of 40 Indian fishermen detained by Sri Lanka.  The situation calls for renewed dialogue between India and Sri Lanka to find a lasting solution to this sensitive issue.  Experts emphasize the need to address both the livelihood concerns of fishermen and the importance of marine ecosystem preservation.  The slow progress of India's deep-sea fishing project, aimed at providing alternative income sources for fishermen, further highlights the urgency for a comprehensive approach.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Blip-service-on-the-emergency-and-governments-actions/article68336750.ece</link>
			<description>The 2023 Lok Sabha Speaker's resolution condemning the Emergency is viewed as  insufficient action given the government's own recent actions resembling Emergency-era tactics.  

The government's suppression of dissent through laws like preventive detention, targeting of Opposition figures, and curtailing press freedom are seen as a worrying trend echoing the dark chapter of the Emergency. The reduced majority of the BJP in the 18th Lok Sabha is interpreted as a signal that voters disapprove of these authoritarian tendencies. Moving forward, a robust Opposition, a vigilant judiciary, and a watchful civil society are crucial to prevent a repeat of the Emergency and protect democratic values in India.</description>

			<title>Ending defections: On politics in Telangana</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-defections-on-politics-in-telangana/article68336345.ece</link>
			<description>The recent defection of BRS MLA M. Sanjay Kumar to the ruling Congress in Telangana has reduced the opposition's strength in the Assembly. This event highlights the recurring issue of defections in Indian politics, with Telangana witnessing mass defections since its formation in 2014.

The incident raises concerns about the effectiveness of the Anti-Defection Law, which has provisions allowing disqualifications but lacks a clear timeline for decisions by Speakers. This ambiguity, coupled with the Speaker's inherent political allegiance, often renders the law ineffective. 


The defection also underscores the importance of a strong opposition for robust democracy and checks on the ruling party's power. The past decade has shown the dangers of single-party dominance, both at the national and state levels, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards against defections.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Modi's call for consensus governing in the 18th Lok Sabha first session has been met with mixed signals. While both the NDA and the INDIA bloc reiterate their commitment to the Constitution, their political discourse remains contentious.  They are currently clashing over the Speaker and Deputy Speaker positions. Despite the BJP's slim majority, the opposition's willingness to support the NDA's candidate for Speaker in exchange for the Deputy Speaker post offers a potential avenue for  cooperation.  

The success of Modi's call for consensus hinges on tangible actions, such as frequent interactions between the government and the opposition. This might not always be achievable, but it could contribute to political stability and pave the way for  shared decision-making on critical issues.</description>

			<description>Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, will be released after a 14-year ordeal. He will plead guilty in the U.S. to espionage charges related to publishing classified documents, receiving a sentence of five years, the time he's already served in British prison. Assange's release comes after years of legal battles and international pressure.  

The case highlights the clash between press freedom and national security, particularly concerning the prosecution of a publisher for revealing government secrets. Assange's treatment stands in contrast to that of Chelsea Manning, who leaked the same information and was imprisoned for 35 years before her sentence was commuted.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Balter-the-status-quo-on-the-conflict-in-manipur/article68327957.ece</link>
			<description>Over a year since ethnic violence erupted in Manipur, killing 221 and displacing 50,000,  peace remains elusive. The conflict has spread to previously peaceful districts, fueled by armed militias with looted weaponry. While the central government has imposed quasi-Article 355 rule, Prime Minister Modi's involvement remains minimal. Despite security briefings by Home Minister Amit Shah, the situation worsens.

The recent general election saw the opposition Congress party win decisively, signaling public dissatisfaction. A change in leadership is necessary, but simply reshuffling officials won't suffice. Disarming militias, empowering peace-seeking civil society actors, and fostering reconciliation between ethnic groups are crucial steps towards restoring normalcy.</description>

			<description>The Indian government's ₹72,000-crore infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island is facing scrutiny over its environmental and social impacts. The project, which includes a trans-shipment port, airport, and power plant, will necessitate clearing over 130 sq. km of forest, potentially harming rare species and the island's delicate ecosystem.  While compensatory afforestation is planned, its effectiveness remains questionable given the vast ecological differences between the affected rainforest and the designated area in Haryana. Concerns have also been raised regarding the lack of transparency in the environmental clearance process and potential violations of the rights of the indigenous Shompen tribe.</description>

			<title>Limit and excess: On the Patna High Court judgment and enhanced reservation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/limit-and-excess-on-the-patna-high-court-judgment-and-enhanced-reservation/article68324378.ece</link>
			<description>The Patna High Court struck down Bihar's increased reservation policy, citing the 50% ceiling imposed by judicial precedents. The government had raised quotas for various backward classes, based on a caste survey, aiming for "proportionate equality". The court, however, upheld the principle that 'adequate representation' does not equal 'proportionate representation'. 

While acknowledging the possibility of exceeding the quota in "extraordinary situations", the court denied Bihar's plea, arguing that geographical remoteness was the only justifying factor. This decision raises questions about Bihar's ability to implement social justice programs despite its backwardness. The court also highlighted the lack of in-depth study before implementing the enhanced reservation, prompting scrutiny of the caste survey's comprehensiveness.</description>

			<description>The upcoming by-election in Vikravandi, Tamil Nadu, is marked by the AIADMK's decision to boycott, citing fears of electoral malpractice. This move, likely influenced by the party's poor performance in the 2024 general election, comes amid concerns that the DMK may resort to money and muscle power. 

Despite past instances of electoral irregularities, including allegations of bribery and voter intimidation, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has rarely taken strict action against parties involved.  The success of this by-election hinges on the ECI's ability to ensure a free and fair process, curbing the influence of money and freebies, and dispelling doubts about its impartiality.</description>

While the Ministry promptly vowed to conduct a fresh exam and initiated a CBI probe, many examinees feel the lack of transparency is concerning. Questions remain unanswered regarding the sudden shift to an offline exam format and  potential vulnerability to leaks. The NTA faces demands for accountability, systemic overhaul, and scrutiny regarding its handling of technical issues, cheating, and previous examination controversies.</description>
