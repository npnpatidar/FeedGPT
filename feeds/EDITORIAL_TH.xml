			<title>Irrational Israel: On the ceasefire proposal and Hamas</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irrational-israel-on-the-ceasefire-proposal-and-hamas/article68153653.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating conflict in Gaza following Hamas's acceptance of a ceasefire proposal mediated by Qatar and Egypt. Despite initial celebrations in Rafah, Israel rejected the proposal, stating it did not meet its core demands, and proceeded to send tanks to Rafah, seizing control of the border crossing with Egypt. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have been reported to have killed over 34,000 Palestinians and wounded over 77,000 since October 7, leading to widespread displacement and a humanitarian crisis, including a famine in northern Gaza.

The article criticizes the Israeli government's approach to the conflict, comparing it to the actions of Hamas and suggesting that Israel's military performance has not lived up to its historical reputation. It argues that a continued war would further isolate Israel internationally, especially with a genocide case pending at the UN's top court. The article concludes by advocating for a negotiated ceasefire that includes the release of all hostages and an IDF withdrawal, noting Hamas's willingness to agree to such terms. The question remains whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will agree to the ceasefire.</description>

			<title>A sob story: on onion exports</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-sob-story-on-onion-exports/article68150034.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Indian government's recent changes to onion export policies. After a six-month ban due to high prices and supply concerns, the government has categorized onion exports as 'free' with a minimum export price of $550 per tonne and an additional 40% levy. This decision follows an earlier allowance of 2,000 tonnes of white onion exports, which led to accusations of preferential treatment for Gujarat farmers just before the state's Lok Sabha vote. The Centre justified the export of white onions, which are more costly to produce, by stating it would aid Maharashtra, India's largest onion producer.

The timing of the export policy change is notable as it precedes the voting in Maharashtra's onion farming regions. The Centre argues that the decision is based on stable mandi prices and adequate supplies. However, the viability of exports is questionable due to the floor price and export duty, making them feasible only if domestic prices are around ₹64 per kilo or higher. The article also notes that international onion prices are decreasing as Egypt and Pakistan lifted their export restrictions earlier than India.

The article suggests that the export curbs, expected to last until the next government takes charge, will have lasted almost a year, potentially affecting farmers' decisions to sow onions. It highlights the need for nuanced policymaking, considering the long-term context of onion prices and the impact of export bans on farmers' incomes. The current policy does not seem to encourage sowing, which is detrimental to controlling inflation and achieving India's goal of becoming a global food supplier. The article concludes by reflecting on the complex balance between consumer interests and farmer welfare.</description>

			<title>Searching for a wave: On the general election so far</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/searching-for-a-wave-on-the-general-election-so-far/article68150202.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the third round of polling for the 18th Lok Sabha, where over 1,300 candidates contested in 93 constituencies across 12 states and UTs. This phase marks the completion of voting in more than half of the total seats. A BJP candidate in Surat was elected unopposed after opposition candidates withdrew. The article highlights the BJP's strong position in Gujarat and a notable contest in Maharashtra's Baramati. It also covers the political debate over reservation policies, with the BJP and Congress offering conflicting views. Allegations of sexual crimes against Prajwal Revanna, a JD(S) MP, have created challenges for the BJP in Karnataka. The article suggests that both major parties are struggling to generate a decisive public wave in their favor for the ongoing elections.</description>

			<title>Time to talk: On Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Mullaperiyar dam row</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-talk-the-hindu-editorial-on-tamil-nadu-kerala-and-the-mullaperiyar-dam-row/article68145900.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing dispute between Tamil Nadu and Kerala over the Mullaperiyar dam. Despite a Supreme Court judgment from 10 years ago, which allowed Tamil Nadu to store water up to 142 feet, issues remain unresolved. Tamil Nadu accuses Kerala of obstructing maintenance work on the dam, which is crucial for its safety. Although committees have been established to address these issues, no solution has been found. Tamil Nadu is pushing for a comprehensive dam safety evaluation by December 30, 2026, as required by the Dam Safety Act, 2021.

Judicial interventions have led to the adoption of a rule curve for operating the dam's shutters during floods, despite Kerala's objections. Additionally, a car parking project proposed by the Kerala government has become a subject of litigation, with Tamil Nadu disputing the project's location.

The article suggests that both states should engage in bilateral negotiations to resolve their differences while maintaining the option of legal recourse. It emphasizes the importance of proactive political leadership to prevent the exploitation of water and dam safety issues for emotional manipulation. The talks may not lead to a major breakthrough but could help both states understand each other's positions and prevent the situation from being aggravated by vested interests.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/twin-towers-the-hindu-editorial-on-china-india-and-badminton/article68145884.ece</link>
			<description>China asserted its badminton dominance by winning both the Thomas and Uber Cup titles in Chengdu, repeating their 2012 feat. The men's team, led by Shi Yu Qi, secured their 11th victory, overcoming a recent slump. The women's team, determined to bounce back from their 2022 loss to South Korea, showcased their strength with 24 consecutive wins. India's performance served as a pre-Olympic evaluation, with mixed results. Despite a quarter-final defeat to China in the Thomas Cup, players like H.S. Prannoy and Lakshya Sen showed promise, while the women's team gained valuable experience despite losses to China and Japan.</description>

			<title>In the frontline: On Rahul Gandhi contesting from Rae Bareli</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-the-frontline-the-hindu-editorial-on-rahul-gandhi-contesting-from-rae-bareli/article68143256.ece</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, has decided to contest the upcoming elections from Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, a constituency with strong familial ties. Despite previous losses in Amethi, he opted for Rae Bareli, where his mother Sonia Gandhi won in 2019. This decision comes after his victory in Wayanad, Kerala, in the last election. Some criticize his delayed announcement, suggesting it lacks clarity and decisiveness. Gandhi aims to combat the BJP's Hindutva politics and promote social justice, focusing on the Hindi belt and western regions. His entry into Uttar Pradesh's electoral arena could invigorate the opposition, particularly in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. However, the Congress faces a daunting challenge against the BJP's stronghold in the region. Winning both Wayanad and Rae Bareli would solidify Gandhi's stance against the BJP's ideology, signaling a long-term commitment to the ideological battle.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the ongoing polling in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, focusing on the challenges and dynamics surrounding voter turnout and political participation. It highlights the disparity in turnout between different regions, with higher participation in Jammu compared to low turnout in the Kashmir Valley, attributed to disillusionment over political changes and central rule.

Additionally, it mentions the campaign in Ladakh led by activist Sonam Wangchuk and the lack of consensus among opposition parties in the region.</description>

			<description>The article calls for sensitive and swift action from the Karnataka police and state administration regarding allegations of rape and sexual harassment against Prajwal Revanna, a suspended Janata Dal (Secular) party leader and Member of Parliament from Hassan, Karnataka. It emphasizes the need to protect the privacy and safety of the women involved, urging the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to remove alleged videos and safeguard the identities of the women.

The article stresses the importance of survivors coming forward, acknowledges the challenges they face, and calls for accountability, including potential resignations of accused leaders pending investigation.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the Israel-Hamas conflict and the response of President Joe Biden. Initially, Biden supported Israel's actions while also attempting diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation. However, as the conflict persisted and civilian casualties in Gaza mounted, criticism grew. The article highlights Biden's efforts to achieve a ceasefire but criticizes his overall approach, arguing that it undermines America's moral stance and weakens its position in the region. It calls for Biden to reassess his policy towards Israel and Palestine, suggesting measures like suspending arms sales to Israel to promote peace.</description>

			<title>​Tipping point: On the GST and reforms</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Btipping-point-on-the-gst-and-reforms/article68132422.ece</link>
			<description>In April, GST revenues surpassed ₹2 lakh crore for the first time, marking a 12.4% increase from the previous year. This spike is typical for April due to year-end tax activities. While this might not become the new norm, continued economic momentum could sustain growth. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman hailed this as a significant achievement, citing a strong economy and improved collection efficiency. The focus now shifts to GST reform, aiming for simplicity and expansion of the tax base. Both major political parties have outlined plans for GST reform in their manifestos, emphasizing the need for stakeholder consultation and smart reforms to boost consumption and pave the way for sustained investment and growth.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Beastern-front-on-the-electoral-battle-in-west-bengal/article68132397.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political landscape in West Bengal ahead of the general elections. Despite the BJP's significant gains in 2019, it faced defeat in the 2021 Assembly polls against the TMC. Now, the BJP is striving to improve its standing by highlighting issues like corruption and women's safety, while the TMC focuses on welfare schemes and Bengali identity. Both parties are vying for support in different regions and communities, with the BJP emphasizing religious polarization and the TMC positioning itself as the guardian of Bengal's interests. The election in West Bengal is crucial for the BJP not only in terms of winning seats but also in expanding its influence in a historically significant region.</description>

			<title>The services story: On India’s success</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-services-story-on-indias-success/article68128729.ece</link>
			<description>Goldman Sachs' report titled 'India’s rise as the emerging services factory of the world' analyzes India's significant growth in providing global services over the past 18 years. The report highlights the rapid expansion of India's services exports, particularly in sectors like professional consulting and financial services. Despite challenges such as the current cautious outlook for the IT services sector, the report forecasts continued growth in services exports, projecting them to reach $800 billion by 2030. However, it also emphasizes the need for attention to constraints such as skill development for graduates and environmental stresses in regions of concentrated growth. The report suggests a calibrated approach, including efforts to expand global market access and facilitate innovation in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and blockchain applications, to sustain India's services success story.</description>

			<description>A recent study led by scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology warns about the significant impact of global carbon emissions on the Indian Ocean. It predicts a rise in ocean temperatures, leading to more frequent marine heatwaves and cyclones. This warming trend could have dire consequences for India, including increased severity of cyclones and erratic monsoon patterns. The study underscores the urgent need for collaborative efforts among Indian Ocean-bordering countries to gather data and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change on the region's infrastructure and population.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/poll-time-prison-time-on-the-continued-incarceration-of-the-delhi-chief-minister/article68125804.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing incarceration of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal amid a general election, highlighting the political dynamics behind the prosecution of leaders on corruption charges. It suggests a trend where only leaders from opposing parties face legal action, while those aligning with the ruling party often escape scrutiny. Kejriwal's arrest is seen as politically motivated, linked to allegations of kickbacks related to a favorable liquor policy. The article questions the timing and necessity of his arrest, emphasizing the need for agencies to prosecute without overly relying on the cooperation of the accused. It raises concerns about the potential subversion of federalism and democracy by arresting and keeping serving Chief Ministers in prison during elections.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the significance of the Hindi heartland in determining the outcome of elections in India, particularly focusing on the ongoing general elections. It highlights the key battleground states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, which collectively hold 189 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims for a landslide victory, while the opposition struggles to unify and gain momentum. Issues such as nationalism, Hindu consolidation, economic challenges, and social justice policies play a significant role in shaping the campaign narratives. The BJP faces challenges in assuring various segments of society, particularly regarding concerns about the possible repercussions of a massive majority, while the Congress aims to mobilize support among the poor and marginalized communities. The complex interplay of caste and communal identities remains central in the heartland's political landscape.</description>

			<description>The ongoing Thomas &amp; Uber Cup in Chengdu, China, holds significance for Indian badminton players as they gear up for the Paris Olympics. The Indian men's team, featuring notable players like H.S. Prannoy and Lakshya Sen, sees this as an opportunity to test their skills before the Olympics. In contrast, the women's Uber Cup team, missing key players like P.V. Sindhu, Ashwini Ponnappa, and Tanisha Crasto, aims to utilize this tournament for developing young talent. With promising performances so far, there's optimism that this tournament could mark the emergence of the next generation of Indian badminton stars.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the voter turnout trends in the second phase of the general election, highlighting high turnout in East and North East India and lower turnout in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It suggests that reduced turnout compared to 2019 may indicate decreased voter enthusiasm, potentially concerning for the BJP. The piece also analyzes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign strategies, noting his focus on communal rhetoric and criticism of the Congress manifesto. It explores the BJP's historical success in mobilizing OBC voters and the Congress's attempt to revive through alliances with Mandal parties. The article concludes by posing questions about how voters will respond to these campaign tactics and their expectations for jobs and livelihoods, which will shape the election's outcome in subsequent phases.</description>

			<title>Towards a green growth: On the RBI and a green taxonomy</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-a-green-growth-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-rbi-and-a-green-taxonomy/article68117880.ece</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's latest Monetary Policy Report emphasizes the significant impact of extreme weather events and climate shocks on both food inflation and the natural rate of interest, which affects financial stability. It utilizes a New-Keynesian model to estimate the macroeconomic impact of climate change, projecting a potential 9% decrease in long-term economic output by 2050 without mitigation policies. The RBI has been gradually addressing climate risks since its July 2022 discussion paper on sustainable finance. Despite issuing Sovereign Green Bonds and allowing Foreign Institutional Investors to participate in green government securities, there's a call for a comprehensive assessment of the economic and financial stability impact of climate change. The RBI is urged to develop a layered green taxonomy reflective of India's developmental trajectories to mitigate transitional risks as the economy moves towards sustainability.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trust-in-machines-on-the-supreme-court-and-the-evm/article68110892.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has rejected the demand for 100% verification of the paper trail from electronic voting machines, citing confidence in the current system's integrity, particularly with the introduction of the VVPAT. Rejecting the idea of reverting to paper ballots as regressive, the court has declined previous requests for increased verification percentages. Instead, it has directed measures to secure symbol loading units and allow for verification of micro-controllers in a portion of EVMs. Despite earlier rulings emphasizing the necessity of a paper trail, the current debate reflects a level of mistrust in the Election Commission of India, highlighting the importance of both voter confidence and the perceived impartiality of the election watchdog.</description>

			<description>The United States Senate has passed a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan with bipartisan support. The package, composed of four bills, includes funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the Indo-Pacific region. Despite initial opposition, the bill received strong support, constituting a significant win for President Biden and bipartisan lawmakers. However, opposition from the far-right wing of the Republican Party, including the House Freedom Caucus, threatened the bill's passage. The aid package is likely to be the last one approved until after the upcoming elections, which could potentially shift the political landscape.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/courting-action-on-fmcg-marketing-advertising/article68106567.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court, led by Justice Hima Kohli, has expanded its scrutiny beyond Patanjali Ayurved to include all FMCG companies advertising misleading claims. This move comes in response to concerns about the proliferation of unscientific claims, especially regarding health products like COVID-19 cures and baby formula. The court has criticized the government's inaction and the ineffective regulatory apparatus for misleading advertisements, emphasizing the need for prompt enforcement. While civil society has taken up the task of calling out such claims, there is a lack of protection for those who do so. The article argues that while the judiciary should take exemplary action against violators, it should not overstep its role by encroaching on legislative and executive powers.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stability-in-maldives-on-the-election-results-and-india-ties/article68106599.ece</link>
			<description>Maldives President Mohammad Muizzu's party, the PNC, secured a significant victory in parliamentary elections, gaining a "super-majority" in the People’s Majlis. This gives Muizzu substantial power to pass laws and potentially amend the constitution. The opposition, particularly the MDP, perceived as "pro-India," performed poorly. Muizzu's international engagements, including visits to China, Turkey, and the UAE, and a distancing from India, have garnered domestic approval. However, concerns arise over potential majoritarian trends in India and strained Indo-Maldivian ties. The article suggests the need for a balanced foreign policy by Muizzu and emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong ties with India amidst Maldives' economic, climate, and geopolitical challenges.</description>

			<title>Surat symptoms: On the BJP and the elimination of political contest</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/surat-symptoms-on-the-elimination-of-political-contest/article68102493.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant concern for Indian democracy, highlighting the uncontested election of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in Surat, Gujarat. The BJP candidate was elected unopposed to the Lok Sabha after various irregularities were reported, such as alleged forgery of signatures on the nomination papers of the Congress candidate and the withdrawal of other candidates. This event has raised questions about the use of state power and the undermining of democratic processes. The article suggests that such practices threaten the essence of democracy, which is built on the contest of ideas and political mobilization. It emphasizes the need for the BJP to foster a political culture where differences are resolved through fair and open contests, rather than eliminating opposition, to maintain the democratic spirit of India.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hot-button-on-the-voter-and-heat-exposure/article68102378.ece</link>
			<description>The Election Commission of India (ECI) is concerned that high temperatures might have deterred voters during the initial phase of the general election. They've formed a task force with various agencies to evaluate heat conditions before each polling phase and ensure polling booths have necessary facilities. While the IMD issues heat wave warnings based on temperature, they don't consider people's actual experience of heat. Measures like adjusting polling dates and providing shaded areas, hydration options, and medical services at booths could help mitigate heat-related issues and encourage voter turnout. Additionally, collaboration with health authorities is essential for collecting data on heat-related health issues and implementing long-term solutions.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/excessive-restrictions-on-poll-time-curbs/article68098347.ece</link>
			<description>Activists Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey have challenged the imposition of prohibitory orders during election time in India, arguing that such blanket restrictions hinder public participation in the democratic process. They argue that while political parties can obtain permission for rallies and meetings, civil society groups often face a lack of response to their applications. The Supreme Court is examining the constitutionality of these orders, questioning whether they unduly limit fundamental rights. The court has directed executive magistrates to decide on public meeting applications within three days. The case also raises concerns about the Election Commission's role in such restrictions and whether statutory powers can be transferred to it.</description>

			<description>The article criticizes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political tactics, highlighting his reliance on right-wing rhetoric, including hate speech against minorities and the use of dog whistles to appeal to bigoted supporters. It refutes Modi's recent claims about the Congress party distributing wealth among Muslims and misrepresenting statements made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The article discusses wealth inequality under BJP rule and refutes Modi's assertions about Muslims and wealth distribution. It also addresses the misuse of social justice and egalitarianism concepts by parties like the BJP to distract from issues of equity and casteism, emphasizing the contamination of India's public sphere with disinformation.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/sobering-assessment-on-the-imf-forecast-world-bank-report/article68091272.ece</link>
			<description>The IMF has raised its forecast for global economic growth in 2024 to 3.2%, citing resilience despite adverse shocks and central bank interest rate hikes, primarily driven by advanced economies led by the U.S. However, there's a growing disparity between low-income developing countries and the rest of the world, with downward growth revisions and increased inflation. These countries, particularly in Africa and parts of Latin America, the Pacific islands, and Asia, are struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, compounded by mounting debt burdens hindering investment in crucial public goods like education and healthcare. The World Bank warns of a historic reversal of development, with half of the world's 75 poorest countries experiencing widening income gaps with wealthier nations. It emphasizes the need for richer countries to financially support the poorest ones to tap into their economic potential for universal peace and prosperity.</description>

			<title>First step: on the general election, the BJP’s southern push</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/first-step-on-the-general-election-the-bjps-southern-push/article68084180.ece</link>
			<description>In the first phase of the 18th Lok Sabha elections, approximately 62.3% of voters turned out across 21 States and Union Territories, with 1,625 candidates competing for 102 Lok Sabha seats. Despite isolated incidents of violence, polling was mostly peaceful. Tamil Nadu saw all 39 Lok Sabha seats contested, with the BJP making a significant push into the state's political landscape. With the BJP aiming to expand beyond its traditional strongholds, including parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, its focus on Tamil Nadu signifies a strategic and ideological shift. The BJP's success in this endeavor will only be revealed after the votes are counted, but its aggressive campaigning in the first phase indicates the seriousness of its efforts to gain traction in southern India.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the current state of the conflict against Maoist insurgents in India, particularly in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. While recent military actions have weakened the Maoists, they still pose a threat to security forces, especially in difficult terrain. The Indian government's approach involves a combination of military tactics and welfare measures to win over tribal populations. However, the Maoists continue to resist, refusing to abandon their ideology despite setbacks. Civil society attempts to broker peace have been unsuccessful so far, leaving the conflict in a state of ongoing attrition.</description>

			<title>Pale green shoots: On exports</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pale-green-shoots-on-exports/article68080198.ece</link>
			<description>India's merchandise exports reached a 12-month peak of $41.7 billion, slightly lower than the previous year but higher than February's figures. Imports decreased by 6% to $57.3 billion, resulting in the trade deficit hitting an 11-month low. Despite challenges like geopolitical tensions, India's export growth has remained positive, partly due to resilient demand in major markets. The decline in commodity prices has also contributed to this outcome. The World Trade Organization has revised down its global trade volume growth projection, but Asia, including India, is expected to see export and import volumes rise in 2024. However, there are looming risks such as disruptions in key shipping routes and geopolitical tensions, which could impact trade dynamics. Rising shipping costs may compel exporters to raise prices, affecting competitiveness. Additionally, India's vulnerability to fluctuations in crude oil prices poses a significant threat to its trade balance and macroeconomic stability.</description>

			<title>Rain shocks: On the monsoon in 2024</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rain-shocks-on-the-monsoon-in-2024/article68071987.ece</link>
			<description>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a monsoon with **6% more rainfall** than the average, which could be good news for the southern states currently experiencing heatwaves. However, there's a risk of **excessive rains**, with a 30% chance of exceeding the norm by more than 10%. The forecast is based on the expected development of a La Niña event and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, which are likely to bring significant rains in August and September. While this may benefit agriculture, there's a concern for potential **extreme floods** that could cause substantial damage, as seen in the past. The IMD has not commented on the expected rainfall for June and July but anticipates neutral conditions. Given the risks, it's crucial for states to prepare emergency plans and for farmers to be informed about the monsoon's second half to plan their sowing accordingly. An update to the forecast is expected by the end of May.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the delayed implementation of the Madurai branch of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Although the idea behind establishing AIIMS across India was to improve healthcare accessibility and education, the execution has been marred by issues such as inadequate infrastructure and manpower constraints. Despite being a prestigious project, the construction of AIIMS Madurai has faced significant delays, leading to protests from students who are currently accommodated in a nearby facility. The article highlights the political ramifications of the project's delay, especially during the 2021 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. It emphasizes the need for effective collaboration between the central and state governments to ensure timely completion of such vital healthcare institutions and to address the persisting doctor-patient ratio imbalance in the country.</description>

			<title>In the fray: On the  CSDS-Lokniti pre-poll survey 2024 findings</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-the-fray-on-the-csds-lokniti-pre-poll-survey-2024-findings/article68071956.ece</link>
			<description>The CSDS-Lokniti pre-poll survey for the 2024 General Elections in India highlights that unemployment and price rise are the primary concerns for voters, reflecting the country's economic challenges. Despite the BJP government's focus on issues like the Ram temple and Hindutva, these do not resonate as strongly with voters compared to economic issues. However, the survey also suggests that the BJP still holds a lead over its rivals due to perceptions of leadership and socio-cultural issues. The survey underscores a significant divide between voter concerns and political messaging, presenting opportunities and challenges for both the ruling party and the opposition. Additionally, there's a notable erosion of trust in the Election Commission of India, signaling a need for the institution to address concerns and assert its independence.</description>

			<title>Step back: On Iran-Israel tensions</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/step-back-on-iran-israel-tensions/article68072172.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating tensions in West Asia following Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel on April 14, 2024. This attack was in retaliation for the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus. The conflict has reached a critical point with the potential to spark an all-out war. Iran's action, which resulted in the loss of key military figures, was described as self-defense. Israel, with support from international allies, managed to intercept most of the projectiles. Despite calls for restraint from allies, Israel has promised to respond to Iran's aggression.

The situation in West Asia is described as complex, with past events such as Israel's siege of Palestinian territories and attacks on Gaza contributing to the current tensions. The U.S.'s failure to control Israel's actions and Iran's support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have also exacerbated the situation. The article suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies have been unsuccessful and have brought the region to the verge of war. It concludes by urging Israel to consider the success of its missile defense as a victory and to de-escalate the situation to prevent a regional war, which could have catastrophic consequences for the entire region.</description>

			<title>Pitch for continuity: On the BJP manifesto for the General election 2024</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pitch-for-continuity-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-bjp-manifesto-for-the-general-election-2024/article68068529.ece</link>
			<description>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has released its manifesto for the 2024 general election, seeking a third term under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The manifesto highlights the BJP's achievements from the past two terms, including the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370, the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and the implementation of various welfare schemes such as the free grain scheme and housing programs. It claims that these efforts have lifted 25 crore people out of poverty.

The BJP promises to continue its strong governance to navigate global instability and pledges to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a law for women's reservations. It avoids taking a stance on a caste census but notes the 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections. A new promise includes a health-care guarantee of up to ₹5 lakh for senior citizens. Notably, the manifesto does not mention the National Register of Citizens, which has been a contentious issue.

The manifesto, titled 'Modi’s Guarantee,' appeals to the rural, youth, farmers, women, and the new middle class, collectively referred to as the GYANM segment. It emphasizes continuity in India's trajectory over the last decade and Mr. Modi's personal appeal. The document suggests that while the BJP has recounted its welfare schemes and achievements, the promises for the next term should be more substantial, leaving it to the voters to weigh these promises against the party's track record.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the upcoming general elections in Karnataka, highlighting the political landscape dominated by the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance. Despite recent incidents like the Rameshwaram Cafe blast, the BJP has refrained from exploiting them for communal gains, possibly learning from past electoral setbacks. The Congress, buoyed by the implementation of its 'five guarantees,' aims to challenge the BJP's dominance. However, the BJP's steady success in previous Lok Sabha elections poses a challenge, though its performance might not be replicated. The article also touches upon contentious issues like reservation policies and their impact on electoral dynamics.</description>

			<title>Fleeting relief: On slide in retail inflation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fleeting-relief-on-slide-in-retail-inflation/article68065278.ece</link>
			<description>India's retail inflation dipped to **4.85%** in March, marking the first time in five months it fell below 5%. This slight decrease from February's **5.1%** is the lowest since May 2023. The final quarter of 2023-24 saw an average inflation of 5%, aligning with RBI's projections and representing the slowest rate in three years. The annual consumer price rise averaged at **5.4%**, a four-year low. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained below 4% for four consecutive months. Fuel inflation reached a four-year low at **-2.7%** in March. Despite reductions in fuel and gas prices, high food costs and rising inflation for rural consumers due to a weak monsoon are concerns. Food inflation averaged **8%** in 2023-24, with entrenched inflation in vegetables, pulses, and spices. Urban inflation was **4.14%** in March, but rural inflation increased to **5.45%**. The RBI aims for a 4% inflation rate, but external factors like oil price surges and global economic conditions present challenges ahead.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/breach-of-convention-on-the-ecuador-mexico-tensions/article68065022.ece</link>
			<description>Ecuador's recent raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest former Vice-President Jorge Glas for corruption charges has sparked a significant diplomatic dispute, violating the Vienna Convention. Glas, along with ex-President Rafael Correa, claims political persecution, but current President Daniel Noboa views it as a stand against corruption. The incident escalated after Mexico granted asylum to Glas and Ecuador responded by declaring Mexico's ambassador persona non grata. This action led to Mexico seeking Ecuador's expulsion from the UN through the International Court of Justice. Domestically, Noboa faces criticism over rampant gang violence and a plummeting approval rating. Critics argue that Noboa is leveraging the diplomatic row to bolster his political position amidst a referendum on increasing government powers to combat gang violence, while failing to address the underlying issues within legal boundaries.</description>

			<title>Risky premise: On Asian Development Bank forecast, India’s GDP growth</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/risky-premise-on-asian-development-bank-forecast-indias-gdp-growth/article68058544.ece</link>
			<description>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has updated its forecast for India's GDP growth for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, to **7%** from the previous **6.7%**. This adjustment is attributed to strong public and private investment and the anticipation of a recovery in consumer demand as the rural economy improves. For the following fiscal year 2025-26, the ADB projects a **7.2%** growth.

Despite this, the ADB's projection is more conservative than the **7.6%** growth estimated by India's National Statistical Office for the year ending March 31. The ADB warns that its forecast is subject to global economic risks, such as a significant increase in oil prices or sustained high interest rates in Western countries, which could impact India due to the rupee's sensitivity to these rates.

The report also highlights a discrepancy between the Centre's strong capital expenditure and the private sector's lagging project completions compared to new project announcements. Notably, the ADB did not comment on the controversies regarding the accuracy of India's national income data or the influence of government tax receipts on the GDP figures.

Furthermore, the ADB did not address the lack of significant structural reforms in India post-COVID-19, which has raised questions about the government's reported strong growth numbers. Risks to consumer spending have been identified, with household savings at near all-time lows, potentially affecting the projected growth.

The ADB recommends that India establish large-scale special economic zones to boost exports and better integrate with global supply chains, especially considering the volatile situation in West Asia and disruptions to shipping routes through the Red Sea. Improving logistics infrastructure is also advised to support these efforts.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/free-the-messenger-on-the-julian-assange-case/article68058325.ece</link>
			<description>President Biden's recent remarks about considering a request from Australian Prime Minister Albanese to drop charges against Julian Assange have sparked hope among Assange's family and supporters. Assange, currently in the UK's Belmarsh Prison, faces extradition to the US over charges related to WikiLeaks' publication of classified US documents in 2010. Albanese's appeal could potentially influence the pending British court decision on Assange's extradition. Assange's family argues that he has already faced significant punishment and is in poor health. His US charges carry a potential sentence of 175 years, mostly under the Espionage Act. While WikiLeaks' actions have raised concerns about national security and responsible journalism, the US's selective prosecution of Assange over his source, Chelsea Manning, appears inconsistent. The Biden administration's stated commitment to global democracy and free speech seems contradictory in light of Assange's continued prosecution. The case presents an opportunity for the US to demonstrate its support for democratic freedoms and transparency.</description>

			<description>Telangana is gearing up for heavily contested general elections, with the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) losing ground and various parties seeing crossovers. The Congress has gained momentum, with a notable increase in vote share since the 2018 Assembly elections. Under Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, there's been a shift in public perception towards governance, with emphasis on inclusivity, symbolized by the Dalit Deputy Chief Minister occupying the former Chief Minister's residence. Despite some welfare measures yet to be fully implemented, recent high-profile defections from the BRS to the Congress, such as Kadiyam Srihari and K. Keshava Rao, indicate a decline in the BRS's prospects. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also doubled its vote share, setting the stage for a three-pronged race in Telangana. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen remains a significant player.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India has utilized its exceptional powers to overturn its own 2021 judgment and alleviate the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) of a significant financial burden of ₹7,687 crore in a dispute with a former concessionaire. This decision highlights the Court's curative jurisdiction and the potential conflict between litigation finality and substantive justice. The case involved a dispute between DMRC and Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd. (DAMEPL), with an arbitral tribunal ruling in favor of DAMEPL in 2017. Despite a previous Supreme Court ruling restoring the arbitral award, a curative petition was filed, leading to a review of the case. The article emphasizes the significance of arbitrators and judges ensuring accuracy in both fact and law to avoid discouraging commercial litigants from arbitration.</description>

			<title>​Pandora’s box: On the electoral bonds scheme, emerging details</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bpandoras-box-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-electoral-bonds-scheme-emerging-details/article68051315.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses recent revelations regarding donations made to political parties in India through electoral bonds, particularly focusing on donations received by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The investigation found that numerous companies with significant losses donated large sums of money, raising concerns about potential money laundering, tax evasion, and the use of shell companies. Despite apprehensions from officials at institutions like the Reserve Bank of India and the Election Commission, the scheme was implemented by the Union Finance Ministry. The Supreme Court's intervention in compelling disclosure of information on these donations is seen as a positive step, but questions remain about the legality and transparency of campaign financing. The article calls for thorough investigations by Parliament and regulatory institutions to ensure accountability and transparency in electoral financing, emphasizing the importance of a clean-up for a healthy democracy.</description>

			<title>​Crowded field: On Maharashtra politics</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bcrowded-field-the-hindu-editorial-on-maharashtra-politics/article68050793.ece</link>
			<description>In Maharashtra's complex political landscape, there are two factions of the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), each aligned with opposing alliances around the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, along with the Congress and NCP, forms the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), set to contest 21, 17, and 10 Lok Sabha constituencies respectively out of the state's 48. This arrangement was reached after significant concessions from each party to ensure unity against the Mahayuti coalition, comprising the BJP, another faction of the Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's NCP.

The Shiv Sena will contest in all five regions of Maharashtra, while the NCP will focus on seats with higher chances of winning, mainly in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra. The Congress's seats are spread across different regions, leaving out the Konkan region and most Mumbai seats.

The political landscape has undergone significant shifts since 2019, with Thackeray switching sides, triggering new alliances and splits within parties. Challenges remain as resentment and rebellion need to be managed within the alliances. For instance, the Pawar family split between two parties, with Ajit Pawar's wife contesting against his cousin in Baramati.

The upcoming Lok Sabha elections will test the popularity of the transformed political landscape, with the MVA aiming to keep various factions within its fold, including Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. The state's significance for the BJP's national strategy is highlighted by its past electoral success and the upcoming campaign, which will likely focus on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</description>

			<title>A distinct right: On climate change and species protection</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-distinct-right-the-hindu-editorial-on-climate-change-and-species-protection/article68047064.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a distinct fundamental right, furthering the case for a healthy environment and sustainable development. While the right to live in a clean environment was already acknowledged under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Court now reasons that protection from climate change is inseparable from this right. Climate change's impacts, from rising temperatures to food shortages, disproportionately affect marginalized communities, violating their right to equality. The Court's emphasis on climate change arose in a case concerning the deaths of the Great Indian Bustard due to solar power transmission lines, highlighting the challenge of balancing environmental conservation with renewable energy development. The Court has called for an expert committee to address this issue, emphasizing the urgency of finding a solution that reconciles environmental protection with sustainable development goals.</description>

			<title>Gross mismanagement: On TB drug shortages and India’s national TB programme</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gross-mismanagement-the-hindu-editorial-on-tb-drug-shortages-and-indias-national-tb-programme/article68047044.ece</link>
			<description>India, known as the pharmacy of the Global South, is facing a concerning shortage of tuberculosis (TB) drugs, hindering efforts to eliminate the disease by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's set deadline in 2025. The shortage extends to critical medications for drug-sensitive TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Disruptions in drug supply have been ongoing since 2022, with recent instances of acute shortages occurring just seven months ago. This scarcity exacerbates existing challenges in TB care, including delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation, as well as treatment failure. The situation is worsened by the National TB Elimination Programme's failure to ensure consistent drug availability, despite being manufactured domestically by multiple companies. Furthermore, the Health Ministry's decision to allow states to procure drugs locally at the last minute adds complexity and undermines efforts to provide free treatment to patients, many of whom come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Overall, India's struggle with TB drug shortages highlights significant shortcomings in its TB control efforts and raises doubts about the country's ability to meet its elimination goals.</description>

			<title>Promise or perish: On political parties and their manifestos</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/promise-or-perish-the-hindu-editorial-on-political-parties-and-their-manifestos/article68043276.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the release of the Congress party's manifesto, titled Nyay Patra (Document for Justice), for the 2024 elections in India. The manifesto outlines the party's vision for governance and policies, aiming to counter the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's ideological agenda. It includes 25 guarantees focusing on social justice, economy, and constitutional institutions, aiming to reverse what they perceive as damage done by the current government. 

Key promises include removing the 50% cap on reservation for marginalized communities and conducting a caste census, which marks a departure from Congress's historical stance on caste politics. Other pledges include ensuring bail is the norm, reviewing laws affecting privacy and personal choices, regulating media, and safeguarding internet freedom.

Welfare schemes proposed include cash transfers, guaranteed minimum support prices for farmers, universal health insurance, apprenticeship opportunities, and debt relief for educational loans. However, the article suggests that while these proposals aim to differentiate Congress from BJP, they lack innovation and may not fully address concerns about Congress's governance track record.</description>

			<title>Perverse intent: On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perverse-intent-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-citizenship-amendment-act/article68043953.ece</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in India, which offers citizenship to migrants fleeing persecution but limits it to certain neighboring countries and to those facing religious persecution, excluding Muslims, atheists, and others. It argues that this selective approach goes against the Indian Constitution's ethos and ignores persecution based on factors like language. The piece highlights the plight of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar and discrimination against minority Islamic sects in Muslim-majority countries. Additionally, it notes concerns about the CAA allowing for dual citizenship, which violates Indian citizenship laws. The article suggests that if India were a signatory to international refugee conventions, the CAA would likely be deemed discriminatory. It calls for the Supreme Court to declare the CAA unconstitutional due to its arbitrary and selective nature.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wayward-elephant-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-rbis-rate-decision/article68039433.ece</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has chosen to maintain the benchmark policy repo rate at 6.5% for the seventh consecutive meeting. This decision is attributed to persistent food price pressures, hindering efforts to stabilize inflation at the 4% target. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das likened inflation to an "elephant in the room," expressing the need for it to return to the "forest" on a lasting basis. Despite projections indicating a slight decrease in inflation in the coming months, concerns persist as it has remained above target for 53 months. However, the MPC is optimistic about economic growth, forecasting a 7% expansion in GDP for the year ending March 2025. Factors such as a normal monsoon, sustained momentum in manufacturing and services, and improved consumer confidence contribute to this outlook. The focus on inflation targeting is justified by the belief that stable prices are crucial for sustaining economic growth.</description>

			<title>Beat the heat: On the IMD warning of more heatwaves</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beat-the-heat-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-imd-warning-of-more-heatwaves/article68039394.ece</link>
			<description>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned that more heatwaves are likely this summer, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Heatwave days are defined as when temperatures are at least 4.5° C above normal or exceed 45° C for two consecutive days. The causes include the cyclical El Niño wave, which dries up rainfall and raises temperatures, as well as overall warming temperatures contributing to less moisture in the air and hotter ground temperatures. This year, the warnings are especially concerning as millions are expected to line up at polling stations during the April and May elections, posing health risks. Despite previous incidents of deaths and hospitalizations due to heat, there is a lack of adequate preparation and response from the governmental machinery. The Election Commission of India has issued generic advisories for managing heat during elections, but there is a need for more specific measures, such as prioritizing cooling at polling stations. With the increasing severity of heatwaves and their impact on health, there is a call for innovative approaches to address this crisis within the electoral process.</description>

			<title>The big fight: On battleground Uttar Pradesh</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-big-fight-on-battleground-uttar-pradesh/article68032762.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the critical role of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in Indian politics, particularly in the upcoming general elections. With 80 Lok Sabha seats, UP is crucial for parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has historically performed well there. The BJP and the Samajwadi Party (SP) are the main contenders, with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by Mayawati contesting independently. Other regional parties like the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) are also trying to establish their presence. Various sub-regional outfits, often representing specific caste groups, are forming alliances with larger parties. The article notes the BJP's efforts to consolidate support, especially with the inclusion of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has influence among the agrarian Jat community. On the opposition side, the SP and Congress have formed alliances with parties like the Mahan Dal. However, challenges remain, particularly for the BSP, which has seen a decline in support. Despite the BJP's dominance in recent years, UP politics remains fragmented along caste, religious, and regional lines. The article concludes that the opposition needs a significant win in UP to pose a viable alternative at the national level.</description>

			<title>Escalation ladder: On Israel’s offensive, and the danger ahead</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/escalation-ladder-on-israels-offensive-and-the-danger-ahead/article68032794.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalation of conflict in West Asia following the April 1 attack on an annex of the Iranian embassy in Damascus. Iran accuses Israel of the strike, which resulted in the death of 13 Iranians, including a top commander. Unlike previous strikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear figures, this attack targeted diplomatic premises, raising concerns about violations of international law.

Tensions between Israel and Iran have been ongoing, exacerbated by Israel's offensive actions in Gaza and air strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Despite facing pressure to cease fire and resign, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears inclined to escalate the regional crisis. The article warns against the consequences of an open war between Israel and Iran, urging Iran to show strategic patience and restraint while calling on the U.S. to restrain Israel from acting recklessly.</description>

			<title>Overkill: On only a 100% recount of VVPATs</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/overkill-on-only-a-100-recount-of-vvpats/article68029040.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in Indian elections, despite the introduction of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system. Critics argue that maintaining a machine audit trail of all commands executed could enhance transparency and security. Others express concerns about potential vulnerabilities introduced by VVPATs. However, there's been no proof of tampering with EVMs. The Supreme Court of India is considering petitions regarding demands for a 100% recount of all VVPATs for full transparency. Despite glitches, the mismatch between VVPAT and EVM counts has been minimal. Solutions proposed include increasing the recount sample size or targeting recounts in closely contested seats. Overall, the debate reflects a lack of trust in EVMs and highlights the need for continuous improvements in election technology and processes.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wide-open-on-the-candidates-chess-tournament-in-toronto/article68028818.ece</link>
			<description>The Candidates chess tournament has begun in Toronto, with players competing for a chance to challenge the reigning world champions, Ding Liren and Ju Wenjun. Five out of the 16 contestants are Indian, including R. Praggnanandhaa, D. Gukesh, Vidit Gujrathi, Koneru Humpy, and R. Vaishali. This strong Indian presence reflects the country's growing strength in world chess. Notable contenders in the tournament include Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura, Ian Nepomniachtchi, and Alireza Firouzja. Praggnanandhaa and Gukesh, both teenagers, have the potential to surprise the field, while Koneru Humpy and Vaishali are experienced players in the women's section. The tournament is expected to be highly competitive, with the women's event appearing more open.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fiscal-battle-borrowings-and-keralas-suit/article68024451.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has referred a suit filed by Kerala, challenging the Centre's decisions on its borrowings, to a Constitution Bench. While the Court didn't grant an interim order to restore Kerala's borrowing position, the referral allows a larger Bench to examine the extent of the Union government's power to regulate a State's borrowings. This dispute is more than just fiscal mismanagement allegations; it's about the constitutional balance between the Centre and States. Kerala argues that the Centre can only impose conditions on borrowings from itself, not on all State loans. The Union defends its actions, citing concerns about national fiscal health and preventing off-budget borrowings. The issue is crucial as it affects States' fiscal space, especially given the current revenue distribution formula under the Goods and Services Tax. The Supreme Court will determine how strictly the Centre can enforce borrowing limits without violating federal norms.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dangerous-game-on-patanjali-ayurveds-claims/article68024468.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India recently issued a contempt notice against Patanjali Ayurved for publishing misleading advertisements, despite previous assurances not to do so. The Court also threatened Baba Ramdev, co-founder of Patanjali, with perjury proceedings. The government was criticized for not taking action against Patanjali's false claims, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patanjali continued to make misleading claims about its products' ability to cure diseases, including COVID-19, despite warnings from the Court. The government's lack of intervention raises concerns about its support for the company's actions. This situation highlights the potential dangers of prioritizing commercial interests over public health and safety in the field of medicine.</description>

			<title>A reform window: On the GST trajectory</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-reform-window-on-the-gst-trajectory/article68020253.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the positive trends in tax collections in India for the financial year 2023-24. Net direct tax collections rose by 19.9% by mid-March, nearing 97% of revised Budget targets, while Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues reached ₹20.18 lakh crore. March saw the second-highest GST revenues since its rollout, with a possibility of crossing ₹2 lakh crore. Despite a lower growth rate compared to the previous year, the consistent revenue growth establishes a new normal for the economy. The government has tightened measures against tax evasion, contributing to the increase in collections. However, there's a slight concern over a decline in GST on goods imports, signaling potential cutbacks in discretionary consumption. The article suggests focusing on GST reforms, including rationalizing multiple tax rates and reducing high levies on certain products. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to wind down the GST Compensation Cess and resist introducing new levies, except for demerit goods like tobacco.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-new-low-on-israels-gaza-war-and-the-us-response/article68020294.ece</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Palestine conflict, labeling it as a new low for American leadership. Despite widespread condemnation of Israel's actions, including accusations of war crimes, the U.S. has continued to support Israel with military aid and sales, even during periods of intense violence. The author argues that previous U.S. presidents have used leverage to influence Israel's behavior, but Biden has failed to do so, leading to significant Palestinian casualties and suffering. The article calls on the Biden administration to take a stronger stance, calling for an immediate ceasefire, increased aid to Gaza, and an end to arms sales to Israel if the violence continues.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-mans-land-the-hindu-editorial-on-playing-politics-over-katchatheevu/article68016301.ece</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently stirred controversy by politicizing the issue of Katchatheevu, an island with implications for India-Sri Lanka relations, for electoral purposes. He claimed that the Congress had irresponsibly surrendered Katchatheevu. However, both Congress and BJP governments have recognized the island as part of Sri Lanka. The dispute revolves around whether Congress leaders handled the matter carelessly, with documents suggesting that historical and legal factors favored Sri Lanka's sovereignty over the island. While it's common for Tamil Nadu politicians to demand the island's return, Modi's involvement could escalate tensions.</description>

			<description>The Indian government has implemented a policy to encourage the use of domestically manufactured solar panels over imports. The policy requires solar module makers to undergo inspections by the National Institute of Solar Energy to be certified as 'approved' manufacturers. This certification allows companies to compete for government tenders, including those for the PM solar rooftop scheme. The aim is to reduce reliance on imported panels, particularly from China, and meet ambitious renewable energy targets. However, the domestic industry currently struggles to meet demand, and the policy aims to strike a balance between promoting domestic production and ensuring affordability and quality.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/malefactors-and-misgivings-on-the-congress-and-the-india-bloc/article68013034.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current political landscape in India, characterized by the dominance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP has emerged as a strong competitor in most states, posing challenges for other parties, particularly the Indian National Congress. To counter the BJP, the Congress forms alliances with regional parties, forming what is termed the "INDIA bloc." In states like Bihar, where the BJP has a significant presence, the INDIA bloc, comprising the RJD, Congress, and Left parties, aims to challenge the ruling alliance. However, the alliance faces challenges such as seat-sharing issues and the inclusion of controversial figures like Pappu Yadav in the Congress. Despite this, the article emphasizes the need for parties to move beyond narrow identity politics and focus on social justice to effectively counter the BJP's rise.</description>

			<description>The article highlights the alarming water scarcity situation in South India, with only 23% of reservoirs filled, nine percentage points lower than the rolling decadal average. Several factors contribute to the severity of the crisis, including ongoing El Niño events, predicted record-breaking temperatures, upcoming general elections leading to increased outdoor activities, and persistent issues like urban growth and groundwater depletion. Climate change exacerbates the situation by creating simultaneous crises, compounding socio-economic challenges, especially for low- and middle-income countries like India. The article emphasizes the need for governments to address water management issues and learn from past crises to mitigate future challenges.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-balancing-act-on-the-fiscal-deficit-target/article68006416.ece</link>
			<description>The Centre's fiscal deficit has widened significantly, reaching ₹15 lakh crore by the end of February, up from ₹11 lakh crore in January. This represents 86.5% of the revised target of ₹17.3 lakh crore. Factors contributing to this increase include higher transfers to states and increased capital expenditure. The government aims to narrow the deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26, with a target of 5.1% for 2024-25. However, achieving this may require recalibration, considering factors like inflation, monsoon conditions, and consumption demand. Some ministries still have significant spending room available for March, but missing spending targets consistently could signal the need for better planning.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/flight-from-fatigue-on-the-dgca-and-flight-duty-time-limitation-norms/article68002453.ece</link>
			<description>The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) planned to introduce changes to flight duty time limitations (FDTL) to address fatigue in the aviation industry. These changes included more rest time for pilots, redefining night duty, and requiring airlines to report fatigue regularly. However, many Indian airlines, mostly privately owned, opposed these changes, citing concerns about increased costs and flight cancellations. Recently, the DGCA quietly allowed airlines to continue operating under previous regulations until their new schemes are approved. This decision has raised concerns about prioritizing airline economics over safety. The article highlights the importance of managing fatigue in aviation and calls for the DGCA to enforce regulations that prioritize safety for both flight crews and</description>

			<title>Easily provoked: On India’s internal affairs and foreign comments</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/easily-provoked-indias-internal-affairs-foreign-comments/article68002512.ece</link>
			<description>New Delhi and Washington seem to be at odds over the U.S.'s expressions of concern regarding the actions of the Modi government ahead of the general election. The U.S. State Department commented on the arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, prompting a stern response from India's Ministry of External Affairs, which summoned the acting Deputy Chief of the U.S. mission in Delhi and criticized U.S. interference in internal affairs. Similar remarks from a German diplomat also received a rebuke. Despite Germany toning down its statements, the U.S. reiterated concerns about legal processes and froze Congress Party accounts during the election campaign, leading to another rebuke. The Modi government may need to reflect on whether these interventions are valid concerns and consider the broader implications for the India-U.S. relationship. Recent incidents, such as the U.S. indictment related to an alleged assassination plot, have strained public engagement, despite strong trade, technology, and military cooperation. The decision by President Biden to decline India's Republic Day invitation and the cancellation of the U.S. NSA's visit, along with the vacancy of the Indian Ambassador to Washington post, warrant examination. India has options to respond to the situation: continue the public spat, reciprocate U.S. comments on internal matters, or refrain from being provoked. Choosing the latter, though less appealing to the government's pugilistic public diplomacy, would demonstrate strength and confidence in India's democratic record on the global stage.</description>

			<title>Jobs outlook bleak: On the ‘The India Employment Report 2024’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/jobs-outlook-bleak-on-the-the-india-employment-report-2024/article68002417.ece</link>
			<description>A recent report on youth employment in India highlights concerning trends. Despite a growing labor force, there's a significant proportion of unemployed youth, especially among the educated. The report suggests a lack of job opportunities for educated youth and deficiencies in the quality of education. Additionally, wages have either stagnated or decreased after adjusting for inflation. The window to harness India's demographic dividend is closing, with the youth population projected to decline. Issues such as gender imbalance in the labor force and high rates of informal employment further underscore the need for comprehensive policy interventions. Policymakers must prioritize job creation and education quality to address these challenges, especially in the context of a rapidly evolving economy.</description>

			<description>The Genome India Project has sequenced 10,000 Indian genomes, creating a reference human genome for India. This will aid in disease prevention and treatment, particularly for inherited genetic disorders, including heart failure, which is more prevalent in Indians due to a genetic variant in the MYBPC3 protein. While genome sequencing unveils genetic complexity, it also highlights challenges in developing affordable and accessible treatments. The project aims to be inclusive, involving collaborations with scientists, students, and others to enhance understanding and make advancements in the field.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vulnerable-to-criticism-on-the-ed-and-a-possible-violation-of-federal-principles/article67903153.ece</link>
			<description>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has raised questions about potential money laundering related to illegal sand mining in Tamil Nadu. While the Supreme Court has ruled that District Collectors must cooperate with ED investigations, it's unclear if the ED has jurisdiction to assess the losses from uncontrolled mining. The Court acknowledged the ED's authority to summon individuals under PMLA, but the Madras High Court had previously stayed the summonses due to concerns that the investigation was a "fishing expedition." Despite the Supreme Court's assertion that the High Court's reasoning was flawed, some argue that the ED's credibility and possible political bias warrant caution in its actions.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-extra-berth-on-the-rajya-sabha-election-results/article67900295.ece</link>
			<description>In Rajya Sabha elections, the BJP won 30 of 56 contested seats, surpassing expectations through alleged cross-voting by opposition members in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Himachal Pradesh's Congress government faces instability after BJP gains from MLAs lost to disqualification. The BJP now has 97 members in the Rajya Sabha, closer to the majority mark. Despite successive state election victories, the party has engaged in controversial tactics to strengthen its position. The gap between the BJP and other opposition parties, including Congress with 29 members, remains significant. Past parliamentary sessions have been marked by opposition suspensions and government unilateralism.</description>

			<title>A respite: On the Trump case</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-respite-on-the-trump-case/article67900199.ece</link>
			<description>The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in April regarding former President Donald Trump's immunity from federal criminal prosecution for alleged election subversion. The decision delays a trial, likely pushing a ruling until late June. This halts Special Counsel Jack Smith's plans for earlier prosecution. Trump faces other legal challenges, including indictments, which will be affected by the Supreme Court's immunity decision. The prosecution battle highlights political divisions, as the lack of viable alternative leaders makes the 2024 election advantageous for Trump. This situation reflects the current lack of a unifying vision in American politics.</description>

			<title>Decoding consumption: On the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/decoding-consumption-on-the-household-consumption-expenditure-survey/article67892144.ece</link>
			<description>The Statistics Ministry released preliminary findings on February 28th, 2024, from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey. Although these results provide insights into household-level changes, they should be cautiously interpreted. Conducted every five years, the last survey in 2017-18 was scrapped due to data quality issues. The 2022-23 survey includes data gathered post-pandemic and during a time of high inflation. Urban households' monthly per capita expenditure increased by 33.5% since 2011-12, reaching ₹3,510, while in rural areas, it rose by 40.4% to ₹2,008. Including imputed values from welfare schemes, these figures still remain below the average growth rate. Changes in food spending, with a decrease in the proportion spent on cereals, may influence inflation trends. However, the results may not fully reflect the current state of the economy due to the effects of pent-up demand and inflation. Therefore, recalculations of poverty, inflation, or GDP should wait for the complete findings of the new survey, which concludes in July 2024.</description>

			<title>Burden of power:  India’s astronauts and the Indian space policy</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/burden-of-power-indias-astronauts-and-the-indian-space-policy/article67892163.ece</link>
			<description>India's human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, has finalized its candidate list, with Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Pratap, and Shubhanshu Shukla as potential astronauts. With this announcement, India aims to send an Indian crew to low-earth orbit using an Indian rocket. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) plans to conduct test flights of the Launch Vehicle Mark-3 rocket in 2024 and 2025, followed by a crewed launch in 2025. While Gaganyaan has faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ISRO's commercial commitments, it is now nearing its final stages. The article emphasizes the importance of balancing political involvement with scientific exploration and democratic values in space missions. It also highlights the need for India to focus on scientific exploration and societal value rather than geopolitical aspirations and achieving superpower status. Finally, the article acknowledges that India's space program has lagged behind countries like China but emphasizes the importance of maintaining a focus on scientific exploration and expanding human horizons.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/robust-revenues-on-direct-tax-collection-target-and-fiscal-consolidation/article67734595.ece</link>
			<description>The Indian government has achieved 81% of its direct tax collection target for the financial year 2023-24. With direct tax inflows of ₹14.7 lakh crore, economists predict that the total collection will exceed the budget estimate of ₹17.2 lakh crore by around ₹1 lakh crore. Corporate taxes have increased by 12.4%, while personal income taxes have seen a 27.3% rise. This positive revenue growth allows for fiscal consolidation and potential tax reforms to simplify the system for both individuals and corporations. The government may also consider encouraging retirement savings and health insurance to align with public policy goals. Additionally, the 18% GST levy on health insurance and a broader rationalization of GST rates are awaited. Despite no significant moves expected in the upcoming Interim Budget 2024-25, the government should keep reform options on the table for the new government to consider.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the Swachh Survekshan Awards, which recognize cities, towns, and states in India for their cleanliness. Indore, Madhya Pradesh has been declared the cleanest city for the seventh consecutive year, sharing the honor with Surat, Gujarat. The top-ranking cities have shown consistency, while lower-ranked cities experience volatility. The article suggests that the focus on top-performing cities overlooks the challenges faced by other cities and recommends retiring consistent toppers for a few years to highlight these challenges. It also raises concerns about the ranking system's effectiveness in motivating improvements in sanitation.</description>

			<title>Drug war: On use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drug-war-on-use-of-antibiotics-and-antimicrobial-resistance/article67710044.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by the prophylactic use of antibiotics. A survey conducted in India revealed that over 70% of patients in tertiary-care hospitals were prescribed antibiotics, with over 50% having the potential to cause AMR. Alarmingly, 55% of patients received antibiotics as preventive measures, while only 45% received them to treat infections, and only 6% were prescribed drugs after identifying the specific bacteria. AMR poses a significant threat to global health, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risks associated with medical procedures. Experts emphasize the need for rational prescription of antibiotics, curbs on the use of drugs in animals and plants, and urgent research and development of new antibiotics. Strict regulation of antimicrobial use and funding for antibiotic research are crucial in addressing this issue.</description>

			<title>Unkept promise: on India’s quest for a Test series win in South Africa</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unkept-promise-on-indias-quest-for-a-test-series-win-in-south-africa/article67709855.ece</link>
			<description>India's quest for a Test series win in South Africa remains unfulfilled. The recent series ended in a 1-1 stalemate, with the second game being the shortest Test ever played. India's victory in that game was overshadowed by their earlier loss in the first Test. The Newlands pitch tested the batting skills of both teams, with erratic bounce and seam movement. The article also highlights the dwindling number of batsmen who can stay long at the crease, with a trend towards a more aggressive approach. India's performance in the T20s and ODIs was more successful, but they are still figuring out their strategies and building blocks for all three formats. The absence of Rishabh Pant forced KL Rahul to take on wicket-keeping duties in Tests, which is not an ideal long-term solution. The article concludes with the disappointment of another South African tour that promised much but yielded little.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shielding-sebi-on-supreme-courts-ruling-and-sebi-probe/article67706171.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has ruled on a batch of petitions related to allegations of malfeasance in the Adani group of companies. The court has deferred to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and its investigation, stating that SEBI has conducted a comprehensive investigation and there is no evidence of deliberate inaction or inadequacy. The court did not address concerns about SEBI's handling of the allegations, but directed SEBI to complete the remaining investigations promptly. The ruling has raised questions about the court's reluctance to review SEBI's actions and its impact on the public interest.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the provision in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that treats hit-and-run accident cases as a more severe offense. The government is planning to implement this provision after consulting with the All India Motor Transport Congress, as truck drivers are concerned about the implications. The article raises the question of whether there should be an increase in the jail term for accidents from two to five years in all cases, and up to 10 years for failure to report them to the authorities. The article also mentions the need for a comprehensive accident prevention policy package that covers imprisonment, compensation, and safety, rather than solely focusing on raising prison terms.</description>
