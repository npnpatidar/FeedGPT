			<title>To abide or not: On the Karnataka case and corruption charges</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/to-abide-or-not-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-karnataka-case-and-corruption-charges/article68543330.ece</link>
			<description>The Karnataka Governor's decision to grant permission for prosecution against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption charges has sparked debate.  The legality of the Governor's action, independent of the Council of Ministers' advice, is questioned. Siddaramaiah contends that the Governor disregarded advice to refuse sanction.  The case revolves around land allotment by the Mysore Urban Development Authority, with allegations of impropriety. 

While the State government supports a judicial inquiry, the Governor deems it insufficient. The Chief Minister denies involvement in the land allocation process, maintaining it occurred during the previous BJP government. The Governor's action highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and the judiciary, and raises concerns about potential selective prosecution.</description>

			<description>The 70th National Film Awards brought fresh hope to the credibility of the prestigious ceremony. Winners like the Malayalam film "Aattam," which explores male behaviour post sexual abuse allegations, and the Kannada film "Kantara," which tackles environmental concerns through folklore, stand out for their unconventional narratives and societal relevance.  The awards also recognized stellar performances by Nithya Menen and Rishab Shetty, further highlighting the rising quality of content from South Indian cinema.  The selections seem to reflect a shift towards meaningful cinema that resonates with contemporary issues, vindicating the National Awards' original purpose.</description>

			<title>​Two States: On elections to Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Btwo-states-the-hindu-editorial-on-elections-to-jammu-and-kashmir-and-haryana/article68539796.ece</link>
			<description>The assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled from September 18 to October 1, will be closely watched as they test India's democratic processes. The elections, the first for J&amp;K since its reorganization in 2019, are significant as a new government could be a crucial step towards a lasting political solution. 

Security concerns and festivals are cited as reasons for staggered elections, with Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls to be announced later. The outcome will have implications beyond the two states, influencing national politics and signaling the BJP’s electoral strength a year before the general election.</description>

			<description>Sri Lanka is holding its ninth presidential election on September 21st with a record 39 candidates. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, running as an independent, hopes to leverage the political and economic stability achieved during his tenure.  He faces challenges from Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and Namal Rajapaksa of the SLPP.  The election comes after Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis in 2022, prompting a debt restructuring and the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  The candidates, including representatives of the Aragalaya movement, will seek to address public concerns about the economy and traditional politics.</description>

			<title>​Apathy continues: On Africa and the mpox vaccine response</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bapathy-continues-on-africa-and-the-mpox-vaccine-response/article68533111.ece</link>
			<description>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), following a declaration by the Africa CDC as a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS).  This marks the first time a regional and global health emergency has been declared for a disease outbreak in Africa. 

The current outbreak, driven by the more lethal clade 1b virus, has seen 2,863 confirmed cases and 517 deaths primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Concerns remain over vaccine supply, with only 0.21 million doses expected immediately against a need for 10 million.  Doses are currently authorized only in the DRC and Nigeria, highlighting the need for wider authorization and expedited global distribution.</description>

			<title>Neighbourhood troubles: On India and instability in the region</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/neighbourhood-troubles-on-india-and-instability-in-the-region/article68533413.ece</link>
			<description>Thailand's Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, at 37 the country's youngest Prime Minister. This follows the Constitutional Court's ousting of Srettha Thavisin due to ethical violations related to his Cabinet's appointment of someone convicted in a corruption case involving Paetongtarn's father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  

The Shinawatra family has a history of facing court dismissals, highlighting Thailand's political instability. Paetongtarn's path to reform and economic recovery is likely to be challenging due to the conservative establishment's influence and her limited experience. She is expected to rely heavily on her father's guidance.</description>

			<title>Freedom notes: On the Independence Day speech and beyond</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/freedom-notes-on-the-independence-day-speech-and-beyond/article68529138.ece</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day address emphasized continuity and authority in his third term. He championed a uniform civil code, 'one nation, one election,' and enhanced women's safety. 

Modi criticized attempts to destabilize the economy, echoing the BJP's stance on the Hindenburg Research report. He called for  one lakh first-generation young leaders in politics. Reviewing his previous terms, he highlighted progress in manufacturing and fighting corruption.  The article critiques the government's partisan approach on these issues, noting the lack of consensus building and the targeting of opposition figures in corruption inquiries. It emphasizes the importance of accountability and criticism as essential aspects of a functioning democracy.</description>

			<title>​Choppy waters: On shrinking exports</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bchoppy-waters-on-shrinking-exports/article68529172.ece</link>
			<description>India's merchandise exports fell 1.5% in July, marking their weakest performance since November 2023. While sectors like electronics, garments, and handicrafts showed growth, declines in petroleum, gems and jewellery, and chemicals hampered overall export performance.  

Imports surged 7.5% due to increased petroleum and consumer demand, leading to a 24% jump in the trade deficit. This was attributed to both a decrease in export growth and a rise in imports. The Commerce Ministry remains optimistic about India surpassing last year's export record, but uncertainties like geopolitical disruptions and weak global demand pose challenges.</description>

			<title>​Illusory blip: On inflation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Billusory-blip-on-inflation/article68524975.ece</link>
			<description>India's retail inflation eased to a 3.54% rise in July, its lowest in nearly five years. This slowdown was largely due to a 13-month low in food inflation, reaching 5.4%. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) aligned with the Reserve Bank of India's target for the first time since August 2019, the MPC expects inflation to rebound later in the year. This is attributed to base effects and the persistence of price pressures in food items like pulses, despite a decline in vegetable inflation. Services inflation also saw a rise, driven by higher transport and communication costs. Though the July figures offer some relief, experts caution against complacency, as Monsoon uncertainties and continued food price pressures may hinder a sustainable decline in inflation.</description>

			<title>​Violence, most foul: On Kolkata doctor rape and murder</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bviolence-most-foul-a-murder-in-kolkata/article68525010.ece</link>
			<description>The brutal rape and murder of a postgraduate medical student in a Kolkata government hospital has sparked national outrage. The incident, highlighting the systemic failures in ensuring safety within hospitals, has revealed a disturbing pattern of violence against healthcare professionals.  Public anger prompted authorities to act after initially attempting to cover up the crime. 

The case echoes previous attacks on doctors, including the murder of Dr. Vandana Das in Kerala and numerous assaults during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the urgent need for improved security and legislation to protect healthcare workers. The government must take proactive steps to prevent such tragedies and ensure the safety of those who dedicate their lives to saving others.</description>

			<title>​Step down: On upholding the integrity of SEBI</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bstep-down-on-upholding-the-integrity-of-sebi/article68521804.ece</link>
			<description>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is facing allegations of bias and conflict of interest concerning its Chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch.  Hindenburg Research claims Ms. Buch and her husband made investments in offshore funds where Adani Group's Vinod Adani also invested, while their consultancy firms in Singapore and India potentially advised SEBI-regulated clients.  Ms. Buch claims her consultancy firms were inactive since her SEBI appointment, but Hindenburg disputes this, citing revenue figures. This unprecedented situation raises concerns about SEBI's impartiality in its ongoing investigation into the Adani Group for alleged stock market manipulation.  

The integrity of India's securities regulator is at stake,  leading to calls for Ms. Buch's resignation to allow for a thorough investigation.</description>

			<description>India's performance at the Paris Olympics fell short of expectations, securing one silver and five bronze medals, a decline from the previous Games. While new stars emerged in shooting and wrestling, the country's reliance on a few athletes was evident.  The lack of representation in disciplines like swimming and gymnastics, coupled with wrestler Vinesh Phogat's disqualification, highlighted areas for improvement.  Broadening the sport's base, increasing participation, and ensuring equitable funding distribution are crucial for future success.</description>

			<description>The Election Commission of India's recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir signals a push for assembly elections in the Union Territory.  The Supreme Court has directed the ECI to hold elections by September 30, 2024, emphasizing that direct elections cannot be delayed until statehood is restored.  J&amp;K's last Assembly election was in 2014,  and the region has been under central rule since 2019. The Centre is encouraged by the high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections, indicating a possible receptiveness to democratic processes. Holding Assembly elections is seen as a vital step towards restoring normalcy, addressing pressing issues like unemployment and infrastructure, and fostering healing in the region.</description>

			<title>More and better testing: On viral disease outbreaks and State responses</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/more-and-better-testing-the-hindu-editorial-on-viral-disease-outbreaks-and-state-responses/article68516674.ece</link>
			<description>The Zika virus outbreak in Maharashtra, with 88 confirmed cases as of early August, has raised concerns, particularly regarding pregnant women. Although rare, Zika can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome and poses a significant risk to fetuses, potentially leading to microcephaly and neurological impairments. Studies have shown a substantial risk of birth defects and complications associated with Zika infection during pregnancy.  The virus can also be transmitted sexually by infected men for at least two months, highlighting the need for awareness and preventive measures.  

The slow response in initiating testing capacity in Pune underscores the importance of robust and decentralized testing infrastructure, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of such systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala. Prompt testing and sequencing of potential pathogens are crucial for effective public health interventions and containing outbreaks.</description>

			<title>Rule and exception: On a reminder on the fundamentals of bail law</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rule-and-exception-on-a-reminder-on-the-fundamentals-of-bail-law/article68513079.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's bail grant to Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia emphasizes that bail should not be denied as punishment. Bail is generally granted in cases primarily based on documentary evidence, unless there's a flight risk, witness tampering, or significant trial delay. The court's order highlights the importance of speedy trials and cautions against judges "playing safe" by denying bail routinely.  Sisodia's case, involving prolonged detention and alleged political targeting, underscores the need for the judiciary to protect citizens' liberty and ensure fair trials without unnecessary pre-trial imprisonment. The court's emphasis on time-bound completion of trials is a crucial safeguard in situations where investigations are perceived to be politically motivated.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perfunctory-panacea-on-the-rashtriya-vigyan-puraskar/article68513100.ece</link>
			<description>The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP) replaces the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards for scientists under 45. The new award scheme includes the Vigyan Shri, Vigyan Ratna and Vigyan Team awards, with a cap of 56 total awards across categories.  While the RVP aims to streamline and elevate scientific recognition in India, emphasizing both individual and team achievements, some critics argue the awards should prioritize improved funding and infrastructure for research.  The list of awardees primarily represents scientists from elite institutions, highlighting the existing disparities in access to resources within the scientific community.</description>

			<description>Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, has called for calm amidst widespread violence and unrest following former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Clashes between political parties and extremist groups have targeted religious minorities and Awami League supporters. Yunus, chosen for his perceived neutrality, faces the challenge of restoring order, preventing military intervention, and facilitating peaceful elections. Building a temporary truce between political rivals, notably the Jamaat and BNP, is crucial, along with ensuring free and fair elections to regain public trust and stability. The success of Bangladesh's current transition hinges on addressing these critical challenges.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Breassuring-resolve-on-the-rbis-monetary-policy-committees-move/article68506053.ece</link>
			<description>The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee has maintained its benchmark interest rates for the ninth consecutive meeting. This decision stems from ongoing concerns about persistently high inflation, which has exceeded the targeted 4% for an extended period, impacting consumer confidence. 

Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the threat posed by elevated food prices, particularly given their significant weight in the Consumer Price Index and direct impact on household budgets.  Although vegetable prices had shown some softening in June, the MPC anticipates continued pressure on inflation, potentially extending into the festive season. The committee raised its inflation projections for the remaining fiscal year, signaling a less optimistic outlook.

They highlighted the risks of spillovers from food prices to other goods and services, as well as potential inflationary effects from mobile tariff revisions. The MPC reiterated the crucial link between price stability and sustainable economic growth.</description>

			<description>Vinesh Phogat's Olympic journey ended in heartbreak when she was found 100 grams overweight before her final bout in the women's 50kg category. Despite weighing in successfully the previous day, she gained weight overnight. Desperate attempts to shed the extra kilos proved futile. Though Vinesh had triumphed over reigning champion Yui Susaki and Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, the Unified World Wrestling's strict rules resulted in her elimination.  Her performance was seen as a symbol of resilience, particularly in light of the sexual harassment allegations against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, which the Indian contingent faced.  Vinesh's exit, leaving her without a medal despite her extraordinary efforts, has deeply saddened Indian sports fans.</description>

			<description>A U.S. court ruled that Google is a monopoly, finding that it violated antitrust laws by using exclusive deals with smartphone manufacturers to maintain its dominance in the online search market. Judge Amit P. Mehta stated that Google's practices stifled competition. 

The Department of Justice is now considering potential remedies, which could range from breaking up Google to eliminating its exclusive agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung. These decisions have significant implications for the future of Big Tech, as similar antitrust cases are pending against companies like Meta, Amazon, and Apple.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bunder-overlords-on-centre-delhi-government-relations/article68497296.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the Lt. Governor of Delhi holds independent authority in appointing aldermen to the Delhi Municipal Corporation. This decision, based on the law governing Centre-Delhi relations and previous judgments, underscores the Delhi government's vulnerability to central influence. 

The Court clarified that the Lt. Governor's power to appoint individuals with special knowledge in municipal administration isn't subject to the advice of the Delhi Council of Ministers. This power, rooted in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, stands apart from the general rule that the Lt. Governor acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers on most matters. This ruling highlights the potential for conflict between the elected government and the appointed administrator. 

While the Constitution Bench attempted to establish a framework for resolving disagreements, the Centre ultimately retains the final say in Delhi's governance due to Parliament's power to legislate and amend laws pertaining to matters under the Delhi Assembly's jurisdiction.</description>

			<description>Puja Khedkar's case exposes a deeply flawed system within the Union Public Service Commission recruitment process.  Khedkar used multiple deceptions, including faking a disability and community certificate, to secure a position she wouldn't have otherwise obtained. Her actions highlight a systemic vulnerability where impersonation and manipulation can easily undermine the fairness of competitive examinations.  The government must address this by overhauling the entire examination system, ensuring robust measures to detect fraud and protect the integrity of the process.  This incident also raises concerns about the disability certification process, demanding a review to safeguard genuine applicants and prevent exploitation.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bfrom-hope-to-despair-on-bangladesh-after-sheikh-hasina/article68493224.ece</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, narrowly escaped mob violence following months of student protests.  A once beloved leader credited with economic progress and fighting terrorism, Hasina faced growing resentment over alleged vote rigging, suppression of dissent, and politically motivated arrests. 

The student protests, triggered by quota system issues, ignited a wider anger stemming from years of curtailing democratic processes. Hasina's hardline approach alienated even those who had previously supported her, including Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Hasina’s forced exit raises concerns about the potential influence of Islamist groups and the future of Bangladesh’s secularism.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bhealing-a-nation-on-kamala-harris-and-the-us-campaign-race/article68492788.ece</link>
			<description>After President Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee to challenge former President Donald Trump in the November election. Harris, who secured a majority of party votes, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  Despite her late entry, she has gained a slight lead in national polls and raised a significant amount of campaign funds. 

The Trump campaign, having previously focused its attacks on Biden, is now pivoting to criticize Harris, resorting to disparaging language and questioning her racial identity. This strategy may inadvertently benefit Harris, allowing her to appeal to a broader electorate and potentially construct a more inclusive policy agenda. The world, seeking stability and democratic values, will be watching closely as the election unfolds.</description>

			<description>The assassinations of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran have significantly escalated tensions in the West Asia region. While Israel claims responsibility for Shukr's death, it hasn't confirmed its involvement in Haniyeh's killing. These incidents follow the already tense situation along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, leading to rocket exchanges between Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces. The killings raise concerns about Iranian retaliation against Israel, potentially triggering a larger conflict.  Haniyeh's death is particularly concerning as he was a moderate voice within Hamas and was involved in ceasefire negotiations with Israel.  Israel's actions, seen as blatant provocations, risk drawing the US into a regional war.</description>

			<title>On target: On the Olympics and Indian shooters</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-target-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-olympics-and-indian-shoote/article68489209.ece</link>
			<description>Manu Bhaker's historic bronze medal wins in the 10m air pistol and mixed 10m air pistol events at the Paris Olympics marked a resurgence for Indian shooting. Bhaker's success followed a period of drought in the sport after a string of medals in previous Olympic Games. 

Her achievements highlight the progress made in Indian shooting, building upon the early pioneering efforts of shooters like Anjali Bhagwat and Suma Shirur. The support system, including coaching from experienced figures like Jaspal Rana, has played a crucial role in nurturing young talent. Bhaker's performance, along with Swapnil Kusale's bronze and Arjun Babuta's fourth-place finish, demonstrated the capability of Indian shooters on the world stage.</description>

			<title>​Election overhang: On economic activity</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Belection-overhang-the-hindu-editorial-on-economic-activity/article68485015.ece</link>
			<description>India's core infrastructure sectors saw growth slow to a 20-month low of 4% in June.  

This slowdown was attributed to reduced state spending on public works following the general election and persistent heatwaves that dampened economic activity. Sectors like refinery products, electricity generation, and steel experienced contractions or significant decelerations in growth. However, coal production expanded at a robust pace. 

A private survey indicated that broader manufacturing activity eased slightly in July, but input costs surged, prompting manufacturers to raise selling prices at their fastest rate in over a decade, raising concerns about inflationary pressures.</description>

			<title>​Medieval-minded: On anti-conversion law in Uttar Pradesh, its amendments</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bmedieval-minded-the-hindu-editorial-on-anti-conversion-law-in-uttar-pradesh-its-amendments/article68485116.ece</link>
			<description>Amendments to Uttar Pradesh's anti-conversion law aim to increase jail terms for those convicted of "unlawful conversion."  The law, originally enacted in 2021, has been used to prosecute over 400 cases primarily concerning inter-faith marriages. 

The amended law includes harsher bail provisions,  similar to those in the NDPS and PMLA Acts, and expands the possibility of filing a complaint against alleged conversions to anyone, not just the victim or their family. This raises concerns about misuse by communal organizations targeting interfaith relationships.  Critics argue the law criminalizes interfaith marriages and violates fundamental rights.</description>

			<title>​Weakest first: On judiciary and sub-categorisation within a class</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bweakest-first-on-judiciary-and-sub-categorisation-within-a-class/article68477898.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that Scheduled Castes (SCs) can be sub-classified to provide preferential treatment to weaker sections. This decision overturns a 2005 judgment that prohibited states from modifying the SC list. 

The court acknowledged the diversity within SCs and recognized that historical and social disadvantages vary. States can now identify and grant benefits to the most backward groups within SCs. The verdict also addressed the "creamy layer" concept, suggesting its potential application to SCs, although specific norms remain to be determined. The focus remains on ensuring adequate representation for the most marginalized Dalit communities.</description>

			<title>Stealing the vote: On the Venezuelan presidential election</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stealing-the-vote-on-the-venezuelan-presidential-election/article68477758.ece</link>
			<description>Nicolas Maduro won Venezuela's recent presidential election with 51% of the vote, extending his rule for another six years. However, the opposition, claiming widespread irregularities and a stolen vote, reports their candidate Edmundo González won by a significant margin. 

Anti-Maduro protests erupted following the official results which the opposition rejects. Maduro's victory comes amidst a devastating economic crisis that has seen Venezuela's economy contract by 80% in a decade, with extreme poverty and household poverty reaching 53% and 82% respectively.  

The crisis is attributed to factors including falling oil prices, sanctions, and Maduro's policies. Despite the opposition's allegations, Maduro has denied fraud. The US and some Latin American allies have called for transparency but Maduro still enjoys military support.</description>

			<title>​Private consultation: On the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bprivate-consultation-on-the-broadcasting-services-regulation-bill-2023/article68473477.ece</link>
			<description>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has reportedly withheld the latest draft of the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, from public consultation. While an earlier draft was circulated publicly, the current version is only being shared with select stakeholders under confidentiality agreements. This approach raises concerns as it excludes online creators, parts of the media industry, and civil society, who are heavily impacted by media regulations. The Bill potentially strengthens an existing regulatory framework already criticized for discouraging free expression. The lack of transparency and limited stakeholder engagement raises questions about the government's intent and the potential for the Bill to be exclusionary and flawed.</description>

			<title>Contested harvest: On India and genetically modified food crop</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/contested-harvest-on-india-and-genetically-modified-food-crop/article68473513.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India delivered a split verdict on the approval of genetically modified (GM) mustard, DMH-11. While Justice Nagarathna found the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)'s approval violated the precautionary principle, Justice Karol supported the GEAC's process. 

The case, which arose from a dispute between developers and environmentalists over the crop's potential environmental impact, will now be heard by a larger Bench. Notably, the Court ordered the government to formulate a comprehensive policy on GM crops.  This highlights the ongoing debate surrounding GM technology in India, which is influenced by both scientific and ideological considerations.</description>

			<title>Unnatural disaster: On the Wayanad landslides</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unnatural-disaster-on-the-wayanad-landslides/article68468839.ece</link>
			<description>Deadly landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, triggered by heavy monsoon rains, have claimed over 200 lives. While landslides are common during this season, their intensity and fatalities are unprecedented. Contributing factors include exacerbated river flow due to deforestation and weakened upstream soil stability from previous heavy rains. 

The tragedy highlights the compounding effects of climate change and inadequate disaster preparedness.  The state's vulnerability to landslides in ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbated by excessive rain and development, necessitates a shift in land use practices and increased environmental protection measures.  Failure to heed warnings and implement proper measures risks more devastating consequences in the future.</description>

			<title>Problem power: On small modular reactor plan</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/problem-power-on-small-modular-reactor-plan/article68468861.ece</link>
			<description>The Indian government aims to collaborate with the private sector to explore small modular reactors (SMRs) as a potential source of nuclear energy. SMRs are smaller, potentially safer, and more cost-effective than traditional reactors. 

However, challenges remain in ensuring the commercial viability of SMRs, including addressing proliferation concerns and managing the significant amount of plutonium produced. 

The success of SMRs in India will depend on factors such as stable grids, market conditions, mass production capabilities, and the cost of safety and proliferation measures.</description>
