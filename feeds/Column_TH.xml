			<title>Column | When Phuphee became a ‘village’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/phuphee-became-a-village-birth-postpartum-depression-sisterhood/article67996974.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the author's experience with postpartum depression after the birth of her second child. She describes feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and hopeless, struggling to find joy in motherhood and experiencing guilt and rage instead. With the support of her husband and a maternal figure called Phuphee, she seeks help, starts medication, and begins to recover. Phuphee's presence and care, reminiscent of a traditional village support system, provide solace and assistance. The author reflects on the lack of such support in modern society and realizes the importance of passing on support to future generations.</description>

			<title>Ind vs Eng Tests | Dreams come true when you hold on to them against the odds</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/dreams-come-true-when-you-hold-on-to-them-against-the-odds/article67891818.ece</link>
			<description>Four Indian cricketers (Jurel, Deep, Jaiswal, Khan) played key roles in India's victory against England. Their journeys are marked by challenges and hardships, from family sacrifices to economic struggles. Despite obstacles, their determination, talent, and support from coaches and relatives led them to success. The emergence of players from non-traditional cricket centers reflects India's growing cricketing talent pool. While their home records are impressive, the team faces a significant test in the SANE countries (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, England). The success of the new generation, despite technical imperfections, highlights the importance of resilience and heart in cricket.</description>
