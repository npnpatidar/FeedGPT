			<title>Judges and the people</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-judges-and-the-people/article68539776.ece</link>
			<description>The article examines the increasing politicization of judiciaries globally.  In Bangladesh, recent protests led to the resignation of the Chief Justice and other judges, highlighting the judiciary's vulnerability to political pressure. This trend is not unique to Bangladesh, as seen in the U.S. where judicial appointments often align with political affiliations, influencing rulings on politically charged issues like abortion rights.

The author explores the tension between judicial autonomy and public opinion, questioning whether a purely apolitical judiciary is truly feasible.  The article also touches upon debates in India regarding the Supreme Court's power to amend the Constitution and the perceived lack of transparency in judicial appointments. 

Finally, it uses examples from India and Bangladesh to illustrate how the concept of "traitor"  is often weaponized in political conflicts, further blurring the lines between law and politics.</description>

			<title>Column | Record of a princely wedding</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/record-of-a-princely-wedding-photo-album-mysore-palace/article68515408.ece</link>
			<description>This article examines a 100-year-old wedding album documenting the marriage of Yuvaraja Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the prince of Mysore. Taken in 1910, the album provides a fascinating glimpse into the opulent ceremony and the newly built Amba Vilas Palace, which was under construction at the time. 

The photographer skillfully used details and composition to tell the story of the wedding, showcasing not only the lavish festivities but also the cultural traditions of the era and the enduring power of the Wadiyar dynasty. The author draws a comparison between the richness of this printed album and the fleeting nature of digital memories, highlighting the enduring value of tangible historical documentation.</description>

			<title>Column | Feet of fortune</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece</link>
			<description>The practice of placing crowns with the deity's footprints on devotees' heads in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes a deeper connection to Hindu bhakti traditions.  Originally, bhakti didn't signify submission but participation in the divine's life. Temples, unlike places of meditation, were vibrant centers celebrating life,  where deities were treated as residents and involved in daily rituals and festivals. This devotion was supported by village grants known as deva bhoga. 

However, this movement coexisted with societal stratification based on purity, leading to instances of exclusion and segregation.  Depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi highlight the importance of contentment over the pursuit of fortune. The Vishnu narrative suggests that a humble mindset and acceptance of all, symbolized by the veneration of the feet, leads to true fortune.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-neighbourhood-tests-india-us-ties/article68512576.ece</link>
			<description>The recent turmoil in Bangladesh, with the U.S. seemingly supportive of a potential Islamist government, tests India-U.S. strategic alignment.  

 India and the U.S. have historically shared goals in countering China's influence, but the U.S. stance on Bangladesh raises concerns for India, as it tolerates actors against India's interests in the region. Both nations face challenges regarding trade restrictions on China, with evidence suggesting they may harm domestic innovation.  Internal dynamics in India, such as debates over caste-based quotas and immigration from Bangladesh, also highlight complexities in navigating both domestic and international issues.</description>

			<title>Unequal, and the more unequal</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision recognizes the unequal treatment faced by different SC groups,  despite existing quotas and schemes. 

The court cited the need for "substantive equality" and  drew parallels to the  'more backward' categories allowed for backward classes. Proponents argue that sub-categorization prioritizes those who need it most, while opponents fear it could further fragment already marginalized communities. The implementation of sub-categories will likely lead to new political dynamics and challenges.</description>

			<title>Column | Workplace friction and Disney+Hotstar’s ‘Hardly Working’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hardly-working-by-naukri-workplace-friction-disney-hotstar/article68466162.ece</link>
			<description>The recent comedy special "Hardly Working" on Disney+Hotstar, featuring comedians who have worked in various corporate sectors,  highlights the growing dissatisfaction of young Indians with their work lives. 

The comedians' jokes center around common workplace grievances such as unnecessary meetings, stagnant salaries, abusive bosses, and lack of career progression. This shift in comedic focus, from the traditional "demanding spouse" to the "irate corporate boss," signals a cultural change. 

Numerous Indian TV shows and films also reflect this sentiment, showcasing the dark side of corporate culture. This widespread frustration underscores the bleak job market and  lack of fulfilling professional opportunities for young Indians.</description>

			<title>Partition of Bengal: New Demands and Old Memories</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-partition-of-bengal-new-demands-and-old-memories/article68456674.ece</link>
			<description>Recent calls from BJP politicians to create new administrative entities from West Bengal have reignited  partition debates. Nishikant Dubey, a BJP MP, suggested  Murshidabad and Malda districts in West Bengal and Kishanganj and Katihar in Bihar be turned into a Union Territory to address the influx of immigrants from Bangladesh. West Bengal BJP President Sukanta Majumdar proposed including North Bengal in the developmental plans of the Northeast, sparking renewed demand for a Gorkhaland.  

This follows historical partitions of Bengal in 1905 and 1947, leaving a legacy of division.  Currently, various regions within West Bengal, including Cooch Behar and Jangalmahal, also seek statehood. The BJP, stronger in northern West Bengal, may be motivated to carve out these regions, potentially exploiting demographic shifts for political gain.

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/lesson-in-a-quince-apple-phuphee-wisdom-saba-mahjoor-column/article68436661.ece</link>
			<description>Phuphee, a wise woman known for her delicious cooking, hears a family distraught over their daughter's desire to study fashion. The father believes it's an "evil spell" and wants to force her into a science career. Phuphee calmly listens to the daughter's mother, who eloquently argues her daughter's talent and the injustice of suppressing her because she's a girl.  Phuphee then reminds the father of a time he defied his own father to marry the woman he loved. This prompts the father to reconsider his stance and eventually agree to support his daughter's dreams. Phuphee demonstrates that understanding hearts, rather than resorting to spells, is the true key to resolving conflict.</description>

			<description>The article humorously reflects on the post-wedding lull following the grand celebration of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant.  The author compares the feeling of emptiness to the aftermath of a major sporting event, lamenting the absence of engaging updates and photo reviews.   

While acknowledging criticisms of extravagant spending, the author defends the spectacle as a source of entertainment and a shared national experience.  The article concludes by suggesting a new word to describe such lavish weddings, playing on the ostentatious lifestyle of Imelda Marcos.</description>

			<title>Column | The other Ayodhya</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/devdutt-pattanaik-the-other-ayodhya-ayutthaya-thailand/article68405755.ece</link>
			<description>In Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand, the influence of the Ramayana epic is deeply ingrained in society. Thai kings, seen as semi-divine figures, modeled themselves after Ram, and incorporated the Ramakien, the Thai version of the epic, into their court performances and grand temple complexes.  Much like the Mandala model of governance described in ancient Indian texts, Thai kings expanded their influence through a network of trading routes and alliances.  

Influenced by both Buddhism and Hinduism, the Thai polity emerged as a unique blend of these traditions. However, the sacking of Ayutthaya in 1765 forced the Thai kings to move their capital to Bangkok, continuing the lineage of kings who are still referred to as Rama.</description>

			<title>When the character is made for the actor</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-the-character-is-made-for-the-actor/article68373975.ece</link>
			<description>The article explores the enduring popularity of detective fiction, particularly highlighting the strengths of British television adaptations. It praises actors like David Suchet and Brenda Blethyn for their nuanced portrayals of classic detectives like Poirot and Vera Stanhope.  

The author contrasts British detective shows with their American counterparts, suggesting a greater depth and complexity in the former.  British shows often feature strong female lead detectives, as exemplified by *Prime Suspect*, and explore the psychological impact of crime beyond simply revealing the perpetrator. *Vera* is lauded as a prime example, with Blethyn's performance capturing both the world-weary detective and the vulnerabilities hidden beneath. Ultimately, the article celebrates the ability of well-crafted detective stories to restore order and provide a sense of justice in a troubled world.</description>

			<description>The article recounts an encounter between Phuphee and Hassan saab, a retired teacher seeking Phuphee's help to persuade a widow to marry him. Despite Hassan saab's persistence, Phuphee opts not to intervene directly, instead suggesting rituals to break a supposed spell on the widow. Ultimately, Phuphee's wisdom lies in empowering individuals to solve their own dilemmas rather than imposing solutions, reflecting her belief in offering support without imposing outcomes. The narrative highlights cultural nuances and the complexities of relationships with a touch of humor and insight.</description>

			<description>Sir Frank Worrell, a cricketer and diplomat, is considered one of the most influential figures in the sport. As the first black captain to lead a team to Australia, he played a crucial role in unifying West Indian island-countries and promoting social equality. Worrell's leadership style emphasized teamwork and off-field unity, inspiring players like Bishan Bedi. Beyond cricket, he contributed to education as a university dean and senator in Jamaica. Despite his impressive cricketing record, Worrell's true legacy lies in his transformative impact on the values of the game and the wider societal landscape.</description>

			<title>Improving the language of biodiversity conservation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/improving-the-language-of-biodiversity-conservation/article68245700.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges of communicating and understanding biodiversity in the context of climate change and human well-being. It highlights that while climate change has gained public attention due to its immediate dangers, biodiversity remains a less popular concept. The article suggests that the scientific and utilitarian language used to describe biodiversity fails to convey its true value to human well-being and calls for a language that resonates with the public.

It explains biodiversity as the variety among living organisms and ecosystems but notes its abstract nature makes it difficult for people to grasp. The article argues for using local languages and examples to make the concept more relatable. It also points out that mainstreaming biodiversity in policies and business practices is challenging due to the focus on financial targets.

The author mentions the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-Being in India, which aims to link biodiversity with economic and health prosperity. However, the article criticizes the narrow focus on income and calls for a broader understanding of well-being that includes capabilities and opportunities for individuals to pursue valuable life pursuits.

In conclusion, the article advocates for a shift in how we communicate and value biodiversity, emphasizing the need to consider human variability and functioning to truly understand its link to well-being. The author is identified as the Lead of the Ecosystems and Human Well-being Programme at ATREE, Bengaluru, and the views expressed are personal.</description>

The article also mentions the negative impact of regionalism that targets other regions or people.

Additionally, it touches on individual cases such as Nalin Yadav's career struggles post-incarceration and the BJP's portrayal of J. Jayalalithaa as a Hindutva icon in Tamil Nadu.

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-siddaramaiahs-failed-romance-and-indias-undefined-borders/article68218384.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of borders, both territorial and social, in the context of India's political landscape. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval advocates for well-defined borders to ensure the country's progress and security, emphasizing sovereignty and territorial integrity. He also mentions the challenges posed by porous borders, including undesirable political and social situations.

On the social front, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah supports inter-caste marriages as a means to eradicate caste inequalities, sharing his personal story of a college romance that ended due to caste barriers. He has inaugurated a website to facilitate inter-caste marriages and promises government support for such unions.

The article also touches on the broader implications of physical and social borders as tools of control and power, highlighting societal resistance and state measures that often reinforce these barriers. It mentions recent legal developments that have increased obstacles for inter-community couples and a Supreme Court inquiry into the essential elements of a Hindu marriage.

Lastly, it covers a controversy involving scholar Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and a Dalit student at JNU, where Spivak's correction of the student's pronunciation sparked a debate on intellectual elitism and gatekeeping in academia. The incident reflects ongoing tensions around social borders and the exercise of power within educational institutions.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/gravity-levity-and-the-theory-of-relativity/article68214417.ece</link>
			<description>The article humorously discusses the awkwardness of reconnecting with distant relatives who seem fixated on one's childhood mishaps. It highlights the discomfort caused by relatives who are surprised by changes that come with growing up and who often recount embarrassing childhood stories. The author questions whether influential figures like Mandela or Gandhi faced similar situations and notes the irony of relatives remembering trivial incidents over significant achievements. Grandmothers are praised for sharing such stories, which later become fodder for family banter. The article also reflects on the fear that we may see less flattering versions of ourselves in our relatives. It concludes with a quote from George Bernard Shaw about the duality of our feelings towards relatives, suggesting that we tolerate them by remembering their good traits but find solace in their absence by recalling their faults.</description>

			<title>Column | Marriage is like a tanga</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/phuphee-saba-mahjoor-column-marriage-is-like-a-tanga/article68200060.ece</link>
			<description>The article is a personal narrative highlighting the cultural expectations and gender roles within marriage, particularly in the Kashmiri context. The author recounts being advised to address her husband with a title rather than his name, reflecting a norm of respect. She questions this practice, comparing it to the equal treatment she expects in their relationship.

The story unfolds with the author's aunt, Phuphee, visiting and sharing her own marital experience, emphasizing the importance of voice and equality in marriage. Phuphee's past struggle with being heard and respected in her marriage leads to a poignant moment where her husband supports her, symbolizing a shift towards a more balanced partnership.

Inspired by Phuphee's advice, the author discusses the issue with her husband, leading to a change in how he addresses her, breaking societal norms and setting a precedent in their village. The narrative concludes with the author, Saba Mahjoor, reflecting on these experiences and the subtle yet significant progress towards gender equality in marriage.

The article serves as a commentary on the evolving dynamics of marriage, the challenges women face, and the small victories that contribute to societal change. It's a call to not accept inequality as a given but to strive for change and mutual respect in partnerships. The Hindu Sunday Magazine published the piece, which delves into themes of marriage and society.</description>

			<title>Jimmy Anderson | A great player’s farewell is handled with respect and common sense</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-great-players-farewell-is-handled-with-respect-and-common-sense/article68174873.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the retirement of **James Anderson**, England's most successful Test bowler. Coach **Brendon McCullum** personally informed Anderson of his retirement, reflecting the respect between the two and McCullum's approach as a coach. Anderson's career is celebrated for his skill and longevity, having taken **700 wickets**, including **220 after the age of 35**, indicating his improvement with age. His ability to swing the ball and master reverse swing, which he learned from **Zaheer Khan**, is highlighted, along with his honesty about the unpredictability of his 'wobble ball'.

The article contrasts the dignified handling of Anderson's retirement with less graceful management in Indian cricket history. It also reflects on the challenges athletes face in recognizing the right time to retire, noting that Anderson may have missed some signs, such as his performance in the Ashes series and struggles in India. Despite this, his legacy as one of the game's greats remains intact, with comparisons drawn to **Glenn McGrath**.

Anderson's dedication to the sport is evident in his continuous efforts to improve, even experimenting with a new run-up at 41. He has played in 70% of England's Tests since his debut, an impressive feat for a fast bowler. The article concludes by discussing the merits of allowing players to choose the timing and place of their retirement, which in Anderson's case, was a fitting end to a remarkable career.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Kejriwal, out and about</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-kejriwal-out-and-about/article68168160.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current political climate in India amidst the 2024 General Elections. It highlights the emergence of Arvind Kejriwal from jail and his allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting a potential replacement by Union Home Minister Amit Shah due to an age-related rule. The BJP is portrayed as struggling to maintain control of the narrative, with its leaders asserting that Modi will continue as PM beyond the age of 75.

The piece reflects on the BJP's shift from showcasing its decade-long governance to defending its positions. It also touches on Narendra Modi's challenges in setting the election's central theme, oscillating between various narratives and promises. The article suggests that the BJP's strategy may be backfiring, as Modi's rhetoric could inadvertently support Congress's redistribution agenda.

Furthermore, it discusses the role of cattle in Indian politics, the fear among Dalit cattle skinners in Gujarat, speculation about Hyderabad's status, the legacy of N.T. Rama Rao in Andhra Pradesh politics, and the implications of a recent Supreme Court decision on Hindu marriages. Lastly, it mentions Rahul Gandhi's promise to introduce a separate Sarna religious code for tribals.

			<title>When Belgian policemen become Catholic priests</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-belgian-policemen-become-catholic-priests/article68165968.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the trend of creating backstories for well-known characters in contemporary literature and media. It notes that this practice has become embedded in our culture, with characters ranging from superheroes like Batman to literary figures like Hercule Poirot receiving elaborate histories. The author suggests that often these backstories are unnecessary and lack imagination, citing a recent TV adaptation of Perry Mason as an example of a poorly conceived backstory.

The piece also touches on the tradition of new authors taking on old favorites and crafting new adventures that respect the original backstories. However, it criticizes the tendency of some adaptations, particularly on television, to alter characters' backstories or the plots of their stories significantly. This includes changes made to Agatha Christie's characters and stories, which have sparked opposition among fans and researchers. The author argues that such changes may be driven by a desire for political correctness or inclusivity, but they often detract from the original works. The article concludes by questioning the need for such extensive alterations, suggesting that they can lead to absurd results if taken too far.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Keywords of 2024: Communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-keywords-of-2024-communalism-casteism-and-constitutionalism/article68136893.ece</link>
			<description>The BJP is facing challenges in the 2024 general election campaign, with allegations against one of its allies, Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, for rape. The party is pivoting its campaign around communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism, targeting specific demographics like OBCs, tribals, and Dalits. This strategy, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to appeal to the subalterns, risking the alienation of upper-caste supporters. The BJP frames its communal and casteist campaign as constitutionalism, accusing the Congress of undermining the Constitution. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena presents a different interpretation of Hindutva, emphasizing governance based on the Constitution over religious dictates. Additionally, regional dynamics are at play, with accusations of BJP insensitivity towards states like Maharashtra and West Bengal. Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy criticizes what he terms "Gujarat hegemony," while the BJP accuses the Biju Janata Dal of disrespecting Odisha's sentiments. In Kerala, an "ex-Muslim" seeks recourse to be governed by secular laws, raising fundamental rights concerns.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/phuphee-became-a-village-birth-postpartum-depression-sisterhood/article67996974.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the author's experience with postpartum depression after the birth of her second child. She describes feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and hopeless, struggling to find joy in motherhood and experiencing guilt and rage instead. With the support of her husband and a maternal figure called Phuphee, she seeks help, starts medication, and begins to recover. Phuphee's presence and care, reminiscent of a traditional village support system, provide solace and assistance. The author reflects on the lack of such support in modern society and realizes the importance of passing on support to future generations.</description>

			<title>Ind vs Eng Tests | Dreams come true when you hold on to them against the odds</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/dreams-come-true-when-you-hold-on-to-them-against-the-odds/article67891818.ece</link>
			<description>Four Indian cricketers (Jurel, Deep, Jaiswal, Khan) played key roles in India's victory against England. Their journeys are marked by challenges and hardships, from family sacrifices to economic struggles. Despite obstacles, their determination, talent, and support from coaches and relatives led them to success. The emergence of players from non-traditional cricket centers reflects India's growing cricketing talent pool. While their home records are impressive, the team faces a significant test in the SANE countries (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, England). The success of the new generation, despite technical imperfections, highlights the importance of resilience and heart in cricket.</description>
