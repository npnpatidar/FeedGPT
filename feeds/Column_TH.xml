			<title>The past shaping the 2024 J&amp;K Assembly elections</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/elections/jammu-and-kashmir-assembly/the-past-shaping-the-2024-jk-assembly-elections/article68592222.ece</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the 2024 Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, discussing the complex political landscape shaped by historical events and the abrogation of Article 370. 

The author notes the resurgence of political interest after a six-year hiatus, highlighting the demand for statehood as a unifying factor. Examining the regional dynamics, the article analyzes the strengths and strategies of various parties like the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, and BJP.  

It explores the impact of delimitation on representation, particularly concerning Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe constituencies, questioning whether it will truly benefit marginalized groups. The article also delves into the contentious issue of nominating seats for Kashmiri migrants and those from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, raising concerns about definition and potential constitutional implications. 

Ultimately, the article suggests that while new political realities are emerging, the legacy of the past continues to shape the electoral landscape and the future of Jammu and Kashmir.</description>

			<title>‘The victim of crime is treated as a mere witness in the prosecution of the offence’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/victims-of-crime-are-the-neglected-pillars-of-the-criminal-justice-system/article68571631.ece</link>
			<description>The criminal justice system often neglects victims, focusing primarily on the accused. Victims suffer physical, emotional, and financial consequences from crimes, but their needs are frequently overlooked.  

Recognizing this, the United Nations adopted principles ensuring victims' access to justice, restitution, compensation, and assistance. While some developed countries have implemented comprehensive victim support laws, India's approach is limited to compensation schemes and the Protection of Human Rights Act.  

Despite progress, a paradigm shift is needed to prioritize victims' rights within the criminal justice system. A more comprehensive approach encompassing relief, compensation, and rehabilitation should be mandated, ensuring victims receive the support they need and deserve.</description>

			<title>Ten million ways to give Test cricket the boost it needs</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/ten-million-ways-to-give-test-cricket-the-boost-it-needs/article68572897.ece</link>
			<description>The International Cricket Council is proposing a new fund to support Test cricket and player salaries. This initiative aims to address the financial disparities between top cricket nations (India, England, Australia) and the rest.  The fund, potentially worth millions of dollars, would provide a minimum income of $10,000 per Test for players in weaker cricketing nations and assist their boards.  

While details are yet to be finalized, the plan is motivated by concerns about the future of Test cricket, which is facing challenges from the rise of lucrative franchise leagues.  Support from India, a major stakeholder in international cricket, is crucial for the fund's success.  The initiative could help balance the scales in international cricket and ensure the long-term viability of Test matches.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/pencil-in-some-rest-phuphee-saba-mahjoor-a-little-life-column/article68542370.ece</link>
			<description>The article tells the story of Phuphee, the author's aunt, and her practice of taking solo walks in the forest to rest and connect with her spirituality. 

Phuphee believed her soul needed these retreats to replenish itself and she would return from them with gifts of foraged food. She would often travel to a distant village to visit a wise friend who lived near healing hot springs.  When her in-laws tried to restrict her trips, unusual weather patterns ensued, highlighting the importance of these journeys.  Phuphee explained that anxiety and dread were signs her soul needed refueling, and she learned to honor that need.  The author reflects on the lessons learned from Phuphee about the importance of rest and self-care.</description>

			<title>No global solutions for cricket, however positive, can work without India</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/no-global-solutions-however-positive-can-work-without-india/article68546859.ece</link>
			<description>The World Cricketers' Association (WCA) is reviewing the global cricket structure to address concerns about an overcrowded and disjointed calendar. While this is seen as a positive step, the WCA lacks influence over India, the most powerful entity in cricket due to its immense financial resources. 

India's BCCI dictates significant decisions, including the scheduling of international matches. The inclusion of a representative from the Indian broadcast giant, Disney Star, on the WCA review panel highlights India's dominant position.  The WCA aims to tackle issues like scheduling conflicts, financial disparities, and player contracts. However, the feasibility of these recommendations ultimately depends on India's willingness to accept them.  Players' associations, including the Indian Cricketers' Association (ICA),  have limited influence due to the BCCI's control.</description>

			<title>Judges and the people</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-judges-and-the-people/article68539776.ece</link>
			<description>The recent political turmoil in Bangladesh, where the Chief Justice and two other judges resigned under pressure from protesters, highlights the increasing politicization of judiciaries worldwide.  This trend is seen in democratic countries like the United States where judicial appointments align with political affiliations, leading to battles over control of the judiciary.  

The rise of populism has fueled the argument for legal control over politics, raising questions about the balance between popular will and the rule of law.  In India, debates rage about the Supreme Court's power to limit Parliament's ability to amend the Constitution and concerns exist about the judiciary's potential bias towards majoritarian politics and the executive. Ultimately, finding the right balance between an independent judiciary and its responsiveness to public opinion remains a complex and ongoing challenge for democracies.</description>

			<title>Column | Record of a princely wedding</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/record-of-a-princely-wedding-photo-album-mysore-palace/article68515408.ece</link>
			<description>This article explores a wedding album from 1910, depicting the marriage of Yuvaraja Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the prince of Mysore. The album, a testament to the era's photographic rarity, offers a glimpse into the lavish ceremony and the grandeur of the Amba Vilas Palace, then still under construction. 

The author, a wedding photographer, highlights the album's meticulous storytelling through its carefully curated images, showcasing not only the opulence but also the cultural traditions of the time.  He contrasts this archival piece with the ephemeral nature of digital memories, emphasizing the enduring value of a tangible album as a lasting testament to a momentous occasion.</description>

			<title>Column | Feet of fortune</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece</link>
			<description>The practice of placing a crown with the deity's footprints on a devotee's head in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes the devotee's connection to the divine.  This act represents the inability of devotees to physically touch the deity within the sanctum sanctorum and highlights the connection between ritual and Hindu bhakti traditions.

Originally, bhakti meant participation in the divine life, contrasting with traditional Vedic practices.  Temples became vibrant centers of celebration, mirroring life itself, with deities engaging in daily rituals, festivals, and even "joy rides."  

Temple construction was fueled by village grants (deva bhoga), managed by Brahmins appointed by kings. However, this period also saw the rise of social stratification based on purity, exemplified by stories of devotees from marginalized professions being excluded from temple spaces. 

The placement of Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, at the deity's feet signifies how fortune serves contentment.  The ritual of the footprint crown underscores the importance of humility and  overcoming hierarchical thinking, emphasizing that contentment transcends boundaries and divisions.</description>

			<title>Neighbourhood tests India-U.S. ties</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-neighbourhood-tests-india-us-ties/article68512576.ece</link>
			<description>The political turmoil in Bangladesh, with the potential rise of Islamist forces, is straining India-U.S. relations.  While India and the U.S. share concerns about China, differences on issues like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran have always existed. The U.S. support for the toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh, and its seeming tolerance of anti-India actors in the region, is a point of contention.

Within India, the BJP's Hindutva ideology and its stance on religious minorities is generating debate. There are arguments over the 'creamy layer' principle within SC/ST quotas and differing opinions within the BJP on accepting refugees from Bangladesh. Meanwhile, other states are grappling with issues of religious conversions, caste reservations, and domicile policies.</description>

			<title>Unequal, and the more unequal</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories among Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision aims to address the fact that there are varying levels of inequality within the SC community.  

The court noted that sub-categorization ensures substantive equality, as those who require more assistance and face greater disadvantages should have priority access to affirmative action programs. 

Bihar's attempt at sub-categorization through the 'Mahadalit' category, though politically influenced, illustrates the complexities of implementing such a system. 

While some advocate sub-categorization as a way to provide more targeted support to marginalized SC communities, others argue that it could exacerbate existing divisions and lead to a "race to the bottom" as different groups compete for preferential treatment.</description>

			<title>Column | Workplace friction and Disney+Hotstar’s ‘Hardly Working’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hardly-working-by-naukri-workplace-friction-disney-hotstar/article68466162.ece</link>
			<description>The comedic landscape in India is shifting, with ex-corporate employees finding humor in the frustrations and dissatisfaction prevalent in the workplace. Comedy specials and shows like "Hardly Working," "The Office" adaptation, "Mr. Das," "Cubicles," and "Better Life Foundation"  reflect this trend, highlighting issues like unreasonable bosses, stagnant salaries, and a lack of work-life balance. 

This shift underscores a growing discontent among young Indian professionals, particularly regarding the job market and corporate culture.  The increasing popularity of these workplace-focused narratives suggests a shared experience of frustration and a longing for authenticity in both humor and societal reflection.</description>

			<title>Partition of Bengal: New Demands and Old Memories</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-partition-of-bengal-new-demands-and-old-memories/article68456674.ece</link>
			<description>Two BJP politicians have recently called for the creation of new administrative entities within West Bengal. Nishikant Dubey, an MP, suggested establishing a Union Territory encompassing parts of West Bengal and Bihar to address the issue of Bangladeshi immigrants.  Sukanta Majumdar, the BJP president in West Bengal, proposed including North Bengal in the developmental plans of the Northeast region. These proposals have sparked controversy, with the ruling Trinamool Congress accusing the BJP of attempting to divide West Bengal.

The BJP's strategy appears to be influenced by political considerations, particularly in Jharkhand, where Mr. Dubey's demand aligns with the party's focus on migrant voters.  This issue highlights broader concerns regarding demographic changes and the allocation of resources within India. It also raises questions about tensions between state and federal powers,  particularly concerning the taxation of mineral rights and the role of Governors in the approval process for state legislation.</description>

			<description>The highly publicized, lavish wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant has concluded, leaving a sense of anticlimax and void.  The media frenzy surrounding the event, with its focus on the extravagance and celebrity guest list, provided a collective sense of entertainment and escapism for many.  While some criticize the ostentatious spending, others argue it provided joy and relieved the pressure on others to replicate such grandeur.  The event has become a cultural touchstone, comparable to major sporting events or blockbuster movies, and may even inspire a new word to describe its level of extravagance.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/devdutt-pattanaik-the-other-ayodhya-ayutthaya-thailand/article68405755.ece</link>
			<description>Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand, was a thriving city for four centuries before being sacked by the Burmese in the 18th century. The city's legacy is intertwined with the Ramayana, a story that profoundly influenced Thai culture.  The Thai kings, seeing themselves as semi-divine figures,  modeled their rule after the mandala system, expanding their influence through trade and alliances.  Ayutthaya's wealth came from its strategic location at the confluence of three rivers, facilitating trade within Southeast Asia. The city's grand temples and palaces, adorned with depictions of the Ramayana, reflected the kings' aspiration to emulate the epic hero, Rama. The sacking of Ayutthaya by the Burmese mirrored the earlier destruction of their previous capital, Sukhothai, leading to a shift southward to a new city: Bangkok.</description>

			<description>The story recounts a tale of a man named Hassan saab, a retired teacher who desires to marry a young widow, against her wishes.

Phuphee's wisdom lies in understanding that sometimes, simply offering a helping hand and giving people the space to find their own solutions is more impactful than forceful intervention.  She emphasizes that individuals often possess the strength and capability to overcome their challenges.</description>

			<title>From the desirable to the derogatory</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/from-the-desirable-to-the-derogatory/article68319809.ece</link>
			<description>The term "woke" has undergone a rapid shift from a positive connotation of awareness to a derogatory term used for criticism.  Initially associated with inclusivity and respect for marginalized groups, it has been ridiculed by those on the political right, who view it as promoting minority over majority opinions. This linguistic transformation mirrors the broader trend of "cultural appropriation," where engagement with different cultures is perceived as theft. This trend towards possessiveness of identity raises concerns about artistic expression and the limitations it imposes on fiction and other genres. The evolving meaning of "woke" exemplifies how political ideologies can influence and distort language, leading to imprecision and division.</description>

			<title>Column | When the rupee ruled</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-the-rupee-ruled-mughal-currency-trade-coin-east-india-company/article68303999.ece</link>
			<description>The rupee, believed to have originated under Sher Shah Suri, became a prominent currency in India. Akbar further solidified its position by establishing mints across his vast empire, ensuring consistent weight and purity.  By the 17th century, European East India Companies adopted the rupee for trade in India and beyond, making it a widely accepted currency in regions like Sri Lanka and Indonesia.  European colonial powers later introduced their currencies in colonies but the rupee remained prevalent in East Africa, even being used as legal tender in Arab sheikhdoms.  The Gulf countries used the Indian rupee until the 1960s when they adopted their own currencies. In a significant turn of events, India's UPI system is now gaining international traction, echoing the historical reach of the rupee.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/centenary-of-the-man-who-changed-cricket-and-society/article68304032.ece</link>
			<description>Sir Frank Worrell, who would have turned 100 on August 1, is considered one of cricket's most important figures.  Worrell, the first black man to captain a Test side, transcended the field, becoming a symbol of social equality and unity. He led the West Indies team to success both on and off the field,  building a cohesive unit from diverse Caribbean islands. Worrell's captaincy, defined by his emphasis on teamwork and sportsmanship, had a profound impact on his players and the game itself. His legacy extends beyond his cricketing achievements, as he actively promoted social harmony and understanding.  Worrell's contributions to cricket and society cemented his place as a true icon of the sport.</description>

			<title>Column | Tracing Parsis and their monotheism</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/parsi-fire-temple-devdutt-pattanaik-parsi-community-monotheism/article68276833.ece</link>
			<description>Zoroastrian fire temples, known as agiaries, are found in western India and feature unique artwork inspired by ancient Mesopotamian creatures. These beings, representing the strength of bulls and eagles, symbolize the one true God. The Parsi community, who originated in Persia, arrived in India over a thousand years ago seeking refuge.  

They assimilated into Indian culture, but maintain distinct religious practices and endogamy.  Today, the Parsi community, both descendants of historical migrants and later Iranian immigrants, represent a bridge between the monotheistic traditions of West Asia and the polytheistic beliefs of South Asia. Despite shared ancestry with Hindus, their religious beliefs and practices remain separate.</description>

			<description>The article presents a satirical argument for a specialized role in government: the "Swearing-In-Chief."  The author humorously imagines themselves as qualified for this position, highlighting their extensive practice of saying the word "I" and proposing personalized oath modifications based on individual politicians' backgrounds.  

The piece further satirizes the current oath-taking process, suggesting it is ineffective in ensuring ethical behavior and advocating for a commission to oversee swearing-in ceremonies nationwide.</description>

			<title>T20 World Cup: Taking cricket to America involves a difficult culture transfer</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/t20-world-cup-cricket-america-difficult-culture-transfer-suresh-menon/article68277510.ece</link>
			<description>Despite the US cricket team's historic win against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, America remains largely indifferent to the sport. Unlike the anticipated football revival after the 1950 US victory over England, the ICC's efforts to popularize cricket in the US haven't resonated with the general public. 

The article critiques the ICC's marketing strategies, suggesting they need to focus on grassroots development, improve commentary and presentation, and create a more American-friendly experience. It argues for better utilization of television,  emphasizing statistics, background information, and a shift from loud commentary to more engaging conversation.  The article concludes by highlighting the stark contrast between the societal impact of past US sporting victories and the current disconnect with cricket, urging the ICC to actively involve celebrities and leverage America's passion for sports to truly establish cricket's foothold in the country.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha 2024 poll verdict: a rare outcome that pleases all</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/political-line-2024-ls-poll-verdict-a-rare-outcome-that-pleases-all/article68270331.ece</link>
			<description>The 2024 Indian general election results show Prime Minister Narendra Modi securing a third term, but with a reduced majority, requiring the support of alliance partners. The outcome has generated widespread satisfaction, with various political factions expressing happiness. Modi himself finds solace in triumph amidst the dependence on allies, while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi celebrates his party's success in limiting the BJP's power. Regional parties rejoice in their strengthened positions, while caste autonomists in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have gained leverage against the BJP.

Religious and communal groups, despite representing diverse ideologies, see this election as a moment of empowerment, having pushed back against the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda.  The Election Commission, judiciary, and media also express contentment, with the latter hopeful for a resurgence in journalistic influence.</description>

			<description>The remote Marubo tribe in Brazil, recently connected to the internet via Starlink, is now grappling with the consequences of online access.  Elders report that teenagers are spending excessive time watching pornography and playing violent video games, neglecting traditional hunting and fishing practices. This situation highlights the universal impact of technology, as the internet, despite its vast potential, also brings societal challenges. The arrival of the internet in such a remote community raises questions about the nature of pornography, its accessibility, and its influence on traditional cultures.  It echoes the experiences of many societies navigating the complexities of the digital age.</description>

This should have read one-third. The report, published on June 6, was intended to analyze public sentiment towards Prime Minister Modi.</description>

			<title>Improving the language of biodiversity conservation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/improving-the-language-of-biodiversity-conservation/article68245700.ece</link>
			<description>This article discusses the challenge of communicating the importance of biodiversity to the public and policymakers. 

While climate change has become a widely recognized issue, biodiversity, despite being essential to human well-being, remains abstract and poorly understood. The article argues that the focus on utilitarian benefits of biodiversity, such as ecosystem services and economic gains, fails to capture its full value. It suggests that incorporating concepts like Amartya Sen's "capabilities" can provide a richer understanding of how biodiversity contributes to people's freedom and opportunities to pursue a fulfilling life.

The author also highlights the importance of localizing the discourse on biodiversity, using vernacular languages and engaging with the diverse ways communities experience and value nature.  By moving beyond technical jargon and focusing on human experiences and aspirations, biodiversity conservation can become more meaningful and impactful.</description>

			<title>The national and the regional</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-the-national-and-the-regional/article68243397.ece</link>
			<description>National parties in India, despite aiming for a national presence, often utilize regionalism in their campaigns. The Congress has leveraged Karnataka and Telangana identities, while Rahul Gandhi appealed to regional pride in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The BJP, in its attempt to challenge the BJD in Odisha, targeted the southern origins of Naveen Patnaik's aide, V.K. Pandian, with some anti-Tamil undertones, while simultaneously courting Tamil Nadu voters. The party, in contrast, has toned down its attacks on Bengali pride in West Bengal compared to the 2021 elections. This tactic of employing regionalism, sometimes targeting other regions and people, raises concerns about its impact on national unity.</description>

			<description>This week's newsletter discusses two contrasting perspectives on borders: territorial and social. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval emphasized the importance of "hard borders" for national security and stability, citing concerns about porous borders facilitating undesirable social and political situations. 

In contrast, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah advocated for more inter-caste marriages to dismantle social barriers and caste inequalities. He shared his own experience of a thwarted love affair due to caste, highlighting the enduring societal resistance to inter-community relationships despite state efforts to promote them. The newsletter also touches on the ongoing controversy surrounding scholar Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's interaction with a Dalit student at JNU, where her correction of the student's pronunciation sparked debate about gatekeeping by intellectual elites.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/gravity-levity-and-the-theory-of-relativity/article68214417.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the often-awkward dynamic between relatives, particularly those who knew us in childhood. It highlights how they can be fixated on past events, dwelling on childhood mishaps and seemingly unable to accept our growth and development as adults. The author uses humor to recount specific examples of these encounters, ultimately concluding that distant relatives are preferable and that the famous quote about relatives – remembering their good points when they're around, and their bad ones when they're not – rings true.</description>

This sparked discussion with her aunt, who shared her own experience of having her voice stifled in her marriage.  The aunt, however, found a solution by speaking to her husband and eventually gained autonomy in her household. Inspired by this, the author shared her predicament with her husband, leading to a positive change in their relationship dynamics. Though met with disapproval from others, the act of calling her "my life" in public signified a shift in societal norms and a testament to love and respect.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-great-players-farewell-is-handled-with-respect-and-common-sense/article68174873.ece</link>
			<description>James Anderson, England's most successful Test bowler, is retiring at 42 after a distinguished career. Having played 187 Tests, he is second only to Sachin Tendulkar in appearances. Anderson's 700 wickets place him third on the all-time list, behind only Mutthiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne. 

Although he was initially known for his swing bowling in home conditions, Anderson adapted his game, mastering reverse swing and evolving his variations. He achieved success in India and consistently challenged batsmen around the world. His retirement, announced by coach Brendon McCullum in a personal conversation after a recent dip in form, marks a fitting end for one of the greatest bowlers of his generation.</description>

			<description>Arvind Kejriwal's release from jail coincides with a shift in the narrative of the 2024 election. Kejriwal's allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, suggesting a power struggle within the BJP and Shah's potential ascension, have put the party on the defensive. This has forced the BJP to clarify its position and explain its actions, instead of focusing on its past achievements. Modi, unable to establish a clear central theme, has shifted between addressing different segments of society, highlighting the challenges he faces in connecting with voters.</description>

			<title>When Belgian policemen become Catholic priests</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-belgian-policemen-become-catholic-priests/article68165968.ece</link>
			<description>Contemporary writers often add backstories to popular characters, even when they are not necessary or relevant to the original work. This practice can range from well-respected adaptations of classic characters to unnecessary alterations of beloved stories. While some argue that backstories provide deeper understanding, others criticize them as uninspired and distracting.  

The issue is particularly prominent with adaptations of Agatha Christie novels, where changes to plot and character have drawn criticism from fans. 
 Despite the pushback, some argue that creative liberties are necessary for adaptation, especially in longer formats like television. This debate raises questions about the balance between respecting original works and allowing for reinterpretation.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Keywords of 2024: Communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-keywords-of-2024-communalism-casteism-and-constitutionalism/article68136893.ece</link>
			<description>The BJP's 2024 election campaign strategy is shifting, focusing on communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism. This approach, exemplified by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speeches, aims to mobilize Hindu subaltern communities against Muslims.  The BJP is targeting OBCs, tribal communities, and Dalits, potentially alienating upper caste and middle-class voters. 

Modi's rhetoric frames the Congress as anti-Constitution and alleges it seeks to undermine reservations for Hindu communities by granting them to Muslims. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray, meanwhile, portrays his party's Hindutva as inclusive, emphasizing skill and constitutional adherence.  The BJP's focus on these issues is generating regional tensions, with accusations of "Gujarat hegemony" and sensitivity to regional aspirations.</description>

			<title>Column | Legacy of India’s courtesans</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/courtesans-tawaifs-courting-hindustan-heeramandi-sarmaya-arts-foundation/article68071442.ece</link>
			<description>Trained in centuries-old traditions, tawaifs held a prominent position in Indian society.  They were highly skilled artists, patrons of traditional crafts, and influential figures in fashion and style.  Known for their exquisite taste, they favored rich silks, intricate brocades, and Dhaka muslin, often adorned with elaborate jewelry.  Begum Samru, a powerful ruler who began her career as a courtesan, exemplified their influence, blending traditional Mughal clothing with European styles to navigate the political landscape. Legends like Begum Akhtar and Gauhar Jaan further cemented their status as style icons, their glamorous appearances influencing trends and even inspiring figures like Mata Hari. By the 20th century, their influence waned but their legacy continues to captivate artists and designers, reminding us of their vital role in Indian culture and history.</description>

			<title>IPL | When players go beyond cliches and illuminate the format</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-players-go-beyond-cliches-and-illuminate-the-format/article68071847.ece</link>
			<description>This article explores the lack of memorable quotes and insightful comments from cricket players, especially in the context of the IPL. It highlights the honesty and self-awareness of Suryakumar Yadav admitting he avoids facing Jasprit Bumrah in the nets due to the bowler's fearsome abilities. 

The article further discusses Bumrah's comment on the lack of ego in the format, arguing that there are two types of ego in sports: a positive, growth-oriented one and a destructive, self-assured one. Bumrah's statement reflects the latter.  The piece also touches upon Sunil Narine's approach to batting, emphasizing his singular focus and the clarity it brings to his performance.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Unity and divisiveness: in the eye of the beholder</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unity-and-divisiveness-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/article68065004.ece</link>
			<description>The article examines the accusations of divisiveness leveled by the BJP and the Congress against each other during Indian elections. The BJP claims the Congress, particularly Rahul Gandhi, is divisive by demanding a caste census and alleging threats to states' autonomy. The Congress, in turn, accuses the BJP of alienating Muslims and other religious minorities, discriminating against subaltern castes, and overstepping the rights of states. 

The BJP argues that it unifies Hindus, seeing Hindu unity as equivalent to national unity. This "unity" involves increased representation of subaltern castes but excludes religious minorities, especially Muslims.

The Congress faces the challenge of advocating for caste justice without alienating Hindu identity. Meanwhile, the BJP grapples with discontent from upper castes who feel marginalized by its focus on subaltern representation. The article also touches upon the contentious issue of defining a Hindu, citing historical examples and  Prime Minister Modi's recent attempt to link Hindu identity to vegetarianism.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the heckling of Hardik Pandya, the captain of Mumbai Indians, by some fans.

			<description>India's selectors face a dilemma when choosing their squad for the World T20: experience versus fresh perspective.  While veterans like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma possess invaluable knowledge and skill, the fast-evolving T20 format emphasizes adaptability and unpredictability. 

Young players often shine by embracing new trends and fearlessly innovating;  their lack of experience does not hinder their confidence.  Kohli's recent form and his effectiveness as an opener pose questions about his role alongside Rohit. The selectors will closely monitor both players' performances in the IPL to make a well-informed decision. The evolving nature of T20 cricket,  where unexpected strokes and flexibility are key, challenges the traditional reliance on knowledge and experience.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-mature-kuldeep-yadav-has-been-the-quiet-success-of-the-series/article67944430.ece</link>
			<description>Kuldeep Yadav has emerged as a key player for India in the recent Test series against England, taking 19 wickets and showcasing the artistry of left-arm wrist spin. Despite facing inconsistencies and spending considerable time out of the team, Kuldeep has persevered, refining his bowling and fitness. His resurgence is a testament to his dedication and a valuable asset for India's spin attack. 

Kuldeep's control and ability to deceive batsmen make him a formidable threat. Captain Rohit Sharma's understanding of Kuldeep's strengths and weaknesses further contributed to his success. His unique delivery, often referred to as the 'chinaman,' has puzzled and dismissed numerous batsmen, highlighting his mastery of this challenging bowling style. Kuldeep's commitment to his craft and his ability to deliver when it matters most have solidified his position as a crucial part of India's spin bowling arsenal.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Glories of our past — two notions that shape our present</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/glories-of-our-past-two-notions-that-shape-our-present/article67885719.ece</link>
			<description>Fali S. Nariman's death prompted reflections on India's secularism, with some viewing the present through the lens of a past characterized by peaceful coexistence, which is now threatened by Hindu nationalism. Others see the current regime as restoring a glorious Hindu past, dismantling a perceived secular deviance of recent decades. 

Both perspectives assume a monolithic past, often ignoring the complexities of Indian history.  The historical record reveals that even in the past, democratic processes involved challenges and complexities, as evidenced by anecdotes from the era of India's first republic.  Rather than lamenting a lost past,  a critical introspection of its shortcomings might be more constructive for shaping a better future.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-way-things-fit-together-is-the-essence-of-good-selection/article67841833.ece</link>
			<description>India faces a unique challenge selecting its middle order for a crucial Test match, potentially including their least experienced batsmen in that position. While AI can theoretically select teams, the human element of imagination, creativity, and unpredictability remains crucial. 

Selectors must consider various factors, from match conditions to players' mental fortitude and, of course, luck. With key players like Virat Kohli and KL Rahul unavailable, the focus is on the inexperienced batsmen vying for the middle-order spots. 

This situation calls for unconventional choices, highlighting the need for human intuition in team selection, as seen in past successes where unexpected picks made a difference. The "Lego principle" emphasizes the importance of how players fit together, making for a team stronger than the sum of its parts. Ultimately, successful selection involves balancing machine-driven data with the human ability to make bold, strategic decisions.</description>

			<description>The ongoing India-England test series is proving to be incredibly exciting. Both teams have a good understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses, especially England's Bazball approach. 

While England initially implemented a  bold, attacking strategy, adapting to Indian conditions has become crucial .Rohit Sharma is showing glimpses of Bazball himself, leading India with a mix of caution and aggression. 

Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional bowling, featuring both raw pace and clever variations, has been a highlight for India.  This series has all the potential to be one of the greatest in recent years, with the possibility of a nail-biting climax.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-the-pace-of-fiscal-consolidation-took-everyone-by-surprise/article67801087.ece</link>
			<description>The 2024 Budget, a vote on account, prioritizes fiscal consolidation with a focus on infrastructure spending. Despite a lower-than-budgeted nominal GDP growth projection, the government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.1% in FY25, exceeding expectations.  Capital expenditure, while appearing to increase,  shows modest growth in key infrastructure sectors, with a significant portion directed towards loan and equity infusions. Rural schemes, with the exception of rural housing, see minimal budgetary allocation increases.  The Centre plans to utilize a portion of GST cess collections to reduce gross G-sec supply in FY25, leading to lower net market borrowing.</description>

			<title>Test cricket | West Indies give us a peep into the past, England into the future</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/west-indies-give-us-a-peep-into-the-past-england-into-the-future/article67793102.ece</link>
			<description>The first Test match between India and England in Hyderabad saw a historic upset.  The West Indies, in a stunning display, defeated Australia in Brisbane, ending a 27-year losing streak. The match showcased the unpredictability of sport, with Joseph Shamar and Tom Hartley playing key roles in securing victory for their respective teams.  Shamar, a 24-year-old from a small village, emerged as the Player of the Series after taking seven wickets.  

England's victory in Hyderabad was attributed to their "Bazball" approach, characterized by risk-taking and a fearless attitude towards failure. In contrast, India's cautious approach under pressure resulted in their fourth home defeat in 11 years. 



The match highlighted the importance of self-belief, adapting to conditions, and the impact of individual performances in shaping the outcome of a Test.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-faith-and-the-nation/article67786740.ece</link>
			<description>The opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is viewed as a significant historical turning point for India. Discussions on faith and nation-building highlight the challenge of fostering an inclusive "we" that avoids divisive "us vs them" narratives.  

Political developments in Andhra Pradesh include a  caste survey and the unveiling of a Dr. B.R. Ambedkar statue, seen as outreach to the Scheduled Caste community.

Other news includes efforts to promote Indian languages in education, the near-extinction of Madhika, a local language in Kerala, and the Centre's initiative to address equitable distribution of resources among sub-castes within the Scheduled Caste population.  

There are also developments related to the Free Movement Regime along the Indo-Myanmar border, the BSF's jurisdiction, and the structure of the 16th Finance Commission.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/indias-home-record-is-formidable-bazball-is-englands-best-chance/article67769365.ece</link>
			<description>India starts as the favorite in the upcoming Test series against England. India has a strong home record, having not lost a series in a decade, and boasts a winning percentage significantly higher at home compared to other venues.  

While England has been successful with its  'Bazball' approach, which emphasizes attacking cricket,  India's strong spin bowling attack, led by Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, could pose a challenge.   India will be missing Virat Kohli for the first two Tests.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-golden-jubilee-and-time-to-name-the-stands-after-the-greats/article67744839.ece</link>
			<description>Fifty years ago, Karnataka won its first Ranji Trophy, breaking Mumbai's 15-year winning streak.  This victory had a significant impact on Indian cricket, leading to a rise in the popularity of the sport and inspiring new teams to achieve success.  

The 1974 final against Rajasthan was filled with memorable moments, including off-field drama and a memorable ball from Erapalli Prasanna that dismissed both Sunil Gavaskar and Ajit Wadekar.       

 Karnataka overcame challenges in the final, with players like V.S. Vijaykumar and Syed Kirmani making valuable contributions.  Prasanna's leadership was crucial to their victory and he was praised for inspiring his team to perform at their best.  Karnataka's historic win established a legacy of cricketing excellence that continues today.</description>

			<description>The recent Test match between South Africa and India in Cape Town was a unique and unpredictable spectacle.  

The unusual nature of the game, with both teams enduring collapses and a solitary attacking century, sparked debate about its causes.  Experts and commentators offered various explanations, including the pitch condition and individual technical shortcomings. However, the game defied easy categorization and offered no definitive answers. This inherent ambiguity, characteristic of sport, challenged conventional explanations and reminded viewers of the inherent uncertainties that make sport so captivating. The match highlighted that sometimes the pleasure of sport lies in its refusal to succumb to straightforward analysis.</description>

			<title>Column | Inside the coastal Muslim kitchen</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/food/features/inside-the-coastal-muslim-kitchen-sarmaya-coromandel-coast/article67695151.ece</link>
			<description>The Coromandel Coast, a historically porous region, has been shaped by centuries of trade and colonial influence, resulting in a diverse and vibrant culinary landscape. Coastal Muslim communities, known for their openness to new trends, played a significant role in this fusion.  Their trading backgrounds exposed them to global commodities, including European dairy brands and spice routes from the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and East Africa.  This exposure is evident in dishes like kuzhi paniyarams, influenced by Dutch poffertjes pans, and thakkadi, a one-pot dish that shares similarities with East African injera.  Thengai buns, with a Portuguese leaning, showcase the region's adoption of leavened bread-making techniques. Koliappam, translucent crepes enjoyed with coconut curries, further highlights the coastal population's adaptability and openness to culinary influences.  The presence  of dodol, an Indonesian sweet that arrived through Sri Lankan connections, completes the narrative of a coast that embraces diverse culinary traditions.</description>

			<title>SA Test team controversy | This might be an inflexion point in the game, but we need to care</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/this-might-be-an-inflexion-point-in-the-game-but-we-need-to-care/article67698540.ece</link>
			<description>South Africa's decision to prioritize their domestic T20 tournament over a Test series against New Zealand highlights a concerning trend in cricket. Only two players from the team that defeated India in the first Test are part of the squad for the New Zealand series, signaling a decline in the importance of Test cricket.  This move raises concerns about the future of the format, with some observers suggesting it might be on the brink of extinction. 

The prioritization of lucrative T20 leagues over traditional Test matches is driven by financial motivations and the pursuit of greater individual wealth for players.  

This raises questions about the long-term sustainability of Test cricket and the role of major cricketing nations in preserving its legacy.  A potential solution lies in addressing financial imbalances, ensuring adequate remuneration for Test players, and finding a balance between franchise cricket and established formats. The fate of Test cricket might depend on the willingness of the governing bodies and stakeholders to prioritize its preservation over short-term financial gains.</description>

			<title>Ind vs SA | Moving an event from the rare to the commonplace</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/moving-an-event-from-the-rare-to-the-commonplace/article67677982.ece</link>
			<description>India has struggled to win Test series in South Africa over the past three decades, despite having strong teams with legendary players.  While India has historically considered draws as acceptable results abroad, their current team, ranked No. 1, views them as defeats and aims for victories.  

A combination of factors has contributed to India's difficulties, including poor sessions of play, struggles against left-arm pace bowling, and challenges with defensive cricket and team balance.  Recent close encounters, like the 2022 series where they won the first Test but lost the second, highlight this persistent challenge. The upcoming two-Test series begins with significant importance, as the winner cannot be overtaken.  This series presents an opportunity for India to break their South African series win drought and achieve a milestone victory that would solidify their status as a dominant force in Test cricket.</description>

			<title>Political Line | The point of the temple</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/recasting-the-caste-debate/article67672185.ece</link>
			<description>The inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, a site believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, marks the end of a century-long religious conflict.  However,  this event also raises questions about the ongoing nature of Indian national identity. Some see it as a finality, while others, like Rahul Gandhi, believe India is an ongoing conversation.  The BJP's approach, emphasizing a singular certitude,  contrasts with the federalist notion of a nation composed of diverse, autonomous religious communities espoused by Mahatma Gandhi. Despite the temple's inauguration,  religious disputes continue, exemplified by the situation in Mathura, where the birthplace of Lord Krishna is contested. Additionally,  politics influences religious matters, with Odisha's chief minister using the Jagannath Temple corridor project for political gain. This raises concerns about the blurring of lines between religion and political agendas.</description>

			<description>Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja's attempt to wear shoes with the slogans "All lives are equal" and "Freedom is a human right" was met with opposition from the International Cricket Council (ICC), who deemed them political statements. Khawaja argues that these are humanitarian messages. The incident raises questions about a sportsman's responsibility towards global issues. While the ICC allows some messages, like "Black Lives Matter," drawing the line remains challenging. Increasingly, sportspersons are using their platform to address social and environmental concerns, prompting debate about their role in wider society. In contrast, Indian cricketers are often hesitant to voice their opinions on such matters, choosing to remain neutral.</description>

			<description>The article tells the story of the author's aunt, Phuphee, who serves a humble meal despite her uncle's expectation of a more elaborate one. When he criticizes her cooking, Phuphee challenges his opinion, highlighting how we often get caught up in the opinions of others and lose sight of our own. She argues that opinions, unlike butterflies, are like bees that carry weight and can influence our perceptions and actions, sometimes even causing harm. The author reflects on how we tend to live in reaction to others' opinions, leading to a feeling of being trapped. Phuphee's actions teach the author a valuable lesson: sometimes the only way out is to stop listening to external opinions and start speaking our own truth.</description>

			<description>The ICC Cricket World Cup concluded with Australia's victory over India, shattering pre-tournament expectations. Despite India's dominance in world cricket and overwhelming support, the result underscored the unpredictability of sport. Australia embraced risk, executed well, and capitalized on India's faltering momentum. The tournament witnessed a strange atmosphere in the Indian crowd, marked by silence and a lack of engagement. While the Indian team, arguably the best in recent history,  performed magnificently, the loss exposed the danger of hubris and highlighted the cyclical nature of success in sport.</description>

			<description>Early defeats in the World Cup can force teams to re-evaluate their strategies and identify weaknesses. Australia's initial losses have led to significant improvement, while England's struggles at the bottom of the table highlight the dangers of complacency.  

India's strong performance so far, with convincing victories, positions them as a top contender to potentially go undefeated in the tournament.  However, the team needs to learn from past successes and address potential complacency to avoid repeating England's mistakes.  

 Captains of other struggling teams are emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and learning from defeats, highlighting the need for introspection and growth.   Ultimately, learning from both victories and defeats is crucial for sustained success in cricket.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/column-saba-mahjoor-an-accidental-cruelty-miscarriage/article67441949.ece</link>
			<description>The author recounts an incident from her childhood involving a woman named Masarat, who suffered repeated miscarriages and was ostracized in her village.  Phuphee, a respected figure in the community, allowed Masarat's mother to believe her daughter had died in a miscarriage. Phuphee's intention was to protect Masarat from her mother's hurtful comments that suggested her miscarried children lacked souls. Years later, the author, who had also experienced miscarriages, understands Phuphee's difficult decision and the weight it carries. The author acknowledges the inherent cruelty of the situation, but recognizes the sacrifice Phuphee made to shield Masarat from further emotional pain.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Digital mohalla sabhas, and international relations</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/digital-mohalla-sabhas-and-international-relations/article67448508.ece</link>
			<description>This article discusses the rise of populism and its impact on international relations. 

The author argues that populism has "democratized" diplomacy, giving the common person a voice in strategic affairs. However, this has led to increased public scrutiny and influence, creating challenges for elites and policymakers. 

The article highlights the contrasting approaches to foreign policy taken by populist movements in India and the West. While Indian populism promotes a strong military stance and assertive foreign policy, Western populism is largely against militarism and global interventionism.

Regardless of their specific stances, the author suggests that populist movements in both India and the West pose a challenge to traditional strategic thinking and present a new dynamic in global affairs.</description>

			<title>ICC World Cup | It takes more than just teams to make a match; fans are important too</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/it-takes-more-than-just-teams-to-make-a-match-fans-are-important-too/article67431187.ece</link>
			<description>India's performance in the Cricket World Cup has been impressive, but  their denial of visas to Pakistani fans has sparked criticism. Mickey Arthur, Pakistan's team director,  pointed out the lack of Pakistani supporters, highlighting the event's feeling of being a domestic BCCI affair rather than an ICC event. The article contrasts this with previous World Cups where Pakistani fans were welcomed,  emphasizing the role of fans in enhancing the sporting experience. 

The piece delves into the historical animosity between India and Pakistan, noting how political tensions often overshadow sporting events.  While acknowledging the financial and political benefits of India-Pakistan matches, the article criticizes the discriminatory visa policy, urging India to promote inclusivity, especially with an upcoming bid for the 2036 Olympics.</description>

			<title>The Israel model, and Indian realities | Political Line</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-israel-model-and-indian-realities/article67423236.ece</link>
			<description>The recent Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's response highlight the challenges faced by diverse nations in maintaining unity and peace.

The article argues that the belief in a strong state as the solution to internal and external threats can be misleading. It points to the example of Israel's fortified borders and military strength proving insufficient against Hamas, and suggests that this approach can also stifle dissent and curtail civil liberties.

The article uses the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict to illustrate the limitations of "peace through strength" and emphasizes the need for inclusive solutions that address the root causes of conflict. It urges India, a diverse nation itself, to learn from these global challenges and avoid falling prey to simplistic solutions that prioritize state power over social and political inclusivity.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Inspector Praveen, inspired by The New York Times</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/inspector-praveen-inspired-by-the-new-york-times/article67393123.ece</link>
			<description>An FIR filed by Delhi police alleges a conspiracy by promoters and contributors of the left-leaning online platform NewsClick to create communal discord in India at the behest of China. This case echoes similar narratives by US media outlets about Russian and Chinese influence operations targeting the US. 

The article draws parallels between the Indian and American contexts, noting that while US media criticizes populism in the US as aligned with foreign influence, Indian media and state apparatus often portray populist criticism as influenced by Pakistan and China. Both situations, according to the article, demonize dissenting voices and stifle intellectual discourse under the guise of national security.

The author criticizes the use of "influence operation" as a vague term in investigative journalism, arguing that it is a slippery slope to criminalize thought based on alleged foreign connections.</description>

			<title>The World Cup as a farewell tour for top players is well established</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-world-cup-as-a-farewell-tour-for-top-players-is-well-established/article67375912.ece</link>
			<description>The World Cup frequently serves as a farewell stage for veteran cricketers. Players often choose this global event to bid adieu to international cricket, pursuing other ventures like commentary, coaching, or administrative roles.  

Their departures evoke emotions of completion and a desire to explore new avenues. While some retirements are planned and celebrated with grand send-offs, others happen unexpectedly. The article highlights instances where players received fitting farewells, such as Sachin Tendulkar's 200th and final Test, and situations where retirements were less ceremonious or even tinged with disappointment, like Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman's farewells.  

Ultimately, the desire to leave on one's own terms often drives these decisions, with players aiming to step away gracefully after a long and illustrious career.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Brownwashing conservative politics in the U.S. and the U.K.</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-big-picture-brownwashing-conservative-politics-in-the-us-and-the-uk/article67364991.ece</link>
			<description>Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican presidential candidate, and Suella Braverman, Britain's Home Secretary, are prominent conservatives who emphasize national identity. Both Ramaswamy, a Hindu, and Braverman, of Indian descent, express concerns about immigration and its impact on Western nations. 

They advocate for stricter border controls and promote a shared cultural identity. This linkage between brown leaders and conservative politics is attributed to various factors, including shared values such as family orientation and a preference for meritocracy over affirmative action.


Conservatives, facing demographic shifts, seek to build alliances with ethnic minorities, potentially leading to a more diverse and racially inclusive conservatism in the future.</description>

			<description>The 1987 Cricket World Cup, held in India, saw Australia upset the home team in a dramatic opening match.  They won by one run, setting the tone for their eventual tournament victory and dominance in world cricket. Despite India's strong start in the match,  they ultimately faltered, thanks to Craig McDermott's bowling and a late six by Dean Jones that sparked controversy. The tournament saw Pakistan lose in the semi-final to Australia, and England defeat India in the final. While India lost by one run to Australia again in the next World Cup,  their 1987 campaign highlighted the unpredictable nature of one-day cricket.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Global nationalists, national globalists</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/big-picture-global-nationalists-national-globalists/article67341289.ece</link>
			<description>The article explores the paradoxical nature of modern nationalism, which seeks both national seclusion and global reach.  

It highlights the global spread of various nationalisms, exemplified by Sikh activism for Khalistan across several countries. The author points out the conflict between the rise of nationalism and the previous post-9/11 emphasis on globalization, noting how nations now simultaneously advocate for sovereignty and universal goals.  

The article uses the India-Canada diplomatic dispute to illustrate this tension, where nationalist sentiments clash with the globalized nature of both nations.  It also examines the complexities of defining national interest in a world with interconnected economies and diverse ethnicities within countries.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/readable-in-one-sitting-and-other-issues/article67338636.ece</link>
			<description>Vivek Shanbhag's "Ghachar Ghochar" is praised as a  fine example of the novella form, which, despite being concise and powerful, is often overlooked by publishers.  Writers like  Orwell, Hemingway and  Ian McEwan  have used the novella format successfully.  The novella requires distinct skills from longer novels or short stories, where what is left unsaid can be as important as what is written.  The novella has a long history, and introducing readers to great writers like Thomas Mann, Camus, and Joyce  through their novellas is a valuable way to engage with their work.  Even non-fiction can utilize the novella format, as evidenced by works such as "The Elements of Style" and "A Room of One's Own."</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/saba-mahjoor-column-beauty-and-the-beasts-infidelity/article67322388.ece</link>
			<description>The story centers around Phuppee, a wise Peer, and Bashir, a handsome farmer whose cows have inexplicably stopped producing milk and escape at night. Bashir seeks Phuppee's help, believing a curse is responsible.  Phuppee, after a visit to the cowshed, advises Bashir to recite Quranic verses and tie them to his wrist. 

While offering this seemingly difficult solution, Phuppee secretly orchestrates a plan with Bashir's wife who confided in her about Bashir's infidelity. Phuppee subtly enacts justice by exposing Bashir's actions, empowering his wife to keep him at home, while also cautioning that help should always empower the individual to make their own decisions.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/we-are-looking-at-the-future-and-it-isnt-reassuring/article67299247.ece</link>
			<description>Cricket is facing numerous challenges, including a decline in Test cricket's popularity. The focus on lucrative franchise T20 leagues, driven by India's dominance in the sport, is changing the game's priorities. 

Countries like South Africa are prioritizing domestic T20 tournaments, often at the expense of Test match commitments. This creates a scenario where top players are unavailable for Test series, impacting the quality and competitiveness of the format. 

The future of cricket raises concerns about the potential for over-saturation of franchise leagues, diminishing fan interest, and the long-term sustainability of the sport's traditional formats.  Governing bodies face the challenge of balancing the financial allure of T20 cricket with the importance of nurturing grassroots development and preserving the integrity of all formats.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Reversing democracy for stability</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-reversing-democracy-for-stability/article67266927.ece</link>
			<description>The Indian government, led by the BJP, is proposing "one nation, one election," aiming for simultaneous polling for all representative bodies every five years.  Proponents cite cost reduction, reduced disruption to governance, and less political instability. 

However, critics argue that such a move restricts democratic expression and overlooks the benefits of a diverse political system. They point out that frequent elections can hold governments accountable and that India's multi-party system reflects its diverse population. They also raise concerns about the proposed mechanism requiring a positive alternative government for a no-confidence motion to succeed, potentially tilting the system further in favor of the incumbent.  This debate highlights the complexities of balancing democratic principles with the pursuit of political stability and efficiency.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/column-saba-mahjoor-phuphee-childhood-making-mistakes/article67222364.ece</link>
			<description>The author shares a childhood memory of being punished by a teacher for accidentally breaking a vase.  She contrasts this experience with the nurturing approach of her aunt, Phuphee, who taught her that mistakes are a natural part of learning. The author reflects on how Phuphee's acceptance of her mistakes fostered her courage and encouraged her to explore the world. She compares Phuphee’s approach to the common practice of punishing children for misbehavior, which she believes stifles their natural curiosity and ultimately harms their development. The author concludes by recognizing her own parenting style, influenced by Phuphee, and the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment for children to make mistakes and learn.</description>

			<description>The story focuses on Tahira, a woman in her 70s living in a peaceful Kashmiri village. Her life is deeply connected to nature and tradition. The arrival of a television in her home disrupts this peace, particularly with the introduction of loud and aggressive political commentary from figures like Donald Trump.

Despite her initial attempts to tolerate the intrusion, Tahira ultimately chooses to remove the television from her home, prioritizing peace and preserving her traditional way of life. The experience serves as a reminder of the impact external influences can have on individual lives and the importance of safeguarding one's inner peace.</description>

			<description>Both the NDA and INDIA alliances are vying for the subaltern vote, particularly from OBCs and Dalits. India’s focus on nationalistic discourse suggests they recognize the BJP's strength in this arena.  

Regional realignments are in flux.  While the BJP attempts to shore up alliances, parties like the Congress and AAP are adjusting their strategies. The BJP's position in states like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh  is uncertain. BSP and AIMIM leaders remain independent, potentially impacting the political landscape. Notably, several regional leaders are positioning themselves equidistant from both major alliances. Meanwhile, the Manipur video has brought the issue of sexual violence to light, while the Tamil Nadu CM's appeal on Tamil issues during the Sri Lankan President's visit underscores the importance of regional concerns.</description>

			<description>A U.S. judge ruled against blocking Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, stating that federal regulators failed to demonstrate a negative impact on the gaming industry. Microsoft had offered to make Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty accessible on various platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Nvidia's cloud gaming service, for at least ten years to address regulatory concerns. This ruling comes shortly before a $3 billion penalty for Microsoft if the deal did not proceed. 
  
The decision has faced criticism due to the judge's son's employment at Microsoft. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gained a more favorable perception compared to Elon Musk, partly due to Zuckerberg's more measured response to Musk's aggressive comments and threats during the launch of Meta's text-based app Threads. Threads garnered around 100 million sign-ups in its first week, highlighting a potential shift in user preference.

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-3-is-a-crucial-position-and-shubman-gill-is-best-suited-for-it/article67016152.ece</link>
			<description>This article analyzes the critical roles of different positions in a cricket team's batting order. 

The authors highlight the importance of openers as scouts, assessing pitch conditions and setting the tone.

The unique demands on the No. 3 position, acting as a bridge between the top and middle order, are also discussed.

			<title>Column | Longing and a side of tehar</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/saba-mahjoor-column-a-little-life-phuphee-sisterhood-longing-tehar/article66988891.ece</link>
			<description>The article describes a gathering of women at the house of a woman named Phuphee. They come together unexpectedly, drawn by a shared sense of longing and a need for connection.  Phuphee provides them with food, tea, and head massages, creating a space for them to express their unspoken desires and sorrows. 

A woman named Aapa sings a poem about her deceased parents, lamenting the love she lost and the emptiness she feels. Others share their own longing – a newlywed yearning for affection from her husband, a young woman mourning an unrequited love. The gathering provides a safe haven for these women to release their bottled-up emotions.
 
Through these shared experiences, Phuphee emphasizes the importance of female solidarity and understanding. She believes that unspoken longings, if left unexpressed, can fester and cause pain, and that sharing and supporting each other is essential for healing.</description>

			<description>The rise of AI-powered mental health chatbots presents both opportunities and risks. While studies suggest chatbots can provide quality and empathetic responses, concerns remain about the authenticity of their empathy compared to human interaction.  

Privacy and data protection are major concerns, with critics labeling these chatbots as "data-sucking machines." There are worries about the potential sharing of sensitive personal information with third parties.</description>

			<description>European Union antitrust regulators are considering ordering Google to sell part of its advertising technology business due to ongoing concerns about its dominance in the digital advertising market. Google holds a significant 28% market share, and the EU has expressed frustration with the company's failure to adequately address competition issues. This potential move could escalate trans-Atlantic efforts to curb Google's power in the digital advertising space.</description>

			<title>Political Line | The stories that make a nation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-the-stories-that-make-a-nation/article66928253.ece</link>
			<description>The inauguration of India's new Parliament building was marked by political division, with opposition parties boycotting the ceremony. The installation of a sengol, a religious sceptre, sparked controversy, with critics arguing it symbolizes a shift towards religious nationalism.  

The BJP's reinterpretation of the sengol's history, framing it as a transfer of power from the British to the Congress, has been disputed.  The party's appropriation of a Saivite sect from Tamil Nadu is seen by some as an attempt to undermine Dravidian politics. 

Meanwhile, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma highlighted the state's transition from a mono-lingual to a multilingual society, while Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin defended the influx of migrant labourers into the state.  A mural in the new Parliament building depicting the Indian subcontinent has drawn criticism from Nepal.</description>

			<title>In the era of unicorns, there are few takers for Sudha Murty’s brand of simplicity</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/society/sudha-murty-simple-memes-and-jokes-the-kapil-sharma-show-india-aspirations/article66910610.ece</link>
			<description>Sudha Murty's recent anecdote sharing stories about her perceived "simplicity" sparked a social media debate. While she has long positioned herself as modest despite her wealth, the current generation finds little appeal in the concept.  

The article suggests that societal values have shifted since economic liberalization, with ostentatiousness no longer considered gauche. Today, wealth often translates to public display of luxury, leading to skepticism and suspicion towards narratives of simplicity, especially those perceived as PR-driven.  


 
Murty's story, like that of other celebrities who have been exposed for fabrication, faced intense scrutiny, highlighting a changed social landscape where transparency and authenticity are deeply questioned.</description>

			<title>IPL to WTC | Fitness and adaptability are the keys; how about the Dhoni Cup?</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/fitness-and-adaptability-are-the-keys-how-about-the-dhoni-cup/article66913436.ece</link>
			<description>The World Test Championship final raises a debate about the impact of the IPL on Test cricket preparation. However, modern cricketers are highly adaptable and can switch between formats seamlessly. The trend of eliminating First Class matches before international series further supports this adaptability. 

Even bowlers, traditionally needing more time to adjust, demonstrate this ability. Examples like Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow show the IPL can be beneficial preparation for Test cricket. 

Ultimately, cricketers today, especially batsmen, are adept at switching gears and excel in different formats.</description>

			<title>Kohli and Root — two contemporary greats and their different approaches</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/two-contemporary-greats-and-their-different-approaches/article66885145.ece</link>
			<description>The article explores the contrasting approaches of Virat Kohli and Joe Root to T20 cricket. While Kohli has reinvented T20 in his image, playing his traditional game, Root is adapting to the format, expanding his shot selection.  The author questions whether there are different "levels" of cricket, likening  Root's T20 batting to classical music played at the wrong speed. 

The article  uses Sunil Gavaskar's example of adapting his traditional Test batting style to ODI cricket as a point of reference. It concludes by suggesting that Root, while striving to succeed in T20, might be sacrificing his natural elegance in the process.</description>
