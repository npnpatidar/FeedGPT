			<title>Judges and the people</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-judges-and-the-people/article68539776.ece</link>
			<description>The article examines the increasing politicization of judiciaries globally.  In Bangladesh, recent protests led to the resignation of the Chief Justice and other judges, highlighting the judiciary's vulnerability to political pressure. This trend is not unique to Bangladesh, as seen in the U.S. where judicial appointments often align with political affiliations, influencing rulings on politically charged issues like abortion rights.

The author explores the tension between judicial autonomy and public opinion, questioning whether a purely apolitical judiciary is truly feasible.  The article also touches upon debates in India regarding the Supreme Court's power to amend the Constitution and the perceived lack of transparency in judicial appointments. 

Finally, it uses examples from India and Bangladesh to illustrate how the concept of "traitor"  is often weaponized in political conflicts, further blurring the lines between law and politics.</description>

			<title>Column | Record of a princely wedding</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/record-of-a-princely-wedding-photo-album-mysore-palace/article68515408.ece</link>
			<description>This article examines a 100-year-old wedding album documenting the marriage of Yuvaraja Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the prince of Mysore. Taken in 1910, the album provides a fascinating glimpse into the opulent ceremony and the newly built Amba Vilas Palace, which was under construction at the time. 

The photographer skillfully used details and composition to tell the story of the wedding, showcasing not only the lavish festivities but also the cultural traditions of the era and the enduring power of the Wadiyar dynasty. The author draws a comparison between the richness of this printed album and the fleeting nature of digital memories, highlighting the enduring value of tangible historical documentation.</description>

			<title>Column | Feet of fortune</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece</link>
			<description>The practice of placing crowns with the deity's footprints on devotees' heads in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes a deeper connection to Hindu bhakti traditions.  Originally, bhakti didn't signify submission but participation in the divine's life. Temples, unlike places of meditation, were vibrant centers celebrating life,  where deities were treated as residents and involved in daily rituals and festivals. This devotion was supported by village grants known as deva bhoga. 

However, this movement coexisted with societal stratification based on purity, leading to instances of exclusion and segregation.  Depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi highlight the importance of contentment over the pursuit of fortune. The Vishnu narrative suggests that a humble mindset and acceptance of all, symbolized by the veneration of the feet, leads to true fortune.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-neighbourhood-tests-india-us-ties/article68512576.ece</link>
			<description>The recent turmoil in Bangladesh, with the U.S. seemingly supportive of a potential Islamist government, tests India-U.S. strategic alignment.  

 India and the U.S. have historically shared goals in countering China's influence, but the U.S. stance on Bangladesh raises concerns for India, as it tolerates actors against India's interests in the region. Both nations face challenges regarding trade restrictions on China, with evidence suggesting they may harm domestic innovation.  Internal dynamics in India, such as debates over caste-based quotas and immigration from Bangladesh, also highlight complexities in navigating both domestic and international issues.</description>

			<title>Unequal, and the more unequal</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision recognizes the unequal treatment faced by different SC groups,  despite existing quotas and schemes. 

The court cited the need for "substantive equality" and  drew parallels to the  'more backward' categories allowed for backward classes. Proponents argue that sub-categorization prioritizes those who need it most, while opponents fear it could further fragment already marginalized communities. The implementation of sub-categories will likely lead to new political dynamics and challenges.</description>

			<title>Column | Workplace friction and Disney+Hotstar’s ‘Hardly Working’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hardly-working-by-naukri-workplace-friction-disney-hotstar/article68466162.ece</link>
			<description>The recent comedy special "Hardly Working" on Disney+Hotstar, featuring comedians who have worked in various corporate sectors,  highlights the growing dissatisfaction of young Indians with their work lives. 

The comedians' jokes center around common workplace grievances such as unnecessary meetings, stagnant salaries, abusive bosses, and lack of career progression. This shift in comedic focus, from the traditional "demanding spouse" to the "irate corporate boss," signals a cultural change. 

Numerous Indian TV shows and films also reflect this sentiment, showcasing the dark side of corporate culture. This widespread frustration underscores the bleak job market and  lack of fulfilling professional opportunities for young Indians.</description>

			<title>Partition of Bengal: New Demands and Old Memories</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-partition-of-bengal-new-demands-and-old-memories/article68456674.ece</link>
			<description>Two BJP politicians have recently called for administrative changes to West Bengal. Nishikant Dubey, an MP, wants parts of West Bengal and Bihar to be declared a Union Territory to address the movement of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Sukanta Majumdar, the West Bengal BJP president, suggested including North Bengal in the Northeast's developmental plans. These proposals have sparked concern within the ruling Trinamool Congress, who see it as an attempt to divide West Bengal. The demand for a separate Gorkhaland state continues, alongside Statehood demands for Cooch Behar and Jangalmahal. The BJP's proposals are seen as politically motivated, particularly as they leverage concerns about demographic changes and align with their strategy for upcoming elections in Jharkhand.</description>

			<title>Column | The other Ayodhya</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/devdutt-pattanaik-the-other-ayodhya-ayutthaya-thailand/article68405755.ece</link>
			<description>Thailand's Ayutthaya, a former capital city, is now a ruin filled with temples and Buddha statues.  The city was heavily influenced by the Ramayana, with the king holding a semi-divine status and the epic used to justify royal power and grandeur. Thai kings, like those in Cambodia and Burma, adopted a Mandala model of governance that expanded and contracted based on charisma and capability.  

A merchant-based economy and vast trade networks fueled the city's prosperity, and religious influences from both Hinduism and Buddhism shaped its culture. The decline and sacking of Ayutthaya in the 18th century echoed a similar historical event in earlier capital Sukhothai, leading to the establishment of Bangkok as the new capital.</description>

The story highlights Phuphee's wisdom and gentle approach, emphasizing that sometimes simply being there for someone can be more helpful than solving their problems directly.</description>

			<title>From the desirable to the derogatory</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/from-the-desirable-to-the-derogatory/article68319809.ece</link>
			<description>The term "woke" has undergone a rapid shift from a positive descriptor of social and political awareness to a derogatory term used for criticism.  Originally associated with inclusivity, respect for diverse cultures, and support for marginalized groups, "woke" has been appropriated by the political right to denigrate such ideals. This manipulation of language reflects how politics often corrupts and is corrupted by the language used.  The author argues that while the goal of being "woke" is laudable, its overzealous application, especially in terms of "cultural appropriation," can lead to an imprecision in language and stifle creativity, as exemplified by the debate surrounding Lionel Shriver's comments on identity politics.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-the-rupee-ruled-mughal-currency-trade-coin-east-india-company/article68303999.ece</link>
			<description>The article explores the history of the Indian rupee as a widely used currency. It traces its origins to Sher Shah Suri's reforms in the 16th century and its consolidation under Akbar, who established mints across a vast Mughal empire.  Europe's trade with India led to the rupee becoming a crucial "trade coin," used by East India Companies and beyond. European colonies in Africa even minted rupees, showcasing its global reach.  



The rupee's use extended to the Gulf, officially recognized by the Reserve Bank of India till the 1960s when Gulf nations adopted their own currencies.  Interestingly, recent advancements in Indian payment technology have seen the “Rupay” system gain traction, echoing the historical journey of the rupee.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/centenary-of-the-man-who-changed-cricket-and-society/article68304032.ece</link>
			<description>Sir Frank Worrell, who would have turned 100 on August 1, is considered by the author to be the most important cricketer of all time.  Worrell's career transcended the game, as he exemplified  C.L.R. James's ideal of cricket: understanding its impact on society. He unified the West Indies cricket team and built a world-class squad, elevating the idea of "West Indies" as a cricketing entity. 

Worrell's captaincy was marked by his emphasis on teamwork and respect.  He fostered unity among his players, emphasizing both on-field performance and off-field harmony. His impact extended beyond the sport, as he played a crucial role in resolving a conflict between India and West Indies during a Test match. Worrell's legacy highlights the power of cricket to unite and inspire, leaving a lasting mark on both the game and society.</description>

			<description>This article explores the unique history and traditions of the Parsi community in India. It highlights their fire temples, adorned with ancient Mesopotamian inspired artwork, and traces their origins to Persia. 

The Parsis, who arrived in India centuries ago seeking refuge, adopted many Indian customs while maintaining their distinct monotheistic faith. The article discusses their enduring cultural practices and the complex relationship they share with other religious groups in India, particularly Hindus. It concludes by noting the surprising connection between Parsis and Hindus, despite the lack of inter-temple access, stemming from their shared Indo-European roots.</description>

			<description>The article imagines a scenario where the author, a "Social Affairs Editor",  takes on the role of a professional oath-taker.  

Humorous recounting of their perceived qualifications for the job includes impeccable "I" pronunciation practice and suggested pricing for administering oaths to various public officials. The author suggests creating a National Commission for Swearing-In headed by themselves,  with regional branches and staff to cater to visitors. To ensure fairness and transparency, they propose a judicial-style appointment process rather than selection by politicians. The author also critiques the standardized oath  and advocates for personalized oaths based on each individual's character and history, suggesting humorous additions to oaths for various public officials.  The piece ends with a tongue-in-cheek call to action to fix the existing oath-taking system.</description>

			<title>T20 World Cup: Taking cricket to America involves a difficult culture transfer</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/t20-world-cup-cricket-america-difficult-culture-transfer-suresh-menon/article68277510.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the limited reception of cricket in the United States despite the USA team's recent victory over Pakistan in the T20 World Cup. Unlike the 1950 football World Cup upset of England by the USA which gained minimal notice, expectations were high for cricket's growth in the U.S. due to its historical connection to the sport. 

However, the article argues that cricket's marketing efforts have fallen short, failing to attract a mainstream American audience. It suggests the International Cricket Council needs to improve the game's presentation, including television coverage, to make it more appealing to a wider audience. Ultimately, the success of cricket in the U.S. hinges on overcoming cultural barriers and connecting with American values and tastes.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha 2024 poll verdict: a rare outcome that pleases all</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/political-line-2024-ls-poll-verdict-a-rare-outcome-that-pleases-all/article68270331.ece</link>
			<description>The 2024 Indian general election results show a BJP victory, but without a commanding majority. Prime Minister Narendra Modi retains his position but requires the support of alliance partners.

The outcome has produced a unique sense of widespread happiness across political spectrums. While Modi celebrates his third term, the Congress party sees his reliance on allies as a significant victory for them. Regional parties experience both successes and setbacks, impacting the BJP's national agenda. 

Social groups, including voters from the heartland and minority communities, feel empowered by the results. The unexpected electoral performance has revitalized the political landscape, impacting journalistic perspectives and fostering a sense of dynamism in Indian politics.</description>

			<description>The Marubo tribe in Brazil, recently connected to the internet via Starlink, is now facing new challenges. 

The arrival of high-speed internet has led to teenagers becoming absorbed in pornography, video games, and online content, neglecting traditional hunting and fishing activities vital for their survival.  This highlights a recurring pattern where new technologies are initially exploited for sexual content, as exemplified by Tim Berners-Lee's observation. Although pornography has existed in various forms throughout history, the internet's accessibility has amplified its reach and impact. Studies on the effects of pornography remain inconclusive, but its influence on internet development is undeniable.  The Marubo tribe's experience underscores the complex and often unforeseen consequences of technological advancements on even the most isolated communities.</description>

			<title>Improving the language of biodiversity conservation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/improving-the-language-of-biodiversity-conservation/article68245700.ece</link>
			<description>This article critiques the communication of biodiversity conservation, arguing that its abstract nature and emphasis on utilitarian benefits hinder public understanding and engagement. 

The author proposes moving beyond a solely functional approach to well-being, emphasizing the importance of recognizing human diversity and agency in experiencing and benefiting from biodiversity. They highlight the limitations of equating ecosystem services with well-being, particularly in the context of social inequalities.  

Drawing on Amartya Sen's concept of capabilities, the article advocates for framing biodiversity conservation in terms of the freedoms and opportunities it enables for individuals and communities. This shift in perspective, the author suggests, will lead to a more nuanced and effective approach to engaging the public in biodiversity conservation efforts.</description>

			<title>The national and the regional</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-the-national-and-the-regional/article68243397.ece</link>
			<description>This article analyses how national parties, such as the Congress and BJP, utilize regionalism during election campaigns. 

The Congress is seen employing regional identity politics in Karnataka and Telangana, while Rahul Gandhi's campaign in Kerala and Tamil Nadu emphasized regional pride. The BJP, on the other hand, targeted the BJD in Odisha by highlighting the influence of a non-Odia individual in the state government, although the party is also attempting to appeal to regional sentiments in Tamil Nadu. 

The article notes that while regionalism may be acceptable if it doesn't target other regions or people, using it as a weapon against them can be harmful.  It concludes that the tendency of national parties to cater to regional sentiments more intensely than regional parties themselves is a notable trend in contemporary politics.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Siddaramaiah’s failed romance and India’s undefined borders</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-siddaramaiahs-failed-romance-and-indias-undefined-borders/article68218384.ece</link>
			<description>This week's Political Line newsletter discusses the concepts of physical and social borders. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval emphasizes the importance of "hard borders" for national security and sovereignty, citing concerns about porous borders and their potential to destabilize the nation.  

In contrast, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah advocates for more inter-caste marriages to dismantle social barriers and eradicate caste inequalities. He uses his own personal experience of a thwarted college romance due to caste as an example, and his government's support for inter-caste marriage facilitation websites highlights his commitment to this cause.  


The newsletter also touches on related topics like recent Supreme Court rulings on Hindu marriage customs and a recent controversy involving scholar Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and a Dalit student, further exploring the complexities of social and intellectual boundaries.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/gravity-levity-and-the-theory-of-relativity/article68214417.ece</link>
			<description>The author humorously reflects on the complexities of family relationships, particularly with relatives who knew them in childhood. 

These relatives, often baffled by the author's maturation and accomplishments, tend to dwell on past mishaps, causing awkwardness and discomfort.  The author compares the dynamics to a playful weaponized storytelling game,  where grandparents deliberately recount embarrassing anecdotes about older siblings to younger generations.  Drawing on Euripides' wisdom, the author suggests that true friends are more valuable than numerous relatives, especially distant ones, who are less likely to hold childhood transgressions against them.</description>

			<description>The article recounts the author's experience with societal expectations after marriage in Kashmiri culture.  Upon marriage, she was expected to address her husband as 'doctor saab', which felt disrespectful to her.  

An aunt, who experienced similar pressures during her marriage,  advised the author to communicate her needs and work towards change.  This prompted the author to speak to her husband, who started addressing her affectionately in public, defying societal norms. This act of defiance led to criticism but ultimately won a small victory for the author and her desire for equality.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-great-players-farewell-is-handled-with-respect-and-common-sense/article68174873.ece</link>
			<description>James Anderson, England's most successful Test bowler, is set to retire after his 188th and final Test match against West Indies at Lord's in July.  Anderson, who is 42, is an iconic figure in cricket, holding the record for most wickets by a fast bowler in Test history with 700.

He has consistently defied expectations, maintaining high levels of performance even after the age of 35.  Anderson's career was marked by his ability to adapt and evolve, particularly mastering reverse swing, and his relentless pursuit of improvement.  

His departure leaves a significant void in the English bowling attack, highlighting his enduring legacy as one of the greatest bowlers of his generation, often compared to Glenn McGrath for their mastery of swing bowling.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-kejriwal-out-and-about/article68168160.ece</link>
			<description>Arvind Kejriwal's recent allegations regarding power struggles within the BJP, including speculation about Amit Shah replacing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, have forced the party to defend its positions. This has shifted the focus of the 2024 election narrative from the BJP's achievements to addressing these challenges. 

Modi, for the first time in his career, is struggling to establish a clear campaign theme, vacillating between promises and attacks on the Congress. This struggle highlights a potential shift in voter sentiment, with the BJP facing pressure to address concerns raised by Kejriwal.</description>

			<title>When Belgian policemen become Catholic priests</title>

			<description>The article discusses the contemporary trend of adding backstories to popular characters, arguing that it is often unnecessary and even detrimental. While some authors successfully continue the adventures of established characters, others, seeking to update stories or embrace inclusivity, take liberties that deviate significantly from the original works. The author cites examples like Agatha Christie's novels, where recent adaptations have altered plots, protagonists, and even murderer identities, leading to criticism from fans who prefer faithful adaptations. While defending such changes as necessary for modern audiences, the article ultimately warns against excessive creative license,  illustrating the potential pitfalls with humorous examples of drastically altered classic stories.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Keywords of 2024: Communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-keywords-of-2024-communalism-casteism-and-constitutionalism/article68136893.ece</link>
			<description>The BJP is shifting its 2024 election strategy, embracing communalism and casteism couched in constitutionalism. They are using  communal insinuations and targeting OBCs, tribal communities, and Dalits with appeals that were previously used by opposition parties. 

This approach, led by Prime Minister Modi, prioritizes the votes of marginalized communities, potentially alienating upper caste and middle-class supporters. 

The BJP claims the Congress seeks to undermines the Constitution by granting Muslim reservations,  playing on fears of Hindu subaltern communities. Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena (UBT) presents a contrasting Hindutva ideology emphasizing skill and hard work, appealing to Muslim voters and accusing the BJP of being anti-Maharashtra.</description>

			<description>The article recounts the author's experience with a harsh mathematics teacher in school. The teacher constantly mocked her for her struggles, leading to feelings of inadequacy. Seeking solace during winter break at her aunt's house, the author commits to mastering math to gain her teacher's approval. However, her aunt's wisdom about snowflakes – their unique beauty invisible to the naked eye – shifts her perspective. Realizing that her teacher's limitations don't diminish her worth, the author finds empowerment in embracing her own individuality. She continues to work hard but no longer seeks external validation, ultimately finding success and personal growth.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/courtesans-tawaifs-courting-hindustan-heeramandi-sarmaya-arts-foundation/article68071442.ece</link>
			<description>Indian courtesans, known as tawaifs, played a significant role in shaping cultural trends and artistic expression between 500 BCE and the 20th century.  Favored for their beauty and talent, they were patrons of the arts, particularly music and dance, and wielded considerable influence.  They embodied elegance, often adorned in luxurious silks, brocades, and intricate jewelry, setting fashion trends that extended to society as a whole. Significant figures like Begum Samru and Begum Akhtar exemplified their status and impact, using their attire and jewels to signal power and affiliation.  Despite the decline of their prominence after 1940, their legacy endures, inspiring artists and designers, including Sanjay Leela Bhansali's upcoming production "Heeramandi".</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-players-go-beyond-cliches-and-illuminate-the-format/article68071847.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the lack of memorable quotes in the IPL, highlighting the sanitized nature of player interviews. The author uses Suryakumar Yadav’s honest admission about Jasprit Bumrah’s ability to break bats and ankles to illustrate the rarity of such candidness. Bumrah’s statement about “no ego in this format” is then explored, differentiating between healthy and destructive ego in sports.  

The article further analyzes Sunil Narine’s approach, emphasizing the value of clarity and focus on one’s role. By limiting his knowledge to his core task of hitting the ball, Narine thrives. The contrasting roles of top-order batters like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are acknowledged, who bear greater responsibility due to their positions.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Unity and divisiveness: in the eye of the beholder</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unity-and-divisiveness-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/article68065004.ece</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the dynamics of political discourse in India, focusing on accusations of divisiveness levied by the BJP and Congress.  The BJP accuses the Congress of promoting division through demands for a nationwide caste census and criticisms of centralizing policies. The Congress, in turn, criticizes the BJP for allegedly excluding and marginalizing Muslims and other religious minorities. 

The BJP's approach to "Hindu unity" is complex, aiming to both include lower castes in political and cultural spheres while excluding religious minorities, particularly Muslims. The Congress faces the challenge of advocating for caste justice without appearing to undermine Hindu identity. 

The article also highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the definition of "Hindu" and its implications for Indian nationalism.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/what-the-heck-more-humour-less-uniformity-please/article68020437.ece</link>
			<description>This article explores the phenomenon of heckling in cricket stadiums, focusing on Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya's recent experience. The author argues that while some fans' displeasure over Pandya's captaincy is understandable, the "booing" strategy lacks originality. 

The piece delves into historical examples of Indian cricketers facing heckling, such as Ravi Shastri being greeted with "Hai, hai Shastri" during his playing days, highlighting how players often learn to ignore it and use it as motivation.  Ultimately, the article emphasizes that while heckling can sometimes be unpleasant, it is an integral part of the spectator experience, bringing a unique form of engagement and humor to the game.</description>

			<description>India's selectors face a dilemma regarding the selection of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for the upcoming World T20.  While experience is valuable in cricket, the T20 format emphasizes adaptability and an ability to constantly evolve.  Young players often thrive in this environment due to their lack of experience-driven constraints.  

Kohli and Sharma, though seasoned veterans,  have shown the ability to adapt their game. Notably, Kohli's recent innings against Punjab Kings showcased both his textbook shots and innovative strokeplay.  The selectors, however, need more data on their performance in the ongoing IPL to make a final decision.</description>

			<title>A mature Kuldeep Yadav was the quiet success of the India-England Test series</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-mature-kuldeep-yadav-has-been-the-quiet-success-of-the-series/article67944430.ece</link>
			<description>Kuldeep Yadav's recent success in the India-England Test series has cemented his position as a key player in the Indian spin attack. 

Despite facing periods of instability throughout his seven-year career, Kuldeep has returned stronger and more assured, showcasing his unique left-arm wrist spin talent. Kuldeep's resurgence is a significant development for India, highlighting the depth of their spin bowling options. 

The series demonstrated Rohit Sharma's understanding of Kuldeep's strengths and weaknesses, offering him both guidance and support. Kuldeep's ability to deceive batsmen with his unpredictable delivery makes him a formidable weapon, and his growing maturity and consistency bode well for his future.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/dreams-come-true-when-you-hold-on-to-them-against-the-odds/article67891818.ece</link>
			<description>The recent Indian team victory against England showcases the remarkable stories of the players who achieved success despite adversity. Dhruv Jurel, Akash Deep, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sarfaraz Khan all endured challenging circumstances: poverty, loss of family, and lack of opportunity. 

Their journeys highlight the importance of resilience, dedication, and support from coaches and relatives. 

Emerging from smaller towns and cities, these players are changing the landscape of Indian cricket,  mirroring the "Jaisball" style with Jaiswal resembling a young Sachin Tendulkar.  Batting technique is evolving, placing emphasis on a "big heart" over rigid classical methods. 


The Indian team now faces the challenge of proving their dominance on tours to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and England, where they will be tested on challenging pitches.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/glories-of-our-past-two-notions-that-shape-our-present/article67885719.ece</link>
			<description>The passing of Fali S. Nariman prompted reflection on India's secular state. One view argues that India once flourished as a secular nation, but the rise of Hindu nationalism with milestones like the destruction of the Babri Masjid and construction of a Ram Temple threatens this past peace. Another view sees the current regime as correcting a historical path, restoring a glorified Hindu past ignored by secular politics. Both perspectives agree that the present deviates from a previous era, considered flawed in either its secularism or non-Hindutva stance.  While lamenting a lost past is not constructive, examining the past realistically can offer insights into the current political climate.  For example, experiences recounted about voting practices during India's early republic highlight the complexities and limitations of democracy.</description>

Experts emphasize the importance of team composition, using analogies like "Lego" and "rowing eight" to highlight the need for diverse players who complement each other.  Selection involves balancing established processes with the ability to make unpredictable choices based on form, match conditions, and individual player attributes. The article cites examples like Cheteshwar Pujara's current form and the need for experience despite a focus on youth development.

			<description>The India-England Test series is shaping up to be a thrilling spectacle. Both teams possess a deep understanding of each other's styles, with England’s "Bazball" challenging India’s traditionally cautious approach. 

Rohit Sharma, leading India, showed glimpses of adopting a more aggressive approach, while the brilliance of Jasprit Bumrah with the ball continues to awe.  England's captain Ben Stokes, a key factor in England's Bazball success, is displaying the leadership qualities of legends like Mike Brearley and Ray Illingworth.

As the series progresses, the captains' decisions and players' adaptations will be crucial in determining the outcome. This five-Test format allows for a true test of mettle, ensuring a captivating contest for fans.</description>

			<title>Budget 2024 | The pace of fiscal consolidation took everyone by surprise</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2024-the-pace-of-fiscal-consolidation-took-everyone-by-surprise/article67801087.ece</link>
			<description>The 2024 Vote-on-Account Budget prioritizes fiscal consolidation despite being a pre-election year.  The government aims to achieve a lower-than-budgeted fiscal deficit of 5.8% of GDP in FY24 and consolidate it further to 5.1% in FY25. While nominal GDP growth is projected at 11%, government expenditure is budgeted to grow at a slower pace. 

Capital expenditure, although projected to increase, shows limited growth in key infrastructure sectors. Rural scheme allocations remain largely flat except for rural housing. The government anticipates using a portion of GST cess collection to offset regular G-sec maturities, leading to a lower overall gross borrowing requirement in FY25.</description>

England’s  "Bazball" strategy, centered on fearless batting, and Ben Stokes' captaincy, which emphasizes self-belief and risk-taking, played a critical role in their victory.  India, on the other hand, seemed timid in their approach and succumbed to pressure, failing to emulate England’s boldness.</description>

Discussions about faith and nation-building raise questions about the "us vs. them" inherent in nationalism. The article explores India-Pakistan relations, highlighting Pakistan's failures in consolidating national unity through religion and meddling in global rivalries. It discusses the importance of caste justice in India, citing initiatives like the BRS government's Ambedkar statue and the YSRCP government's caste survey.  Concerns about the extinction of local languages like Madhika are addressed, as is the government's effort to enhance educational access through the Eighth Schedule languages. The article also touches upon the Free Movement Regime across the Indo-Myanmar border and debate around the BSF's jurisdiction, the 16th Finance Commission, and the potential impact of simultaneous elections on democracy and federalism.</description>

			<description>India hosts England for a five-Test series with the home team entering as favorites. India has a strong record in home Tests, having not lost a series for a decade. They are also aiming to record more Test victories than losses in their history. 

This series pits India's "win at all costs" mentality against England's "Bazball" philosophy, an aggressive and attacking brand of cricket. The success of Bazball in India hinges on the English batsmen's ability to handle the spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Key players like Virat Kohli and Harry Brook will miss the first two Tests, adding another layer of intrigue to the series.</description>

			<title>Ranji Trophy | A golden jubilee, and time to name the stands after the greats</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-golden-jubilee-and-time-to-name-the-stands-after-the-greats/article67744839.ece</link>
			<description>Fifty years ago, Karnataka won the Ranji Trophy for the first time, marking a pivotal moment in Indian cricket. This victory broke Mumbai's dominant 15-year reign and paved the way for other teams to claim titles.  

The 1974 triumph was marked by both on-field brilliance and off-field passion.  Highlights include Erapalli Prasanna's nine wickets in the semifinal against Mumbai and instances of remarkable luck, such as  Viswanath surviving a close lbw call and Wadekar getting run out due to a faulty pair of shoes. 

The final saw contributions from the entire squad, with  lesser-known players stepping up to secure victory. Karnataka's captaincy, led by Prasanna, played a crucial role, along with the influence of his predecessor, V. Subramanya, who fostered a culture of excellence. 


The team's success continues to inspire, and the legacy of this historic win includes a notable lineup of world-class players from Karnataka.</description>

			<description>The second Test match between South Africa and India in Cape Town was a unique and unpredictable affair.  The game saw bizarre dismissals and unexpected performances, leading to many theories about what caused the unusual results.  Though the pitch received criticism for its uneven bounce, attributing the match solely to the pitch seems simplistic.  

The match highlights the inherent unpredictability of sport and challenges our desire for straightforward explanations.  Sometimes, the most intriguing games defy easy analysis, reminding us that the unexpected is what makes sport so captivating.  Rather than seeking definitive answers, we should embrace the ambiguity and appreciate the beauty of the unknown.</description>

Dishes like kuzhi paniyaram, inspired by the Dutch poffertjes pan, and thakkadi, likely borrowed from Sri Lanka, showcase this blending of traditions. Thengai buns, with their Portuguese-influenced yeasted bread technique, and koliappam, resembling East African injera, highlight further cross-cultural exchanges.  Even the sweet treat dodol, originating in Indonesia and brought to the coast via Sri Lanka, exemplifies the region's dynamic culinary landscape. This fusion of flavors, shaped by centuries of interaction, paints a vibrant picture of the Coromandel Coast's culinary heritage.</description>

			<description>South Africa's prioritization of their domestic T20 tournament over a Test series against New Zealand highlights a growing trend in cricket.  

The article argues that the sport is headed towards the potential demise of Test cricket as administrators favor the financial gains of T20 leagues over the traditional format. This decision has drawn criticism from figures like Steve Waugh, who feels that Test cricket is being sidelined.  The author questions the long-term sustainability of T20, suggesting that its overwhelming dominance could lead to viewer fatigue and financial instability.  

It emphasizes the need for a balance between franchise cricket and Tests, positing that financial incentives are crucial to preserving Test cricket's future. The article concludes by lamenting the potential loss of a historic format and its legacy for future generations.</description>

			<title>Ind vs SA | Moving an event from the rare to the commonplace</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/moving-an-event-from-the-rare-to-the-commonplace/article67677982.ece</link>
			<description>India have struggled to win Test series in South Africa over the past three decades, despite boasting some of the finest players in history. 

While they have improved in overseas conditions, South Africa's bowling attack, particularly left-arm pacers, has often posed a challenge for Indian batsmen. Past series defeats have often been attributed to a combination of poor batting, specific bowling vulnerabilities, and strategic errors. 

India's current captain, Rohit Sharma, possesses a more aggressive approach that aims to seize control early, unlike previous generations who often opted for defensive strategies in South Africa.  


The upcoming two-Test series holds significant importance for India, as a win would not only end their long-standing drought but also establish them as a force to be reckoned with in all Test-playing nations.</description>

			<title>Political Line | The point of the temple</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/recasting-the-caste-debate/article67672185.ece</link>
			<description>The inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya marks a significant moment, concluding a long-standing religious dispute.  However, the event also raises questions about the nature of Indian nationalism.  While some view it as a finality, others, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, emphasize the ongoing conversation and pluralistic nature of India.  The BJP's approach, symbolized by the temple's construction, centers on a singular certitude of Hindu nationalism.  This raises concerns about the future, as other religious disputes, such as the one in Mathura, are likely to emerge, fueled by competing claims and the inherent tensions within a singular national narrative.</description>

			<description>Usman Khawaja, an Australian cricketer, was asked by the ICC not to wear shoes with the slogans "All lives are equal" and "Freedom is a human right" during a Test match against Pakistan. The ICC deemed these messages political and against their policy prohibiting personal messages on equipment.  

While the ICC seeks to maintain neutrality and avoid endorsing specific political viewpoints, Khawaja argues his slogans are humanitarian messages. This incident raises questions about a sportsman's responsibility to speak out on global issues. 

The article also highlights the increasing prominence of social causes in sports, citing examples like "Black Lives Matter" and climate activism within cricket. It contrasts this with the more reserved stance of Indian cricketers, ultimately suggesting that Khawaja's initiative, even if unsuccessful, prompts important conversations.</description>

			<description>The article explores the impact of opinions on our lives through a personal anecdote.  The author's aunt, Phuphee, confronts her uncle's opinionated nature after he criticizes a humble meal she prepared. Phuphee emphasizes that opinions, unlike fleeting butterflies, carry expectations that influence perceptions and actions, often causing harm. She highlights the importance of speaking our truth and not letting others' opinions dictate our lives. The author, initially oblivious to the deeper meaning, eventually understands the suffocating effect of constantly catering to external opinions and the liberating power of self-expression.</description>

			<description>The ICC Cricket World Cup final saw Australia defeat India, shattering the pre-tournament hype surrounding India's victory.  Despite being considered favorites, India failed to win, reminding everyone that upsets are an inherent part of sport.  

Australia's underdog status fueled their aggressive approach, contrasting with India's perceived confidence.  The disappointed Indian crowd, known for its silence even in defeat, failed to fully embrace the visitors' victory. 

The Indian team, considered one of the strongest, put up a valiant fight. However, the loss highlights the cruelty of sport, as some players may never get another chance to compete for the World Cup.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the contrasting fortunes of England and India at the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

The article highlights the importance of learning from defeats, drawing parallels with past Indian victories after initial setbacks. It emphasizes that even the best teams can stumble and that fresh starts are crucial in every match.</description>

			<description>The story revolves around Masarat, a woman who faced repeated miscarriages in her village. As a result, she was ostracized and her own name was replaced with a derogatory description of her misfortune. 

Phuphee, the protagonist, witnessed Masarat's suffering and, in a shocking act, convinced her mother that Masarat had died after a miscarriage.  This acted as a catalyst for the mother to finally stop invalidating Masarat's grief by claiming her lost babies were not real. 

Years later, Phuphee justifies her actions, explaining that it was easier to bear the guilt of hurting Masarat's mother than to witness the unbearable emotional pain caused by the mother's words.</description>

			<description>Bishan Singh Bedi, renowned for his integrity and sportsmanship, was a celebrated Indian cricketer known for his beautiful left-arm spin bowling.  His straightforward nature and unwavering commitment to the game, though sometimes controversial, were deeply rooted in his passion for cricket.  

Bedi's skills were undeniable, holding the record for most First Class wickets by an Indian bowler.  Don Bradman himself praised Bedi's talent and sportsmanship, ranking him among the finest spinners of all time.  

Beyond his cricketing achievements, Bedi was a beloved figure who touched the lives of those around him. He remained connected to his friends and family, offering support and guidance. His legacy extends beyond the field, as he embodied the spirit of sportsmanship and devotion to the game.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the influence of public opinion on diplomacy and international relations, particularly in the context of populism. 

It highlights how populism has transformed the discussion of foreign policy from an elite domain to a public one,  with citizens expressing their views on matters such as war and national interest.  The article contrasts Indian and Western populism, noting that while Indian populism favors a strong military stance and national sovereignty, Western populism often pushes back against militarism and foreign intervention.

It also examines the challenges this presents for governments, as public demands for assertive foreign policy can complicate their efforts to navigate complex international situations. The article uses examples from India, the United States, and Israel to illustrate these points.</description>

			<description>India's cricket team has been performing well in the World Cup, but their denial of visas to Pakistani fans has drawn criticism.  Mickey Arthur, Pakistan's team director, criticized the atmosphere, stating it lacked the feel of an ICC event. Only a handful of Pakistani supporters, journalists, and team staff were allowed in, a stark contrast to previous tournaments. The article argues that this decision reflects a pattern of exclusion and a politicization of sport. It highlights the hypocrisy of India's stance, given its fondness for the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry and its financial benefits. The article concludes by urging India to embrace a more inclusive approach, especially in its bid for the 2036 Olympics.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/inspector-praveen-inspired-by-the-new-york-times/article67393123.ece</link>
			<description>The article critiques the recent FIR filed in Delhi alleging a conspiracy by left-leaning online platform NewsClick to incite communal unrest at China's behest. It draws parallels with the U.S. media's portrayal of Russian and Chinese "influence operations," arguing that both instances demonstrate a tendency to frame dissent and criticism as foreign-backed threats.  

The author highlights the differences between Indian and American populism, noting that in India, populism aligns with the security apparatus, while in the U.S., it challenges it.  This, the author suggests, leads to a distinct media landscape where in India, state and media are aligned against perceived internal threats, while in the U.S., they often collude to paint populist nationalists as enemies of the state influenced by foreign powers. The author concludes by expressing concern over the criminalization of thought based on alleged foreign links, highlighting the slippery slope it creates for national security and media freedom.</description>

			<description>The World Cup often serves as a farewell stage for veteran cricketers.  Players like Rohan Kanhai, Imran Khan, and Mahela Jayawardene chose the tournament as their final curtain call.  

The concept of retirement in cricket has evolved, with players potentially retiring from specific formats while pursuing others.

Quentin de Kock and Naveen-ul Haq have announced their retirement following this year's World Cup, while others like Moeen Ali and David Warner have hinted at similar decisions. 

The article then delves into the significance of a proper farewell, citing Sachin Tendulkar's iconic send-off as an example.  It contrasts Tendulkar's grand farewell with the more unceremonious departures of other Indian legends like Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-big-picture-brownwashing-conservative-politics-in-the-us-and-the-uk/article67364991.ece</link>
			<description>Vivek Ramaswamy and Suella Braverman, despite their Indian origins, have emerged as prominent figures in conservative politics in the US and the UK respectively. Both advocate for restricted immigration and emphasize "western identity."  

Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate, connects his Hindu faith to conservative values and criticizes the impact of American capitalism on the middle class.  Braverman, the British Home Secretary, warns of the "existential challenge" posed by unchecked migration and criticizes multiculturalism.

Possible reasons for their appeal to conservative voters include shared values on family and concerns about changing cultural norms. Furthermore, conservatives may see these figures as potential allies in countering changing demographics and maintaining their influence.</description>

			<title>Left arm spinners, Steve Waugh and India’s near misses twice in a row</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/left-arm-spinners-steve-waugh-and-indias-near-misses-twice-in-a-row/article67348809.ece</link>
			<description>The 1987 Cricket World Cup, held in India, began with a dramatic Australian victory over India by one run. Despite early Indian dominance, the Australian team, considered underdogs, capitalized on their chances, led by Steve Waugh.  

Dean Jones' controversial six, later corrected to a four, added to the tension.  

India's middle order collapse, fueled by Craig McDermott's bowling, sealed their fate.  A promised India-Pakistan final did not materialize as Australia defeated Pakistan in the semis and England eliminated India. 

Australia's win highlighted the importance of singles and patience, concepts that differed from today's modern cricketing approach.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Global nationalists, national globalists</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/big-picture-global-nationalists-national-globalists/article67341289.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the paradoxical trend of rising nationalism becoming a global phenomenon. Using the India-Canada dispute over Khalistan as an example, it highlights how nationalist movements transcend geographical boundaries.  The author argues that even though the world witnessed a perceived shift towards globalism in the late 20th century, the rise of nationalism and the desire to control national interests have resurfaced.  

This globalized nationalism is evident in various countries, including the US, UK, and China, where domestic politics intertwine with international relations.  The article concludes by emphasizing that both nationalism and globalism continue to be relevant and influential forces shaping the world today.</description>

			<title>Column | Beauty and the beasts</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/saba-mahjoor-column-beauty-and-the-beasts-infidelity/article67322388.ece</link>
			<description>The story revolves around Phuphee, a wise peer, and Bashir, a handsome farmer, whose cows are inexplicably malperforming. Believing they are cursed, Bashir seeks Phuphee's help.  She devises a plan for him to read Quran verses and tie a rope around the cows and his wrist,  an undertaking she claims will be difficult.  

However, Phuphee reveals to the narrator that she  actually aided Bashir's wife who had confronted her about Bashir's infidelity.  Phuphee's "cure" was nothing more than suggesting the wife milk the cows when Bashir was absent. The cryptic whisper she gave Bashir was a suggestion that the curse came from the woman he was seeing, a woman with distinctive features that Phuphee, as the woman's midwife, knew well.</description>

			<title>Test cricket | We are looking at the future, and it isn’t reassuring</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/we-are-looking-at-the-future-and-it-isnt-reassuring/article67299247.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the growing dominance of franchise T20 cricket and its potential impact on the future of Test cricket.  

The International Cricket Council (ICC), now heavily influenced by India's financial power, faces pressure to prioritize revenue-generating T20 leagues over Test matches.  South Africa's decision to send a weakened team to New Zealand for a two-Test series while focusing on its lucrative domestic T20 tournament, the SA20, highlights this shift in priorities. 

The author questions whether the oversaturation of T20 cricket will lead to its own decline as fans lose interest in a format that becomes repetitive and predictable. The article concludes that the very organizations responsible for preserving the integrity of the sport, both national and international governing bodies, may have become beholden to private owners who prioritize profit over the long-term health of cricket.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the BJP's proposal for "one nation, one election," aiming to synchronize national and state elections every five years.  

The author argues that while this could reduce election costs and government disruption, it undermines democratic principles.  The author cites concerns that it restricts voting rights, favors the incumbent government, and limits the expression of diverse viewpoints. The article also explores the implications of such a move for India's diverse population and its history of multi-party politics, suggesting it could potentially hinder the expansion and deepening of democracy in the country.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/column-saba-mahjoor-phuphee-childhood-making-mistakes/article67222364.ece</link>
			<description>The article explores the author's childhood experiences with discipline and contrasts the approach of her aunt, Phuphee, with the prevalent practice of physical punishments.  

The author recounts her teacher slapping her for an accidental mishap and the subsequent harsh  treatment at home and how Phuphee's gentle and understanding approach created a safe space for learning and growth. 

Phuphee believed in encouraging children to try new things without fear of mistakes, fostering their courage and resilience. The author highlights the detrimental long-term effects of punishment-driven discipline, arguing that it stifles a child's spirit and curiosity.  Ultimately, the article champions a more compassionate and nurturing approach to parenting, inspired by Phuphee's unwavering love and acceptance.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/phuphee-spicy-potatoes-trump-column-a-little-life/article67118704.ece</link>
			<description>The author's aunt, Phuphee, lived a peaceful life in a Kashmiri village, connected to nature and tradition.  The arrival of a television brought noise and disruption into her home, but she tolerated it. However, the loud and aggressive rhetoric of Donald Trump, constantly present on television, proved too much for her. 

Phuphee's refusal to make her traditional "gande ti aalve" and the subsequent disappearance of the television revealed her powerful reaction to the noise and negativity.  She recognized the danger of allowing such voices into her peaceful life, choosing to shield herself and her home.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Chaos and coalitions</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-chaos-and-coalitions/article67113169.ece</link>
			<description>India's political landscape is undergoing a major realignment ahead of the 2024 elections. Two prominent alliances have emerged: the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), formed by opposition parties. 

These alliances are vying for the subaltern vote, with both BJP and INDIA parties focusing on OBCs and Dalits.  However, there is a lack of strong, independent subaltern leadership, leaving a vacuum that the BJP appears to be successfully filling.  

The emergence of these alliances has led to shifting political equations at the state level. The Congress is facing challenges in states like West Bengal and Punjab, while regional parties like the BRS and YSRCP are maneuvering for advantage. 



The situation remains fluid, with further realignments expected. The outcome of the 2024 elections will depend largely on the ability of both alliances to effectively mobilize these crucial voter segments.</description>

			<description>Authors are calling for tech companies to obtain permission and compensate them for using copyrighted material to train AI models. Legal action is also being considered, alleging the use of "shadow libraries" containing pirated content for AI development.

Amazon's Prime Day saw a surge in smartphone and TV sales, with foldable and 5G enabled devices in high demand. 

TSMC has delayed its 4nm chip production at its Arizona facility by two years due to a shortage of skilled labor. The company plans to train US-based technicians to address the issue.</description>

			<description>A US judge has approved Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, rejecting the federal regulators' claims of potential harm to the gaming sector. Microsoft had pledged to make Activision Blizzard's popular "Call of Duty" accessible on platforms like Nintendo Switch and Nvidia's cloud gaming service for at least ten years. The ruling, despite criticism over a potential conflict of interest, allows the deal to proceed just before a $3 billion break-up fee would have been due.</description>

			<title>No. 3 is a crucial position and Shubman Gill is best suited for it</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-3-is-a-crucial-position-and-shubman-gill-is-best-suited-for-it/article67016152.ece</link>
			<description>This article explores the distinct roles and skill sets required of batsmen in different positions within a Test cricket team.  It highlights the importance of openers in assessing the pitch conditions, the middle order's role as the engine room capable of both defense and attack, and the crucial role of the No. 3 batsman as a link between the top and middle order, requiring adaptability and the ability to set the pace. 

The author argues for Shubman Gill's development as India's future No. 3 batsman, citing his strokes, defense, temperament, and potential to lead. It also touches upon the influence of white-ball cricket on positional fluidity in Test cricket, contrasting Greg Chappell's approach with the traditional preference for batsmen specializing in specific roles.</description>

			<description>This article describes a gathering of women at the home of a Kashmiri woman named Phuphee.  The women, coming from their village and beyond, find solace and healing in each other's company. They share their longing for things they cannot express openly – be it love, family or simply a moment to themselves. They sing, recite poetry, hold each other, and offer comfort through shared experiences and gestures like applying warm mustard oil to each other's scalps. Phuphee makes tehar, a turmeric rice dish, and kehwa, a cardamom tea, symbolizing their shared longing and the act of healing through simple acts of care and companionship. The article highlights the importance of female solidarity and the unspoken longings that women carry, emphasizing how sharing these burdens, however imperfectly, can create space for healing and connection.</description>

			<description>The increasing use of AI-powered mental health chatbots presents both opportunities and concerns. While a study suggests chatbots may provide better quality and empathetic responses compared to physicians, experts warn about potential risks. These include the simulation of empathy lacking genuine human connection, privacy violations, and the potential for data sharing with third parties. 


Google recently faced a $15.1 million lawsuit for patent infringement related to its discontinued music app, Google Play Music.  Additionally, technology companies, including Google, have lodged complaints with the FTC regarding alleged unfair practices by cloud vendors, particularly Microsoft.  They claim anti-competitive practices hinder customer switching and market competition.</description>

			<description>European Union regulators might compel Google to divest part of its advertising technology business due to concerns about its dominance. Google dominates the global digital ad market with a 28% market share and has faced scrutiny for its market power. The EU, frustrated by Google's failure to address these concerns, may issue a break-up order, a rare move by the competition enforcer.</description>

			<title>Political Line | The stories that make a nation</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-the-stories-that-make-a-nation/article66928253.ece</link>
			<description>The inauguration of India's new Parliament building was marked by political divide, with opposition parties boycotting the event. 

The installation of a sengol, a golden sceptre,  triggered debate as it symbolizes religious authority. The BJP framed the sengol as symbolic of power transfer from British to Congress rule, despite historical inaccuracies. Critics argue this move attempts to redefine Indian republicanism and undermines Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu. Academic Partha Chatterjee's "The Truths and Lies of Nationalism" provides insightful context on such historical narratives. 

Meanwhile, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma discussed the evolving identity politics in the Northeast, advocating for a multilingual state with Assamese as the lingua franca. A mural depicting the subcontinent in the new Parliament building has drawn criticism from Nepali politicians for its implications on territory claims. 

Finally, the Law Commission recommends retaining the sedition law despite its colonial origins, suggesting amendments for clarity.</description>

			<title>In the era of unicorns, there are few takers for Sudha Murty’s brand of simplicity</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/society/sudha-murty-simple-memes-and-jokes-the-kapil-sharma-show-india-aspirations/article66910610.ece</link>
			<description>Sudha Murty, the author and wife of N.R. Narayana Murthy, recently sparked a social media controversy after sharing anecdotes about her simple lifestyle on The Kapil Sharma Show. 

Murty recounted experiences of being mistaken for an economy passenger and jokingly suggesting 10 Downing Street as her address at Heathrow airport.  While often praised for her humility, these stories generated criticism, highlighting a generational shift where simplicity is no longer considered aspirational. 

The controversy stemmed from the erosion of trust in public personas, amplified by pervasive social media scrutiny and a culture of fact-checking. Murty's message of simplicity, while once widely appreciated, now appears outdated and even suspect in a world where wealth and extravagance are increasingly celebrated.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/fitness-and-adaptability-are-the-keys-how-about-the-dhoni-cup/article66913436.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of the IPL on Test cricket, arguing that modern cricketers' adaptability allows them to seamlessly transition between formats.  

It highlights how players like Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow have performed well in Tests after playing in the IPL, challenging the notion that it hinders preparation.

The piece also reflects on the legacy of MS Dhoni in the IPL and the emergence of Shubman Gill as a promising all-format batter. Finally, it suggests that India's Test team might explore innovative strategies like using Ishan Kishan as wicketkeeper or Jaydev Unadkat's inclusion in the bowling lineup.</description>

			<title>Kohli and Root — two contemporary greats and their different approaches</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/two-contemporary-greats-and-their-different-approaches/article66885145.ece</link>
			<description>The article explores the contrasting approaches of Joe Root and Virat Kohli to T20 cricket. While Kohli adapts his powerful strokeplay to the format, Root reinvents himself with a wider range of shots, often deemed unorthodox.

The author questions whether there are distinct styles of batting suited for different formats, likening Root's T20 play to "classical music played at the wrong speed."  Comparisons are drawn with Sunil Gavaskar's initial reluctance towards ODIs and his eventual success in the format, highlighting how great batsmen adapt to different challenges. 

Ultimately, the article suggests that  Root, like Kohli, is ultimately playing to his strengths, even if it means compromising elegance for effectiveness in the demanding world of T20 cricket.</description>

			<title>India deserve the money, but the ICC needs to work out a better system</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/india-deserve-the-money-but-the-icc-needs-to-work-out-a-better-system/article66857664.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ICC's revenue-sharing model and India's dominant position in cricket. It highlights how the initial power dynamics  were centered around England and Australia, later shifting to a financial model where India holds significant influence due to its massive market size and commercial value. 

The article criticizes the ICC's focus on rewarding  financial contributions, arguing that it neglects the development of the game in less wealthy nations. While acknowledging India's right to its share based on its financial input, the author stresses the need for a more balanced approach that promotes equitable growth within the cricketing world.</description>

			<description>An article discusses the prevalence of online opinions, fueled by social media's constant push for engagement.

Drawing on Jon Ronson's book "So You've Been Publicly Shamed," the author examines examples of individuals whose careers were derailed by online shaming and highlights the dangers of mob mentality.  The author concludes that the relentless cycle of online outrage has led to a deeper understanding of the limitations of personal opinions and the need for more thoughtful engagement with complex issues.</description>
