			<title>Judges and the people</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-judges-and-the-people/article68539776.ece</link>
			<description>The article examines the increasing politicization of judiciaries globally.  In Bangladesh, recent protests led to the resignation of the Chief Justice and other judges, highlighting the judiciary's vulnerability to political pressure. This trend is not unique to Bangladesh, as seen in the U.S. where judicial appointments often align with political affiliations, influencing rulings on politically charged issues like abortion rights.

The author explores the tension between judicial autonomy and public opinion, questioning whether a purely apolitical judiciary is truly feasible.  The article also touches upon debates in India regarding the Supreme Court's power to amend the Constitution and the perceived lack of transparency in judicial appointments. 

Finally, it uses examples from India and Bangladesh to illustrate how the concept of "traitor"  is often weaponized in political conflicts, further blurring the lines between law and politics.</description>

			<title>Column | Record of a princely wedding</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/record-of-a-princely-wedding-photo-album-mysore-palace/article68515408.ece</link>
			<description>This article examines a 100-year-old wedding album documenting the marriage of Yuvaraja Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the prince of Mysore. Taken in 1910, the album provides a fascinating glimpse into the opulent ceremony and the newly built Amba Vilas Palace, which was under construction at the time. 

The photographer skillfully used details and composition to tell the story of the wedding, showcasing not only the lavish festivities but also the cultural traditions of the era and the enduring power of the Wadiyar dynasty. The author draws a comparison between the richness of this printed album and the fleeting nature of digital memories, highlighting the enduring value of tangible historical documentation.</description>

			<title>Column | Feet of fortune</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece</link>
			<description>The practice of placing crowns with the deity's footprints on devotees' heads in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes a deeper connection to Hindu bhakti traditions.  Originally, bhakti didn't signify submission but participation in the divine's life. Temples, unlike places of meditation, were vibrant centers celebrating life,  where deities were treated as residents and involved in daily rituals and festivals. This devotion was supported by village grants known as deva bhoga. 

However, this movement coexisted with societal stratification based on purity, leading to instances of exclusion and segregation.  Depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi highlight the importance of contentment over the pursuit of fortune. The Vishnu narrative suggests that a humble mindset and acceptance of all, symbolized by the veneration of the feet, leads to true fortune.</description>

			<title>Neighbourhood tests India-U.S. ties</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-neighbourhood-tests-india-us-ties/article68512576.ece</link>
			<description>The recent turmoil in Bangladesh, with the U.S. seemingly supportive of a potential Islamist government, tests India-U.S. strategic alignment.  

 India and the U.S. have historically shared goals in countering China's influence, but the U.S. stance on Bangladesh raises concerns for India, as it tolerates actors against India's interests in the region. Both nations face challenges regarding trade restrictions on China, with evidence suggesting they may harm domestic innovation.  Internal dynamics in India, such as debates over caste-based quotas and immigration from Bangladesh, also highlight complexities in navigating both domestic and international issues.</description>

			<title>Unequal, and the more unequal</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision recognizes the unequal treatment faced by different SC groups,  despite existing quotas and schemes. 

The court cited the need for "substantive equality" and  drew parallels to the  'more backward' categories allowed for backward classes. Proponents argue that sub-categorization prioritizes those who need it most, while opponents fear it could further fragment already marginalized communities. The implementation of sub-categories will likely lead to new political dynamics and challenges.</description>

			<title>Column | Workplace friction and Disney+Hotstar’s ‘Hardly Working’</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hardly-working-by-naukri-workplace-friction-disney-hotstar/article68466162.ece</link>
			<description>The recent comedy special "Hardly Working" on Disney+Hotstar, featuring comedians who have worked in various corporate sectors,  highlights the growing dissatisfaction of young Indians with their work lives. 

The comedians' jokes center around common workplace grievances such as unnecessary meetings, stagnant salaries, abusive bosses, and lack of career progression. This shift in comedic focus, from the traditional "demanding spouse" to the "irate corporate boss," signals a cultural change. 

Numerous Indian TV shows and films also reflect this sentiment, showcasing the dark side of corporate culture. This widespread frustration underscores the bleak job market and  lack of fulfilling professional opportunities for young Indians.</description>
