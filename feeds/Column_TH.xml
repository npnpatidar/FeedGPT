			<description>US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley has ruled against blocking Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, citing a lack of evidence from federal regulators. The ruling comes just before the "break up" fee would have been imposed on Microsoft if the deal fell through. To address regulatory concerns, Microsoft has committed to making Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty accessible on other platforms, including Nintendo's Switch console and Nvidia's cloud gaming service, for at least ten years. Some critics have pointed out that Judge Corley's son works at Microsoft. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg's recent responses to Elon Musk's comments and actions have been seen as more mature, potentially improving Zunckerberg's reputation as the head of Meta. Meta's text-based conversation app Threads has garnered around 100 million sign-ups within a week of its launch, while Twitter users are facing tweet reading limits. Additionally, Amazon's vice president overseeing its applications group, Dilip Kumar, discussed how Amazon Web Services (AWS) aims to lower costs for clients working on generative AI, positioning itself against main competitors Microsoft and Google.</description>

			<description>European Union antitrust regulators are considering ordering Google to sell a part of its advertising technology business in an effort to reduce the tech giant's dominance in digital ads. Google currently holds a 28% market share of global ad revenue and has faced increasing scrutiny over its dominance in online advertising. The US Federal Trade Commission has also sought to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, citing concerns about potential changes in the company and competition in the cloud gaming market. In India, the Ministry of Health has denied reports of a data breach of COVID vaccination beneficiaries, stating that the claims are baseless and mischievous. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team has been asked to investigate the issue.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the contrasting approaches of cricketers Joe Root and Virat Kohli in T20 cricket. While Kohli stays true to his traditional techniques and emphasizes playing his own game, Root is reinventing himself as a T20 player and exploring new shots.

It also highlights the importance of playing to one's strengths and compensating for weaknesses in order to succeed. Root's determination to play in the T20 World Cup is mentioned, suggesting that he is willing to adapt and not necessarily prioritize elegance in his batting style.</description>

			<title>India deserve the money, but the ICC needs to work out a better system</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/india-deserve-the-money-but-the-icc-needs-to-work-out-a-better-system/article66857664.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the financial dynamics within the International Cricket Council (ICC) and how money has become the basis of power within the organization. In 2014, England, Australia, and India proposed a revenue-sharing model that favored them over other countries. This model has been proposed again for the cycle of 2024-2027, where India would take home the largest portion of the surplus revenue. The article argues that while self-interest is understandable, the ICC should prioritize the growth of the game and ensure that the money is used for the development of cricket. Currently, the countries that need the funding the most are receiving the least amount.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the ability of various animals, including humans, to recognize themselves in a mirror. It explains that the "Mirror test" is often used to determine self-recognition, where a mark is placed on the subject's face and their reaction is observed. The article mentions that even young children show signs of self-recognition around 18 months of age. It then introduces a study conducted on bluestreak cleaner wrasse fish, which also showed signs of self-recognition.

			<title>Today’s Cache | Battery from nuclear waste to power space missions</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/battery-from-nuclear-waste-to-power-space-missions-todays-cache/article66238519.ece</link>
			<description>Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA) are developing batteries made of Americium, a nuclear waste material, to power space missions. The technology is expected to be developed by the end of the decade and will be used for missions in areas where solar power is limited, such as the dark side of the Moon or far-off regions of the Solar System. The batteries will be encapsulated in layers to ensure safety, and Americium will be extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel to make fuel pellets for the batteries. Americium is cheaper, more abundant, and has a longer half-life compared to the currently used plutonium-238 batteries. The ESA has approved a funding of $30 million for the battery system, and plans to launch Americium-based power sources in moon missions in the early 2030s. The technology is also of interest to NASA for its Artemis program.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/chatgpt-open-a-new-search-paradigm-todays-cache/article66233972.ece</link>
			<description>OpenAI has introduced its large language model (LLM) ChatGPT, which allows users to interact with it using natural language. The chatbot not only answers questions but also corrects codes in computer programs. While there are limitations to the chatbot's responses, it has the potential to fundamentally change the way we search the web. OpenAI's chatbot is built on GPT 3.5 architecture and is powered by Microsoft's cloud. The chatbot could be monetized in the future, and there may be a need for a watermark solution to prevent misuse of its capabilities.</description>

			<description>This article tells the story of K. Thiruvengadasivasamy, or KTS, who was the deputy vice chancellor-cum-cook at a fake university in California. When the author was invited to speak at the university, KTS offered financial incentives for the author to come to the university. However, the author suggested that the university open a campus in India instead, which led to a signing of an agreement between the university and the government of Uttar Pradesh. Unfortunately, it was later discovered that the university was fake, leaving KTS in a difficult situation. KTS then joined the Bharat Jodo Yatra (BJY), an initiative by the Congress party to promote fitness in India. Through participating in the yatra, KTS lost 55kg and shared that India as a whole has collectively shed a significant amount of weight through the yatra. The author concludes the article by emphasizing the inspiring nature of political leaders promoting fitness and encourages others to walk more in 2023.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as OpenAI's chatbot, GPT-3.5, and Prisma Labs' Lensa AI. GPT-3.5 is a language model that can answer text questions and fix programming codes. It is trained on a variety of data sources such as social media posts, Wikipedia, and news articles. On the other hand, Lensa AI is an app that uses a machine learning model to create artistic portrait images based on selfie photographs. However, the app has faced criticism for using digital images scraped from the web without giving credit or payment to the original artists. Despite these concerns, Lensa AI has gained popularity and achieved the top spot in Apple's app store. The app offers advanced editing features but also raises privacy concerns as it collects user data and grants the app rights to user content.</description>

			<title>Today’s Cache | Elon Musk picks a quarrel with Tim Cook</title>

			<description>Elon Musk's recent quarrel with Apple is causing trouble for his platform, Twitter. Musk has been making changes on Twitter since purchasing the platform, including laying off half the staff, which led to voluntary resignations and advertisers leaving. In an attempt to keep the platform active, Musk reinstated former President Donald Trump's account and launched a paid blue verification tick mark. However, the launch did not go smoothly, and the service had to be relaunched. It is speculated that Apple's 30% app tax played a role in delaying the relaunch, as Musk would have to pay a third of his earnings from selling blue tick marks to Apple. Musk publicly criticized Apple's app store in-app purchase policy, calling it a "hidden 30% tax on the internet." He also claimed that Apple has stopped advertising on Twitter and threatened to withhold the platform from its app store, though Apple has not publicly responded.</description>

			<title>Today’s Cache | Twitter’s anti-propaganda team grapples with Chinese spam accounts on lockdown protests</title>

			<description>China is experiencing anti-lockdown protests as citizens oppose the country's zero-covid policy. According to a report by Washington Post, China's state-backed accounts are spamming hashtags on Twitter, including hashtags related to protests. Twitter staff are trying to fight back against this stream of spam, particularly targeting city names such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and Lanzhou. The protests have been fueled by issues such as confusion surrounding hiring, mass quarantines, worker bonuses, and lockdowns as part of China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19. Some protestors have been sharing videos online to raise awareness about their situation. It is noted that Twitter's staff has significantly decreased in number following mass layoffs and resignations after Elon Musk took over the platform. Activists and researchers have expressed concerns about the impact this reduced manpower may have on handling spam and ensuring access to vital information during anti-regime protests.</description>

The feedback from these video reviewers is used to train the company's AI camera system that monitors the stowing process in the warehouses. Reviewers are paid low wages and are expected to watch thousands of videos per day, leading to physical problems and high-stress targets. Amazon claims that its system is 95% accurate and that reviewers are encouraged to take breaks. The report is based on interviews with current and former Amazon employees.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jiocinema-chokes-in-its-maiden-stream-of-fifa-world-cup-2022/article66163923.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the frustration of Indian football fans with the JioCinema app, which is the only way to watch the FIFA World Cup in India for free. Users complained about buffering issues and missed goals during live streaming. The article explains that streaming involves a series of steps including compression, encoding, segmentation, and distribution through a content distribution network (CDN). If the CDN is not functioning properly, it can cause streaming issues. If the app does not fix its CDN issue, users may switch to traditional set-top boxes to watch the rest of the World Cup.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in a $44 billion deal has resulted in increased wealth for the platform's former owners and bosses. However, the article highlights that stakeholders, including employees, were not given enough consideration during the deal-making process. The lack of a deal to benefit employees is criticized, particularly noting that allocating a small percentage of the monetary gains to employee protection could have provided financial support for those who were let go after the deal's closing. The article emphasizes the importance of considering stakeholders and delivering long-term value to customers, employees, and communities.</description>

			<title>Meta Quest Pro VR users need almost five hours to read its privacy policy: report</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-virtual-reality-users-need-almost-five-hours-read-privacy-policy-mozilla-report/article66144169.ece</link>
			<description>Mozilla researchers have discovered that it would take hours to read through the privacy policy for Meta's new Quest Pro VR headset. In Mozilla's 'Privacy Not Included' guide, it was noted that big tech companies like Meta, Verizon, and Amazon release lengthy privacy policies for their devices, some of which run for tens of thousands of words. The researchers estimated that it would take around four hours and fifty minutes to read all the privacy documents associated with the Meta Quest Pro. Mozilla suggested that the overwhelming volume of documents could be used to pressure users into quickly agreeing to the terms, potentially allowing their data to be collected and sold to external parties.</description>

			<title>In sport, you often learn more from a defeat than from a victory</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/in-sport-you-often-learn-more-from-a-defeat-than-from-a-victory/article67480900.ece</link>
			<description>This article discusses the benefits of early defeat in a World Cup tournament. It suggests that losing early can rid a team of complacency, highlight weaknesses, motivate players, and improve team selection. The article mentions that Australia, despite starting with two defeats, now looks like one of the favorites in the tournament. On the other hand, England, the reigning champions, are currently at the bottom of the table, putting their qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy in jeopardy. India, on the other hand, has won all their matches convincingly and is considered a strong candidate to go through undefeated. The article emphasizes that successful teams learn from defeat and disappointment, and that there are lessons to be learned from both victory and defeat. It also warns against the temptation to hold onto a once-victorious team, as England is currently facing, and suggests that India may face similar problems in the future if they don't learn from England's mistakes. The article concludes by stating that there are lessons to be learned from both defeat and victory, but it is important to learn the right ones.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-the-stories-that-make-a-nation/article66928253.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the installation of a golden sceptre, called sengol, in India's new Parliament building. The opposition parties boycotted the inauguration, and The Hindu editorial criticized the move as an attempt to reimagine India's founding principles. The BJP has embellished the event, linking it to the transfer of power from British rule to Congress. However, this claim lacks historical basis. The article also highlights the BJP's attempt to undermine Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu by appropriating a Saivite sect. The author suggests that the official narrative will overshadow the facts over time. Additionally, the article covers other political topics such as Assam's changing linguistic landscape, north-south divide in politics, criticism of a mural in Parliament, delimitation of Lok Sabha seats, and the retention of sedition laws.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/column-saba-mahjoor-an-accidental-cruelty-miscarriage/article67441949.ece</link>
			<description>The article tells the story of a woman named Masarat who suffered repeated miscarriages and faced social stigma in her village. The author, reflecting on her own experience of miscarriage, recalls how Masarat's ordeal affected her. One day, Masarat had a miscarriage and refused to go to the hospital.

When Masarat's mother believed her daughter had died, Phuphee explained that she wanted her to understand the pain of loss. Despite questioning her actions, Phuphee believed it was easier to bear the mother's grief than to face Masarat's death.

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the democratization of diplomacy and the increasing influence of public opinion on strategic decision-making in India and other democracies. It highlights the rise of populism and its impact on governance, emphasizing the contradictory calls for centralization and decentralization in governance prescriptions. In India, populism aligns with the deep state, military, and security apparatus, advocating for India to become a superpower and endorsing military spending and aggression. On the other hand, Western populism primarily opposes the national security apparatus and criticizes unending wars conducted by elite strategists. The article also mentions the challenges faced by strategists in dealing with assertive public opinion on international relations. It references Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to balance India's positions in conflicts, despite pressure from his supporters who demand unwavering support for Israel. The article concludes by discussing the questioning of traditional approaches to conflicts by the public and the power of people's movements in shaping political outcomes.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-big-picture-brownwashing-conservative-politics-in-the-us-and-the-uk/article67364991.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the emergence of Vivek Ramaswamy and Suella Braverman as prominent leaders in conservative politics in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.

			<description>The article tells a story about Phuphee, a wise woman who helps her neighbor Bashir with his troubled cows. Phuphee suggests two solutions: slaughtering the cows or performing a ritual involving reading verses from the Quran. However, it is later revealed that Phuphee didn't actually curse the cows but instead advised Bashir's wife to milk them when he sleeps and let them loose, making him think they were cursed. The article highlights the importance of offering help that empowers individuals to make their own decisions rather than controlling or manipulating them. Phuphee's wisdom is compared to her cooking, appearing simple but requiring a lifetime of mastery.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Reversing democracy for stability</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-reversing-democracy-for-stability/article67266927.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of 'one nation, one election' proposed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. The idea is to have simultaneous polling for Parliament, State Assemblies, and local bodies every five years. Proponents argue that this approach would reduce election expenses, minimize disruptions to government officials and development work, and prevent hung Assemblies and unstable governments. However, critics argue that this proposal restricts the fundamental freedom of expression in a democracy, as voting is a crucial aspect of democratic rights. They also highlight the diversity of India and the importance of accommodating multiple parties and opinions. Additionally, the article touches on the ongoing ethnic conflict between the Kuki and Meitei communities in Manipur and the challenges faced by smaller tribes in being identified as either Kuki or Naga. The author warns that the 'one nation, one election' concept may jeopardize the expansion and deepening of Indian democracy.</description>

The article calls for a shift in perspective, encouraging adults to consider the well-being and growth of children rather than just seeking convenience for themselves.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the realignment of political parties in India, particularly in preparation for the 2024 elections. The author notes that those not aligned with the Congress party are effectively supporting the BJP. Two major alliances were formed recently, one endorsing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the other vowing to defeat him. The Opposition parties formed an alliance called the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), indicating their recognition of a need to contest the BJP on nationalist grounds. The NDA gathering, which supported Modi, included parties with little voter base, suggesting an attempt to show that the BJP is not isolated. The article also highlights the focus of both alliances on securing subaltern votes, particularly from OBCs and Dalits. The BJP has successfully captured this space, leaving no visible subaltern leaders or parties. The article further mentions various political equations being disrupted across different states, as parties navigate new alliances and rivalries. It concludes by discussing topics such as sexual violence in Manipur, language instruction in schools, and the question of delimitation in the redrawing of constituency boundaries.</description>

			<title>Political Line | Big Picture: Five vantage points of opposition to Narendra Modi</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/big-picture-five-vantage-points-of-opposition-to-narendra-modi-political-line/article66687763.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the various strands of opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. It highlights five different vantage points from which opposition groups approach their stance against the BJP.

Firstly, regional elites, such as the DMK in Tamil Nadu and the TMC in West Bengal, can align with either the BJP or the Congress depending on the situation. They negotiate with both parties but currently view the BJP as a bigger threat to their interests.

Secondly, Arvind Kejriwal of the AAP represents an apolitical opposition to the BJP. Although he doesn't oppose the Hindutva agenda, he openly declares war on Prime Minister Modi. Kejriwal focuses on governance as a service delivery platform and can adapt to different ideological settings.

The third vantage point is dominated by middle castes in the Hindutva heartland, such as the Yadavs and Jats. Parties like the SP, RJD, and RLD represent this group, which views both the Congress and BJP with suspicion. They oppose the upper caste prominence within the Hindutva ideology.

Constitutional liberals constitute the fourth vantage point. They focus on principles of constitutional liberalism, individual rights, and the integrity of institutions. While they are opposed to the BJP, they also have reservations about the other opposition vantage points. The Congress and the Left are principal rivals in some states.

Lastly, religious minorities, including Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians, form the fifth vantage point. They may support their own parties or join hands with other opposition groups. Overall, the BJP is seen as a bigger enemy than the Congress, but there are still many contradictions and differences within the opposition.

The interplay between these vantage points will determine the strength and scope of the opposition to the BJP in the upcoming 2024 elections.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, plans to make the platform's algorithm open source. This means that the rules governing how content and ads are presented to users will be accessible to the broader developer community. While Musk has not provided an update on when the algorithm will be available to developers, he believes that making it open source will lead to rapid improvement. Twitter, with its relatively large number of highly engaged users, attracted Musk despite its smaller user base and lower profitability compared to Facebook. The article also discusses the history of free and open-source software (FOSS), highlighting Red Hat Inc.'s success in providing open-source software products to enterprise clients. The author suggests that Musk can learn from Red Hat's example and build a new open-source business model for Twitter, but acknowledges that this journey will take time and require Musk to make interest payments on his loans.</description>

			<description>The article reflects on the author's experience of feeling a sense of loss and restlessness upon the death of someone they didn't know well. The author describes their relationship with Aunty Nusrat, a family acquaintance who would always attend gatherings and show warmth towards them. They explain how over time, seeing Aunty Nusrat became an expectation and a habit at family events. However, during a cousin's engagement party, the author couldn't find her and later learned that she had passed away. The author reflects on their mixed emotions, feeling restless but not deeply distressed by the loss. They compare their feelings to a painting that has disappeared, leaving only an impression behind. The author discusses their confusion about why they are experiencing these emotions when they weren't close to Aunty Nusrat. In a conversation with Phuphee, they express their surprise and describe themselves as feeling like a fraud. Phuphee responds with an analogy, comparing human connections to trees in a forest, emphasizing that even distant relationships can have an impact on us. She explains that grieving doesn't follow specific rules and that it is normal to feel the way the author does. The author reflects on how Phuphee's words have given them permission to grieve when experiencing loss, whether it be from those close or far away.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent Golden Globe award won by 61-year-old actress Jennifer Coolidge for her role in "The White Lotus." It highlights how this win not only recognizes Coolidge's talent but also represents a golden moment for older women in general. The narrative surrounding older women often focuses on their invisibility, but the article argues that older women are actually living their best lives. Liberated from societal expectations and with financial security, women over 50 are enjoying their time and pursuing their interests. The author reflects on Coolidge's acceptance speech, finding inspiration in her refusal to conform and her embrace of self-expression. The article also mentions another significant moment at the Golden Globe awards when 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh won an award and was celebrated by her colleague Jamie Lee Curtis. The real power of older women is seen not just in their freedom from the male gaze but in the support they find within female friendships. The author concludes by emphasizing that life and work are not zero-sum games, and there are always opportunities for reinvention and growth.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses India's draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (DPDP) of 2022, which has sparked intense debate. Critics argue that the bill gives the government too much power to collect data and infringe on individual privacy. The draft emphasizes state authority over data, including trade-related issues. Retired Justice B. N. Srikrishna believes the proposed regulator will lack independence and act as a puppet of the government. However, junior minister for IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, disagrees and states that the Data Protection Board will be independent. Despite concerns about state control, some see it as preferable to unregulated private entities having unrestricted access to data. The article also briefly touches on caste dynamics in Bihar, border tensions between India and China, and the elevation of Tamil music by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.</description>

When the owner slaughtered the cow years later, they discovered that her heart had five holes in it, representing each lost calf. The narrator then recounts an incident at a wedding where a woman named Farhana, who was unable to have children and faced social stigma, showed up uninvited. The other women at the wedding avoided her, causing her to leave. Later, the narrator's companion, Phuphee, reflects on the story of the cow and emphasizes the struggles women face and the need to support and uplift one another.

			<title>Political Line | Hardik, Alpesh, Dimple, Kedar: caste tales from Gujarat, U.P., Bihar</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/political-line-hardik-alpesh-dimple-kedar-caste-tales-from-gujarat-up-bihar/article66248561.ece</link>
			<description>This article discusses the transformation of the Bharata Janata Party (BJP) under Narendra Modi's leadership and its ability to incorporate different caste identities. The BJP, under Mr. Modi, has managed to restrain dominant castes such as Patels in Gujarat, Marathas in Maharashtra, and Jats in U.P. and Haryana, by aggregating several minor caste groups. Previously, the Patel community controlled the BJP in Gujarat, but Mr. Modi successfully faced challenges from them. Ahead of the 2017 elections, Hardik Patel, a Patel leader, demanded OBC (Other Backward Classes) status for the community and later joined the Congress party. However, in 2022, he switched to the BJP and won as a candidate. Similarly, Alpesh Thakore, an OBC leader who opposed Patel's demand for reservations, also joined and won as a BJP candidate.

The article highlights the conflicting positions on caste quotas held by both Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakore, who are now BJP MLAs. The BJP managed to bring them together by utilizing state power, and both individuals faced police cases, realizing that opposing the BJP was risky. While some communities within the BJP may not be entirely satisfied with the space and power they hold, the BJP has contained their discontent for now. This situation is comparable to the Jats in Uttar Pradesh, who initially opposed the BJP but ended up voting for the party in large numbers.

The article also touches upon the political dynamics in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Janata Dal (United) (JDU) claim to champion the cause of OBCs but faced defeat in recent by-elections. The BJP's victory in these bypolls indicates that the alliance between the RJD and JDU is not effectively working on the ground.

In addition to the political analysis, the article briefly mentions the struggle of reviving the Meetei Mayek script in Manipur. The script was replaced by the Bengali script in the 18th century, but language activism is now pushing for its revival.

Overall, the article highlights the BJP's ability to navigate caste dynamics and bring together conflicting interest groups, as well as shedding light on political developments in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.</description>

			<title>Political Line | The Prime Minister’s political messaging, border disputes, electioneering in Gujarat and more</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-the-prime-ministers-political-messaging-border-disputes-electioneering-in-gujarat-and-more/article66184936.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses two recent events in which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to the Tamil and Assamese linguistic and cultural groups. In Assam, the BJP has gained significant support, while in Tamil Nadu, the party aims to expand its presence. The Prime Minister addressed a group of Tamils in Varanasi, emphasizing the connection between Kashi and Tamil Nadu and celebrating Tamil culture. This move seeks to address criticism that the BJP undermines Tamil Nadu's cultural identity. Additionally, Mr. Modi participated in an event organized by Himanta Biswa Sarma to commemorate a 16th-century Ahom army general in Assam. By retelling the story of Assamese pride, the Prime Minister reinforces the idea of Assamese exceptionalism and resistance to outside influences. The article also briefly mentions ongoing border disputes between Assam and Meghalaya, as well as Karnataka and Maharashtra. Finally, the author reflects on the changing dynamics of politics in Gujarat, where Gujarati sub-nationalism blended with Hindutva has been weakened by the rise of Modi and Amit Shah in national politics.</description>
