			<title>What does spaceflight do to the human body? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-does-spaceflight-do-to-the-human-body-explained/article68571578.ece</link>
			<description>Hundreds of astronauts have flown to space, revealing trends in how spaceflight affects the human body.  Microgravity causes bones to weaken, potentially leading to kidney stones.  Digestive issues can occur, and about 70% of astronauts on long-duration missions develop spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), which impacts eyesight. 

The heart, muscles, and blood also undergo changes in response to the space environment.  While exercise regimes and routines help mitigate these effects, researchers continue to investigate the long-term impacts of radiation exposure, confined environments, and the unique conditions of space.  

Innovative studies like the 'Twins Study' and the development of space omics tools are shedding light on how the body adapts to space, paving the way for countermeasures and a deeper understanding of human health in extreme environments. As missions become longer and venture farther into space, these findings are crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of future astronauts.</description>

			<title>What did Justice Verma panel say on death penalty for rape? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/what-did-justice-verma-panel-say-on-death-penalty-for-rape-explained/article68566587.ece</link>
			<description>Following the horrific rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, calls for the death penalty have intensified. This incident reignites the debate around the Justice J.S. Verma Committee recommendations, which opposed capital punishment for rape, even in extreme cases. The committee, formed after the 2012 Delhi gang rape, argued that the death penalty was not a deterrent and that reformation should be prioritized.

While the 2013 amendments introduced death penalty for certain aggravated rape cases, the Verma Committee's core stance on capital punishment for rape remained untouched. They did, however, recommend harsher sentences for rape, including life imprisonment, and advocated for the removal of marital rape exemption, a recommendation the government did not adopt. The committee emphasized the need for broader societal changes to empower women and address gender bias.</description>

			<title>Will Malayalam film industry report lead to changes?</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/will-malayalam-film-industry-report-lead-to-changes/article68562114.ece</link>
			<description>The Hema Committee report, examining issues in the Malayalam film industry, revealed a dark side with widespread sexual exploitation,  illegal bans, and poor working conditions. 

The report, released after years of delay, confirmed the existence of a "casting couch" and documented incidents of assault and intimidation. It highlighted the industry's control by a powerful "male mafia" who could silence victims through bans and cyberattacks. The report also exposed the exploitation of junior artistes, who faced meagre pay and inadequate facilities. The committee recommended legal action and urged the creation of a tribunal to address these issues.</description>

			<title>Why is lateral entry policy under scrutiny?</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-is-lateral-entry-policy-under-scrutiny/article68562127.ece</link>
			<description>In 2023, the UPSC advertised lateral recruitment for 45 posts at senior levels, sparking controversy.  This led to criticism as reservation benefits, applicable to government job recruitment, were not considered for these “single post” appointments.  

Lateral entry has been endorsed by NITI Aayog and previously suggested by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission to bring specialized expertise into government service. While the aim is to augment human resources and bring fresh talent, concerns have been raised about its potential to undermine reservation policies. 

The controversy highlights the ongoing debate surrounding lateral entry and its implications for diversity and representation in government services.</description>

			<title>Why is sanction for prosecution needed?</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-is-sanction-for-prosecution-needed/article68562121.ece</link>
			<description>The Karnataka Governor's approval to investigate Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for alleged land irregularities has sparked debate regarding the legal and constitutional implications of sanctioning prosecution against public servants. 

Sanctioning prosecution for public servants is a mandatory requirement under both the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). While the CrPC generally gives sanction authority to the State or Central government, the PCA allows for broader applications. Historically, the Governor has been seen as the authority to grant sanction in cases involving a Chief Minister, as they possess the power to dismiss them. The Supreme Court has upheld the Governor's discretion in such matters, emphasizing that they should act independently of the Council of Ministers' advice.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/paetongtarn-shinawatra-rise-of-the-scion/article68563429.ece</link>
			<description>Paetongtarn Shinawatra, at 38 years old, became Thailand's youngest and second female Prime Minister on August 18, 2023.  Following in the footsteps of her father, Thaksin, and aunt, Yingluck, both former Prime Ministers, Paetongtarn formally entered politics in 2021. Before politics, she was involved in her family's business ventures. Her path to Prime Minister included a  coalition government formation, the dismissal of the initial PTP nominee Srettha Thavisin, and a swift vote of confidence from the newly elected Senate.  Despite this, Paetongtarn faces numerous challenges, including a divided Parliament, a complex judiciary, and economic concerns, while also striving to establish her own legacy separate from her family's political history.</description>

			<title>Women in Cinema Collective | The fight for a gender-balanced workplace</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/women-in-cinema-collective-the-fight-for-a-gender-balanced-workplace/article68563412.ece</link>
			<description>The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) is a group formed in 2017 after an actress was allegedly assaulted in Kerala. The collective advocates for women's rights and safety in the Malayalam film industry.  A government report, released in 2024, confirmed the widespread issue of sexual exploitation and discrimination faced by women in the industry. 

The WCC has faced criticism and backlash for their outspoken stance, with some members resigning from industry associations in protest. Despite challenges, they have achieved legal victories, including a ruling mandating Internal Complaints Committees in film production houses. The collective continues to work towards a safer and more equitable film industry, partnering with organizations and undertaking independent projects.</description>

			<title>Ladki Bahin : A look at cash transfer schemes for women in seven states</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ladki-bahin-a-look-at-womens-cash-transfer-scheme-in-seven-states/article68557741.ece</link>
			<description>Various Indian states have launched direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes providing monthly financial aid to women. Maharashtra's Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, offering ₹1,500 per month to women with annual family income below ₹2.5 lakh, is one such example.  This initiative comes amid anticipation of state elections.  Other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Delhi, and West Bengal, have implemented similar schemes with varying amounts, eligibility criteria, and focus areas. These programs aim to empower women economically, improve their decision-making power, and enhance their overall well-being. 


Despite the positive impact of these schemes, challenges remain, including low digital and financial literacy among women, limited access to banking services, and restrictive social norms. 


India continues to strive to bridge the gender gap in financial inclusion through such DBT initiatives.</description>

			<title>Since Chandrayaan-3, what has India’s space programme been up to? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/since-chandrayaan-3-what-has-the-indian-space-programme-been-up-to-explained/article68554417.ece</link>
			<description>Since its successful Chandrayaan-3 mission, ISRO has been busy with several projects.  The Aditya-L1 solar mission reached its destination at the Lagrangian point L1, where it observed a solar storm.  

ISRO conducted abort tests for its Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission, with plans to launch an uncrewed Gaganyaan mission later this year. Four astronaut candidates are currently training for spaceflight, with Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla and Group Captain Prashanth Nair chosen as the prime and backup crews for the first Gaganyaan mission to the International Space Station in 2025.

ISRO plans to create a new Indian space station, Bharatiya Antariksh Station, by 2035, and is developing a new launch vehicle, the NGLV, for heavier payloads.  In the meantime, the PSLV and GSLV rockets continue to launch satellites. Prime Minister Modi declared August 23rd as National Space Day to commemorate  ISRO's success with Chandrayaan-3. ISRO is also prioritizing research and development, focusing on new technologies and collaborating with private companies to advance India's space program.  India has also made strides in its space policies and regulations, with new licenses and relaxed FDI rules encouraging greater private sector participation.</description>

			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ten-ex-cms-who-were-hurt-by-their-ouster-and-rebelled/article68549345.ece</link>
			<description>This article discusses former Chief Ministers in India who have been ousted from their positions and their subsequent actions. It provides specific examples of how each CM was removed from office (e.g.,  due to disagreements with party leadership, health issues, or loss of public support), and highlights their subsequent political moves, which often include joining rival parties or forming their own. Some examples include N.T. Rama Rao, who was removed from his party due to alleged interference by his wife, and  Jitan Ram Manjhi, who resigned from his party and formed his own after being pressured to step down. The article explores the reasons behind these political maneuvers and the subsequent impact on the political landscape.</description>

			<title>What is vaccine-derived polio, and what are the available vaccines against poliovirus? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/what-is-vaccine-derived-polio-and-what-are-the-available-vaccines-against-poliovirus-explained/article68550340.ece</link>
			<description>A two-year-old child in Meghalaya has been diagnosed with vaccine-derived polio (VDPV). This is a rare condition that occurs when the weakened poliovirus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and causes paralysis. 

The child was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis and officials are on high alert. OPV, though effective, carries a risk of VDPV, particularly with the type 2 strain. The World Health Organization has declared wild poliovirus type 2 eradicated, but cases of  VDPV remain a concern. India had shifted to a bivalent OPV in 2016 to  prevent type 2 VDPV, but outbreaks have continued to increase. A newer, genetically modified type 2 oral polio vaccine with a lower risk of reversion is now being used.</description>

			<title>What are some new research projects in the field of ‘smart’ insulin? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/diabetes-insulin-research-new-research-projects-in-the-field-of-smart-insulin/article68528434.ece</link>
			<description>The Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge awarded over £2.7 million in grants to six international research projects focused on developing next-generation insulins.  These projects aim to address limitations of current insulin therapy, such as frequent injections and the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  

Four projects focus on glucose-responsive insulins (GRIs) that release insulin only when blood glucose levels are high, preventing both high and low blood sugar. Other projects involve developing a short-acting insulin with immediate effect and a combination of insulin and glucagon to stabilize blood sugar.  


The research, conducted at universities in the United States, Australia, and China, utilizes various innovative approaches including nanotechnology and studies on cone snail venom to improve insulin delivery and effectiveness.</description>

			<title>Can blood tests for cancer save more lives? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/blood-tests-for-cancer-could-save-more-lives/article68547977.ece</link>
			<description>Cancer is a major public health concern in India, with a high incidence and mortality rate. Early detection is crucial for improving survival outcomes. While organised screening programs exist in many developed countries, India lags behind in this area. 

However, advancements in liquid biopsy technology offer hope. Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can detect signals from early-stage cancers, including those currently lacking recommended screening methods.  These tests have shown promise in detecting additional cancer cases that traditional methods might miss.  

While MCED tests are not yet FDA approved, some are available in India as laboratory-developed tests.  They offer a potentially transformative approach to cancer screening, but it is important to be aware of potential challenges like false positives and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Comprehensive patient support and clear communication with healthcare providers are essential to navigate the complexities of MCED testing.</description>

			<title>Lateral entry for government posts | Explained</title>

			<description>The UPSC advertisement, withdrawn shortly after issuing, sought to fill 45 posts across 24 ministries through lateral entry - recruiting experts from outside the usual bureaucratic setup.  The posts included joint secretary and director/deputy secretary roles in areas like emerging technologies, cybersecurity, climate change, and education.  The application was open to both private and public sector employees, with appointments made on a contract or deputation basis. The move sparked controversy as the opposition alleged it circumvented reservation policies, raising concerns about equity and social justice. They pointed to the lack of reservation for SC, ST, OBC, and EWS candidates in these lateral entry roles. This  follows criticism faced by the government earlier regarding the alleged reduction of reservation-based posts in other government sectors.</description>

			<title>A change in India’s power export rules | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-change-in-indias-power-export-rules-explained/article68544254.ece</link>
			<description>India recently amended its power export rules, allowing exporters to reroute power to the domestic grid if payments are delayed from partner countries. This change comes after reports that Bangladesh, a significant buyer of Indian power, may be facing financial difficulties and delays in payments. Adani Power's Godda plant in India, which supplies all its power to Bangladesh, has stated its commitment to the existing contract despite the amendment. 

Bangladesh relies on imported power, with India’s Godda plant contributing a substantial portion. However, the country faces internal issues like overcapacity and fuel scarcity, leading to underutilization of power plants.  Analysts believe the amendment provides flexibility to Indian exporters and mitigates risks associated with payment delays. Despite concerns, experts suggest the immediate impact of a potential supply stoppage from India would be limited, as Bangladesh has alternative power sources.</description>
