			<title>Lateral entry for government posts | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lateral-entry-for-ias-posts-what-is-the-proposal-and-why-it-has-sparked-controversy-explained/article68542248.ece</link>
			<description>The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has issued an advertisement seeking  lateral entry hires for  45 posts across 24 ministries.  These roles include joint secretary, director, and deputy secretary positions in areas such as emerging technologies, environment policy, cybersecurity, and education.  Applicants from both the private and public sectors are eligible, with appointments on a contract or deputation basis. The program, implemented by the Modi government in 2018, aims to bring in domain experts and skilled individuals. However, the move has triggered criticism from the opposition, who allege it bypasses reservation policies and benefits the RSS.</description>

			<title>A change in India’s power export rules | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-change-in-indias-power-export-rules-explained/article68544254.ece</link>
			<description>India recently amended its power export rules, allowing exporters to reroute electricity to its domestic grid if there are payment delays from partner countries. This amendment comes amidst concerns over delayed payments from Bangladesh, the primary recipient of power from Adani Power's Godda plant in Jharkhand.  India's first transnational power project, Adani Power supplies 1,496 MW to Bangladesh under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). 

However, Bangladesh faces overcapacity issues and power constraints due to fuel and gas shortages. Despite this, delays in payments from the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) to Adani Power have been a recurring issue. Experts believe the regulatory change provides flexibility to power exporters and mitigates risks associated with external market instability.</description>

			<title>Why is SEBI’s credibility under a cloud? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/why-is-sebi-credibility-under-a-cloud/article68537409.ece</link>
			<description>Hindenburg Research accused SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch of conflict of interest due to her and her husband's past investment in a fund linked to Adani Group.  Buch responded by stating that the investment was made before she joined SEBI and the fund did not invest in Adani Group, confirming details to SEBI and tax authorities.  

SEBI maintained it has disclosed required holdings and Buch has recused herself from potential conflicts.  They asserted 23 of 24  investigations regarding Adani Group are complete,  with the last nearing completion. The Adani Group insisted on the transparency of its overseas holding structure and pointed out the fund's connection to a former Adani director. 

Hindenburg continues to question Buch's role and SEBI's approach, citing potential breach of policy for income from consulting firms during her SEBI tenure and a lack of recusal from a case involving a company with Blackstone ties. SEBI remains silent while the Finance Ministry keeps a stoic stance.</description>

			<title>Manda Krishna: Rebel with a cause</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/manda-krishna-rebel-with-a-cause/article68537522.ece</link>
			<description>Manda Krishna, founder of the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS), is a lifelong advocate for sub-categorization of Scheduled Castes. His movement started three decades ago in a small village in Andhra Pradesh and gained momentum through rallies, marches, and protests.  Despite facing opposition from rival groups and legal hurdles, Krishna persistently fought for the cause, leading to landmark moments like the government issuing orders for SC categorization and the Supreme Court's recent historic verdict allowing sub-categorization for reservations and employment.   He has gained immense support from the Madiga community and emerged as a powerful figure in the movement for social justice.</description>

			<title>Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh: Return of the Islamists</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jamaat-e-islami-bangladesh-return-of-the-islamists/article68537482.ece</link>
			<description>The article discusses the history and current political situation of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (JeI Bangladesh). It highlights the JeI's evolution from its origins in Pakistan to its emergence as a political force in Bangladesh, noting its changing alliances and positions on key issues.  

The article focuses on the JeI's role in Bangladesh's liberation war and its subsequent crackdown by the Sheikh Hasina government. It details the 1971 Demra massacre, the JeI's  leader Motiur Rahman Nizami's execution, and the JeI's subsequent shift towards social media outreach and university activism.  

The recent protests against Ms. Hasina are framed as a form of revenge by the JeI for Nizami's execution, comparing the current situation to the 1990 movement against military rule, where the JeI allied with opposition groups.</description>

			<title>How an Iranian group used ChatGPT to influence U.S. presidential election</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-an-iranian-group-used-chatgpt-to-attempt-to-influence-us-presidential-election/article68536247.ece</link>
			<description>OpenAI identified and shut down an Iranian influence operation called Storm-2035, which used ChatGPT to generate content aimed at swaying the U.S. presidential election. The operation comprised four fake news websites that exploited social and political issues, including LGBTQ rights, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and Venezuelan politics. They used AI to plagiarise stories and amplify their reach on social media platforms like X and Instagram. While OpenAI claims the operation had limited engagement, they shared threat information with government and industry stakeholders. This incident highlights the potential misuse of AI tools by foreign actors for influence operations. OpenAI has also reported other instances of AI abuse by state-backed actors and individuals, prompting them to enhance their AI security measures and collaborate with organizations like the U.S. AI Safety Institute.</description>

			<title>How can traffic which causes air pollution be controlled? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/how-can-traffic-which-causes-air-pollution-be-controlled-explained/article68530115.ece</link>
			<description>India faces a severe air pollution crisis, ranking high in the world for both the number of polluted cities and air pollution-related deaths. Road transport, particularly heavy vehicles, is a major contributor to PM2.5 and NOx emissions, both harmful pollutants.  

While the government's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms for cars are a positive step towards reducing emissions, they do not address heavy vehicle emissions. Similarly, the vehicle scrappage policy, aimed at removing old and polluting vehicles, has yet to see widespread implementation. 

Stricter enforcement of existing policies, including vehicle emissions testing, open garbage burning bans, and industrial emission control, is crucial.  Additionally, promoting mass transit is essential for sustainably tackling air pollution in India.</description>

			<title>An overview of governance in Delhi | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/an-overview-of-governance-in-delhi-explained/article68522086.ece</link>
			<description>A recent Supreme Court ruling has granted the Delhi Lieutenant Governor the power to nominate 10 aldermen to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) without consulting the council of ministers. This decision exacerbates the ongoing tensions between the Union government, the Delhi government, and the local government.  The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a "triple chain of accountability" in a democracy, but the current power dynamics disrupt this chain.  

Suggestions have been made to delineate responsibilities more effectively, such as placing 'New Delhi', where most central government offices are located, under direct central control, while granting the Delhi Assembly more autonomy over the remaining areas. This would require a constitutional amendment and broad consensus. Ultimately, the aim should be to ensure responsive and responsible governance from all levels of government in Delhi, regardless of the political affiliations in power.</description>

			<title>Why are recent patent and trademark grants under scrutiny? | Explained</title>
			<link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-are-recent-patent-and-trademark-grants-under-scrutiny-explained/article68504902.ece</link>
			<description>The Calcutta High Court has ruled that employing contractual workers for "quasi-judicial functions" in the patents and trademark office is unlawful. This decision stems from a case where a trademark opposition order issued by a contractual employee was challenged. The court found that such orders lack legal validity  as contractual employees do not have the authority to perform quasi-judicial functions. 

This ruling casts doubt on the legitimacy of numerous patents and trademarks granted by contractual officers.  The situation further highlights existing issues within the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (CGPDTM), including allegations of corruption and procedural inconsistencies.  The government has initiated steps to rectify the situation by terminating its agreement with the Quality Council of India (QCI) and establishing a committee to review and revalidate orders issued by contractual staff.</description>
