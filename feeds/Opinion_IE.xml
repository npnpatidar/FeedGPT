			<title>Galgotias University is not alone: Empty jargon at institutes mirrors students’ political slogans</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/galgotias-university-empty-jargon-institutes-mirrors-students-political-slogans-9318499/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the phenomenon of "bannerism" in the context of Indian universities, using Galgotias University as a case study. It highlights a protest by students who seemed uninformed about the issues they were protesting, which led to public criticism. The university responded with advertisements promoting its achievements and educational approach, but the article suggests that such promotional tactics may lack substance and fail to address the underlying issue of students' lack of critical engagement with public affairs. The article argues that bannerism, which prioritizes technocratic slogans over meaningful education, is prevalent in many institutions and affects their ability to produce inquiring minds and employable graduates. It also touches on a similar issue at Ashoka University, where openness and inquiry are promoted but not necessarily in a way that challenges power structures. The article concludes that this approach to education may explain why university-educated individuals might lack a nuanced understanding of social and political issues. The writer is identified as a British Academy Global Professor at SOAS University of London. The unrelated content about KSEAB releasing SSLC results is not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>Netflix’s ‘Baby Reindeer’ forces us to ask: Can an abuser be a victim?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/baby-reindeer-a-story-that-blurs-the-line-between-survivor-and-abuser-9317972/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Netflix series "Baby Reindeer," which is based on the true experiences of British comedian Richard Gadd. The series portrays Gadd's character, Donny Dunn, as he deals with the obsessive stalking by a woman named Martha Scott, who disrupts his life with relentless communication and threats. However, the series also delves into a darker past where Dunn was sexually assaulted by an older writer, a trauma that deeply affects his life and relationships.

Gadd, who wrote the show and plays Dunn, parallels his own life story, having debuted a play of the same name that deals with his assault and its aftermath. The article compares Gadd's approach to that of Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby, who also turns personal trauma into art. It highlights how both comedians use their platforms to control their narratives and confront their abuse.

The piece further explores how various artists have historically processed their trauma through their work, citing examples like Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi and French writer Vanessa Springora. It points out the complexity of labeling victims and abusers, especially in cases where the victim sympathizes with the abuser, as Gadd does with Martha.

Ultimately, the article reflects on the nuanced and often non-binary nature of trauma and survivorship, emphasizing that there is no "rational" response to such profound experiences, and societal expectations often fail to capture the reality of those who have endured severe trauma. The article concludes by challenging the simplistic categorization of victims and perpetrators, suggesting that understanding and sympathy can be part of the survivor's journey.</description>

			<title>BJP’s Surat win: Indication that party is a victim of its own success</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/bjp-surat-win-indication-party-victim-own-success-9318004/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the unusual political scenario in Surat, where Mukesh Dalal won the Lok Sabha seat unopposed, a rarity in competitive multiparty systems. The incident raised questions as the nomination papers of other candidates were rejected or withdrawn. The author suggests that the BJP, having dominated Surat and Indore for decades, may not need to influence electoral processes for victory but does so to maintain its image of strength and invincibility. This strategy is seen as a way to enthuse party cadre and intimidate opponents, despite appearing to adhere to legal procedures. The article argues that such tactics, while not illegal, undermine democratic norms by prioritizing victory over fair competition, leading to a gradual erosion of democracy. The author, affiliated with the University of Hyderabad, emphasizes that these actions, although technically correct, compromise the spirit of the law and democratic principles. The views expressed are personal to the writer.</description>

			<title>Express View: Congress plus, minus</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-congress-plus-minus-9316843/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the changing dynamics of Indian politics, particularly focusing on the decline of the Congress party and the rise of regional parties. It reflects on the historical shift since the 2014 general election when the BJP emerged as a dominant force and the Congress reached its lowest point in the Lok Sabha. The piece suggests that the erosion of the Congress's influence began much earlier, with the fading of the Nehruvian consensus in the 1960s leading to a more federal political structure and the rise of marginalized social groups forming their own parties.

Sharad Pawar, NCP founder and former Congress leader, predicts that in the coming years, several regional parties may either align more closely with the Congress or consider merging with it, seeing it as beneficial. The article notes that many Indian political parties have their origins in the Congress, having been formed by leaders who left due to ideological differences or after significant political events like the Mandal Commission.

The upcoming 2024 elections are seen as a critical juncture, with the possibility of the opposition uniting under the INDIA formation. However, the success of any potential mergers will depend on various factors, including the Congress's electoral performance. If the Congress does not perform well, it may not serve as a strong political attractor. Regional considerations also play a significant role, as seen in West Bengal, where local political dynamics prevent a seat-sharing arrangement between the Left, Congress, and TMC.

The article concludes by suggesting that the current political fluidity may lead other parties to consider their positions and strategies, especially in light of the BJP's dominance and the need for some regional parties to possibly reunite with the Congress.

			<title>Sam Pitroda’s crude parallels to explain diversity show how, for some Indians, self-worth is skin deep</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/sam-pitrodas-diversity-remarks-9316917/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding Sam Pitroda's comments on Indian diversity. Pitroda, the former chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, faced backlash and lost his position after making remarks in an interview that stereotyped people from different regions of India based on their appearance. The article criticizes his choice of words and suggests that his comments reflect a broader societal issue in India, where skin color and facial features are often given undue importance. It also points out the irony in the outrage against his comments, highlighting that the criticism itself may carry prejudiced undertones, especially regarding the comparison of South Indians to Africans. The article calls for a more nuanced appreciation of India's diversity beyond superficial characteristics.

			<title>SC verdict in West Bengal teacher recruitment case is a matter of reinforcing trust in public jobs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/supreme-court-west-bengal-teacher-recruitment-case-9316916/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India provided relief to school teachers and non-teaching staff in West Bengal by staying a Calcutta High Court order that had canceled their appointments due to irregularities in the recruitment process by the West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC). The apex court criticized the SSC and the state government for what it called "systemic fraud" but chose not to annul all appointments, distinguishing between tainted and untainted ones. The CBI will continue its investigation, and those appointed improperly will have to return their salaries.

The controversy began in 2014 when the SSC announced a state-level selection test for teacher recruitment, which led to allegations of improper evaluation of mark sheets and a subsequent CBI investigation. The SSC reportedly destroyed the OMR answer sheets, which should have been foolproof, after a year. The Enforcement Directorate is also conducting a separate investigation. The issue has become a focal point in the Lok Sabha election campaigns, with accusations from political parties about job denials and attempts to rob people of employment. The state's reliance on government jobs for social and economic mobility is highlighted, and the need for transparency and accountability in recruitment is emphasized.

The article also briefly mentions actor Jason Shah's role in the Netflix series Heeramandi, but this content is unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<title>Do we still need the ‘wilful defaulter’ framework?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/do-we-still-need-the-wilful-defaulter-framework-9316936/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the legal and regulatory issues surrounding the designation of "wilful defaulters" in India's financial sector. The Bombay High Court recently invalidated a government provision that allowed public sector banks to issue look out circulars against wilful defaulters, citing violations of fundamental rights. The court's decision highlights the need for procedural fairness and raises questions about the impartiality of lenders in these proceedings, as they may not be neutral judges in cases where they have a vested interest. The concept of a wilful defaulter, which carries significant penalties and market restrictions, is being scrutinized, especially since the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code now provides a mechanism for dealing with defaults. The article suggests that policymakers should reconsider the utility of the wilful defaulter framework in light of modern insolvency laws. The author of the article is an Associate Director at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas &amp; Co., and the views expressed are personal.

			<title>How to measure a superpower</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-superpower-gdp-growth-9316934/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of India's status as a power on the global stage, drawing parallels from historical concepts of power and rulership. It begins by referencing a book titled "Grasping Greatness, Making India a Leading Power," which explores India's potential to become a leading global power. The article argues that the terms "leading power," "great power," and "super power" are fluid and can change over time, with countries moving up or down the power hierarchy.

The author suggests that power can be measured by a country's formal leadership in global institutions and its GDP, highlighting India's strong GDP growth and potential to become the third-largest economy. The article then delves into ancient Indian texts and traditions, such as the Shatapatha Brahmana and Shukra Niti, to illustrate historical gradations of power based on rulers' titles and the types of sacrifices they performed, which symbolized their conquests and sovereignty.

The text also describes a historical system of ranking kingdoms based on annual revenue, measured in gold coins called karshas. This system categorized rulers from samantas (feudatory vassals) to sarvabhouma (universal emperors), based on the revenue of their domains.

In conclusion, the article reflects on the importance of tangible and measurable indicators of power, suggesting that historical methods of assessing power through revenue and sacrifices are analogous to modern considerations like GDP. The writer, who is the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the PM, emphasizes that these views are personal and not official statements.

			<title>Roti, kapda, makaan: Why not good air?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/air-quality-pollution-gdp-9316935/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the inclusion of environmental and air quality issues in the 2024 Lok Sabha manifestos of major political parties in India. It questions whether these issues are a top priority for parties and candidates and suggests that without becoming a political issue or a people's movement, significant improvement in air quality may not be realized. The article reflects on the evolution of public priorities from basic needs to more complex societal demands, noting that air quality has yet to become a central concern. It highlights the lack of information and effort by local governments in raising awareness about air pollution's effects.

The article also touches on the economic impact of air pollution, citing studies that link it to significant GDP losses. It references the Kuznets curve, which posits that environmental degradation initially increases with economic development but eventually decreases after a certain income level is reached. The piece argues for air pollution to become a mainstream issue through political agendas, news coverage, and public concern.

To address air pollution effectively, the article suggests public awareness campaigns, the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), and on-ground activities aimed at pollution reduction. It calls for local bodies to identify and address pollution sources, create green zones, and conduct outreach programs. The author, a professor at the Bose Institute, advocates for clean air as a fundamental right and urges collective action to demand better air quality.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need for mass movements to spread the demand for clean air across India, drawing parallels with other issues that have successfully mobilized public protest and political attention. It underscores the importance of grassroots efforts and the role of various stakeholders in making air quality a national priority. The article's focus is on the potential for societal change through increased awareness and political action to improve air quality in India.</description>

			<title>In India, the idea of democracy differs from its practice</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-democracy-election-9316842/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concept of democracy from both a theoretical and practical perspective, particularly in the context of India. It references Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben's view that democracy serves as both a method for forming a political community and a governance technique. The article contrasts democracy as an ideal, characterized by dissent, justice, and respect for rights, with democracy as a majoritarian administrative practice.

In India, the values of democracy were embedded during the national movement, despite its upper-caste and middle-class leanings. Figures like Gandhi and Ambedkar had differing views on democracy's place in society and the constitution. The early post-independence years in India saw a commitment to justice and fundamental rights, but dissent was not fully embraced, leading to events like the Emergency in 1975.

The article suggests that the current political climate in India has seen a shift in the principles and values of democracy, with the influence of certain organizations becoming normalized. It argues that Indian politics is drifting away from human values essential to democracy, making it difficult to envision a democracy focused on human engagement and daily life concerns.

Philosopher Alain Badiou is cited to describe democracy as a political society's dominant emblem, where criticism is allowed as long as it's under the banner of democracy. This is particularly relevant in India, where discussions on democracy's forms often overshadow concerns about its content and values.

The writer of the article is a professor at the School of Gandhian Thought and Development Studies, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala. The unrelated content about actor Jason Shah and the Netflix series Heeramandi has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>India can unlock growth by boosting nari shakti</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/viksit-bhrat-nari-shakti-9316841/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the imperative of empowering women in India to achieve economic development by 2047. It outlines three key policy areas:

**1. Increasing Women's Labor Force Participation (LFP):** The article highlights the low LFP rate for women in India, currently at 25%, and suggests that increasing it to 50% could significantly boost GDP growth. It recommends expanding manufacturing capacity, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like garments and footwear, under the Production Linked Investment (PLI) scheme to create more jobs for women.

**2. Enhancing Formal Sector Employment and Skilling:** The article points out the need for high-quality, affordable skilling programs, especially for women, to transition from informal to formal sector employment. It suggests improving access to Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and addressing gender imbalances in skill training and employment outcomes.

**3. Urban Infrastructure for Women's Mobility:** As India urbanizes, the article stresses the importance of designing cities that facilitate women's mobility, access to education, and work opportunities. It calls for urban planning with a gender perspective and the creation of a high-quality urban care infrastructure to release women from care work and generate new jobs.

The article also touches on the need for public policies that incentivize the use of clean technology to reduce domestic work and promote women's participation in the labor market. It concludes that investing in women's human capital is crucial for achieving gender parity and a developed society. The writer is an economics professor with affiliations to the Indian Statistical Institute and the University of Toronto.</description>

			<title>The British reduced all tawaifs to sex workers – so has Sanjay Leela Bhansali in Heeramandi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/tawaifs-sex-workers-sanjay-leela-bhansali-heeramandi-9316484/</link>
			<description>The article is a critique of the Netflix series "Heeramandi," which portrays the lives of tawaifs (courtesans). The author, who has spent 15 years reviving the art of tawaifs, praises the series' production quality but criticizes its content for reinforcing negative stereotypes. The series is said to depict tawaifs as scheming for wealth and sexual favors, ignoring their historical role as educated, accomplished artists. The author argues that the series conflates different categories of performers and fails to acknowledge the tawaifs' dedication to perfecting their art forms. The series also inaccurately mixes cultural elements from Awadh and Lahore, further distorting history. The author expresses concern that the series will perpetuate misconceptions about Kathak dancers and tawaifs, and laments the missed opportunity to accurately represent and honor the tawaifs' contributions to Indian cultural history. The article ends by noting the founder of The Courtesan Project, Chaturvedi, as the author.

			<title>In Uttar Pradesh, SP and BSP are following BJP’s playbook. It’s not so easy to pull off</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uttar-pradesh-sp-bsp-following-bjp-playbook-not-easy-9315905/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the shift in political strategies of major parties in Uttar Pradesh (UP) during the general elections, focusing on the mobilization of non-dominant OBC and Dalit communities. The BJP's model, which has been in place for a decade, aims to form a broad social alliance by including these communities, moving away from the traditional reliance on a "base" vote. This approach is based on the concept of Antyodaya and expanding the electoral base. The SP and BSP are now partially adopting this model, giving fewer tickets to their traditional caste bases and focusing on other communities to broaden their appeal. The BJP's experience in balancing these social groups may give it an advantage, while the SP and BSP are still developing this capacity. The outcome of this strategy will be significant in the elections, as it could challenge the BJP's dominance if the other parties manage to create a harmonious balance among the various castes. The writer's views are personal and reflect the evolving political landscape in UP. The unrelated content about Ranveer Singh's social media activity has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>The ‘Bandhutva’ push: Foreign policy, beyond slogans and acronyms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bandhutva-push-foreign-policy-slogans-acronyms-9315551/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complexities of political slogans, national ideologies, and India's foreign policy, particularly in relation to China. It critiques the oversimplification of national interests and the dangers of ignoring historical context in policy analysis. The author argues that states act out of self-interest, not friendship or altruism, and questions the current Indian government's claims of pursuing national interests more effectively than previous administrations.

The piece also addresses India's development goals, the impact of digitalization on the economy, and the growing inequalities since liberalization. It emphasizes the need for India to capitalize on global shifts in manufacturing and to invest in science, technology, and innovation to keep pace with other countries.

Reflecting on India's foreign policy from Nehru to Modi, the author suggests that despite new terminology, the core principles of an independent and autonomous policy remain relevant. The article concludes by urging the current government to acknowledge the contributions of its predecessors and to focus on the realities of the present rather than the glories of the past. The writer identifies as a former diplomat, providing a perspective grounded in experience with international relations.

			<title>For women-led development, invest in the Care Economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/for-women-led-development-invest-in-the-care-economy-9315433/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of unpaid care work on gender inequality and economic growth. It highlights that women disproportionately bear the burden of unpaid care work, which hinders their career advancement and contributes to the gender wage gap. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) defines the Care Economy as activities related to care and support, both paid and unpaid. Despite its importance, care work is often undervalued and invisible in traditional economic frameworks, particularly in India.

Studies indicate that women's unpaid work contributes significantly to global GDP, yet this is not reflected in national accounting systems. In India, unpaid care work is estimated to be a substantial portion of the GDP, with women dedicating more time to it than men. Investing in the care sector could create millions of jobs and address the needs of an aging population.

The article suggests that achieving gender equality requires recognizing the value of care work, reducing the amount of unpaid care, redistributing care responsibilities, rewarding care workers fairly, and ensuring their representation in decision-making. It also recommends prioritizing care work in socio-economic development plans, creating gender-inclusive childcare policies, and enhancing the quality of the care sector.

The authors argue that strengthening the care economy is crucial for India's development and women-led growth, especially in the upcoming era termed "Amrit Kaal." They advocate for increased public and private investments in the care sector to create new business opportunities and promote development led by women. The article concludes with a brief mention of Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh's social media activity, which is unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<title>No, Pakistan’s employment picture isn’t better than India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-pakistans-employment-picture-isnt-better-than-india-9314843/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the transformation of India's labor market, challenging the notion that high unemployment rates are the primary issue. It argues that the real problem is not unemployment but low wages. The author criticizes the use of the CMIE Consumer Pyramids Household survey for labor market analysis due to its inconsistencies and suggests that the Ashoka University's pause in using this survey indicates a need for more rigorous data.

The piece highlights the policy approach termed 'Madhyam Marg,' which balances welfare state efficiency, digital public infrastructure, and private sector productivity to address poverty, hunger, shelter, and health. It emphasizes the importance of formalizing employment, improving infrastructure, and reducing regulatory burdens to boost job creation.

The author also reflects on economist Alfred Marshall's theory of time periods in economics, applying it to the labor market to explain the dynamics of supply, demand, and wages. The article concludes by urging offshore Indian economists to recognize India's progress and contribute positively rather than dismissing it. The writer is associated with Teamlease Services.

			<title>According to SC, it is ‘pregnant persons’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/according-to-sc-it-is-pregnant-persons-9314855/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, has taken a progressive step by extending the definition of pregnancy to include non-binary and transgender men, in addition to cisgender women. This was highlighted in a case involving a minor's pregnancy termination, where the term "pregnant person/(s)" was used to acknowledge a broader gender spectrum. The Court's decision is part of its efforts to promote gender-neutral language and combat gender stereotypes within the legal system. This move is seen as a significant stride towards inclusive legal protections for all individuals capable of pregnancy and aligns with the Court's previous judgment advocating for legislative safeguards for same-sex couples. The shift in language is expected to influence a broader understanding of gender and family in legal contexts.</description>

			<title>Why can’t George Lucas make changes to ‘Star Wars’?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/why-cant-george-lucas-make-changes-to-star-wars-9314851/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contentious issue of artists altering their previous works. It references George Lucas's modifications to the original Star Wars trilogy, which sparked debate among fans about the nature of artistic ownership and the right to revise art. The piece also touches on historical precedents, such as Arthur Conan Doyle's decision to resurrect Sherlock Holmes due to fan demand, and the common practice in various media to retcon for consistency. The central argument is that creation is an ongoing process aimed at perfection, and while fans' emotional attachments are significant, they do not negate the artist's right to refine their work. The article concludes by affirming the artist's prerogative to make changes in pursuit of their vision.</description>

			<title>Uttarakhand forest fire: Climate-proof the state</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/uttarakhand-forest-fire-climate-proof-the-state-9314854/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the severe forest fires in Uttarakhand, India, which have claimed lives and spread over 1,000 hectares. The fires pose a threat to populated areas, including Nainital city, and have been exacerbated by poor visibility affecting firefighting efforts. Experts link the fires to increased heat and black carbon emissions, impacting water systems and air quality. The state government attributes the fires to human activities and has implemented bans on setting fires and burning waste near forests as emergency measures.

The article emphasizes that nearly 95% of forest fires are human-induced, with historical practices like burning pine needles now becoming destructive. The fire season, typically from February to June, is starting earlier due to climate changes, with Uttarakhand experiencing its driest April in five years. The forest department has taken steps like creating firelines, but more proactive measures are needed, including weather prediction systems, satellite monitoring, and community training for first response.

The article concludes by highlighting the need for climate-proofing the ecologically sensitive region of Uttarakhand, which regularly suffers from natural calamities worsened by poor policy decisions. It calls for a collective effort from various experts to address the climate crisis and protect the environment.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/america-deals-woke-mobs-campuses-hypocrisy-caa-shaheen-bagh-protests-stands-exposed-9314269/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the resilience of US universities, drawing parallels with their recovery post-Vietnam War and expressing confidence in their ability to bounce back from current challenges.

			<title>C Raja Mohan writes: Xi Jinping’s visit, a divided Europe and India’s challenge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/xi-jinping-europe-visit-india-challenge-9313680/</link>
			<description>Xi Jinping's recent tour of Europe is a strategic move by China to capitalize on the divisions within Europe and between Europe and the United States. The visit comes at a time when Europe faces a trilemma in its relations with the US, Russia, and China, exacerbated by the possibility of Trump's return to power, Russia's assertiveness in Ukraine, and economic pressures from China.

French President Emmanuel Macron has called for European unity to confront these challenges, emphasizing the need for strategic autonomy and a balanced approach between the US and China. Xi's visit aims to persuade Europe against escalating trade tensions and to consider Chinese investments, particularly in the electric vehicle sector.

China's support for Russia's actions in Ukraine has raised concerns in Europe, with Macron advocating for European responsibility in security matters, including the potential deployment of troops to Ukraine. However, this proposal faces resistance within Europe.

Xi's engagements in pro-Russian Serbia and Hungary highlight the divisions within Europe and the extent of support for the Sino-Russian alliance. His visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which China uses to challenge Western narratives.

Former US President Donald Trump's criticisms of Europe and NATO contribute to the complex dynamics, as Europe seeks to define its role amid great power competition. The outcome of Europe's geopolitical decisions will significantly impact India's relations with the US, Russia, and China.

India, recognizing the importance of engaging with Europe, has increased its outreach to various European entities. This engagement is crucial for India to navigate the shifting relations between major global powers and to explore strategic opportunities within Europe.

The article also mentions an upcoming Apple event focused on new iPad products and software developments, unrelated to the geopolitical discussion.</description>

			<title>From bomb threats against schools to deepfakes in election — combatting cyber crime in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bomb-threats-schools-deepfakes-in-election-cyber-crime-india-9313365/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the urgent need for a comprehensive cyber security strategy in light of recent cyber attacks on schools in the national capital. It emphasizes the importance of establishing a cyber ministry to ensure accountability and governance in protecting national cyberspace. The article suggests that the current system lacks accountability, as demonstrated by a similar incident in the UK, which led to the creation of the National Cyber Security Centre. It also references Australia's appointment of a minister for cyber security and outlines the benefits of such a role.

The author calls for a revision of the 2013 cyber security policy and the introduction of a Cyber Security Act to address modern cyber crimes. The increase in cyber crime, particularly through smartphones, and the need for a holistic approach involving various sectors are highlighted. The article also mentions the challenges posed by deepfakes and disinformation, especially during elections, and the need for a national cyber reference framework and international cooperation in cyber defence.

The piece concludes by stressing the necessity of deterrence in cyber defence and notes the shift from cyber security to cyber power in global strategies, underscoring the urgency for action. The writer is identified as the chairman of the Cyber Security Association of India, and the article ends with an update on the ongoing Lok Sabha election's Phase 3 polling. Election results are expected to be announced shortly after the phase concludes.</description>

			<title>Why fast bowler talents such as Mayank Yadav should not be rushed back to action after an injury</title>

			<description>India's cricket scene has been abuzz with the rise of **Mayank Yadav**, a young fast bowler capable of consistently delivering speeds over **150kph**. His talent has been acknowledged by international cricket legends, but his career is currently at risk due to injury mismanagement. Despite a side strain that typically requires **3-4 weeks** of recovery, Mayank was rushed back into an IPL match by the Lucknow Super Giants, only to suffer another breakdown. This has sparked a debate on the conflicting priorities between IPL franchises' short-term goals and the national team's long-term planning, especially with an important Test tour of Australia on the horizon. The article emphasizes the need for better scientific advice and patience in handling emerging talents to prevent permanent damage to their careers. It suggests that it's the decision-makers, not Mayank, who need to acknowledge his injury and manage his recovery responsibly.</description>

			<title>Why spectrum allocation, tech policy must not be a matter of courts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-spectrum-allocation-tech-policy-must-not-be-a-matter-of-courts-9312249/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of spectrum allocation in India, particularly focusing on the shift from administrative assignment to auctions following the 2G scandal. The 2010 3G spectrum auction is highlighted as a turning point that brought transparency and significant revenue to the government. However, the author argues that auctions may not be the best method for spectrum allocation as they can hinder the telecom sector's growth and competitiveness. The piece suggests that providing spectrum at a reasonable fee could spur efficiency and competitiveness, akin to the benefits seen from toll roads in the U.S.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has sought to modify a Supreme Court order to allow administrative allocation of spectrum in specific cases where auctions are not feasible, as outlined in the Telecom Act, 2023. The author believes that policy decisions, such as spectrum allocation, should be left to expert bodies like TRAI and DoT, who are better equipped to handle the complexities of the telecom sector. The article concludes with a personal reflection on the role of TRAI in tariff fixing and the importance of specialist bodies in policy-making. The writer's views are presented as personal opinions.</description>

			<title>Charanjit Channi’s comments on the Poonch terror attack: Petty politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/charanjit-channis-comments-on-the-poonch-terror-attack-petty-politics-9312222/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversial statements made by Charanjit Singh Channi, former Punjab chief minister, during an election campaign. Channi suggested that a militant attack in Poonch was a political stunt by the BJP, which led to the death of an Indian Air Force corporal and injuries to others. His comments were criticized by the BJP and contrasted with Rahul Gandhi's response, calling the attack "sad and shameful." Despite demands for an apology, Channi reiterated his stance and criticized the government's handling of the 2019 Pulwama attacks.

The article argues that while national security is a valid topic for debate, it should not be politicized in the context of terrorist attacks. It criticizes the tendency of political leaders to use military operations for electoral gain, stating that this undermines the sacrifices of the armed forces and does not contribute to a reasoned discourse on national security. The author suggests that Channi should apologize for his remarks.

Additionally, the article provides an update on the Lok Sabha elections, noting that 93 seats across 12 states and UTs will be contested in the third phase, with five states completing their polling process. The BJP candidate in Surat has already won unopposed due to the rejection or withdrawal of other nominations.</description>

			<title>MSMEs are not paid on time. They need to be</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/msmes-are-not-paid-on-time-they-need-to-be-9312221/</link>
			<description>Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are crucial to India's economy, contributing significantly to manufacturing and exports, and employing a large labor force. However, they face challenges such as limited credit access and delayed payments, with the latter being predominantly owed to micro and small enterprises. To address this, the government launched the Samadhaan portal and introduced a budget provision for timely MSME payments within 45 days. Despite good intentions, this led to unintended consequences, with larger companies canceling orders with registered MSMEs to maintain longer payment cycles and flexibility. This has pressured MSMEs to deregister to retain business. The government is now engaging stakeholders to find solutions and ensure prompt payment clearance for MSMEs, who also struggle with accessing affordable credit. The article also briefly mentions the third phase of the Lok Sabha elections, unrelated to the MSME discussion.</description>

			<description>The article covers several key issues in India:

- **Adivasi Leaders Arrested**: A commission has reported that Adivasi leaders in Madhya Pradesh were arrested for petitioning against bonded labor. They were allegedly terrorized by the administration due to pressure from vested interests.
- **Indian Ocean Rivalry**: Prime Minister Indira Gandhi highlighted the superpower rivalry in the Indian Ocean and the challenges India faces in achieving technological sophistication despite its peace policy.
- **Indo-Pak Border Tensions**: Defence Minister R Venkataraman stated India is ready to counter threats from Pakistan, noting the accumulation of Pakistani military equipment and troops near the Ladakh border.
- **Constitutional Protection**: Opposition parties, led by the CPI-M, oppose any amendments to the Constitution that would shield legislative and parliamentary privileges from judicial review, particularly concerning Article 32.

Additionally, the article mentions the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, with 93 seats across 12 states and UTs voting in the third phase, and the BJP candidate in Surat winning unopposed.</description>

			<title>In Gujarat, an unpredictable campaign before a predictable outcome</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/gujarat-lok-sabha-polls-unpredictable-campaign-predictable-outcome-9311846/</link>
			<description>The parliamentary election in Gujarat in 2024 has defied expectations of being dull, with various opposition movements challenging the dominance of the BJP. These movements include statewide agitations by the Kshatriya community, mobilization of tribal youth, and intensive campaigning by opposition candidates like Geniben Thakor. The discourse reveals tensions between caste and development, highlighting social cleavages despite the BJP's focus on development. The co-option of youth leaders by the BJP has created space for emerging opposition figures like Chaitar Vasava, though regional marginalization limits their impact. The BJP's success lies in integrating diverse communities into regional political economy structures, as seen in candidate choices like Rekha Choudhary in Banaskantha. Despite spirited opposition campaigns, the BJP's resources and organization often determine outcomes.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/viswanathan-anand-writes-golden-generation-for-indian-chess-9311721/</link>
			<description>Viswanathan Anand reflects on the factors contributing to India's success in chess, particularly at the Candidates tournament. He highlights the sacrifices of parents, the necessity of coaching, and the advancements in training methods. Anand notes the development of India's chess ecosystem, with successful players establishing coaching centers and academies, providing a strong foundation for the current generation. The popularity of chess has grown, partly due to its portrayal in streaming and e-sports, leading to increased sponsorship and public engagement. Anand mentions the achievements of young grandmasters and the potential of the current generation, while also acknowledging the persistent gender disparity in chess. Efforts are being made to address this through equal prize money and support for women's tournaments. Anand hopes for the further national spread of chess, overcoming regional disparities in its popularity. The article concludes with a mention of a legal notice received by a tea startup from Sony Pictures Networks India, unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<title>Some academics are getting it wrong: New PhD guidelines will make life easier for scholars</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/new-phd-guidelines-scholars-9311307/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India's new policy that allows four-year Bachelor’s degree holders to directly pursue PhD programmes. This move taps into the larger pool of undergraduate students, aligning with the goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The policy is designed to prepare students with rigorous training in research methods and analytical skills, and it breaks down barriers that previously restricted PhD eligibility to postgraduate students only.

The UGC-NET, an entrance test for PhD eligibility and Assistant Professor appointments, will now include an "admission to PhD only" category from June 2024, allowing universities to use UGC-NET scores instead of conducting their own entrance tests. This change is part of a continuing policy to recognize the academic achievements of diverse educational backgrounds.

The article emphasizes that objections to this policy, based on concerns about the dilution of quality, are unfounded since students must have a minimum of 75% marks to be eligible. It also clarifies that qualifying in the UGC-NET based on a four-year degree does not grant eligibility to teach as an Assistant Professor unless the candidate completes a PhD.

The UGC's request for universities to use UGC-NET scores aims to reduce the financial burden and stress on students from multiple entrance exams and to streamline administrative processes for universities. The policy is seen as a step towards fostering innovation, excellence, and inclusivity in doctoral research, positioning India at the forefront of global research and innovation.

The article concludes with the personal views of the Chairman of the UGC, who advocates for diverse doctoral research opportunities for students without the need for multiple entrance tests. The unrelated content regarding a woman's abduction is not included in the summary as per the request.</description>

			<title>Big question in West Bengal: Will BJP’s charges of corruption trump Mamata’s charisma, welfare programmes?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/big-question-in-west-bengal-will-bjps-charges-of-corruption-trump-mamatas-charisma-welfare-programmes-9311072/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political climate and voter turnout in West Bengal during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. It highlights a lower voter enthusiasm compared to the 2014 and 2019 elections, attributing it to factors such as the BJP's weakened booth-level organization post-2021 assembly elections and the absence of migrant workers due to post-Covid job uncertainties. The BJP's ambitious seat target faces challenges due to a decline in vote share and internal party rivalry. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) benefits from welfare schemes and the charisma of Mamata Banerjee, while the Left has seen some organizational strengthening. The article concludes by questioning how voters will respond to the opposition's campaign against the TMC, noting that West Bengal has historically voted against national parties. The views expressed are personal to the writer, a political scientist. The unrelated content regarding a separate legal case has been omitted from the summary.</description>

			<title>BJP’s Karnataka push is a reaction to its weaknesses</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-karnataka-push-reaction-weaknesses-9310978/</link>
			<description>The article by Srikar Raghavan reflects on the state of politics and media in Karnataka, drawing parallels between the issues highlighted in a 1994 edition of Lankesh Patrike and the current political climate. It discusses the use of gag orders to suppress media, citing over 600 lawsuits against media houses involving politicians from various parties. The article also details a scandal involving Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, accused of sexual abuse, and his subsequent flight from the country. The BJP's political strategy in Karnataka is critiqued for its reliance on communal tension and the Modi factor, which is expected to yield diminishing returns. The article predicts internal conflicts and the impact of Congress' policies on farmers and women will weaken the BJP's hold on the Lingayat-dominated northern Karnataka. It highlights the significance of the Lingayat vote and the personal crusades of local leaders. The Congress is predicted to win a significant number of seats, and the author calls for civil society to prioritize issues like political accountability, women's empowerment, economic distress, and climate change over divisive politics. The article concludes with a note on the author, an independent writer and researcher, and mentions his forthcoming book. Additionally, it touches on a case of alleged abduction related to a JD(S) legislator's son, causing public scrutiny and concern for the victim's family, now under SIT protection.</description>

			<title>The clean energy transition has become messy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-clean-energy-transition-has-become-messy-9310119/</link>
			<description>The article provides an in-depth analysis of the current complexities in the global petroleum industry, highlighting the interplay of geopolitics, market forces, and environmental concerns. It outlines the challenges faced by policymakers, especially in oil-importing countries like India, due to the volatile nature of oil prices influenced by factors beyond traditional supply and demand. The piece discusses the geopolitical tensions involving major oil-producing nations like Venezuela, the US, Russia, and the Middle East, and their impact on global oil trade and prices.

The author also touches upon the dilemmas faced by the petroleum industry and governments in balancing economic interests with commitments to reducing carbon emissions. The fragmentation of the global oil market due to sanctions and regional trading relationships is emphasized, along with the potential deepening of this trend.

Furthermore, the article points out the increasing demand for electricity by the AI industry and the challenges it poses for meeting net-zero carbon emission goals. It concludes with advice for India to hedge against market volatility by diversifying its energy sources, investing in clean energy, and building strategic oil reserves.

The writer, a chairman and distinguished fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, urges analysts to consider additional factors such as net-zero commitments and the AI industry's energy demands when assessing the oil market's future. The overarching message is that despite the complexities, strategic planning and adaptation are essential for navigating the uncertain terrain of the petroleum market.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-pather-panchali-and-lagaan-to-all-we-imagine-as-light-india-stars-at-cannes-9310100/</link>

It begins by recalling the first Indian film to win at Cannes, "Neecha Nagar" in 1946, and goes on to discuss the consistent recognition of Indian cinema at the festival over the years. The piece celebrates the diversity and innovation of Indian filmmakers, mentioning notable awards and recognitions such as Satyajit Ray's "Pather Panchali" and Mira Nair's "Salaam Bombay!"

The narrative also touches upon the cultural impact of Indian cinema, likening it to the country's cuisine in its variety and appeal.

			<title>Student protests in the US: Campus and Camp</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/student-protests-in-the-us-campus-and-camp-9310134/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the detention of over 2,000 students in US universities and the deployment of armed riot police on campuses, highlighting it as a failure of leadership in higher education. This situation raises complex questions about free expression, security, and the role of "cancel culture" in shaping political narratives. The article contrasts the current protests with those of the 1968 era, noting a lack of solidarity with broader societal issues. It also touches on the response to recent events in Gaza and the challenges universities face in balancing free speech with order and safety. The piece suggests that the current turmoil could have been an opportunity for learning and debate on global conflicts and the influence of multinational corporations on education. The article concludes by mentioning ongoing security operations in Jammu and Kashmir following an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy. The need for self-examination at universities is emphasized, especially when they resort to calling the police to maintain order.</description>

			<title>Laapataa Ladies: A fantasy by those who have never lived in a village</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/laapataa-ladies-a-fantasy-by-those-who-have-never-lived-in-a-village-9310120/</link>
			<description>The article provides a thematic analysis of the film "Laapataa Ladies," drawing parallels with Mahasweta Devi's story "Seed." It highlights the use of floral names and motifs as a pattern in the film, where two brides named Phool and Pushpa (both meaning flower) are lost and mistakenly swapped on a train. The narrative explores the significance of these names and the concept of light and life, as the village's name, Suryamukhi, means sunflower, and the protagonist Phool needs light to survive, symbolized by her husband Deepak (meaning lamp).

The author reflects on the film's setting in a fictional utopian village, contrasting it with the harsh realities of Mahasweta Devi's story set during the Emergency in India, where oppression and violence are prevalent. The film's portrayal of organic farming is critiqued as an upper-class aspiration, while "Seed" presents a more grounded and brutal take on the concept, where the land becomes fertile with the corpses of oppressed farmworkers.

The article concludes by describing the film as a fantasy that offers a sanitized, idealistic view of village life, far removed from the actual hardships, and uses the metaphor of organic farming to represent rebirth and resistance against oppression. The author, Roy, clarifies that the views expressed are personal. The unrelated content about security operations in Jammu and Kashmir is not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>On Myanmar, India needs a rethink</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/on-myanmar-india-needs-a-rethink-9310128/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing conflict in Myanmar and its implications for regional stability and Indian security policy. It highlights the recent recapture of Myawaddy by Myanmar's army, a key trade route town with Thailand, from anti-government forces. The Border Guard Force (BGF), aligned with the military but operating with autonomy, is said to be exploiting the situation for its own gain, including criminal activities. The article reflects on Myanmar's historical struggle to maintain control over its territories, exacerbated by the 2021 coup, leading to increased involvement of external powers like China and the US. India's response to the crisis is critiqued, suggesting a need for a policy shift to engage with Myanmar's National Unity Government and local forces, rather than solely the military, to address security challenges along the shared border. Additionally, it mentions ongoing operations in Jammu and Kashmir by Indian security forces to apprehend militants who attacked an IAF convoy. One injured personnel, Corporal Vikky Pahade, succumbed to his injuries and was honored posthumously. The summary omits unrelated content as per your request.</description>

			<title>From the Opinions Editor: Why political parties need to do some data crunching when they defer to the likes of Brij Bhushan Singh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/brij-bhushan-singh-political-parties-data-9309616/</link>
			<description>Sakshi Malik, India's first female Olympic wrestling medalist, expressed disappointment over the BJP's decision not to renominate Brij Bhushan Singh for the Kaiserganj seat. Singh, facing allegations of sexual harassment, was replaced by his son. This move reflects a political culture that disregards women's dignity for electoral gains. Despite recent legislation promoting women's representation, the percentage of female candidates remains low, while candidates with criminal records, including those accused of crimes against women, are prevalent. Parties prioritize winnability over addressing gender disparities, evident in the underrepresentation of women despite their success rates. It's imperative for parties to consider these figures and challenge patriarchal norms in candidate selection.</description>

			<description>The article discusses recent food safety concerns in India, particularly regarding ground spices and foods for infants and children.

The author emphasizes the need for stricter standards, citing examples of added sugar in baby foods despite WHO recommendations against it.

			<title>A vacation on one’s own terms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-vacation-on-ones-own-terms-9308218/</link>
			<description>The Mona Lisa, long hailed as a pinnacle of art, is now deemed disappointing by many due to overhyped expectations and mass tourism. This trend reflects a broader issue: the obsession with capturing moments for social media rather than savoring experiences. The article argues for a return to slower, more mindful travel, reminiscent of Kerouac's adventures, where discovery happens by chance and true understanding comes from immersing oneself in the unfamiliar. Ultimately, it suggests that the essence of travel lies not in ticking off destinations but in embracing the freedom of the unknown and cherishing the unique experiences it brings.</description>

			<title>Coomi Kapoor writes: BJP workers’ anger has made party vulnerable in this election</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/inside-track-worker-let-down-9308186/</link>
			<description>The BJP's vulnerability in the upcoming elections is attributed to a drop in worker enthusiasm, dissatisfaction with ticket distribution, and resentment towards replacing popular MPs. Modi's campaign focuses solely on him, with notable BJP leaders missing from posters. Criticism arises over Modi's speeches targeting the Muslim community, viewed as polarizing. Despite accusations of straying from RSS ideology, Modi emphasizes his commitment to core principles. Opposition leverages past remarks and misinformation, making the campaign contentious. Additionally, the NEET UG 2024 exam faced issues, including false leak claims and distribution errors in Rajasthan.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: Mr Modi acknowledges hero of LS 2024</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mr-modi-acknowledges-hero-of-ls-2024-9308188/</link>
			<description>The Congress party's manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, named 'NYAY PATRA,' was a result of extensive efforts dating back to 2019. It incorporated inputs from a historic journey by Rahul Gandhi from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, a Udaipur Conclave, and an AICC session in Raipur. The manifesto focused on justice for various segments of society and presented an alternative vision of growth and development. Despite initial neglect by the BJP and media, it gained traction as its messages reached the masses. The BJP's manifesto, 'Modi Ki Guarantee,' failed to garner attention. In response, the BJP resorted to spreading falsehoods about the Congress manifesto, which were debunked. By avoiding mention of its own manifesto and propagating lies about the Congress', Modi inadvertently elevated the latter's significance in the election discourse.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the challenges of writing political columns in the era of social media, where even minor critics become targets of intense scrutiny and criticism. The author reflects on the barrage of attacks they face, particularly during election season, from both Congress and Modi supporters. They criticize Prime Minister Modi for his recent comments linking the Congress Party to Pakistan and for his derogatory remarks about India's Muslim citizens. The author argues that Modi's tactics are divisive and reminiscent of the vote-bank politics he claims to oppose. They suggest that Modi's focus on such issues may backfire in the upcoming election, where his performance and promises are the central concerns for voters.</description>

			<title>Misconstrued polyamory and lying men: Why I am off dating apps</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/misconstrued-polyamory-and-lying-men-why-i-am-off-dating-apps-9307478/</link>
			<description>A study revealed that around 60% of married Indians are interested in extramarital relationships, with dedicated apps for open marriages gaining popularity. However, the prevalence of married individuals on dating apps seeking non-monogamous relationships has led to frustration among single Indian women. Many have experienced deception from individuals claiming to be single but are actually married. While alternative relationship forms like open marriage or polyamory are respected, the lack of honesty in these interactions is concerning. The experience appears to be gender-neutral, with both men and women facing challenges in dating apps due to dishonesty, manipulation, and other issues. As a result, many are turning away from dating apps towards offline communities with shared interests or values. However, even this alternative comes with its caveats.</description>

			<title>PM Modi’s remarks are a ‘massive fall’ from Vajpayee’s era</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-remarks-massive-fall-vajpayee-era-9307366/</link>
			<description>The article discusses several issues related to India and Pakistan, focusing on political rhetoric, labor rights, press freedom, and a wheat crisis in Pakistan:

- **Political Commentary**: Pakistani media has critiqued Indian PM Narendra Modi's speeches, particularly his remarks on "infiltrators" and his aggressive stance, which contrasts with the more peaceful approach of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

- **Labor Rights**: On May Day, Pakistani leaders emphasized labor welfare, with calls for better health and safety measures, training, and equipment for workers. Suggestions include curbing child labor, respecting labor rights, and implementing subsidies and poverty alleviation programs.

- **Minimum Wage**: There's a proposal for setting a minimum wage in each province, inspired by improvements in the textile industry's labor conditions due to international pressure.

- **Press Freedom**: World Press Freedom Day highlighted the environmental crisis's impact on journalism. South Asia faces challenges with press freedom, particularly in India and Bangladesh, with Pakistan experiencing control from both the government and security establishments.

- **Wheat Crisis**: Pakistan is dealing with a wheat surplus and low market prices, leading to farmer protests. The crisis is partly attributed to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on wheat imports and is exacerbated by the caretaker government's decisions.

- **CISCE Results**: The article ends with an announcement about the release of the ICSE Class 10 and 12 results on May 6.

			<title>May 4, Forty Years Ago: Atal, Charan Held</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/may-4-forty-years-ago-atal-bihari-vajpayee-chaudhary-charan-singh-held-9306568/</link>
			<description>Hundreds of volunteers from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprised of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Lok Dal (LD), staged a week-long satyagraha in Delhi, led by Charan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, protesting the government's failure to restore normalcy in Punjab. The Punjab government lifted the siege on three gurdwaras in Moga after an ultimatum from the Akali Dal, resulting in several arrests and the recovery of firearms. A threatening letter to Indian diplomat Prakash Bhalla in London turned out to be a hoax. In New Delhi, a massive fire in the New Seemapuri colony claimed seven lives, injured many, and destroyed thousands of homes. The CISCE announced the release of ICSE Class 10 and 12 results for 2024 on May 6 at 11 am.</description>

			<title>Long, dry spell: Drought conditions could cause food inflation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/long-dry-spell-drought-conditions-could-cause-food-inflation-9306551/</link>
			<description>Water levels in 150 major reservoirs across India are at a concerning 28.2% of their full capacity, lower than the levels from the previous year and the 10-year average for this time. Southern states are particularly affected, with some reservoirs practically dry. This situation raises concerns about agricultural production, exacerbated by last year's poor monsoon and El Niño-related weather patterns. Procurement of rice and wheat has been affected, leading to higher retail prices for various food items. However, there's hope as global models suggest the weakening of El Niño and a potential transition to La Niña, associated with surplus rainfall in India. Nonetheless, the government, post-elections, may face challenges in managing food inflation if the monsoon doesn't meet expectations. Meanwhile, amidst these concerns, the NEET UG 2024 exam was conducted without any reported paper leaks, though there were isolated incidents such as providing English question papers to Hindi medium students in one center in Rajasthan.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-ticket-to-brij-bhushans-son-is-a-moral-failure-karan-bhushan-9306543/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the nomination of Karan Bhushan Singh, the son of former Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, for electoral candidacy despite allegations of sexual harassment by female wrestlers against Brij Bhushan. It highlights the failure of repeated calls for justice and the culture of impunity allowing powerful men to escape accountability. Despite the emphasis on women's empowerment in politics, the decision to nominate Karan is seen as tokenism and a moral failure, maintaining the patriarchal status quo. The article calls for addressing the systemic barriers women face in achieving justice and equality.</description>

			<title>Ram Madhav writes: How social media is making us all clowns</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-how-social-media-is-making-us-all-clowns-9306449/</link>
			<description>Ren Chonghao, a commentator on Chinese geopolitics, recently gave a speech referring to Chinese people as clowns, highlighting societal shifts due to industrialization and social media. He drew parallels with Johannes Gutenberg's printing press revolution in Europe, emphasizing the democratization of media. Chonghao argued that social media has decentralized narrative control, making everyone a participant in shaping public discourse. This "clowning" phenomenon, evident in elections and public debates, exposes individuals and institutions to intense scrutiny, often resulting in misinterpretation and controversy. The key, he suggests, is honesty, transparency, and the ability to laugh off criticism.</description>

			<title>Side effects of AstraZeneca vaccine: Medicine is clear now to the courts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/astrazeneca-vaccine-side-effects-9305888/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing issues surrounding the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, particularly its association with a rare adverse side effect called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). It notes a shift in the company's stance regarding the vaccine's connection to TTS and highlights a case against the Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures the vaccine under the name Covishield.

The piece explains TTS, its symptoms, and its classification, and explores why it may not have been detected in vaccine trials due to the expedited development process and the rarity of such events. It also delves into the rarity and fatality rates of TTS, as well as the varying responses of different countries to the vaccine.

Diverging views among vaccine safety experts and public health authorities regarding the risks and benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine are discussed, along with decisions made by regulatory bodies like the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization.

Finally, the article touches on the legal implications, including a potential class action lawsuit in the UK and ethical dilemmas surrounding vaccine confidence and policymaker motivations.</description>

			<title>Sanjay Jha writes | Rahul Gandhi from Rae Bareli, Priyanka a no-show: How Congress lost its UP stronghold</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rahul-gandhi-rae-bareli-priyanka-congress-lok-sabha-polls-9305341/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the author's experiences in Amethi and the political significance of the Gandhi family in the region. It discusses the anticipation around whether Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would contest the 2024 general elections from Amethi and Rae Bareli. The piece highlights the shock defeat of Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 elections and the BJP's campaign for a "Congress-mukt Bharat." It also touches on the strategic moves by the BJP, particularly Smriti Irani's role, and the unpredictable nature of elections.

The article suggests that the decision for Rahul Gandhi to contest from Rae Bareli is underwhelming and questions the Congress party's strategy and its decline in Uttar Pradesh politics since 1989. It ends with a nostalgic recollection of the author's last visit to Amethi, the spirit of Congress workers, and their affection for the Gandhi family, symbolized by the song 'Hum honge kamyaab ek din' (We shall overcome someday).

The writer identifies as a former spokesperson of the Congress party, adding a personal perspective to the narrative. The article concludes with an unrelated announcement about the release of the ICSE Class 10 and 12 results for 2024. The results will be declared on May 6 at 11 am, continuing the tradition of pen-and-paper exams, with the previous year's pass percentage for Class 12 being 96.93%, where girls outperformed boys.</description>

			<title>Hindutva’s southward journey: How BJP emerged as a major player in Karnataka</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hindutvas-southward-journey-how-bjp-emerged-as-a-major-player-in-karnataka-9305133/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political trajectory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka, highlighting how it has strategically gained ground in the state over the past three decades. Despite initial skepticism about the BJP's appeal in the South, Karnataka has emerged as a crucial stronghold for the party, contributing significantly to its national electoral success. The BJP's approach involves forming alliances with state-level parties, capitalizing on social divisions, and promoting aggressive Hindutva ideology to create a broad coalition of Hindu voters. This strategy has not only reshaped Karnataka's political landscape but also serves as a blueprint for the BJP's expansion into other states, regardless of their location. The article suggests that the BJP prioritizes short-term electoral gains over long-term social implications, positioning its southern march through Karnataka as pivotal in its pursuit of political dominance.</description>

			<title>US Fed holds rates, inflation still a hurdle</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/us-fed-holds-rates-inflation-still-a-hurdle-9304386/</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates amid lingering inflation concerns and uncertainty about its trajectory. Inflation rose to 3.5% in March, surpassing expectations, making achieving the 2% target challenging. Plans for multiple rate cuts have been delayed due to inflation uncertainty, with the Fed preferring to wait for more confidence in the inflation outlook. Despite strong US economic growth, other central banks like the ECB and Bank of England may diverge in their rate-cutting timelines. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India faces its own challenges with elevated food inflation and subdued core inflation, prompting the need for clarity on future monetary policy. Additionally, the NEET UG 2024 exam was conducted without any reported paper leaks, although there was an incident of misallocation of question papers at one center in Rajasthan.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/zendaya-challengers-indian-films-review-9303830/</link>
			<description>"Challengers," starring Zendaya, depicts a romantic entanglement between three tennis players over 13 years, showcasing desire and passion in mainstream American cinema.

The article suggests a hunger for more sensual and beautiful films among audiences, evidenced by the underperformance of recent big-budget releases. It concludes by proposing a return to portraying desire and yearning on screen as a potential remedy.</description>

			<title>Covishield’s ‘rare’ side-effects: In election season, dangers of politicising the vaccine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/covishield-side-effects-election-season-dangers-politicising-vaccine-9303640/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the public reaction to AstraZeneca's admission in court about the rare side effect of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) associated with its Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield. It emphasizes that the risk of TTS is very low, comparing it to the global risk of dying in a traffic accident, and argues that the benefits of vaccines generally outweigh the risks. The article also mentions observational studies that have identified very low risks of Guillain-Barré syndrome and brain inflammation from Covid-19 vaccines, highlighting the importance of such research in ensuring vaccine safety.

The author, a virologist, cautions against politicizing vaccines, citing a study showing higher excess mortality among Republican voters in the US after vaccines became available, likely due to political rhetoric undermining trust in science. The article concludes by reinforcing the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing excess deaths, as shown by studies from Imperial College London and Stanford University, and urges a focus on improving public health rather than dwelling on the disclosed side effects by AstraZeneca, which are not new concerns.

			<title>What obituaries about Paul Auster have missed: The answer may lie in one of his books</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/obituaries-paul-auster-books-us-writer-9303495/</link>
			<description>Paul Auster, who passed away at 77, was more than just the author of The New York Trilogy. Despite being often defined by this work, he wrote over 37 novels, memoirs, and screenplays. Auster's style, characterized by unreliable narrators and fractured masculinity, has been likened to European post-modernism, though his perspective on America reflects loss and uncertainty rather than success. Some of his lesser-known works, like "Timbuktu" and "Mr Vertigo," showcase his talent for magical realism and allegory. Unlike his contemporaries, Auster's narratives don't neatly tie character identity to larger politics but instead focus on individual stories. His exploration of themes like suicide in "Leviathan" and unlikely love in "The Brooklyn Follies" reveal his depth as a writer. Even in his later work like "4 3 2 1," Auster's mastery shines through. Through characters like Mr. Blank in "Travels in the Scriptorium," Auster examines themes of identity and creation, suggesting that the ultimate mystery in his work is the role of the writer themselves.</description>

			<title>One year after Manipur violence, what the state needs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/one-year-after-manipur-violence-what-the-state-needs-9302287/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur, India, highlighting that despite a decrease in large-scale violence, sporadic clashes and loss of life persist. The state government is criticized for not initiating dialogue between the conflicting communities, which has led to continued distrust and violence, including attacks on security forces. The article also mentions the formation of a committee by the Union Home Minister to address the conflict, but notes its struggles due to the complex societal structure of Manipur. The government's focus on cracking down on drug smuggling is acknowledged, yet it is also accused of neglecting political and administrative issues and blaming problems on illegal migrants. The need for comprehensive economic, political, and administrative measures to heal the state is emphasized, with a warning that the current government's failure to recognize this could be detrimental to Manipur's recovery from a year of strife.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/surya-tilak-at-ram-temple-and-the-state-of-science-9302313/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Surya Tilak project at the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which aims to direct sunlight onto the idol's forehead during the festival of Ram Navami. This festival follows a lunisolar calendar, making it challenging to consistently position the mirrors to direct sunlight accurately. The project involved scientists and engineers from government-funded institutions like the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and the Central Building Research Institute. The author questions whether government institutions should participate in projects with explicit politico-religious motives, highlighting concerns about secularism and public funding for research. Alternatives, such as private funding or competitions, are proposed. The article reflects on the broader implications of such projects for the secular character of the state and the potential shifts in public acceptance of government involvement in religious endeavors.</description>

			<description>Here's a summary of the key points from the article:

- **Political Stalemate**: The military government led by President H M Ershad and the 15-party opposition alliance have not agreed on how to end martial law and transfer power.

- **NEET UG 2024**: The National Testing Agency conducted the NEET UG 2024 exam in numerous cities in India and abroad. Despite social media rumors, the NTA has denied any paper leak, although there was an incident where Hindi medium students received English medium papers by mistake in Rajasthan.</description>

			<title>In an uncertain world, India’s trade push</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-an-uncertain-world-indias-trade-push-9302171/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the trends in global and Indian merchandise exports amidst volatile trade conditions. It highlights a decline in global trade due to various factors, including the pandemic and geopolitical conflicts. Despite this, India's merchandise exports experienced a sequential improvement in the January-March 2024 quarter. The decline in India's exports is attributed to lower international commodity prices, particularly in petroleum products. However, certain sectors like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture witnessed healthy export growth. The article also addresses concerns about declining exports in labor-intensive sectors and emphasizes the need to reverse this trend. It concludes by noting the potential for India's exports to grow, supported by upward revisions in global growth projections and bilateral free-trade agreements.</description>

			<title>Congress inheritance tax idea: Why Indian billionaires must pay</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/congress-inheritance-tax-idea-why-indian-billionaires-must-pay-9302312/</link>
			<description>The article criticizes an Indian Express editorial on wealth tax, calling it "retrograde" and out of touch with the global momentum towards taxing extreme wealth. It highlights growing support for wealth taxes worldwide, including from unexpected sources like the Indian government. The piece argues that wealth inequality in India is severe and worsening, with a small elite amassing vast riches while most people struggle. Despite this, resistance to wealth taxes persists, often citing administrative complexities and low revenue generation. However, the article suggests that with modern information-sharing mechanisms, targeting only the super-rich for wealth taxes is feasible and could generate significant revenue without burdening the majority. It concludes by pointing out that the main obstacle to such policies is the lobbying power of the wealthy elite.</description>

			<description>Paul Auster, a renowned writer known for intertwining fact and fiction, passed away at 77. Throughout his career, epitomized by works like "The New York Trilogy" and "Moon Palace," Auster delved into themes of identity, love, and loss. His fascination with chance, stemming from a childhood encounter with death, permeated his writing, notably explored in his novel "4 3 2 1." Auster viewed writing as a pursuit of truth through the lens of fiction, acknowledging the inherent lies in storytelling. His legacy endures in his profound exploration of the human experience.</description>

			<description>The article discusses improvements in Delhi's air quality, noting fewer days with high pollution levels in April compared to previous years.

			<description>The article highlights the issue of forced evictions and home demolitions in India, particularly in the context of elections.

The term "domicide" is introduced to emphasize the profound impact of destroying someone's home, going beyond mere demolition.

The author advocates for using "domicide" to accurately capture the gravity of destroying homes and to recognize it as a form of violence against inhabitants.</description>

			<title>In Myanmar, a weakening junta and an uncertain political future</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/myanmar-weakening-junta-and-uncertain-political-future-9300944/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the weakening position of the Myanmar junta amidst ongoing internal conflict, as highlighted by Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. Recent developments, including loss of control over territories and challenges in military recruitment, suggest a decline in the junta's power. Despite this, major cities remain under junta control, and the military still possesses superior weaponry. However, the article suggests that the outcome of the conflict may not solely depend on military strength. While external actors may consider striking deals with the junta, the ultimate decision lies with the people of Myanmar. The article concludes that further escalation of conflict will only lead to more suffering without a resolution, emphasizing the need for a political solution.</description>

			<title>Sam Pitroda’s inheritance tax idea: The rich will not pay and middle class will suffer</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sam-pitroda-inheritance-tax-congress-9300855/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contentious issue of inheritance tax and its implications in India. It begins by mentioning Congress leader Sam Pitroda's suggestion to debate the implementation of inheritance tax, drawing a parallel with the US where a significant portion of the deceased's wealth is taxed. The Congress party, however, has distanced itself from Pitroda's views.

The author then explains that while inheritance tax exists in various forms in countries like South Africa, Brazil, and the US, emerging economies such as India and China do not have this provision. The article argues that inheritance tax is not an effective tool for equitable wealth distribution, as the wealthiest can easily avoid it, leaving the middle class to bear the burden.

The article outlines several reasons why implementing an inheritance tax could be detrimental to India's economic growth and middle-class aspirations. These include disincentives for wealth accumulation, forced asset sales by beneficiaries, significant resistance due to its visibility, administrative burdens, and the potential to exacerbate wealth inequality rather than reduce it.

Furthermore, the author points out that India's lack of a robust social security system means that people rely on family support, and introducing an inheritance tax could worsen investment and wealth generation, encourage capital flight, and drive young talent abroad.

The article concludes by suggesting that India's economic future looks promising, with the capital market reaching new heights and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to make India the third-largest economy. However, discussing the implementation of an inheritance tax is seen as a step backward and counterproductive to the nation's growth and the aspirations of India's youth. The author advocates for wealth and income equality through inclusive wealth creation efforts rather than taxation that negatively affects aspirations.

The writer identifies as a professor of finance and a member of the BJP, indicating a political perspective on the matter. The article also briefly mentions India's External Affairs Minister's comments on Nepal's new currency note and India's stance on national security and relations with China, which are unrelated to the main topic of inheritance tax.</description>

			<title>Prajwal Revanna case: My moral outrage, as an MLA and a woman</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/prajwal-revanna-sexual-abuse-clips-karnataka-jds-9299837/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the serious allegations against Prajwal Revanna, a Member of Parliament from Hassan, Karnataka, and grandson of a former Prime Minister of India. He is accused of being a sexual predator, with his actions leading to one of the most significant sexual abuse cases in India's recent history. The author, a Congress MLA from Karnataka, expresses deep concern for the women affected by Revanna's actions, emphasizing the need for justice and dignity for them. The MLA criticizes the political system and media for potentially exploiting the situation for political gain while neglecting the victims' suffering.

The article highlights that Revanna allegedly used his political influence to lure and coerce women, with a Special Investigation Team appointed to determine the criminality of his offenses. It also points out the moral failure of political parties, as leaders from both the BJP and JD(S) were reportedly aware of Revanna's actions but chose to overlook them for political reasons. The MLA calls for accountability and action from all political parties, not just selective outrage, and urges citizens to speak up against such abuses of power.

			<description>The article discusses anomalies in the electoral process observed in the Surat and Indore Lok Sabha constituencies during the 2019 general elections, where BJP candidates won by large margins amidst controversy.

The Election Commission is urged to investigate these anomalies to uphold the sanctity of the nomination and poll process, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding citizens' fundamental right to vote.</description>

Meanwhile, Lt-Governor P G Gavai's inaugural address at the Delhi Metropolitan Council led to opposition members walking out in protest against the administration's failure to tackle extremism.

			<title>What binds Prajwal Revanna, Brij Bhushan Singh, Kuldeep Sengar – a system that treats women as dispensable</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/prajwal-revanna-brij-bhushan-system-that-treats-women-as-dispensable-9299533/</link>
			<description>Prajwal Revanna, a JDS MP and joint BJP-JDS candidate in Hassan, fled to Germany amid allegations of sexual assault on women, including government employees. Despite prior knowledge of his behavior, no action was taken, and he was even endorsed by the Prime Minister. This highlights a pattern of political parties protecting individuals with serious allegations against them. Democratic politics, purportedly about the common good, often prioritizes power acquisition over ethical standards. Public outrage, rather than internal accountability mechanisms, drives action against offenders. Despite rhetoric on women's empowerment, issues like respect, equality, and security remain on the periphery, with representation alone insufficient for true empowerment. The top-down nature of power acquisition and exercise exacerbates a culture of impunity, where individual women bear the burden of pursuing accountability. Revanna's case exemplifies how systemic impunity not only harms those who speak up but also diminishes those who operate within it.</description>

			<title>Resignation of Arvinder Lovely – a symptom of all that’s wrong with Congress</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/resignation-arvinder-lovely-symptom-wrong-congress-9298613/</link>
			<description>The resignation of Delhi Congress president Arvinder Singh Lovely reflects deeper issues within the party, highlighting a trend of opportunism over commitment. Despite holding key positions during the party's rule, figures like Lovely shifted allegiances when power seemed elsewhere. The writer suggests that relying on such defectors, especially during critical times like elections, is a mistake. They argue that the current political landscape demands resilient leaders, contrasting Congress' lackluster performance with AAP's proactive approach, despite challenges. With BJP facing anti-incumbency sentiments and shifting public concerns, the alliance between Congress and AAP could offer a formidable opposition. The article emphasizes the need for Congress to rejuvenate with new leadership and ideas, moving away from old faces and opportunistic politics.</description>

			<title>Rahul Gandhi’s call for a social ‘X-ray’ is divisive and based on outdated ideas</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rahul-gandhi-call-social-x-ray-divisive-outdated-ideas-9298177/</link>
			<description>The article critiques Rahul Gandhi's recent speeches and the Congress party's manifesto, suggesting they reflect a return to outdated socialist ideologies. Gandhi's proposal for extensive socio-economic surveys and caste censuses is likened to Maoist doctrines, potentially leading to economic and social chaos. The emphasis on wealth redistribution along caste lines is criticized for disregarding economic principles and risking India's demographic dividend. The article warns against the consequences of such policies, advocating for inclusive growth strategies instead. It highlights the importance of scrutinizing regressive proposals to maintain India's unity in diversity and avoid societal division.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the recent allegations of sexual abuse against Prajwal Revanna, a JD(S) candidate from Hassan, Karnataka, bringing attention to the broader issue of power dynamics in politics and the deeply entrenched patriarchal nature of Indian society.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/from-mdh-to-ceralac-and-cadbury-where-is-the-regulator-9297878/</link>
			<description>Recent concerns have surfaced regarding India's food safety regulations, particularly regarding products such as infant food, health drinks, and spices.

Similar issues have arisen with US customs declining entry to MDH spice shipments due to salmonella contamination. The FSSAI, established in 2008, faces challenges due to staff and infrastructure shortages, leading to perceived regulatory lapses. Despite its mandate to ensure food safety and educate businesses and consumers, controversies persist, highlighting the need for a more proactive regulator. The article emphasizes the importance of updating standards and supporting exporters to maintain India's credibility in the global food market.</description>

			<description>The Congress-I secured an absolute majority in Mizoram, ending the five-year rule of the Peoples Conference. They captured 18 out of 28 seats in the Assembly, with one election countermanded due to a candidate's assassination. Meanwhile, China reiterated its concerns about US arms sales to Taiwan despite talks between President Reagan and Chinese leaders.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/childcare-leave-policy-supreme-court-maternity-leave-ccl-female-employees-9297771/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the childcare leave (CCL) policy in India, which grants 730 days of paid leave to female government employees for child care. It questions the gender-specific nature of the policy, suggesting it may reinforce inequitable norms by assuming mothers are the primary caregivers. The Supreme Court's ruling on a CCL denial case in Himachal Pradesh is mentioned, highlighting the policy's complexity and its non-binding nature on states. The article also addresses the limited applicability of pro-women laws in India due to the small size of most firms and suggests a broader approach to childcare responsibilities. It proposes the 3Rs framework: Recognize, Reduce, and Redistribute childcare responsibilities, emphasizing the need for societal investment in the care economy to uphold mothers' constitutional rights and acknowledge childcare as a social necessity. The writer's views are personal and not related to the political content mentioned at the end, which is unrelated to the main topic.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the rising trend among Gen Z for nostalgia-driven products, particularly focusing on the recent unveiling of the Boring Phone during Milan Design Week. Created by Heineken Beer and Bodega, this phone eschews modern features like apps and cameras, appealing to those seeking simplicity reminiscent of past decades. The article highlights other examples of this trend, such as the revival of the Nokia 3310 and the resurgence of old fashion styles. It suggests that the appeal of such "boring" products lies in their ability to tap into nostalgia and serve as a form of rebellion against the tech-dominated present.</description>

			<title>Beyond life vs choice: The legal gaps for born-alive children of abortions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/beyond-life-vs-choice-the-legal-gaps-for-born-alive-children-of-abortions-9296739/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India recently addressed a critical case involving a 14-year-old rape survivor seeking a late-stage abortion. While the court emphasized the importance of the survivor's health, it highlighted a broader issue: the lack of discourse on the fate of born-alive children resulting from failed abortions. Absence of guidelines leaves these children vulnerable, raising questions about their rights and care. Constitutional principles mandate protection for such children, requiring clear policies and medical support. The writer suggests adopting measures similar to the US Born-Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act and enhancing awareness of abortion laws to ensure timely access to rights for survivors. Bridging regulatory gaps is crucial for safeguarding born-alive children and empowering survivors.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rishi-sunak-rwanda-bill-can-give-flight-to-tory-aspirations-9295906/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the passing of the Safety of Rwanda Bill in Westminster, following a Supreme Court ruling against the government's deportation plans to Rwanda. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced challenges within his party due to the court's verdict. The bill designates Rwanda as a "safe country" for asylum seekers, but critics question its effectiveness and the lack of evidence supporting Rwanda's designation. Despite concerns, the government aims to send a signal to deter asylum seekers, overlooking broader migration issues such as legal pathways. Sunak's leadership amidst electoral challenges is highlighted, with the Rwandan policy seen as crucial for Tory electoral prospects. However, failure to implement it could harm the party's chances.</description>

			<description>The US recently passed a $94 billion military assistance package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, signifying a political win for President Biden. Despite initial Republican resistance, bipartisan support was achieved after overcoming internal divisions. Former President Trump's absence from the issue made it easier for Biden.

			<title>How to care for an ageing population</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/for-future-ready-seniors-9295872/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the demographic shift in India towards an aging population, with projections indicating a significant increase in the number of people over 60 years old. This shift, driven by declining fertility rates and longer lifespans, necessitates a reevaluation of health and social care systems, particularly for in-home care. The expansion of home care services includes daily living assistance, nursing care, and specialized care, which can potentially reduce hospital visits and costs.

However, the sector faces challenges such as the lack of standardization, shortage of trained and empathetic caregivers, and the absence of grievance redressal mechanisms. The cost of in-home care is also high, with the private sector currently dominating the market. Policy interventions are suggested to address these issues, including recognizing home care as a legitimate form of care and employment, tailoring care to the home environment, improving caregiver training and career progression, and developing a comprehensive policy for home-based care that ensures transparency, accountability, and insurance coverage.

Special attention is called for policies to support older women, who often outlive men and may spend their later years alone. The article emphasizes the need for collaboration between various ministries to implement reforms and highlights the importance of caring for the elderly as a moral and ethical responsibility, drawing parallels with Japan's experience. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019, is mentioned as a legislative effort to regulate home-based care, although it has not been passed since its introduction.

The article concludes by stressing the importance of not neglecting the needs of the older population while focusing on preparing the youth for the future, as both are crucial for the country's economic contribution and societal well-being. The writer is identified as a specialist in Health Systems Governance. The unrelated content about the NEET UG 2024 exam has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-pm-modi-lok-sabha-elections-370-seats-target-9295839/</link>
			<description>The article discusses Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition for a massive electoral victory, aiming for 370 Lok Sabha seats for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Despite the potential for significant constitutional changes with such a victory, doubts arise regarding the necessity of such a majority for implementing reforms, especially considering past instances of significant reforms without overwhelming parliamentary support. Furthermore, the article delves into the political dynamics within the BJP, highlighting concerns among party members about the concentration of power under Modi's leadership and the potential marginalization of senior leaders. It also touches upon the shifting power dynamics between Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), as well as the preferences of business leaders and regional politicians for a less authoritarian prime minister. Lastly, it contrasts the economic growth rates under "powerful" versus "weak" prime ministers, suggesting that less centralized leadership may foster better economic outcomes.</description>

			<title>April 29, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Modinagar remained tense following a bloody clash at Modi Textile Mills</title>

			<description>Here's a summary of the key points from the article:

- **Modinagar Clash**: A violent confrontation between two unions at Modi Textile Mills in Modinagar led to the deaths of Ram Nath and Khushiram, both from the Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), and serious injuries to another HMS member, Bhagwan Singh.
- **Akal Takht Efforts**: Giani Kirpal Singh, the Jathedar of the Akal Takht, is working with other high priests to unite various Sikh leader factions and restore peace in the Golden Temple complex. Despite some Akali Dal members' desire for a directive ("hukamnama"), it is unlikely to be issued.
- **Deng Xiaoping on Taiwan**: Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping assured US President Ronald Reagan that Taiwan's relationship with the US would not change after a peaceful reunification with China, suggesting increased cross-strait contacts and negotiations.
- **SGPC Walkout**: A walkout by SGPC members and Akali Dal activists signaled the end of the Akali Dal (Talwandi) group, with the general secretary stating their intention to follow the "path of truth."

The article also mentions the National Testing Agency's (NTA) administration of the NEET UG 2024 exam across various cities, addressing false social media claims of a paper leak and clarifying an error where Hindi medium students received English medium question papers at one center in Rajasthan. The exam saw 23 lakh candidates register, with the highest numbers from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.</description>

			<title>Telangana student suicides: Listen to their cry for help</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/telangana-student-suicides-cries-for-help-9295888/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the tragic suicides of seven students in Telangana following their intermediate exam results, highlighting the ongoing issue of student stress and the need for systemic change. Despite counseling services and government appeals to students to not lose hope, the deaths indicate deeper issues within the educational system. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows a significant rise in student suicides, with over 13,044 cases in 2022, suggesting that academic pressure and parental expectations are major contributing factors. The competitive nature of schools and coaching centers exacerbates this problem, leading to rote learning and a lack of meaningful engagement with education.

The article emphasizes the importance of emotional well-being, as outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and the need for schools to have support systems to help students cope with stress. It also points out the gap between the country's economic realities and the aspirations fueled by the education system.

			<title>From the Opinions Editor: In election campaigns, not much talk of climate change</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/elections-campaigns-climate-change-9295405/</link>
			<description>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for severe heatwaves in Eastern India, particularly West Bengal and Odisha. Climate change is exacerbating these heatwaves, with humidity intensifying the discomfort. Recent incidents, such as Union Minister Nitin Gadkari fainting at a rally due to heat, highlight the urgency. Experts emphasize the health risks, including dehydration and heatstroke, urging preventive measures. Rising temperatures, compounded by humidity, pose challenges, with severe impacts on public health discussed by experts. The article emphasizes the need for proactive policies to mitigate climate change's adverse effects, citing the Supreme Court's recognition of citizens' rights to be safeguarded from global warming. However, environmental issues remain sidelined in Indian politics, despite their crucial importance. With India's vulnerability to extreme weather events increasing, addressing climate change becomes imperative for sustainable development and economic stability.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-cant-a-film-made-with-indian-funding-compete-at-cannes-9294929/</link>
			<description>Payal Kapadia's film, "All We Imagined as Light," making it to Cannes is a moment of pride for India and offers hope to emerging filmmakers. Kapadia's success highlights the trend of Indian filmmakers collaborating internationally for broader exposure and opportunities. While global platforms offer benefits like higher budgets and networks, there are challenges such as compromising creative integrity and homogenizing content. To address these issues, there's a call for state bodies like the National Film Development Corporation to support diverse narratives and filmmakers. The article urges for a collective approach among filmmakers to navigate through challenges and push boundaries of storytelling. Kapadia's nomination serves as a reminder for India to revive support for independent filmmakers from within the industry and state-funded bodies.</description>

			<title>Mr Modi rewrites Congress’s manifesto</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mr-modi-rewrites-congresss-manifesto-9294190/</link>
			<description>In a surprising move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took it upon himself to re-write the Congress's manifesto, incorporating his own thoughts and ideas. This came after dissatisfaction with his own party's manifesto, which he felt lacked impact. Modi's embellishment of the Congress's manifesto included exaggerated claims about their policies, sparking a coordinated attack from his colleagues. Despite Modi's efforts to discredit the Congress's manifesto, it gained significant attention for its promises on various socio-economic issues. This attention seemed to irk Modi, leading him to portray the document negatively. However, the Congress's manifesto remained unscathed, prompting Modi to resort to imaginary attacks. The article suggests that this episode highlights the BJP's fear of the Congress's manifesto's popularity and outlines key promises made by the Congress.</description>

			<title>Booker Prize name change: Not a simple racism story</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/booker-prize-name-change-not-a-simple-racism-story-9292868/</link>
			<description>The Booker Prize faces criticism for its ties to colonial exploitation, with calls for a name change due to its association with the exploitation of plantation workers in the Caribbean. Originating from Booker McConnell, whose founders profited from slavery, the Prize's history intertwines with colonialism. Criticism, like that from radio host Richie Brave, emphasizes the Prize's connection to slavery and racism. Despite alterations to acknowledge this history, questions persist about the Prize's legacy. Such critiques echo sentiments expressed by past winners, like John Berger, who condemned the Prize's sponsor in 1972. As the Prize grapples with its past, it prompts reflection on the role of history and contradictions in literature.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-dev-anands-amir-garib-to-abhishek-bachchans-guru-redistribution-is-bad-politics-9292800/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the historical context and evolution of wealth redistribution policies in India from the 1950s to the present day. Initially, there was broad political acceptance of measures like land reforms and high taxation on the wealthy, aimed at reducing income and wealth inequality. However, over time, there has been a significant shift in public attitudes and economic structures, with wealth now being more financially dispersed. Despite rising income inequality, the growing middle and propertied classes have altered the political landscape, making radical redistribution policies less feasible. The article suggests that addressing inequality may now require a focus on job creation, education, skill development, and progressive taxation rather than traditional redistribution methods.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-sc-verdict-on-childcare-leave-opens-up-possibilities-for-women-9291069/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, emphasized the constitutional entitlement of women to participate in the workforce, highlighting Article 15's protection against discrimination and provision for special measures for women.

Despite recent legal reforms mandating childcare services, implementation remains inadequate. Initiatives by some state governments are noted, but there's a call for sustained efforts and budget allocation.

			<title>Medium budgets, big ambitions: Why Malayalam cinema is dominating the box office</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/malayalam-cinema-box-office-success-budget-9289874/</link>
			<description>The recent surge in popularity of Malayalam cinema outside Kerala can be attributed to three key factors. Firstly, the industry's smaller market size encourages experimentation with stories and characters, leading to fresher and more innovative content compared to larger markets like Tamil or Telugu. Secondly, focusing on medium-sized films allows for greater artistic expression and technical superiority within a reasonable budget range. Lastly, strategic positioning of stories with cross-cultural appeal, borrowing elements from neighboring southern states, enhances the films' marketability in new regions. This shift highlights how Malayalam cinema has creatively leveraged its limitations to expand its audience base, raising questions about the approach of other southern film industries.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-not-thinking-enough-has-cost-humans-a-good-society-9289188/</link>
			<description>The article highlights the paradox of human cognition: while we celebrate our capacity for higher-level thinking, the reality is that many individuals struggle with complex reasoning. This cognitive weakness carries significant societal costs, hindering participation in knowledge-driven societies and undermining public discourse. With the rise of AI, the need for higher-order thinking skills becomes even more pressing. The article suggests incorporating "human cognition" as a compulsory subject in education to promote meta-cognition, enabling individuals to understand and improve their thinking processes. Recognizing deficient human cognition as a public policy issue is crucial for addressing its impacts on economic productivity, social harmony, and governance.</description>

			<title>UK’s Rwanda Bill: Why it’s a solution that doesn’t work</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uks-rwanda-bill-why-its-a-solution-that-doesnt-work-9289157/</link>
			<description>The UK government has passed the controversial "Rwanda Bill," allowing asylum seekers who entered the UK illegally after January 1, 2022, to be sent to Rwanda for processing. Regardless of their asylum status, they cannot return to the UK. The bill is seen as a deterrent to those crossing the English Channel in small boats. Similar offshore processing arrangements exist elsewhere, such as Australia's use of Nauru. These policies reflect Western governments' emphasis on border control and sovereignty, while also attempting to maintain a semblance of compassion. However, the emergence of an "asylum economy" raises concerns about neo-colonial relationships between wealthy and poor nations. There is little indication that these policies address the root causes of migration, and questions remain about their effectiveness and ethical implications.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the phenomenon of forgetfulness, as highlighted by Uber India's annual 'Lost and Found Index', which lists items left behind in cabs. It notes that Delhi ranks as the most forgetful city, and evenings, particularly around Diwali, are times when people tend to be more absent-minded. The piece references Lisa Genova's book "Remember: The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting", emphasizing the importance of both remembering and forgetting for a balanced and healthy mental state. It cites the story 'Funes the Memorious' by Jorge Luis Borges to illustrate the burden of an infallible memory. The article concludes by suggesting that while losing items like keys or phones can be frustrating, the ability to forget is a small price to pay for a happy life. Additionally, it briefly mentions the NEET UG 2024 exam, dismissing social media claims of a paper leak and noting the mix-up of question papers at one center in Rajasthan.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-uks-rwanda-bill-cruelty-as-policy-9289159/</link>
			<description>Refugees and asylum-seekers, driven by desperation to escape various dangers, including poverty and persecution, have been attempting to enter the UK, often risking their lives on dangerous boat crossings. The recent passage of the Rwanda Bill by the Rishi Sunak government aims to address this issue by deporting some asylum-seekers to Rwanda for assessment. However, critics argue that this policy, originating from Boris Johnson's administration, is morally and legally problematic, as Rwanda's human rights record raises concerns. Furthermore, the bill's efficacy and financial viability are questioned, with calls for a more streamlined asylum and immigration process instead. Despite government assurances, the bill's reliance on xenophobic sentiments is criticized, highlighting the need for more humane and effective policies.</description>

			<description>Sam Pitroda's endorsement of an inheritance tax has sparked concern, evoking memories of India's socialist past despite its previous abolition by the Congress party. Critics view this proposal as regressive and impractical, emphasizing the party's failure to learn from history. While acknowledging the need to address wealth concentration and uplift marginalized communities, the manner in which Rahul Gandhi intertwines this issue with wealth redistribution raises apprehensions. With India's evolving wealth landscape and increasing participation in wealth creation, such proposals risk undermining the progress made since the economic reforms of 1992. The article warns against hasty measures for political gains, urging the Congress to exercise caution in its economic policies.</description>

			<description>The Congress party's manifesto, unveiled on April 5, stirred both excitement and skepticism with its bold proposals addressing various societal issues. Rahul Gandhi emphasized the manifesto's focus on social justice, particularly highlighting the need for a caste census to address inequities.

However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi misrepresented the manifesto, falsely claiming it advocated wealth redistribution to Muslims, sparking unfounded fears. Despite these misconceptions, the manifesto does not propose such measures. The article emphasizes the importance of addressing caste-based inequality and clarifies that the Congress has no intention of seizing private wealth. It urges readers to read the manifesto themselves to discern the truth.</description>

			<title>Why all parties in West Bengal need Matuas on their side</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/all-parties-west-bengal-matuas-on-their-side-9288165/</link>
			<description>The Matuas of Bengal are in focus due to the recent Citizenship (Amendment) Rules and the ongoing elections. Four key factors influencing Matua voting are the citizenship issue, communal polarization, political use of Matua icons, and internal family disputes. The citizenship conundrum, stemming from the recent notification, has left Matuas uncertain about their status and political allegiance. Communal polarization tactics by parties, along with the deification of Matua figures, further complicate the landscape. Additionally, factionalism within the Thakur family, who hold religious authority, shapes Matua politics, with the BJP merging Matua identity with Hindutva, while the TMC seeks to maintain its influence. The evolving dynamics may determine who benefits from Matua votes in the elections.</description>

			<title>When villagers kill a leopard: The need for co-existence</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/when-villagers-kill-a-leopard-the-need-for-co-existence-9288006/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the increasing incidents of leopards being lynched in southern Rajasthan and other parts of India due to conflicts with humans. The primary reason for this animosity stems from leopards preying on livestock, impacting people's livelihoods. Historically, humans have targeted these animals for the loss they cause, leading to extensive hunting. The piece suggests practical solutions for coexistence, such as providing alternative food sources for leopards and increasing the population of their natural prey through conservation measures. It emphasizes the adaptability and elusive nature of leopards, urging for peaceful coexistence rather than conflict.</description>

			<title>Age is just a number — a study may help make the argument</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/age-is-just-a-number-a-study-may-help-make-the-argument-9287244/</link>
			<description>The perception of old age is shifting, as revealed by a study in Psychology and Aging. The threshold for being considered "old" has moved forward over time, and older individuals tend to perceive old age as further away. While some view this as denial or vanity, it could also reflect a more positive outlook on aging. Factors such as extended adolescence due to economic challenges contribute to this shift. Despite societal pressure to stay youthful, feeling young for longer can be beneficial. The NEET UG 2024 exam was conducted in various cities with no evidence of paper leaks, although some administrative errors occurred.</description>

			<title>Express View on child care leave: Bringing up a child</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-child-care-leave-bringing-up-a-child-9287243/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India, led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, has emphasized the importance of child care leave (CCL) for women's workforce participation through a judgment that could significantly impact female employment. The case involved an assistant professor from Himachal Pradesh who was denied CCL for her child with a genetic disorder due to the absence of such a provision in the state. The Court has directed the state to consider policy changes, highlighting that women's workforce participation is not only a privilege but also a constitutional right.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey Report 2022-23 indicates a rise in female labor force participation to 37%, a 4.2% increase from the previous year. Despite this, women in India still undertake a disproportionate amount of unpaid work, which is often a barrier to their career progression. The report suggests that addressing the care responsibilities borne by women, including motherhood, housekeeping, and elderly care, is crucial for their continued professional growth.

The article also discusses the need for progressive legislation and infrastructure investment to support child and elder care, advocating for a gender-neutral approach to care work. This includes extending CCL to all employees, regardless of gender, to support the evolving nature of families and to challenge existing stereotypes. By 2050, with the expected rise in the senior citizen population to 20.8%, such measures will become increasingly important.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-editorial-indian-express-didnt-write-9287242/</link>
			<description>The article is a critical editorial on the role of the Opposition in India, emphasizing the importance of constructive criticism over divisive rhetoric. It discusses recent controversial statements by Opposition leaders, including Mamata Banerjee and members of the TMC and Congress, which have been seen as communal, violent, and undermining democratic values. The editorial argues that while the Opposition's role is to hold the government accountable, there is a need for responsible dialogue that unifies rather than divides. It calls for Opposition leaders to elevate public discourse, respect India's diversity, and lead by example, even in disagreement. The article concludes by noting the ongoing search operations in Jammu and Kashmir following an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes: Why voters’ silence is making the BJP nervous</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/voters-silence-bjp-lok-sabha-polls-9286294/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current general election in India, highlighting a sense of ennui and silence, with a decrease in voter turnout. Despite the BJP being the frontrunner, there is a lack of visible enthusiasm for the party, which is expected to win a majority of seats. The author suggests that the BJP's challenges include the dilution of its identity due to the inclusion of opportunists, changes in local leadership affecting social equations, and a lack of new themes to energize its base. The article also touches on the potential for boredom among voters and the BJP's reliance on Hindutva as common sense rather than an ideological passion. The BJP aims to re-energize its base by reminding them that the Hindutva project is not yet complete, amidst fears of a normal election driven by local issues rather than national fervor. The writer concludes that Modi is likely to win, but the victory may come by appealing to communal sentiments rather than aspirational ones. The writer is a contributing editor at The Indian Express.</description>

			<title>D Gukesh makes history: Viswanathan Anand’s successors are here</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/d-gukesh-makes-history-viswanathan-anands-successors-are-here-9286070/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the rise of young Indian chess players, particularly highlighting **Dommaraju Gukesh**, who at 17 years old, has earned the right to challenge **Ding Liren** for the World Chess Championship. The presence of five Indians in the Candidates tournament, including Gukesh, marks a significant moment for Indian chess, which has been seeking successors to the legendary **Viswanathan Anand**. Gukesh, once India's youngest Grandmaster at 12, outshone notable players like **Fabiano Caruana**, **Ian Nepomnichtchi**, and **Hikaru Nakamura**.

His victory is seen as a triumph for the new generation, surpassing the likes of **R Praggnanandha** and **Alireza Firouzja**. Even **Magnus Carlsen** acknowledged underestimating Gukesh's strength and stability. The article also mentions **Garry Kasparov's** praise, calling the young Indian players 'Children of Vishy on the loose'. Ding Liren himself has recognized Gukesh's maturity and unique understanding of the game, setting the stage for an exciting India-China rivalry in chess.

The article notes the burgeoning talent in Indian chess, with thousands of young players ready to emerge, supported by former players turned mentors and coaches. Gukesh's development has been carefully managed by **GM Prasanna**, avoiding over-reliance on chess engines to maintain creativity and unpredictability. This approach, however, may pose risks in the future. The Indian chess community is compared to the Soviet chess surge of the last century, with a vibrant ecosystem supporting the rise of young talents like Gukesh, who is now poised to challenge the world's best players. The article concludes with a brief unrelated mention of the NEET UG 2024 exam, refuting social media claims of a paper leak and noting the registration statistics.</description>

			<title>The power of a vote: Is there a link between voter turnout and progress?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-voter-turnout-9286009/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the voter turnout and political competition in the context of India's electoral democracy. It notes that the voter turnout in the first phase of the 18th Lok Sabha Election was 65.5%, which is 4% lower than in 2019. The article questions whether the lower turnout is due to voter apathy or ineffective electoral instruments.

It then explores the relationship between voter turnout, political competition, and human development, using the Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI) as a measure. The findings suggest no correlation between high voter turnout and SHDI values across states, nor between political competition and SHDI. However, a more hopeful sign is seen in the relationship between political fragmentation (number of candidates per electorate) and SHDI, with higher political fragmentation generally correlating with higher SHDI.

The article argues that while political competition may seem ineffective in improving lives and livelihoods, it is essential for maintaining accountability and preventing the monopolization of resources by political elites. It concludes that voting is crucial, even if the preferred candidate has low chances of winning, to ensure representation and reverse the decline in political competition observed between 2014 and 2019.

			<title>I changed political parties out of conviction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/i-changed-political-parties-out-of-conviction-gourav-vallabh-9285201/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the allegations of political bias within India's legal system, particularly against the ruling party. It argues that such accusations are unfounded and threaten the integrity of the democratic framework. The piece presents data from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to demonstrate their impartiality, noting that only a small fraction of their cases involve politicians. It emphasizes that these agencies operate under the law and are committed to upholding justice without political interference.

The article also addresses criticisms of the judiciary, stating that unwarranted attacks undermine its independence and the nation's sovereignty. It asserts that individuals join political parties based on various factors, not just legal issues, and highlights the importance of ideological alignment and visionary leadership over legal matters in political affiliations.

The author, a professor of finance who recently switched from Congress to BJP, illustrates this with his own experience, driven by disillusionment with his former party's lack of direction. The article concludes by urging stakeholders to respect India's democratic institutions and avoid divisive rhetoric, focusing on the common good. It also briefly mentions the NEET UG 2024 exam, refuting social media claims of a paper leak and noting the registration statistics.</description>

			<title>It’s not the climate, it’s us</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/its-not-the-climate-its-us-9285202/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the growing concern over climate change and its impact on the weather, which has become a common topic of conversation. It highlights the record-breaking temperatures and climate anomalies, such as delayed snowfall in the Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh regions, and the increasing frequency of heatwaves in India. The author reflects on the legacy we are leaving for future generations, emphasizing the need for a better climate future, a sentiment recognized by the Supreme Court of India as a distinct right.

The piece also shares insights from children across India, who have observed changes in their environment, such as reduced rainfall and deforestation. These observations align with global research indicating a transactional or anxiety-ridden relationship with nature among the youth. The article cites a UNICEF estimate that 76% of children in South Asia are exposed to extreme high temperatures, highlighting the vulnerability of children to the climate crisis.

The concept of Shifting Baseline Syndrome is introduced, describing how each generation's perception of environmental conditions is diminishing. The author calls for action, urging adults to listen to children's concerns about the climate and to work towards protecting the Earth for their sake. The article concludes with a personal note from the author, a children's book writer and climate advocate, on the importance of addressing climate change for the well-being of future generations.</description>

			<title>What India-Mauritius treaty amendments mean for foreign investors</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-india-mauritius-treaty-amendments-mean-for-foreign-investors-9285167/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolution of tax treaties and their impact on cross-border investments, particularly focusing on the efforts to prevent treaty abuse and tax avoidance. It highlights the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) programme by the OECD, which aims to combat the use of low-tax jurisdictions for tax avoidance. The multilateral instrument (MLI) is mentioned as a key reform that allows countries to amend tax treaties quickly to prevent abuse.

The article specifically addresses India's stance on treaty shopping and its recent amendment to the India-Mauritius treaty to close loopholes that allowed investors to route investments through Mauritius to benefit from lower taxes. This amendment includes a principal purpose test (PPT) to deny treaty benefits if the main intent of a transaction is to obtain such benefits.

Furthermore, the article touches upon India's General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) introduced in 2017, designed to respect the spirit of the law and prevent tax evasion. The potential impact of these reforms on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and the global support for a minimum tax rate are also discussed.

The writer, an associate professor at NIPFP, suggests that these changes signify a shift in policy direction, ensuring that investment decisions are not solely influenced by tax considerations. The unrelated content regarding the NEET UG 2024 exam has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court intervenes on healthcare: Why insurance model isn’t enough</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-intervenes-on-healthcare-why-insurance-model-isnt-enough-9285166/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges of healthcare costs in India and the Supreme Court's recent attention to this issue. It highlights the financial burden on patients due to high out-of-pocket expenses, which often leads to impoverishment and resentment towards healthcare workers. The Supreme Court is considering imposing CGHS rates on all hospitals to control costs, following a PIL by an NGO under the Clinical Establishment Act.

The article argues for the need for a publicly funded health system that provides free care to all citizens, funded by taxes, to eliminate financial barriers to healthcare. It traces the evolution of healthcare in India post-independence, noting the underfunding of public facilities and the rise of private healthcare, which now dominates the sector. However, private healthcare is characterized by minimal regulation, potential conflicts of interest among medical professionals, and a lack of accountability.

Political responses to the healthcare crisis have included mass insurance schemes like Aarogyasri and AB-PMJAY, but these require rationalization of healthcare costs. The Clinical Establishment Act aims to regulate the sector, but it has faced resistance. The article suggests that private healthcare is unlikely to self-regulate costs and that government subsidies already support the sector.

The Supreme Court's intervention could be significant, but it faces challenges from the industry and medical professionals. The article concludes that while legal interventions can help, substantial improvements in health equity require adequate state investment in healthcare. It also criticizes the political neglect of healthcare issues in favor of more emotive topics, despite the recent impact of Covid-19. The author, a Mumbai-based surgeon, calls for greater political commitment to healthcare reform. The unrelated content about the NEET UG 2024 exam has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-no-prime-minister-modi-rajasthan-congress-muslim-9285168/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a controversial speech by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election rally in Rajasthan, where he made divisive remarks linking the Muslim minority with infiltrators and suggesting they have more children, which could deprive the majority of their earnings. This rhetoric was seen as a step back from his previous inclusive messages and a narrowing of political debate. The article also mentions Modi's claims that his government's welfare schemes are non-discriminatory, benefiting all communities, including Muslims. It reflects on Modi's influence as a leader who has risen above India's complex social divisions, but notes that such speeches are disheartening, especially for young voters. Additionally, it reports on security operations in Jammu and Kashmir following an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>April 23, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Death and violence at Golden Temple</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/april-23-1984-forty-years-ago-death-and-violence-at-golden-temple-9285193/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the key events from the article:

- **Violence in Punjab**: In the last 24 hours, three individuals were killed by terrorists, another man was fatally assaulted in the Golden Temple complex, and a group of 32 bus passengers were robbed near Mukerian in Hoshiarpur district. The bus was en route from Patiala to Jammu when it was intercepted by four armed assailants.
  
- **UK-Libya Diplomatic Crisis**: The UK has severed diplomatic ties with Libya, expelling Libyan diplomats from the embassy in London. This follows a six-day standoff and unsuccessful negotiations after a British policewoman was shot dead, allegedly from gunfire originating within the Libyan Embassy.

- **Punjab Political Developments**: The Congress (I) leadership is seeking consultations to resolve the Punjab crisis and reinstate civilian governance. There is hope for an early resolution provided that terrorist activities do not further complicate the situation for the Akali leadership.

- **Naval Clash off Sri Lanka**: A Sri Lankan naval patrol engaged and killed thirteen individuals labeled as "terrorists" and "recruits" when they failed to halt their boat within the designated surveillance zone along the northern coast.

- **Security Operations in Jammu and Kashmir**: Joint security forces and police are conducting search operations in Poonch district's forests to locate militants behind an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy. The attack resulted in injuries to five personnel, with Corporal Vikky Pahade succumbing to his injuries and being posthumously honored by the IAF. The militants involved are believed to be highly trained.

			<title>Express View on Maldives election: Muizzu’s win, India’s pragmatism</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-maldives-election-muizzus-win-indias-pragmatism-9285180/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political landscape in the Maldives following the parliamentary elections. **President Mohamed Muizzu**, who had previously defeated his predecessor **Mohamed Solih**, secured a significant victory for his party, the **People's National Congress (PNC)**, which won 70 of 93 seats, achieving a 'super majority.' The elections were marked by an anti-India sentiment, with Muizzu's campaign and subsequent policies reflecting an "India Out" stance, including the withdrawal of Indian troops and the cancellation of a hydrographic survey agreement with India. Muizzu's administration has also sought closer ties with Beijing.

Domestically, the elections centered on issues such as corruption, the economy, and employment. The acquittal of former President **Abdulla Yameen** on corruption charges likely consolidated the ruling coalition. The article also touches on India's measured response to the Maldives' internal politics, emphasizing the importance of maintaining bilateral relations regardless of the Maldivian government's stance. It concludes with a brief mention of ongoing security operations in Jammu and Kashmir, where forces are searching for militants after an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>If Congress and CPM attack each other in Kerala, what happens to INDIA?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/congress-cpm-attack-kerala-india-9284659/</link>
			<description>The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) was formed as a coalition of opposition parties with differing ideologies to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, presenting a united front against the ruling BJP. The alliance's formation was a strategic move to address the common cause of safeguarding democracy, which they claimed was under threat.

Recently, the alliance's unity has been questioned, particularly in Kerala, where the leaders have engaged in public disputes. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioned why Kerala's Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, had not been arrested in connection with ongoing investigations into alleged financial irregularities. Vijayan retorted by referencing historical events during the Emergency period when Indira Gandhi was in power.

The internal conflicts within the INDIA bloc, especially between the Congress and the CPM in Kerala, have raised concerns about the alliance's viability and could potentially benefit the BJP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi commented on the discord, suggesting that Rahul Gandhi might abandon his constituency in Wayanad as he did in Amethi.

The article suggests that the INDIA bloc should concentrate on its stated objectives rather than internal conflicts. It emphasizes the importance of leaders using their capabilities to persuade voters of the alliance's significance, resolving internal differences, and focusing on overcoming challenges such as aligning their manifestos and selecting a prime ministerial candidate.

			<title>Four ways the Israel-Hamas-Iran conflict has led to a more volatile Middle East</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/four-ways-israel-hamas-iran-conflict-volatile-middle-east-9284319/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating conflict in the Middle East, focusing on the Israel-Hamas war and its broader implications. Here's a summary:

- **Israel-Hamas Conflict**: Six months after an attack on October 7, Israel's campaign against Hamas has led to the near-total destruction of Gaza and a humanitarian crisis. Iran and its allies have rallied behind the Palestinian cause, widening the conflict.
  
- **Iran-Israel Confrontation**: The war's dynamics changed after Iran's drone and missile strikes on Israeli military targets on April 14, in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Damascus that killed Iranian generals. Israel hadn't faced direct state attacks since 1991.

- **Media War and Diplomacy**: Claims of Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites were countered by Iran, which downed "mini drones" over Isfahan. The situation seems contained by a media narrative war, with the US playing a role in de-escalation.

- **Regional Geopolitics**: The conflict has altered regional geopolitics, including a thaw in Shia-Sunni relations, expansion of the war across the region, political moves by Sunni Arab States, and disruptions by Yemen's Houthis affecting global trade.

- **Economic Impact**: The war has economically strained Israel, with significant damage to its economy and infrastructure. Israel remains committed to its goals against Hamas, despite international pressure for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid.

- **Long-term Challenges**: The ongoing conflict poses long-term challenges for the administration of Gaza and the stability of the Middle East, with the Israel-Iran conflict likely to influence peace efforts for years.

The article concludes with the author's credentials as a security analyst and former Director General of Police. The rest of the content, including various reviews and announcements, is unrelated to the main article and has been omitted from the summary.</description>

			<description>The article, written by IPS officer Vrinda Shukla, draws parallels between India's extensive election preparations and the need for similar efforts in everyday governance, especially in remote areas.

			<title>What the global media fails to understand about India’s democracy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-the-global-media-fails-to-understand-about-indias-democracy-lok-sabha-election-9283361/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the scale and integrity of the Indian electoral process, highlighting its vast number of voters and technological embrace with over 5.5 million electronic voting machines across 1.05 million polling stations. It critiques the global media's misunderstanding of Indian democracy, citing examples of flawed assessments and contradictions in international indexes that rank other countries with significant issues above India. The piece argues that terms like "democratic backsliding" and "shrinking freedom of expression" are misapplied to India, where the electoral system remains vibrant and diverse opinions are expressed across media platforms.

It praises India's independent institutions, such as the courts and the Election Commission, for maintaining integrity above partisan politics. The article also commends Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his non-partisan recognition of political figures across the spectrum, including the awarding of the Bharat Ratna to politicians from various parties and ideologies.

The author, a former CEO of Prasar Bharat, asserts that the rule of law is upheld in India without compromising constitutional values, contrasting this with Western democracies where the law is applied unflinchingly. The article concludes by stating that those who criticize Indian democracy are inadvertently acting as agents of partisan politics, failing to recognize the vibrancy and competitiveness of India's democratic system.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/m-venkaiah-naidu-writes-the-cost-of-voter-apathy-lok-sabha-elections-low-voter-turnout-9283362/</link>
			<description>The article emphasizes the importance of voting in strengthening democracy, particularly in India where voter apathy is a significant issue. It highlights the low voter registration and turnout rates, especially among first-time and urban voters, with specific statistics from the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and various states. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has implemented strategies to increase voter engagement and participation, including targeted outreach, polling station facilitation, and leveraging social media. The article calls for active participation in the electoral process, especially from the youth, to uphold democratic principles and combat voter disenfranchisement. The former Vice-President of India, who authored the article, urges citizens to recognize the power of their vote and fulfill their responsibility to vote.</description>

			<title>Express View on Nestle controversy: Check the sugar</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-nestle-controversy-check-the-sugar-9283356/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a study that accuses Nestle of adding excessive sugar to its baby food products, specifically Cerelac, in developing countries. The International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) and Public Eye brought this issue to light, claiming an addition of 2.7g of sugar per serving. Nestle responded by stating a reduction of added sugar by over 30% in the past five years in India. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is investigating these claims, which is seen as a positive move. However, the article emphasizes that oversight should extend beyond Nestle to all baby food manufacturers.

The importance of the first two years of a child's diet is highlighted, noting that added sugars are considered "empty calories" and can lead to health issues like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and tooth decay. The article points out that India has a high number of childhood diabetes cases and that a recent Lancet study showed over 12 million children aged between five and 19 are significantly overweight.

Indian regulations specify micronutrient requirements for baby foods but lack an upper limit for added sugars. The current controversy is expected to spark debates on the quality of children's food products and potentially lead to stricter regulations and closing of regulatory gaps.</description>

			<title>From the Opinions Editor: As Lok Sabha polls begin, it’s over to the young voter</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-polls-2024-young-voters-9283096/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the initial phase of voting in India's 2024 elections, highlighting a voter turnout of around 62%, which is expected to increase slightly but remain lower than the previous general elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has encouraged people to vote, emphasizing its importance for the country's future. The article notes the historically uneven voter turnout across different states and expresses concern over the low registration of first-time voters aged 18-19, which is less than 40%.

The youth's engagement in politics through social media and protests is acknowledged, reflecting their care for social issues and desire for change. The demographic dividend of India, with a young median age and low dependency ratio, presents both opportunities and challenges for the country in terms of employment for the growing workforce.

Political parties are addressing the aspirations of young voters in their manifestos. The BJP's Sankalp Patra focuses on education and social justice, while the Congress's Nyaya Patra emphasizes jobs and governance, proposing a right to apprenticeship with a stipend for young people under 25 with a diploma degree.

The article concludes by suggesting that political parties should pay attention to how young voters are participating in the elections, as their involvement will shape the future of Indian democracy. The summary omits unrelated content and advertisements.</description>

			<title>Warmer Moscow-Beijing ties are a chilling signal for New Delhi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/warmer-moscow-beijing-ties-india-chilling-signal-9282828/</link>
			<description>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's visit to China highlighted three significant outcomes from India's perspective. Firstly, the strategic alignment between China and Russia was evident, with both nations opposing Western hegemony and seeking a multipolar world order. They equated Western alliances like NATO with regional groupings such as the Quad, which India finds misleading and problematic due to its involvement in these minilateral arrangements.

Secondly, China and Russia aim to use platforms like the Global South, BRICS, and SCO to promote an anti-Western narrative and shape a world order that respects major powers' sovereign interests. This vision contrasts with India's approach to international relations, which seeks equal representation rather than dominance.

Lastly, Lavrov's discussions about forming a new security structure in Eurasia reflect the deepening Sino-Russian partnership, which is concerning for India given its tense relations with China and reliance on Russian arms.

The article also notes challenges in the China-Russia relationship, such as their differing economic interests with the West and the reliance on the Putin-Xi dynamic, indicating potential cleavages in their partnership.

			<title>Writers in an election year: Remember, we are the joke</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/writers-in-an-election-year-remember-we-are-the-joke-9282408/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the nature of fiction writing, particularly in the context of political events like elections. The author suggests that fiction writers are akin to those who extrapolate from insufficient data, as they create stories from a deep love for language and the world. This process often involves interpreting the world's tragedies and farces, and despite the lack of reciprocation from the world, writers persist in their craft through all historical events.

The piece also touches on the complexity of fiction, which cannot be reduced to a single theme or message, and how fiction inherently becomes political through the choices writers make, even when they aim to be apolitical. The author emphasizes the role of irony and satire in their work, especially during election times, and the importance of maintaining a sense of humor to avoid becoming cynical.

Lastly, the article mentions the author's upcoming book and briefly reports on ongoing security operations in Poonch district, Jammu and Kashmir, without connecting it to the main theme of the article. This unrelated content seems to be an interjection, possibly an update on current events. The focus remains on the introspective journey of a fiction writer navigating the complexities of life and politics through their writing.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-peace-subcontinent-arabia-persia-matter-9282396/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent military tensions between Israel and Iran, highlighting their efforts to demonstrate military capability without escalating the conflict. It notes the role of the Biden Administration in tempering Israel's response and Iran's preference for proxy warfare over direct confrontation with the US. The piece also touches on the broader regional dynamics, including the Abraham Accords and the contrasting positions of Sunni Arab states and Iran. It emphasizes India's support for the Accords and its strategic interest in promoting peace in the Middle East without directly involving itself in the Arab-Iran conflict. The article suggests that India should actively support Arab initiatives for a two-state solution in Palestine, balancing between Iran's and Israel's positions on the issue. Lastly, the article mentions the NEET UG 2024 exam conducted by NTA, refuting social media claims of a paper leak and noting the mix-up of question papers in Rajasthan.</description>

			<title>How Bengaluru’s lakes disappeared</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bengaluru-water-crisis-water-scarcity-deccan-hills-agrarian-economy-9281769/</link>
			<description>Bengaluru is facing an acute water crisis in the summer of 2024, with predictions of running out of water by 2025. Historically, the city has been prone to water scarcity due to its geographical location and lack of major rivers. In the past, the city's lakes, dating back to the 9th century CE, were integral to the community for irrigation, fishing, farming, and cultural practices. However, British colonial rule shifted the governance and perception of these water bodies, leading to their decline in importance.

The introduction of piped water in 1892 further diminished the role of lakes, which were often filled in for urban development. Research highlights the loss of interconnected water systems and open wells, contributing to flash floods and droughts. In the context of climate change, the article emphasizes the need to restore peripheral lakes and wetlands for ecological, social, and water resilience benefits. It advocates for reimagining Bengaluru as a city of lakes, vital for the community and the environment.

The article is authored by Hita Unnikrishnan, a Research Associate at The Urban Institute of The University of Sheffield, and Harini Nagendra, Director and Professor at the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability, Azim Premji University.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: Cult worship and consequences</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/cult-worship-and-consequences-9281720/</link>
			<description>The article from the Indian Express discusses the BJP's manifesto titled "Modi Ki Guarantee," critiquing it as a shift from a political party to a cult of personality around Prime Minister Modi. The manifesto is said to repackage ongoing programs without addressing their faults and inequities, and it pushes for major constitutional changes through proposals like the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and One Nation One Election (ONOE).

**UCC** is criticized for attempting to homogenize India's diverse communities, which could lead to conflict, while **ONOE** is seen as a move to centralize power and erase regional differences. The article also accuses the BJP of using an anti-corruption crusade to target opposition parties and consolidate its base in Northern India, particularly after the construction of the Temple at Ayodhya.

The author predicts that these issues will cause heated debates in the upcoming elections, especially in states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and expresses concern over the potential for these policies to disrupt India's celebrated diversity. The article concludes with a brief mention of security operations in Jammu and Kashmir, unrelated to the main content.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the political landscape in India during the general elections, focusing on the BJP's challenges and strategies. The BJP, aiming for a third consecutive win, faces anti-incumbency and voter apathy, relying on Prime Minister Modi's influence and opposition mistakes. In Bihar, the BJP's ally JD(U) struggles with a shrinking vote base and reluctant BJP campaigners. Maharashtra presents similar challenges, with unease over the BJP's absorption of regional parties. The NCP's Ajit Pawar and his family are working to secure their political stronghold, despite internal family politics.

The Congress party is also scrutinized, with questions about Rahul Gandhi's leadership decisions, particularly candidate selections that overlook established party members. The BJP's previous dominance in Karnataka is questioned, with criticism of its hardline Hindutva approach and the sidelining of key leaders.

The article also touches on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), noting Arvind Kejriwal's controversial Rajya Sabha appointments and the departure of original party leaders due to internal conflicts. Lastly, it mentions the NEET UG 2024 exam, dismissing rumors of a paper leak and noting the registration statistics.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/lok-sabha-elections-decolonisation-narendra-modi-9281723/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political and social changes in India since Narendra Modi became prime minister, focusing on a perceived decolonization process that has displaced the old ruling class. The author, claiming to be part of this class, criticizes their detachment from Indian languages and culture, and their adherence to Western norms and the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The rise of Modi is described as a seismic shift that made the old class irrelevant, as a new breed of Indians, proficient in Hindi and less so in English, took prominent roles in society. The author suggests that despite efforts by Rahul Gandhi to connect with the common man, he fails to resonate with voters who are more attracted to Modi's governance, which has brought tangible improvements to their lives. The article concludes with the author's admission of the old ruling class's ignorance of the struggles of ordinary Indians and their continued hope for Modi's defeat, despite his popularity among rural voters.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dont-call-it-a-sellout-9281791/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complex relationship between art, ambition, and the necessity of self-promotion in the modern world. It begins with an anecdote about a museum employee in Germany who was fired for hanging his own painting in an exhibition alongside works by Picasso and Warhol, without receiving any visitor acclaim. The incident raises questions about the appropriateness of self-promotion and the difficulty of breaking into the art world. The article suggests that today's artists must engage in networking and self-promotion to succeed, contrasting with the past ideal of the artist as a pure dreamer. It also comments on how social media has changed the perception of artistic success, where visibility and attention can outweigh actual craft. The piece reflects on the 1990s ethos where selling out was scorned, noting a shift to a culture where self-promotion is necessary and even expected. The article concludes by highlighting the challenges artists face in a digitized world that values bold self-promotion over subtlety. The writer is identified as the director of Hutkay Films.</description>

			<title>Why it makes sense for Mayawati, BSP to not join NDA or INDIA</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-it-makes-sense-for-mayawati-bsp-to-not-join-nda-or-india-9281486/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political strategy of Mayawati and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the context of the general elections. It highlights Mayawati's decision to not align with any major political alliances, which is seen as a move to maintain the BSP's core voter base and bargaining power. The BSP aims to project its value for future political negotiations and to emerge as a significant force in Uttar Pradesh (UP), where it still has considerable influence.

The article also touches on the socio-economic tensions in UP between the OBC landed gentry and landless Dalit labourers, which influences the BSP's national political strategy. Mayawati faces challenges from the popularity of "Brand Modi" and the need to address the aspirations of Dalit communities benefiting from BJP's schemes, as well as the social justice-oriented approaches of the Congress and Samajwadi Party.

The writer, the director of the G B Pant Social Science Institute in Allahabad, concludes that this election is crucial for the BSP's survival and relevance, and notes that there is no apprehension among rural Dalit voters regarding the BSP's decision to not join an alliance. The selection of BSP candidates is being done with careful consideration of the social and political landscape, based on feedback from the party cadre.</description>

			<title>India’s Ambassador to Ireland crossed the political line by praising PM</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/india-ambassador-to-ireland-crossed-the-political-line-by-praising-pm-modi-9281020/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding a letter written by India's ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra, to The Irish Times. Mishra's letter, which praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and criticized the Congress party, is seen as a breach of the Indian Foreign Service's (IFS) principles of political neutrality, especially during the election period. The article argues that Mishra should have refrained from making political statements and instead focused on factual and non-political responses to defend India's image. It also highlights the potential influence such a letter could have on Indian officials abroad who are eligible to vote, suggesting that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should take notice and issue guidelines for responding to government criticism. The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining the IFS's political neutrality as a national asset. Additionally, it briefly mentions ongoing security operations in Jammu and Kashmir following an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>We live in terrible times. That’s why artists can’t lose hope</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/art-reading-literature-artists-9280928/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the role of art in society, questioning its practical impact on stopping violence, political deceit, or poverty. However, it also highlights art's ability to provide solace and hope to individuals from various walks of life after challenging days. The author acknowledges the privilege inherent in the art world and the guilt that accompanies it, but also notes the moments when art connects with people from all backgrounds, offering them new experiences and perspectives. The piece cites Toni Morrison's view that artists must work especially in times of dread, as their expression is how civilizations heal. Despite the world's tragedies and the dominance of money and facts, the author believes artists should not despair but continue their work, likening themselves to violinists on a sinking ship who play to remind others of what life sounds like. The unrelated content regarding security operations in Jammu and Kashmir has been omitted from this summary.</description>

			<title>How can India revive its investment cycle?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/reviving-the-cycle-cmie-capex-9280308/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current state of investment in India, highlighting both positive trends and areas of concern. The investment rate has improved slightly, with a notable increase in capital formation due to government housing initiatives. However, the share of plant and machinery investments has decreased. Private sector investment intentions, as reported by CMIE, are high, with a significant portion coming from the private sector, including foreign companies. Debt issuances have also increased, primarily within the financial services sector.

The power sector, particularly renewable energy, has seen the largest share of investment announcements, likely spurred by government incentives. Transport services, especially airlines, are also looking to expand significantly. Other key sectors with substantial investment announcements include chemicals, machinery, metals, and auto. However, there is a lack of investment in consumer-oriented industries, despite government schemes to encourage such investments.

The article suggests that the private investment cycle is picking up but is not broad-based and is mainly concentrated in industries benefiting from government spending. Consumer goods companies are not investing due to excess capacity and various factors affecting demand, such as lack of productive job creation, stagnant rural demand, and high inflation impacting household consumption power.

State governments have reduced their capital expenditures to meet fiscal targets, which impacts the overall investment cycle. The article concludes with the author's credentials and a separate note on security operations in Jammu and Kashmir, unrelated to the economic content.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the commencement of India's general elections in 2024, highlighting the country's journey to achieving universal adult franchise. It reflects on the historical context of voting rights, comparing India's inclusive approach to the more restrictive histories of countries like the United States. The piece emphasizes the importance of a neutral and vigilant Election Commission in safeguarding the democratic process. Additionally, it notes that 2024 is a significant year for global elections, with many countries, including the UK, USA, and South Africa, scheduled to hold elections. The article also mentions the impact of these numerous elections on global debt and highlights the unique situation of Ukraine, which could not conduct its elections due to conflict. The author, a Senior Advocate at the Supreme Court, contemplates what India's founding figures would think of the current state of its electoral democracy. The article concludes with a brief mention of ongoing security operations in Jammu and Kashmir.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-bitter-truth-about-baby-formula-is-added-sugar-9280296/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of added sugars in infant formulas, particularly in developing countries like India. It highlights a study that found a high sugar profile in 28% of baby food products, which is concerning given the increased risk of diabetes among Indians. The early introduction of sugar can cause permanent metabolic damage and increase the risk of obesity and diabetes. The article criticizes the double standards in sugar content in formulas between developed and developing countries and calls for strict regulation to address the unethical promotion of high-sugar infant formulas. It emphasizes the need for long-term studies to assess the health risks associated with these products. The author, Dr. Misra, is an expert in diabetes and advocates for stringent measures to prevent early onset of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

			<title>Express View on Maryam Nawaz’s olive branch to India: Punjabiyat diplomacy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-maryam-nawazs-olive-branch-to-india-punjabiyat-diplomacy-9280324/</link>
			<description>Maryam Nawaz, the Chief Minister of Punjab in Pakistan, addressed a gathering of Sikh pilgrims at Kartarpur Sahib, promoting peace and friendship with India. She highlighted the shared cultural ties between the Punjabis across the border and emphasized religious harmony and celebration of festivals like Eid, Baisakhi, and Holi. Her speech reflects Pakistan's current economic challenges and the government's consideration of trade with India. This outreach aligns with previous efforts to improve bilateral relations, including visits and proposals for cross-border economic cooperation that ultimately did not materialize, partly due to opposition from the Pakistan Army.

However, Maryam's recent statements suggest a shift, possibly indicating the Army's tacit support for the current government's stance towards India. Bilateral relations have been strained, particularly after the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir, with both countries holding firm to their core concerns—terrorism for India and Kashmir for Pakistan. The article suggests that the current situation may offer an opportunity for diplomatic progress, such as restoring trade ties, through quiet diplomacy similar to that which led to the 2021 ceasefire along the Line of Control.

The article also mentions ongoing security operations in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district, where forces are searching for militants who attacked an Indian Air Force convoy, resulting in injuries and the death of Corporal Vikky Pahade. The militants are believed to be well-trained.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the Venice Biennale, an international art exhibition, which is facing political challenges despite its theme of diversity and tolerance, titled "Stranieri Ovunque" (Foreigners Everywhere). The Italian Culture Minister defended the inclusion of Israel amidst calls for its exclusion, while the Israeli Pavilion remains closed until a ceasefire and hostage release agreement is reached. Historical context is provided, highlighting the Biennale's past political entanglements and its evolution to include a wider range of voices. Additionally, the article mentions ongoing security operations in Jammu and Kashmir following an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>Express View on ‘love jihad’ law: Playing to anxieties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-love-jihad-law-playing-to-anxieties-9280325/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the implications of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021, on inter-faith relationships, particularly those in live-in arrangements. It highlights how the Allahabad High Court has had contrasting rulings on providing police protection to interfaith couples, with at least 12 pleas dismissed and three granted conditional protection. The term "love jihad" is mentioned, which, despite not being legally defined or reported by central agencies, has led to paranoia and scrutiny of interfaith relationships, conflicting with the diversity principle of Indian democracy. The article points out that such anxieties have resulted in the enactment of similar laws in various states, threatening individual rights and women's independence. It emphasizes the judiciary's role in consistently upholding constitutional rights and the need for the Supreme Court to expedite hearings on related petitions. The unrelated content about security operations in Jammu and Kashmir is not included in the summary.</description>

			<title>Changes in law will just make medicines more expensive, not better</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/changes-law-medicines-more-expensive-not-better-9279623/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of patent rules on the availability and cost of medicines in India. It highlights that medicines account for a significant portion of healthcare costs, and the high prices are largely due to patenting. The Indian generic pharmaceutical industry has historically provided affordable medicines globally, but recent amendments to the patent rules threaten this by making it harder to oppose patents before they are granted, potentially leading to higher drug prices.

The piece outlines the history of India's patent laws, noting that the 1970s Patent Act, which protected only the process of making a medicine and not the product, allowed India to become a major generic drug manufacturer. However, the TRIPS Agreement of 1995 required the reintroduction of product patents, leading to the patenting of 'me-too' drugs with no significant therapeutic benefit. In response, India amended its Patent Act in 2005 to include Section 3(d), preventing the patenting of new forms of old drugs unless they offer increased therapeutic efficacy.

The article expresses concerns over recent changes that make it easier for patents to be granted without opposition, which could stifle competition and increase drug prices. It also criticizes the new requirement for opponents of patents to pay fees, which could deter patient groups and civil society organizations from filing pre-grant oppositions (PGOs). Additionally, the amendments could complicate the issuance of compulsory licenses and the enforcement of patents, as patent holders are now required to report production details every three years instead of annually.

The author, a senior Supreme Court advocate and former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, argues that these amendments favor non-deserving patents, limit competition, and ultimately harm patients by making drugs more expensive and less accessible. The article concludes by mentioning unrelated content about security operations in Jammu and Kashmir.</description>

			<title>Israel and Iran: How radical governments in both countries have crossed all the red lines</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/israel-iran-radical-governments-red-lines-9279550/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, highlighting a series of aggressive actions that have brought the shadow war between the two nations into the open. It began with an Israeli airstrike on an Iranian consular building in Damascus, which was met with an unprecedented direct missile attack from Iran on Israel. Although Iran's assault was thwarted by Israel's defense systems, the exchange has increased tensions and the potential for a broader conflict in West Asia.

The article also delves into the underlying causes of the conflict, such as existential fears, radical politics, and arrogance on both sides. It examines Iran's use of proxy militias to exert influence and defend its regime, and Israel's policies in the West Bank that deny Palestinian self-determination, contributing to regional instability.

The writer, a professor at Princeton University, argues that the denial of Palestinian rights is a core issue driving the conflict. He suggests that peace and stability in West Asia hinge on the creation of a Palestinian state, as proposed by the US and Arab states. However, the current Israeli government's refusal to acknowledge this right is seen as an obstacle to resolving the conflict and preventing further escalation. The article concludes with a call for a return to the two-state solution to ensure peace in the region.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha elections 2024: Why the Opposition fails to strike a chord</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-2024-opposition-9279278/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political climate in India during election time, focusing on the opposition's criticism of the ruling party's goal to secure 400 seats, which they claim shows a lack of a "level playing field" and hints at authoritarianism. The author argues that this ambition is not undemocratic, citing historical precedents set by the Congress party post-Independence. The piece suggests that the BJP is now the dominant party with a vision for a developed India, while the opposition is criticized for lacking a coherent vision and being stuck in old politics.

The article compares the election manifestos of the BJP and Congress, noting the BJP's focus on welfare programs without freebies, environmental sustainability, technological innovation, and specific policies like the India AI Mission and digitization initiatives. In contrast, the Congress manifesto is said to offer many freebies and lacks detail on environmental governance and technology. The Congress manifesto is noted for addressing LGBTQ+ civil unions, while the BJP focuses on identity cards for transgenders and inclusion in the Ayushman Bharat scheme.

The author concludes that the opposition fails to connect with the people's dreams, which is crucial in elections, and criticizes the opposition for not presenting a compelling narrative to the electorate. The writer's affiliation with the RSS is mentioned at the end, and an unrelated note about security operations in Jammu and Kashmir concludes the article. The summary omits advertisements and unrelated content as per your request.</description>

			<description>The Indian government's establishment of a committee to examine issues facing the LGBTQIA+ community, in compliance with a Supreme Court directive, marks a positive step. The committee aims to address systemic discrimination and violence encountered by the community in accessing social welfare schemes. Despite progress such as the decriminalization of Article 377, challenges persist. While public opinion favors same-sex marriage legalization, political action has been limited. The committee must capitalize on the Supreme Court's momentum and ensure the community's concerns are addressed.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-fdi-in-space-opening-up-9278413/</link>
			<description>The government's recent liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in the space sector aligns with efforts to position India as a space power. The policy allows increased FDI in satellite manufacturing, launch vehicles, and related components, reflecting a shift towards collaboration and private sector involvement. With India aiming to expand its share of the global space economy to over 10% by 2030, the move seeks to attract significant investments, estimated at $22 billion over the next decade. This policy change, coupled with previous initiatives like the Space Policy introduced last year, signals a departure from the past ISRO-dominated model towards a more inclusive approach involving private players. The evolving space ecosystem is seen as crucial not only for economic growth but also for addressing welfare and security objectives.</description>

			<description>The article discusses India's current economic and labor market situation. It highlights India's significant economic growth in recent decades, positioning it as a potential counterweight to China. However, the country faces challenges, particularly in employment. With a young median age and a low dependency ratio, India's demographic dividend could become a curse if not managed properly. The labor market struggles with high unemployment rates, especially among educated youth, due to the small size and low productivity of Indian firms, and a skill deficit among workers. The article suggests that the aspirations of India's young, educated workforce clash with the limited growth ambitions of small firms. It argues for a reorientation towards exports to incentivize larger, more productive firms, which could address the labor market crisis and fulfill the aspirations of the workforce. The article concludes that addressing these issues should be a priority for the government. The unrelated content and advertisements have been omitted from this summary.

			<title>After the anti-Naxal operation: Time to heal, not conquer</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/anti-naxal-operation-time-heal-not-conquer-9278116/</link>
			<description>Security forces achieved a significant victory against Maoists in Chhattisgarh, resulting in the death of 29 insurgents, including three senior commanders, along with the recovery of a substantial cache of arms. Despite government efforts to curb Maoist influence, including a claimed 73% reduction in violence since 2010, the problem persists due to the lack of a cohesive strategy and inadequate infrastructure development in cleared areas. Fundamental economic issues, such as forest displacement and extreme wealth inequality, also contribute to the ongoing conflict. The author suggests initiating peace talks with Naxal leaders as a proactive step towards resolution, drawing parallels with successful peace dialogues in the Northeast.</description>

			<title>What Iran-Israel conflict means for Middle East and India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/iran-israel-conflict-middle-east-india-9277570/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the escalating tensions in the Middle East following Iran's retaliation against an Israeli airstrike on its consulate in Damascus. Iran's counterattack involved drones and missiles, some of which breached Israel's Iron Dome defense system, causing minimal damage. The ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict continues without resolution, and there are concerns about further attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and cyberattacks, potentially leading to more instability.

The direct confrontation between Israel and Iran marks a significant escalation from their usual proxy conflicts. Both nations have crossed a line with their recent actions, and while the US and Western countries have condemned Iran's attack and called for de-escalation, Iran's regional supporters have launched their own attacks on Israel.

The article highlights the risks of a nuclear flashpoint and the potential for Iran to accelerate its nuclear ambitions. It also notes the limited progress in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Egypt.

The conflict poses a threat to regional peace, economic growth, and stability. It affects global oil prices and supply chains, and for India, it impacts the security of its diaspora in the Gulf region. The article calls for international intervention to prevent further violence and advocates for a two-state solution as the path to long-term peace and stability in the region.

The writer, a former Ambassador and Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, emphasizes India's role as a mediator due to its historical ties to the region. The article concludes with a call for diplomatic negotiations to address the cycle of violence and meet the rights and aspirations of the people involved.</description>

			<title>Work or vote? It’s a choice no citizen should have to make</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/lok-sabha-elections-work-or-vote-migrant-voters-9277092/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by internal migrants in India, who often find themselves excluded from the democratic process due to their mobility and multi-locational residence. With millions of internal migrants, primarily short-term and temporary workers, their political disenfranchisement poses significant concerns for inclusive democracy. Socio-economic factors, practical constraints, and structural barriers prevent migrants from participating in elections, including the difficulty of changing voting constituencies, financial burdens, and long distances to travel. The introduction of Remote Voting Machines (RVMs) by the Election Commission of India is seen as a positive step, although challenges remain in implementation. Additionally, the lack of essential documents like Aadhaar cards and voter IDs further marginalizes migrants. The article calls for political parties to include migrants in their election manifestos to address their issues and ensure a more inclusive democracy.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court has just put the Delhi metro on track – and given a roadmap</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-has-just-put-the-delhi-metro-on-track-and-given-a-roadmap-9276403/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's recent verdict on the DMRC-DAMEPL case, a decade-long legal battle over the Delhi Metro Airport Express Line, sets a significant precedent for arbitration and public-private partnerships. The case originated from operational issues between DMRC and DAMEPL, leading to arbitration and subsequent court battles. While the Delhi High Court initially sided with DMRC, the Supreme Court controversially restored the arbitral award to DAMEPL, causing a miscarriage of justice. However, a curative petition by DMRC was eventually granted, rectifying the error and reverting the parties to the High Court's judgment. This landmark decision underscores the importance of meticulous examination of contracts and the accountability of arbitration tribunals.</description>

			<title>After engineering splits, BJP’s troubles ahead in Maharashtra</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/after-engineering-splits-bjps-troubles-ahead-in-maharashtra-9276321/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political dynamics in Maharashtra, focusing on the BJP and Shiv Sena's struggle for dominance. It highlights the BJP's ambition to become the single dominant party in the state, despite not securing the chief ministership after the 2022-23 intrigues. The BJP's strategy has led to fragmentation within the Shiv Sena and NCP, weakening these parties and potentially benefiting the BJP. However, this approach may not translate into success in the current Lok Sabha elections, as the BJP faces challenges within the Mahayuti alliance and complicated seat-sharing processes. The BJP's tactics have also contributed to social and political turmoil in Maharashtra, raising questions about the long-term impact on the state's political and social fabric. The article suggests that the BJP's "smart politics" may not be conducive to healthy competition or social harmony, as it has led to the politicisation of bureaucracy, policy disconnection, and social unrest, particularly concerning the Maratha community. The writer, a political science professor from Pune, reflects on whether the political gains are worth the social and policy costs incurred.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the contrasting outcomes of two incidents involving museum staff and their artwork. While the discovery of an uncatalogued painting led to its identification and sale, a technician's attempt to promote his own artwork backfired, resulting in his dismissal and legal action. The piece reflects on the blurred lines between personal ambition and professional boundaries in the art world, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals seeking recognition. Additionally, it briefly mentions security operations in Jammu and Kashmir following an attack on an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>Express View on BJP in Tamil Nadu: Sense of an opening</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-bjp-in-tamil-nadu-sense-of-an-opening-9276322/</link>
			<description>In the final leg of his campaign in Coimbatore, BJP candidate K Annamalai expresses confidence in the party's performance in Tamil Nadu, aiming for double-digit seats and a strong presence. The BJP sees Tamil Nadu as crucial in its goal of significant electoral gains. However, overcoming the entrenched dominance of Dravidian politics presents challenges. Historically, national parties have struggled to gain traction in Tamil Nadu. BJP attempts to address this by emphasizing state-specific issues and distancing itself from a perception of centralizing tendencies. Culturally, the party strives to bridge the gap between Hindi-speaking leadership and Tamil heritage. Despite facing skepticism, the BJP aims to establish itself as a viable alternative in Tamil Nadu's political landscape.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/april-18-1984-forty-years-ago-hindu-leader-killed-9276397/</link>
			<description>In Punjab and Chandigarh, six people were killed and eight injured within 24 hours, with a night curfew imposed in Patiala and tensions escalating at the Golden Temple Complex in Amritsar. The conflict between Akali Dal chief Harchand Singh Longowal and militant Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale intensified, prompting a cautious government response. Opposition parties united to criticize the government's failure to address national unity, unemployment, and inflation, though they clarified they wouldn't contest elections together. In Maharashtra, 13 Congress (I) MLAs cross-voted in Legislative Council elections, surprising party leaders. Additionally, the NEET UG 2024 exam was conducted across numerous cities, refuting social media claims of paper leaks.</description>

			<title>Express View on Indian ambassador’s rejoinder to Irish Times editorial: Undiplomatic</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indian-ambassadors-rejoinder-to-irish-times-editorial-undiplomatic-9276368/</link>
			<description>Indian diplomats stationed abroad should represent and defend the values of Indian democracy, even in the face of criticism. However, Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra's response to an editorial in The Irish Times, defending Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seemed more political than diplomatic. Mishra's rebuttal praised Modi's achievements and attacked the editorial's criticisms, blurring the line between diplomacy and political advocacy. In a constitutional democracy, bureaucrats are expected to maintain political neutrality, representing the country rather than the government in power. Mishra's response, while showcasing Indian cultural events on social media, risks undermining the diplomatic professionalism expected of him. Meanwhile, security forces in Jammu and Kashmir are conducting search operations to apprehend militants responsible for attacking an Indian Air Force convoy, resulting in the death of Corporal Vikky Pahade.</description>

			<title>Banning transgender persons from begging is cruel and illegal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/transgender-persons-ban-begging-is-cruel-and-illegal-9276074/</link>
			<description>The Pune police commissioner has issued a ban on transgender individuals begging in various public spaces, continuing a trend seen previously in Nagpur. This action raises constitutional concerns regarding discrimination and violates the rights guaranteed under Article 15. High court rulings have previously struck down similar laws, emphasizing that begging is often a result of poverty and criminalizing it only exacerbates the issue. Additionally, the ban reflects broader issues of discrimination against transgender individuals, who face systemic marginalization and limited access to education and employment opportunities. Instead of punitive measures, the focus should be on supportive schemes and addressing root causes of poverty.</description>

The article concludes by highlighting Cavalli's impact beyond his flamboyant persona, emphasizing his contribution to making fashion more inclusive and comfortable for people worldwide.</description>

			<title>In BJP and Congress manifestos, new ideas about the Indian state</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-congress-manifesto-2024-lok-sabha-elections-9275276/</link>
			<description>The article compares the manifestos of the BJP and Congress parties in two ways: by checklist method and by evaluating their proposed outlines for the future Indian state. Both parties highlight economic growth and welfare but sidestep controversial issues like CAA and NRC. The BJP's manifesto, called Sankalp Patra, focuses on Modi's leadership and promotes a charitable state model, emphasizing welfare schemes and infrastructural development. It promises social justice representation and inclusivity but lacks mention of religious minorities. On the other hand, the Congress's manifesto, Nyay Patra, challenges the charitable state model, emphasizing economic inequality and proposing a new framework for social justice. It advocates for an open economy with a strong public sector and addresses growing intolerance and marginalization of minorities. The article concludes that these manifestos represent an ongoing battle of political ideas that will influence the future of Indian democracy.</description>

			<title>Express View: A good augury</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-imd-weather-prediction-rainfall-unseasonal-rain-9274337/</link>
			<description>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts an above-normal southwest monsoon this year, with rainfall expected to be 106% of the long-term average. This optimism is based on the weakening of El Niño conditions and the development of La Niña, which typically enhances rainfall in India. A good monsoon is crucial for economic growth, agricultural productivity, drinking water availability, and sentiment, particularly for the new government. However, concerns persist regarding retail food inflation, which could limit policy options, with the government urged to consider measures like abolishing import duties on wheat. Meanwhile, security forces in Jammu and Kashmir continue operations to apprehend militants responsible for attacking an Indian Air Force convoy.</description>

			<title>Express View on Derek Underwood: The Deadly spinner</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-derek-underwood-the-deadly-spinner-9274350/</link>
			<description>Derek Underwood, England's renowned Test left-arm spinner nicknamed "Deadly," passed away at 78. Known for his skill on wet pitches and all-round ability, he held records for wickets in India and dismissed Sunil Gavaskar 12 times. Gavaskar praised Underwood's unique bowling style, emphasizing his ability to vary pace. Underwood's method involved focusing on "drop" rather than flight, releasing the ball early to induce rapid descent. Despite minimal LBW victims due to conservative umpiring, Underwood's wider crease bowling style was effective. He cited Geoffrey Boycott, Zaheer Abbas, and Basil D'Oliveira as notable opponents. However, his career faced interruptions, including participation in Kerry Packer's league and a ban for the rebel tour of South Africa.</description>

			<title>C Raja Mohan writes: What Opposition manifestos say about changing domestic views on India’s foreign policy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/opposition-manifestos-india-foreign-policy-9273440/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the critiques of the BJP government's foreign policy by the Left and Congress, challenging the notion of consensus and continuity in India's international relations. While some argue there's been no structural change, manifestos of Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) suggest otherwise. Congress criticizes marked departures from traditional foreign policy, citing examples like the Gaza conflict, while the CPM denounces the government's ties with Israel and the US. The article examines the nuanced positions of both parties on issues like US ties and China policy, suggesting a shift in India's great power relations over the last decade. It also highlights the absence of references to Russia in their foreign policy discussions. The writer reflects on these dynamics and their implications for India's international image and strategic partnerships.</description>

			<title>Misleading analyses of poverty, complacency from policymakers will worsen India’s inequality crisis</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/misleading-analyses-of-poverty-complacency-from-policymakers-will-worsen-indias-inequality-crisis-9270216/</link>
			<description>In their working paper, Bharti, Chancel, Piketty, and Somanchi analyze income and wealth inequality in India, noting a significant increase since the 1980s, with the top 1% now holding unprecedented wealth shares. They defend their findings against critiques from government-affiliated economists, arguing that these criticisms misrepresent and misunderstand their work, particularly by misusing a footnote irrelevant to the core inequality estimates. The authors accuse the critics of "inequality denialism," a tactic that diverts attention from robust results by focusing on minor, unrelated points. They also refute claims of methodological errors and emphasize their comprehensive analysis, which includes the middle class and not just the top 1%. The paper concludes that ignoring such inequalities could worsen India's economic disparity. The authors are part of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics.</description>

			<title>Why nomination of Payal Kapadia’s ‘All We Imagine As Light’ to Cannes is significant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/why-nomination-of-payal-kapadias-all-we-imagine-as-light-to-cannes-is-significant-9270234/</link>
			<description>After a 30-year hiatus, an Indian film has returned to compete at the Cannes Film Festival. Payal Kapadia's "All We Imagine As Light" will vie for the Palme d’Or alongside works from renowned directors. This milestone prompts reflection on India's sporadic Cannes presence, despite its early successes, including the Grand Prix win for "Neecha Nagar" in 1946. The gap since Shaji N Karun's "Swaham" highlights a system struggling to balance art with commercialism. The article suggests that state support, akin to the EU's Creative Europe MEDIA programme, could bolster art cinema. It cites Kapadia's and Shaunak Sen's recent Cannes wins as evidence of India's cinematic potential, advocating for structured support to nurture this talent.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-the-asian-edge-9270235/</link>
			<description>Recent summits between US President Joe Biden and the leaders of Japan and the Philippines have set new political and military precedents in Asia, signaling a shift in the region's dynamics. These meetings, particularly transformative for Japan, have marked its evolution from a pacifist state to a potential military power. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's agreements with the US aim to deter Chinese military aggression and uphold a rules-based Indo-Pacific order. Additionally, a trilateral summit including the Philippines has reinforced commitments to defend sovereignty against Chinese pressures. China's response has been to caution against forming blocs reminiscent of a "mini NATO" and to engage diplomatically with other Asian nations to counter US influence. India, amidst these developments, finds itself in a pivotal position, balancing its strategic partnership with the US and its contentious border relations with China.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-sankalp-patra-2024-empowerment-9269763/</link>

			<title>Why Benjamin Netanyahu will have to respond to Iran missile attack</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/benjamin-netanyahu-iran-missile-attack-9269652/</link>
			<description>Iran's unprecedented missile attack on Israel, involving over 300 projectiles, marks the first direct assault by a state on Israel since 1991. The attack was a response to the killing of a senior IRGC commander and has led to minimal physical damage due to Israel's defensive capabilities. Despite this, the attack represents a significant challenge to Israeli deterrence. Iran has warned of a stronger response if provoked further, while the international community urges restraint. Israel's response is uncertain, but it may involve targeting key Iranian figures, as it has done in the past. The situation underscores the heightened tensions and the potential for escalation in the region.</description>

			<title>Iran’s drone attack on Israel: Two greatest West Asian powers are prone to lapses in common sense</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/iran-israel-drone-attack-9269634/</link>
			<description>Iran's recent drone and missile offensive against Israel marks a significant escalation in their longstanding covert conflict. Historically, Iran has engaged Israel indirectly via proxies in various countries, without direct admission of involvement. The recent Gaza conflict has intensified regional tensions, with Iran seeking to reinforce its influence amidst the chaos. Despite Tehran's claims of not pursuing nuclear weapons, Israel believes military intervention is the only way to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. The prolonged Gaza war raises the possibility of direct conflict, highlighted by Iran's retaliation to an unclaimed attack on its consulate in Damascus. Iran's strategy aims for regional hegemony, leveraging its network of proxies, led by the Quds Force. The situation remains complex, with both nations being significant military powers in the Middle East, and any escalation could be detrimental due to a lack of common sense.</description>

			<title>From the Opinions Editor: Markets touch new high, but the shadow of war looms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/markets-new-high-iran-israel-attack-war-9269535/</link>
			<description>The Indian stock market experienced significant fluctuations last week, influenced by geopolitical tensions and economic indicators. The BSE Sensex briefly surpassed 75,000 but ended the week lower due to Iran's attack on Israel, raising concerns of increased volatility and potential shifts in capital towards safer assets. Despite this, the Sensex has seen a 23% rise over the past year, with mid and small caps performing even stronger. Economic growth in India has been robust, with an 8.2% increase in the first three quarters of the last financial year, and projections remain positive despite some downward revisions. Corporate earnings, particularly from TCS, have been promising. However, uncertainties in US interest rate policies and tax implications for foreign investors following the India-Mauritius treaty have caused investor apprehension. Domestic inflation concerns and the RBI's monetary policy stance are also key factors for market sentiment. As national elections begin, the outcomes could further influence market directions.</description>

			<title>From ‘Kathal’ to ‘Kabali’: How Dalit cinema has taken off in the last decade</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dalit-cinema-kathal-kabali-ambedkar-9269265/</link>
			<description>B.R. Ambedkar's legacy as a champion for the marginalized in India is increasingly reflected in popular media. Historically sidelined by mainstream Hindi cinema, Ambedkar and the anti-caste movement are now gaining visibility, particularly through the emergence of "Dalit cinema." Regional films have led the way, with directors like Pa Ranjith and Mari Selvarajan portraying Dalit protagonists as assertive heroes challenging societal norms. This trend extends to web series and TV shows, where Dalit characters are depicted as self-aware and assertive, often accompanied by Ambedkar's imagery. Documentaries are also contributing to this narrative, exploring the contemporary Dalit experience and Ambedkar's enduring influence. This growing representation marks a small but significant step towards democratizing the entertainment industry and creating a cinema that speaks to and for socially marginalized groups.</description>

			<description>On a summer afternoon, a mother struggles with her restless toddler on a Metro coach.

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: Quickest way to make a dishonest fortune is to become an Indian politician</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/corruption-as-an-election-issue-9268390/</link>
			<description>In the article, the Prime Minister's frequent mention of 'corruption' and 'dynastic politics' in his campaign speeches is highlighted. He criticizes opposition parties for being family-run and suggests a link between corruption and hereditary politics. The author agrees there's a connection but challenges the notion that the Prime Minister's party is free from corruption. The piece discusses the pervasiveness of political corruption in India, the difficulty in combating it due to weak checks and balances, and the selective enforcement of anti-corruption laws. It acknowledges Modi's efforts to reduce corruption in non-political areas and improve welfare schemes but points out the complexities in political-business relationships. The author calls for genuine leadership and honesty to combat deep-rooted corruption and expresses skepticism about real change, while crediting Modi for making corruption a key issue.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: The declaration of intent</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/the-declaration-of-intent-9268360/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the significance of political manifestos in India, referencing historical speeches and the current promises of the Indian National Congress (INC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It highlights the INC's commitment to the Constitution, conducting a Socio-economic and Caste Census, and lifting the reservation ceiling. The INC also plans to address minority rights, job creation, women's empowerment, and federalism. The BJP's stance on these issues remains unclear, particularly regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act and Uniform Civil Code. The author emphasizes the importance of upholding the Constitution, democracy, and human rights in the upcoming elections, indicating a personal preference for candidates who support these values. The unrelated mention of football at the end suggests a separate topic not covered in the summary.</description>

			<title>‘Laapataa Ladies’: A tale of clunky feminism; a plea for a state more benevolent</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/laapataa-ladies-feminism-9268089/</link>
			<description>"Laapataa Ladies," directed by Kiran Rao, is a film that weaves local idioms and sayings into a narrative set in the fictional state of Nirmal Pradesh, circa 2001. The story follows Phool Kumari, a young bride, as she navigates her new life, adorned with wisdom from her husband about the perils of flaunting wealth. The film contrasts traditional societal norms with the empowering guidance of Manju Maai, a tea stall owner who mentors Phool. Rao's script critiques Indian matrimony and dowry practices through a comedic lens, offering a fresh perspective on the subject. The film's humor and feminist undertones challenge the transactional nature of marriages and the systemic oppression of women, ultimately providing a hopeful outlook on overcoming societal injustices. "Laapataa Ladies" stands out for its optimistic portrayal of a challenging social environment and its call for a return to a more compassionate state governance.</description>

			<title>For Maharashtra’s Dhangars, the road to ‘Begampura’ is far</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/maharashtra-dhangar-community-caste-census-9267965/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges faced by the Dhangar community in Maharashtra, India. Representing nearly 9% of the state's population, the Dhangars are listed as "Dhangad" on the Central OBC list and struggle with social, economic, and cultural marginalization. Changes in land use, reduction in common lands, and upper-caste dominance in agriculture hinder their economic and educational prospects. Political representation is limited, and cultural narratives are threatened by Brahmanisation. Efforts to forge a martial identity among youth and political rallying points are noted, but lack historical and social awareness. The community's push for ST status and the Rohini Commission's recommendations on OBC sub-categories could impact their future, highlighting the need for national-level caste census data to inform policy and preserve social memory. The article concludes by questioning if shepherd communities in India have achieved an equal society, suggesting that a blend of social memory and data-driven policy could be a step towards it.</description>

			<title>Why the BJP shies away from fielding Muslim candidates</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-muslim-candidates-9267817/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the historical and contemporary relationship between Muslims and political parties in India, focusing on the BJP. It highlights the low representation of Muslims in the BJP and draws parallels to the pre-independence era, where Muslims also felt alienated from the Congress party. The piece reflects on the Muslim League's accusations against Congress for Hindu bias, which fueled the demand for Pakistan. It notes the failure of Congress leaders to alleviate Muslim concerns and the subsequent support for the Muslim League. The article suggests that the BJP views Muslims as equal citizens but acknowledges the difficulty in gaining their electoral support. It concludes that building trust between Muslims and the BJP remains a challenge, mirroring the historical distrust towards Congress. The author of the article has also written a book titled "Tryst with Ayodhya: Decolonisation of India."</description>

			<title>Pakistan media ‘warns’ India against plotting assassinations on its soil</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pakistan-media-india-plotting-assassinations-9267694/</link>
			<description>Recent reports from various South Asian media outlets highlight tensions between India and Pakistan, with allegations of India conducting targeted killings in Pakistan. Editorials from Pakistan call for a state-centric dialogue to address grievances and warn against electoral stunts. The visit of Pakistan's Prime Minister to Saudi Arabia is seen as a potential step towards easing regional tensions, with Saudi investments poised to bolster Pakistan's economy. Meanwhile, Pakistan faces internal challenges such as water scarcity, with calls for home-grown solutions and agritech innovations. Security concerns are also paramount, with the government taking measures to protect against terrorism, but media outlets urge for a more centralized approach and better resources for security agencies. The articles collectively underscore the need for long-term strategies and international cooperation to address these multifaceted issues.</description>

			<description>Aishani Menon reflects on the societal issues surrounding women's reproductive health and representation in India. She highlights the discomfort in discussing menstruation and the lack of educational programs on reproductive health.

With India's general election approaching, she considers her vote a tool for change, advocating for leaders who will enhance women's representation and address societal malaise. Menon, a sociology post-graduate, views voting as an act of dissent and a means to influence decision-making in her country.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/april-14-forty-years-ago-government-announces-more-liberalisation-reforms-for-tech-9266892/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has announced a liberalisation of technology imports and new initiatives to boost computer software exports in the 1984-85 import-export policy. Commerce Minister V P Singh highlighted the inclusion of new priority areas for technology import and the placement of several capital goods under Open General Licence. Meanwhile, constitutional amendments are proposed to limit judicial intervention in parliamentary decisions, a topic discussed by opposition leaders. In the Lok Sabha, concerns were raised about a Sri Lankan naval blockade, with calls for an official government stance. The Maharashtra Assembly was stirred by allegations of misconduct by Deputy Chief Minister Ramrao Adik, leading to calls for the Vasantrao Patil ministry's resignation. In entertainment, despite star promotions, 'Bade Miyan Chote Miyan' underperformed at the box office, overshadowed by 'Maidaan'.</description>

			<title>India-China border dispute: Beyond the hype, the reality of the LAC</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/india-china-border-dispute-beyond-the-hype-the-reality-of-the-lac-9266802/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the territorial disputes between India and China in eastern Ladakh, emphasizing that the claims of significant land loss to China are exaggerated and politically motivated. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a notional boundary with differing perceptions by both nations, leading to disputes at various Patrol Points (PPs). While some areas like the Chushul-Pangong sector and Chang Chenmo Valley have seen disengagement and peace, others like Depsang and Demchok remain contentious. The article highlights India's strengthened defenses and infrastructure improvements, including the Shyok-DBO road and upgraded aviation facilities, which have bolstered India's position. It concludes that while the LAC situation is stalemated, the accusations of losing massive land areas are unfounded, and opportunities for clarifying the LAC should be pursued post-elections in New Delhi. The author is the president of the Ladakh International Centre, Leh.</description>

			<title>B R Ambedkar beyond the Constitution — the architect of Hindu Code Bill</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/b-r-ambedkar-constitution-of-india-hindu-code-bill-constitution-drafting-committee-dr-rajendra-prasad-9266801/</link>
			<description>B.R. Ambedkar's pivotal role in drafting India's Constitution is often overshadowed by misconceptions attributing the work to B.N. Rau and the drafting committee. Despite significant contributions from Rau, it was Ambedkar who, amidst the drafting committee's dwindling numbers due to resignations and absences, shouldered the colossal task of integrating 2,473 amendments. His dedication was acknowledged by Rajendra Prasad, the Constituent Assembly's chairman. Beyond the Constitution, Ambedkar's personal struggle against caste discrimination fueled his commitment to Hindu reform, leading to the Hindu Code Bill's inception. Despite initial support from Nehru, the Bill faced resistance, resulting in its shelving and Ambedkar's resignation. Nevertheless, its essence was later realized through separate acts under Nehru's leadership. Ambedkar's experiences and efforts, particularly with the Hindu Code Bill, remain a testament to his enduring legacy.</description>

			<title>India’s missing jobs — and where the next government can find them</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-missing-jobs-and-where-the-next-government-can-find-them-9266841/</link>
			<description>Meta's first data center in India signifies a small step towards the massive job creation needed by 2030. The Indian economy, poised to become the world's third-largest, faces a challenge: only 46.6% of the working-age population is employed, compared to 70% in other emerging markets. Over half of the workforce is self-employed, and the reliance on service industries over manufacturing has led to a skills deficit, with only half of young Indians being employable. The IT sector's contraction and the return of many to agriculture post-Covid highlight the need for diverse job creation strategies. The government must prioritize job creation, supporting multiple sectors like high-end services, tech startups, green transitions, and small-and-medium manufacturing to absorb the vast workforce.</description>

			<title>Private sector TB care can better capacity for primary treatment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/private-sector-tb-care-can-better-capacity-for-primary-treatment-9266842/</link>
			<description>India's healthcare system heavily relies on the private sector, which provides over 80% of initial primary care. The government's Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY initiative, which offers insurance for secondary and tertiary care, acknowledges this contribution. The TB elimination program has seen significant public-private collaboration, with the Private Public Interface Agency (PPIA) acting as a bridge between national efforts and private entities. The Patient Provider Support Agency (PPSA) extends this network to ensure standards of TB care are met and supports free diagnostics and treatment in the private sector. To enhance this model, the program could engage informal healthcare providers and private chemists more effectively. These community-trusted figures could help screen and refer TB patients, encouraging treatment adherence and helping curb drug-resistant TB. Ensuring compliance with drug sale regulations is also vital. With proper support, these providers could be instrumental in strengthening India's primary healthcare delivery.</description>

			<title>Express View: Problem with coal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-problem-with-coal-9266884/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the challenges of reducing coal usage in light of global climate goals. It highlights that coal power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the expansion of coal power in China and India, along with a slowdown in decommissioning in the US, is concerning. Despite China's promise to reduce coal use, it added significant capacity last year, and the US also saw a decrease in retired capacity. To meet the Paris Climate Pact's targets, a substantial increase in the retirement of coal plants is necessary. The article also touches on the complexities of transitioning to green energy in developing economies and the need for carbon capture technology, despite its high costs. It concludes by emphasizing the urgency of addressing the environmental impact of coal energy, as global temperatures continue to rise.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-nso-data-a-softer-landing-9266885/</link>
			<description>Retail inflation in India, as per the National Statistical Office, dipped to **4.85% in March** from February's 5.09%, primarily due to slightly lower food prices. However, food inflation is still high at **8.52%**, and core inflation remains unchanged at **3.5%**. Inflation is notably high for staples like cereals, eggs, vegetables, and pulses, which could impact the upcoming national elections. Positive rainfall forecasts from NOAA may improve food production and prices. Globally, disinflation proves challenging, with the US seeing a rise in inflation and the European Central Bank ready to cut rates if inflation aligns with targets. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of India is maintaining its current stance, awaiting clarity on monsoons, food inflation, and oil prices before any policy shifts.</description>

			<description>OJ Simpson, an iconic figure in American sports and culture, passed away at 76, leaving behind a complex legacy. His 1995 trial for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend captivated the nation, highlighting deep societal rifts over race, justice, and celebrity. The case, paralleled with Oscar Pistorius's, raised questions about the influence of race and fame on legal outcomes. Simpson's acquittal sparked debates and inspired numerous media adaptations. His story serves as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of success and fame, systemic biases, and the loss of truth amidst a lack of nuance. These themes resonate globally, especially in the context of ongoing discussions about racial justice.</description>

			<title>Hinduphobia and half-truths: What Western media gets wrong about India, its elections</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-hinduphobia-western-media-9266428/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the portrayal of India's upcoming Lok Sabha elections in the US media, contrasting it with the coverage of the 2019 elections. It categorizes the current coverage into three types: factual, which acknowledges Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and his government's achievements; critical, which debates accusations of illiberalism and authoritarianism; and deceptive, which includes misleading statements and biases, particularly regarding Hinduphobia.

The author criticizes the Western media's persistent misrepresentation of events like the 2002 Gujarat riots and the Ayodhya dispute, suggesting a deliberate exclusion of fuller historical contexts. The article also reflects on the broader decline of American journalism, citing NPR's loss of credibility due to a lack of viewpoint diversity and an incident of Hinduphobia involving an NPR producer.

The writer, a professor of media studies, calls for Indian communication professionals to lead a new vision for global news and communication, drawing from India's civilizational ideals and fostering a more holistic approach to ecological, social, and cultural health. The article ends with a mention of a viral video of cricketer Virat Kohli giving a pat on the back to Rohit Sharma, highlighting a lighter moment amidst the serious discussion.</description>

			<title>In the time of ‘Veer Savarkar’ and ‘Animal’, why ‘Manjummel Boys’ stands out</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-manjummel-boys-stands-out-9265968/</link>
			<description>"Manjummel Boys," a Malayalam film directed by Chidambaram, has become a box-office sensation, setting records as the highest-grossing film in its category despite its modest budget. The film is celebrated for its immersive big-screen experience, which captivates audiences with its intense survival drama, distinguishing itself from typical hyper-masculine action films.

The narrative employs a pivotal tonal shift in the first half that enhances the storytelling, reminiscent of the "cinema of attractions" concept by film theorist Sergei Eisenstein, as discussed by scholar Tom Gunning. This style emphasizes the medium's ability to present rather than represent, focusing on the form and the visceral excitement it can evoke.

"Manjummel Boys" stands out by eschewing the formulaic spectacle of grand action sequences and instead, offers a heartfelt indie film experience. It lacks developed female characters but avoids the cliché of a male superhero, opting for a portrayal of vulnerability and courage. The film pays homage to cinephilia, particularly through a reference to Kamal Haasan and his work.

Unlike other Malayalam films that critically examine masculinity, "Manjummel Boys" presents male friendships based on solidarity rather than victimhood, offering a fresh perspective in an era where many films exploit perceived male victimhood for narrative thrust.

Rooted in a real-life incident in Kodaikanal, the film forgoes typical action spectacle for a focus on human resilience and innovative storytelling. Its cinematic language, encompassing camera work, sound design, and editing, breathes life into the film, making it a compelling case for the big-screen experience in a time when cinema attendance is waning.

The article also mentions a viral social media video featuring cricketer Virat Kohli giving a supportive gesture to Rohit Sharma during a match at the Wankhede Stadium. This detail, while unrelated to the film, highlights the cultural backdrop against which "Manjummel Boys" is being discussed. The writer, a Delhi-based film scholar and critic, underscores the film's significance in contemporary cinema.</description>

			<title>The US support for Israel, contrary to opinion, is as strong as ever</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/us-support-for-israel-strong-as-ever-9265839/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant shift in the US-Israel relationship, marked by the US abstaining from a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, a departure from its previous vetoes. This abstention has been interpreted by Israel's Prime Minister as a retreat from the US's unwavering support. The article suggests that recent events, including criticism of Netanyahu by US politicians and the death of aid workers in Gaza, indicate a change in the US's stance towards Israel.

However, the article also argues that the fundamental dynamics of the US-Israel relationship remain unchanged. Despite the appearance of a shift, the US's substantial financial and military support for Israel continues, and the political influence of pro-Israel forces remains strong. The article posits that the shared settler-colonial history and ideological alignment between the US and Israel are likely to preserve their special relationship.

The writer, a professor of History at UCLA, concludes that while there may be signs of frustration and changing opinions within the US, the deep-rooted ties and mutual interests between the two nations suggest that any significant change in their relationship is unlikely in the near future.

			<description>I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts. However, I can offer a summary based on the information you've provided:

The article discusses the political dynamics surrounding the Muslim vote in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in India. It highlights the ruling party's stance of not explicitly seeking Muslim votes, while the opposition seems to rely on the Muslim vote as a counter to the ruling party. The article reflects on historical exploitation of the Muslim community for votes without addressing their aspirations for governance representation. It also touches upon the irony of Muslims' loyalty being doubted despite their choice to stay in India post-independence, based on their faith in the Hadith mantra of love for the homeland.

The piece further explores the mutual mistrust between the Sangh Parivar and Muslims, especially during elections, and the BJP's challenge to the Muslim community to not treat any political party as untouchable. It calls for the BJP to field credible Muslim candidates and for the Muslim community to support such candidates, transcending ideology and focusing on development.

The article recounts instances of communal violence and the lack of Muslim representation in high power echelons, advocating for the BJP to make a significant statement by giving tickets to Muslims, thereby affirming the inclusiveness of Indian democracy. It suggests that Muslims should engage actively in politics, demand genuine reforms, and question the secular parties about their contributions to the community.

The writer, a former chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University, concludes by emphasizing the need for both the BJP and the Muslim community to take steps towards each other to participate in democratic politics, not just during elections, and to uphold the values of inclusiveness and respect for all religions.

Lastly, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce the results of the Intermediate exams on April 12, with the exams having taken place from March 1 to April 20, 2024.

			<title>Amar Singh Chamkila — singing defiance in a militancy-hit Punjab</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/amar-singh-chamkila-singing-defiance-in-a-militancy-hit-punjab-9265040/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed account of the life and legacy of Amar Singh Chamkila, a prominent Punjabi musician, in the context of A R Rahman's composition for Imtiaz Ali’s biopic "Amar Singh Chamkila". Lyricist Irshad Kamil captures the essence of Chamkila's music and its significance to Punjab's culture, especially during the tumultuous 1980s. Chamkila rose to fame with his raw and candid songs that often dealt with controversial themes, reflecting the society's underbelly and resonating with the common people's struggles and desires. Despite facing threats due to the nature of his music, Chamkila continued to perform until he and his wife Amarjot were tragically killed in 1988. His music remains influential, symbolizing the coexistence of contrasting elements in society.

In a separate note, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) is set to announce the results for the intermediate public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes. The results will be available on official websites, and students are advised to collect their original mark sheets from their respective schools.</description>

			<title>Express View on Andaman and Nicobar islands: Turning seaward</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-turning-seaward-9265041/</link>
			<description>The article from The Indian Express discusses India's strategic initiative to enhance the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' role in regional security and as a pivotal point in the Indo-Pacific. It highlights the government's efforts to upgrade military infrastructure, including the basing of advanced military platforms, enhancing communication and surveillance, and stationing permanent troops. This shift represents a significant policy change from previous years when the islands were underutilized and disconnected from mainland India and Southeast Asia.

Historically, the British valued these islands for their strategic position in global trade and power projection. However, post-independence India, focused on internal issues and land borders, largely overlooked its maritime potential. It wasn't until economic reforms in the 1990s that the Indian Navy advocated for a renewed focus on sea power. Despite establishing a joint tri-service command in Port Blair in 2001, the islands didn't receive adequate resources to fulfill their strategic potential.

The current government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has recognized the importance of the islands and has been motivated by China's growing naval presence in the Indian Ocean to develop bases and engage with other island nations. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are strategically located near key maritime routes, and their development could serve as a counterbalance to China's influence. The article suggests that Delhi is now poised to implement its ambitious plans for the islands swiftly.

The article also briefly mentions deep belly breathing as a yoga technique for relaxation and better sleep, unrelated to the main topic of the article. It describes how this practice can help reduce stress and improve well-being.</description>

			<title>Derek O’Brien writes: My encounter with the Delhi Police</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/derek-obrien-writes-my-encounter-with-the-delhi-police-9265038/</link>
			<description>The article describes an incident where the author, a Member of Parliament (MP) and leader of the All India Trinamool Congress Parliamentary Party in the Rajya Sabha, along with other MPs and former MPs, were detained by the Delhi Police. The group was holding a peaceful protest outside the Election Commission of India, demanding fair play in the upcoming 2024 general elections and the transfer of chiefs of various investigative agencies. They also sought permission for the West Bengal government to release cyclone relief funds.

After submitting a memorandum and addressing the media, the group began their dharna (sit-in protest). They were quickly and forcefully detained by the police and taken on a bus to an undisclosed location, despite legal requirements to be informed of arrest grounds and taken to the nearest police station. The group, which included former journalists and experienced MPs, questioned the police's actions and were eventually taken to the Mandir Marg Police Station after a brief confrontation.

The article also mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce the results for the intermediate public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their results.

			<title>Forty Years Ago, April 12, 1984: Three killed in Punjab by terrorists</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/forty-years-ago-april-12-1984-three-killed-in-punjab-by-terrorists-9265046/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

- **India's Space Achievement**: Squadron Leader Rakesh Sharma, India's first cosmonaut, successfully returned from space, landing 60 km from Arkalyk, Kazakhstan. The mission, a collaboration between India and the Soviet Union, was completed without any issues. Sharma, along with Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Malyshev and Gennadi Strekalov, were honored with the Ashok Chakra for their achievement.

- **Sri Lanka's Naval Blockade**: In response to ongoing conflicts with Tamil militants, Sri Lanka has established a naval blockade termed as a "sea surveillance zone" along its maritime boundary with India. National Security Minister Lalith Athulathmudali assured that the blockade is positioned away from the Indian maritime border.

- **Violence in Punjab**: Punjab experienced a surge in violence, with terrorists killing three individuals and committing acts of arson. The incidents occurred during a protest by the Akalis against alleged CRPF killings. Among the victims were Raghbir Chand Mittal, a brick kiln owner, his employee Joginder Pal, and a shopkeeper from Amritsar district.

- **Leadership in the Soviet Union**: Konstantin Chernenko was elected President of the Soviet Union during the first session of the new Supreme Soviet. He holds the combined roles of head of state and chief of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as chairman of the defence council.

- **Education Update**: The Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) is set to release the results for the first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE) today. Over a million students await their results, which will be available on official websites, with original mark sheets to be distributed by their respective schools.

The rest of the headlines seem to be from subscriber-only articles, so I can't provide summaries for those. However, if you have access to the full articles, I can help summarize them as well.</description>

			<title>A solar eclipse and a Bonnie Tyler ballad’s moment under the Sun</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/a-solar-eclipse-and-a-bonnie-tyler-ballads-moment-under-the-sun-9265050/</link>
			<description>Certainly! Here's a summary of the article:

**Bonnie Tyler's 1983 hit song "Total Eclipse of the Heart"** has seen a resurgence in popularity coinciding with the **solar eclipse in North America on April 8**. This isn't the first time the song has gained attention during an eclipse; it also happened in August 2017. Originally topping charts in the UK and US, the song's themes of lost love resonate with the imagery of an eclipse, symbolizing a dimming light or a shadowed heart. Interestingly, the song's writer, **Jim Steinman**, intended it as a **vampire love story**, aligning with the dark romance of works like "Twilight" and "Vampire Academy." Despite the years, Tyler's song remains a beloved heartbreak anthem, undimmed by time.

In a separate note, the **Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP)** is set to announce the results for the **first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE)** today at 11 am. The exams, which took place from March 1 to April 20, saw participation from over **10 lakh students**. Students are advised to check the results on the official websites and collect their original mark sheets from their respective schools.</description>

			<title>Express View on US Fed: Holding back</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-us-fed-holding-back-9265049/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

The US Federal Reserve's March meeting minutes revealed concerns among policymakers about the trajectory of inflation, as recent data did not bolster confidence in inflation sustainably returning to the 2% target. March's CPI inflation increased to **3.5%**, up from February's **3.2%**, driven by rises in fuel, housing, and clothing costs, while core inflation remained at **3.8%**.

Contrary to earlier expectations of three interest rate cuts this year, recent economic data, including a rise in non-farm payrolls and a drop in the jobless rate to **3.8%**, suggest that rate cuts may not occur as soon or as significantly as anticipated. The stronger-than-expected economy and inflation readings may delay the Fed's pivot, with markets now pricing in only two rate cuts starting in September.

The next Fed meeting, scheduled between April 30 and May 1, is expected to provide more clarity on interest rates. However, the current economic conditions have complicated the situation for global central banks that look to the US Fed for policy direction.

			<title>Why Andaman and Nicobar Islands are key to Indo-Pacific security</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/andaman-nicobar-islands-indo-pacific-security-9264661/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the strategic significance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (A&amp;N) in India's defense and security framework. It recounts the historical context of the islands, from being a penal colony for Indian freedom fighters during British rule to their role in World War II and the subsequent political decisions that led to their integration into India.

The piece highlights the islands' unique geographical position near major maritime routes and their potential for military and economic use, emphasizing the importance of the Andaman Nicobar Command (ANC) established in 2001. The ANC is India's first joint/unified operational command, combining forces from all military services and the Coast Guard, and has been successful in demonstrating the effectiveness of joint military operations.

The author, a retired chief of naval staff, stresses the need for India to maintain robust maritime domain awareness and defense capabilities in the A&amp;N region, especially in light of potential threats from state and non-state actors, as well as the strategic presence of the Chinese navy. The article also touches on the importance of the Malacca Strait for global trade and India's opportunity to monitor and potentially control this critical maritime choke point.

Finally, the article calls for a cohesive strategy to transform the A&amp;N islands into a strong maritime bastion, extending India's defensive reach and fostering cooperation with other nations to ensure peace in the Indo-Pacific region. The writer envisions Port Blair as a regional hub for naval interoperability in various cooperative maritime activities. The article concludes with the hope that the reported security infrastructure upgrades are part of this broader strategic vision.</description>

			<title>There’s nothing quite like the joy of walking the streets of Jama Masjid at 2am during Ramzan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/theres-nothing-quite-like-the-joy-of-walking-the-streets-of-jama-masjid-at-2am-during-ramzan-9264378/</link>
			<description>The article recounts the author's experiences of exploring Delhi during the month of Ramzan, a tradition that began after moving to the city eight years ago. Despite Delhi's reputation for being unsafe, especially at night, the author finds solace and safety in the festive atmosphere of the night markets during Ramzan. The streets are lively with people eating, shopping, and preparing for sehri, particularly around Jama Masjid, Nizamuddin, Zakir Nagar, and Shaheen Bagh.

The author describes feeling welcomed and safe, even as a single woman from outside the local community and faith. The warmth of the locals, from sharing food to helping with shopping, creates a sense of belonging. The article highlights the contrast between the city's usual tense atmosphere and the communal harmony experienced during these nightly outings. It concludes with a positive note on the spirit of Delhi and its people, who make the city what it is, especially during festive times like Ramzan and Eid.

In a separate note, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) will announce the results for the first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE) today at 11 am, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their results.</description>

			<title>In election season, lessons from the universal Ram in Ayodhya</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-election-season-lessons-from-the-universal-ram-in-ayodhya-9263163/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, emphasizing the universal message of Lord Ram as a symbol of unity and goodness that transcends religious and social identities. It recounts the author's personal experience visiting the temple with their family, feeling a sense of togetherness and humanity. The article also discusses the views of Nripendra Mishra, who highlights that the temple and Lord Ram's message should not be seen as a victory for one group but as a universal lesson in harmony and righteousness.

The narrative further explores the idea that Lord Ram's teachings are more about social, spiritual, and philosophical values than religious dogma. It mentions anecdotes that illustrate this inclusive spirit, such as a Muslim man named Noor Alam providing shelter to devotees and a Muslim child named Ram-Rahim. The article suggests that Lord Ram's life and values, such as empathy, humility, and respect for all beings, offer lessons that are relevant to everyone, beyond the confines of an election or political victory.

The author, Nilay, is identified as an ethics teacher and a doctoral fellow in Gandhian Studies, who has written books on being good and ethical behavior. The article concludes with a mention of a viral video showing cricketer Virat Kohli's sportsmanship towards Rohit Sharma, reinforcing the theme of unity and respect.

			<title>India can learn from Japan’s ‘womenomics’ reforms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-can-learn-from-japans-womenomics-reforms-9263161/</link>
			<description>The article discusses Japan's successful implementation of "womenomics" as part of the "Abenomics" era, initiated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2014. The reforms aimed at gender equality have led to a significant increase in the Women's Labour Force Participation Rate (WLFPR) in Japan, rising by ten percentage points from 2013 to 2023, marking the fastest growth in decades and the highest among the G7 countries. This growth is particularly notable among women aged 30-39, indicating mothers returning to the workforce.

The increase in WLFPR has helped Japan address labour shortages and is estimated to have boosted the GDP per capita by 4% to 8%. Key reforms include investments in childcare, with daycare capacity expanding from 2.2 million in 2012 to 2.8 million in 2018, and a further investment of $26 billion announced for 2023-2026. Parental leave policies have also become more flexible, with paternity leave uptake increasing from 2% in 2012 to 17% in 2023.

The article also highlights the "Eruboshi" certification, introduced in 2016, which recognizes companies committed to workforce diversity. The number of companies receiving this certification has grown significantly, from 815 in 2019 to 1905 in 2022.

Drawing parallels with India, the article notes that both countries face wide gender gaps in unpaid care work. Lessons from Japan's experience suggest that long-term investments in care infrastructure, changing social norms around domestic work, and investing in a range of care services can enhance WLFPR and contribute to GDP growth.

In response to Japan's strategies, a five-pillar strategy has been developed in India to unlock business opportunities in the care economy, focusing on gender-neutral leave policies, subsidies for care services, investment in care infrastructure, skill training for care workers, and quality assurance for care services.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a continued focus on the care economy to maintain the rising trend in India's WLFPR and to empower women for a developed India by 2047. The writer is the founder of Nikore Associates.</description>

			<title>How Peter Higgs changed our understanding of the nature of the universe</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/how-peter-higgs-changed-our-understanding-of-the-nature-of-the-universe-9263159/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the groundbreaking work of British physicist Peter Higgs, who explored the mechanisms by which particles acquire mass. His initial paper, rejected for its perceived irrelevance to particle physics, was later accepted in 1964 and aligned with concurrent research. This work led to the prediction of the Higgs boson, often called "the God particle," which fundamentally changed our understanding of physics and earned Higgs a Nobel Prize in 2013.

Higgs' discovery confirmed the Standard Model, which is the current framework for understanding the universe's fundamental particles. It also contributed to the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking, a process central to the existence of the Higgs boson. His findings continue to influence research in areas like Dark Matter and force unification, a concept dating back to James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.

The long-awaited confirmation of the Higgs boson came in 2012 with the help of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, marking a significant milestone nearly five decades after Higgs' initial proposal. Higgs, present at the discovery announcement, expressed humble gratitude for witnessing the validation of his life's work.

The article concludes with an unrelated announcement from the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) about the release of results for intermediate public exams, which over 10 lakh students took part in.

Please note that the summary provided is based on the information given in the article excerpt and my knowledge as of 2021. For the most current and detailed information, it's always best to refer to the full article or the latest scientific publications.</description>

			<title>Express View: Back on track</title>

			<description>The Supreme Court of India has overturned a previous judgment from 2021 that favored Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd (DAMEPL), a Reliance Infrastructure firm, with a substantial arbitral award. The award had granted DAMEPL damages amounting to Rs 2,782.3 crore plus interest, which the Supreme Court now deems as "perverse, irrational and patently illegal," citing overlooked evidence that led to an undue advantage for the private firm over the public-serving Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).

This case highlights potential manipulations in legal processes and systems, dating back to 2008 when DMRC and DAMEPL entered into an agreement for the Delhi Airport Express. The agreement was terminated by DAMEPL in 2012, leading to arbitration and a series of legal decisions that culminated in the recent Supreme Court verdict. The prolonged resolution process is criticized for potentially deterring private investment in infrastructure projects due to the time and capital it locks up, emphasizing the need for timely dispute resolution and possibly an independent regulator.

The Supreme Court's decision is seen as a correction of a "miscarriage of justice" and serves as a lesson for future court interventions, especially as India anticipates an increase in investment. It underscores the importance of robust systems and processes to prevent such legal missteps.

In a separate note, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) is set to announce the results for the first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE) today, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes. The results will be available on official websites, and students are advised to collect their original mark sheets from their respective schools.</description>

			<title>Express View: Hepatitis warning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-hepatitis-warning-9263158/</link>
			<description>The WHO report highlights the critical challenge of Hepatitis B and C in India, noting the country has the second-highest burden of these diseases globally. With nearly 3 crore Hepatitis B and over 50 lakh Hepatitis C patients, the diseases claimed over a lakh lives in 2022. Alarmingly, less than 30% of Hepatitis C and less than 3% of Hepatitis B cases are detected. The National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme (NVHCP) aims to eliminate Hepatitis C by 2030 and significantly reduce Hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality. The WHO suggests that with course correction between 2024 and 2026, NVHCP can get back on track.

Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through contaminated blood, with Hepatitis B potentially causing liver scarring and cancer. Diagnosis is difficult as carriers may not show symptoms for years. The NVHCP offers free testing and medication, but many patients remain unreached. Improved blood screening has reduced transfusion-related infections, but mother-to-child transmission remains a concern. Less than 50% of infants in India receive early vaccination, partly due to low institutional birth rates. Enhancing community healthcare worker training could improve vaccination efficacy.

Hepatitis C is more treatable with anti-virals, and India has some of the lowest treatment costs. However, the diagnostic gap of 70% indicates a need for immediate healthcare improvements. The article concludes with the personal story of Mohammed Saleem, whose son died in the US, leaving the family with the burden of a substantial education loan.

**Please note**: The personal details mentioned in the article about Mohammed Saleem and his son are sensitive, and I have included them only as they are part of the summary you requested. It's important to handle such information with care and respect.</description>

			<title>Providing better medical assistance to survivors of gender-based violence</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/providing-better-medical-assistance-survivors-gender-based-violence-9262852/</link>
			<description>I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts. However, I can offer a summary of the key points addressed in the article:

The article discusses the pervasive issue of gender-based violence (GBV) in India, highlighting its impact on nearly one-third of women in the country. GBV includes various forms of violence such as intimate partner violence, domestic violence, and non-partner sexual violence, leading to severe health and psychological consequences for survivors. The World Health Organisation recognises GBV as a significant public health issue and advocates for a structured response from the health system.

Despite the immediate health impacts of GBV, research indicates that survivors are reluctant to seek medical care due to stigma and the daunting criminal justice process. The article emphasizes the importance of survivor-centric medical care, which involves creating safe spaces for disclosure, ensuring patient autonomy, and maintaining confidentiality.

The authors note that while the health system's response to sexual violence has evolved, including the establishment of One Stop Centres (OSC) providing comprehensive services, there are still significant barriers to accessing care. These include mandatory police reporting, which can compromise confidentiality and deter survivors from seeking help.

The article proposes a seven-point agenda for reform, focusing on legal changes to protect survivors' rights, health system reforms to provide simplified and accessible care at all levels, and the sensitisation and training of healthcare workers to deliver survivor-centric care. The authors call for a collaborative effort among medical professionals, legal experts, activists, and policymakers to address the systemic gaps and improve the health outcomes for survivors of GBV in India.

			<title>The real Kerala story – without ‘love jihad’ fiction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-real-kerala-story-without-love-jihad-fiction-9262788/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the portrayal of Kerala's society in various films and the controversy surrounding the 2023 Hindi film "The Kerala Story." The film, directed by Sudipto Sen, faced criticism for its depiction of the alleged brainwashing and conversion of Malayali girls by a Muslim group, which was claimed to be for the use of the Islamic State. Despite doing poorly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the film sparked controversy, especially with its screening by the Idukki diocese of the Kerala Catholic Church, which was met with protests from political parties.

The article argues that the concept of "love jihad" is a fabricated issue used by conservative forces to control the lives of young people, particularly women, and that the film's claims were exaggerated and later retracted. It highlights that real-life issues in Kerala, such as poverty, unemployment, and misogyny, are more pressing than the sensationalized narrative of "love jihad."

The piece also mentions other films like "Sudani From Nigeria," "Angamaly Diaries," and "Kumbalangi Nights," which depict the state's diversity and societal complexities without resorting to sensationalism. It questions the authenticity of stories told by those who rely on selective news reports and sensational headlines, suggesting that a true understanding of Kerala comes from experiencing its diversity and history firsthand.

Lastly, the article includes an unrelated note about the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education announcing results for public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes. Students are advised to check the official websites for results and collect their mark sheets from their schools.</description>

			<title>The Brussels Effect: How EU’s law affects AI regulations globally</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/brussels-effect-eu-law-affects-ai-regulations-globally-9262249/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the influence of the European Union (EU) in setting global regulatory standards, a phenomenon known as the **Brussels Effect**. Despite not having the military power of the US or China's economic clout, the EU shapes global commerce by enforcing high standards within its market, compelling multinational corporations to adopt these standards worldwide. This leads to a gradual Europeanization of global commerce in various sectors.

The article emphasizes the EU's regulatory power, particularly with the advent of AI. The **EU's AI Act** is a comprehensive regulation covering AI applications, reflecting the EU's commitment to addressing the challenges posed by AI, including digital discrimination and job displacement. The Act is seen as an extension of the Brussels Effect, influencing global AI policy.

Internationally, there is a growing movement towards establishing AI governance standards. The US has issued an **AI Executive Order** to guide responsible AI development, and the UK has hosted the **AI Safety Summit**, indicating a global recognition of the importance of AI regulations.

The article suggests that while the EU's AI Act and other international efforts do not contradict the Brussels Effect, they validate it. The US, leveraging its AI capabilities, is beginning to appreciate the significance of regulation, which might eventually contain the Brussels Effect's influence on AI and beyond.

The article concludes with a separate news snippet about the arrest of Ajit P Menon, a close aide of the Cox and Kings owner, in connection with a fraud case involving Yes Bank. Menon was arrested at Cochin International Airport, suspected of diverting loan money to foreign companies. His appointment as managing director of a sister concern was not officially recorded.

			<description>I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts. However, I can give you a summary based on the information you've provided:

- **Punjab Terrorist Activity**: In the last 24 hours, three individuals lost their lives and two were seriously injured due to ongoing terrorist activities in Punjab. A high-powered bomb attack at a place of worship in Bhatinda resulted in casualties and injuries.

- **Eenadu Editor's Legal Situation**: The Supreme Court has issued a notice regarding the writ petition filed by Eenadu editor Ramoji Rao, with a standing order preventing his arrest. This follows a legislative council finding him guilty of breaching privilege over a report on the discussion about abolishing the Upper House.

- **India-Bangladesh Border Tension**: Tensions have escalated on the India-Bangladesh border following a proposal for barbed-wire fencing. Bangladesh has refuted claims of significant migration into India since Bangladesh's independence in 1971.

- **Andhra Pradesh Exam Results**: The Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce the results of the first and second year intermediate public exams. Over 10 lakh students await their results, which will be available on official websites.

			<title>The scapegoating of India’s ‘elites’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dont-blame-the-elites-9260898/</link>
			<description>The article presents a critique of Aditya Puri's views on the intellectual elite and politics in India. The author argues against Puri's notion that politics is solely about economics, pointing out that Indian politics has always encompassed issues of equitable growth, culture, and religion. The piece highlights the irony of elites criticizing other elites for being out of touch while themselves being part of the elite. It discusses the backlash against elites, suggesting that populist leaders blame them for societal issues without offering solutions. The author disagrees with Puri's interpretation of the current Prime Minister's vision for India, instead advocating for a vision that includes justice, respect for all faiths, and attention to the needs of the poor. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of striving for a better country, regardless of one's status as an intellectual or ordinary person. The author, D'Souza, also mentions their recent work, "Roadwalker: A Few Miles on the Bharat Jodo Yatra."

			<title>Express View on stock market at 75,000: A high point</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/bse-market-capitalisation-bse-midcap-index-smallcap-index-national-income-9260994/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article you provided:

The BSE Sensex recently surpassed the 75,000 mark, reaching a peak of 75,124, although it closed slightly lower by 0.08%. Over the past year, the Sensex has seen a remarkable increase of nearly 25%, with the market capitalization of BSE-listed firms crossing Rs 400 lakh crore. This growth extends beyond large companies, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices up by approximately 67% and 65%, respectively.

Several factors have contributed to this market rally:
- The Indian economy exhibited strong growth, with an 8.4% increase in the third quarter of 2023-24, exceeding forecasts. The National Statistical Office has projected a full-year growth of 7.6%.
- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) anticipates a 7% growth in the current financial year, supported by expectations of robust corporate earnings, particularly in banking and auto sectors.
- There is speculation that central banks in developed countries, including the US Federal Reserve, may reduce policy rates, with potential rate cuts starting from the June meeting.
- In India, there's a possibility of monetary policy easing due to the expected decline in food inflation, influenced by factors like La Nina and a healthy output.
- With core inflation at 3.4%, a decrease in food inflation could provide room for the RBI to cut interest rates.
- The upcoming general elections have led investors to consider the likelihood of policy continuity, which has historically resulted in strong pre-election market rallies.
- However, there are concerns about high valuations, with the Sensex trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.54, above the average from 2014-15 to 2023-24.

Additionally, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) is set to announce the results for the intermediate public exams (IPE) for over 10 lakh students, with the exams having taken place from March 1 to April 20.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the article and my knowledge up to 2021. For the most current details and figures, it's best to refer to the latest financial reports and market analyses.</description>

			<title>Express View on Ukraine-returned medical students: To be a doctor</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/indian-students-in-ukraine-russia-ukraine-conflict-ukraine-war-9260931/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

In the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022, **18,000 Indian medical students** were compelled to return from Ukraine. The National Medical Commission permitted **4,000 final semester students** to complete their internships in India. As the conflict persists, many students have redirected to countries like Serbia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia for their medical education, highlighting the inadequacies of India's medical education system.

Despite the addition of over **220 medical colleges** in the past five years, increasing the seat count to **1,07,950**, the demand far exceeds the supply, with a ratio of **20 aspirants per available seat**. The NEET examination's competitiveness further exacerbates the issue, with only the top **0.25%** gaining admission to elite institutions.

The article suggests that to address the shortage of medical professionals, India could consider strategies like linking private colleges with district hospitals and enhancing the skills of paramedics and nurses. It also notes the challenges faced by MBBS graduates from abroad who must pass rigorous tests to practice in India, unlike in some European countries where credit transfers facilitate a smoother transition.

The article concludes by urging the government to undertake reforms to remedy the gaps in medical education. Additionally, it mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) is set to announce the results for the intermediate public exams, with over **10 lakh students** awaiting their outcomes.</description>

			<title>The oldest get-rich-quick scheme is back with world’s young billionaires</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/editorials/wealth-guaranteed-9260976/</link>
			<description>The article presents a critique of the common advice given by "tech bros" and self-help gurus on how to become wealthy through innovation and hard work. It suggests that a simpler and time-tested method is to inherit wealth, as evidenced by the fact that all billionaires under 30 have inherited their fortunes. Forbes magazine highlights that these young billionaires, including Firoz and Zahan Mistry of the Tata group, have simply had the right last names. The article points out that generational wealth transfer is set to increase, with over $5 trillion expected to be passed down in the next few decades. While acknowledging that envy of the uber-rich is natural, the article calls for a cessation of patronizing advice to the working class on how to become rich, emphasizing that luck plays a significant role in wealth acquisition. Additionally, the article mentions a viral video of cricketer Virat Kohli giving a supportive gesture to Rohit Sharma during a cricket match.</description>

			<title>Student suicides: How the hype around IITs creates a culture of unhappy students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/iit-hype-student-suicides-9260283/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the distressing trend of student suicides at premier institutes, highlighting the need for systemic change. It critiques the current remedial measures as addressing symptoms rather than causes, drawing an analogy to treating heart disease with cardiology units without addressing broader lifestyle and environmental factors.

The author argues that the public perception of IITs is skewed towards job prospects rather than education quality, fueled by media reports on high starting salaries. This creates unrealistic expectations and extreme competition. The intense preparation for entrance exams from a young age isolates students from family and social life, focusing solely on academic success.

The article suggests that if the JEE rewarded social contributions, like blood donation, it could lead to positive outcomes. It criticizes the societal pressure that leads to brutal academic preparation, as no other educational path guarantees a successful career as early as the IITs do.

Many IIT undergraduates feel unhappy and consider themselves failures if they don't meet their own or their parents' high expectations, despite being in prestigious programs. The author, a professor at IIT Kanpur, observes that students are ill-prepared for the academic rigor and real-world applications of their studies, leading to disillusionment.

The unhappiness extends to postgraduate students, who often come from smaller colleges and face even tougher challenges. The author calls for a shift in focus from placement to education, advocating for smaller classes, more personal interaction with faculty, and a reevaluation of student festivals in favor of technical discussions.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes that institutes should be places of learning, not just job placement centers. By setting realistic expectations, valuing diverse career paths, and fostering a stronger belief in education, the author hopes to alleviate the unhappiness prevalent in campuses. The views expressed are personal and come from a mechanical engineering professor at IIT Kanpur.</description>

			<title>Breaking our food myths: Muslims don’t make the best qorma and Afghan bakeries have Bihari bakers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/at-iftar-blurring-the-lines-between-us-and-them-9259797/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the deep connection between food and identity, highlighting how the act of sharing meals fosters camaraderie and security. It notes a cultural shift towards dining out, which has become associated with status. Food is a symbol of identity in today's socio-political climate, creating distinctions and fostering regional culinary trends. The author, a chef, emphasizes the importance of culinary experiences that connect with personal and collective histories, and the beauty of sharing meals with strangers, especially during festivals like Ramazan in India.

The narrative also touches on the complexities and conflicts surrounding food as an identity marker, citing incidents of violence and the politicization of food that infringes on minority rights. It challenges stereotypes associated with food and culture, and criticizes the stigmatization of meat-eating in some sections of Indian society that promote vegetarianism as a virtue.

The article underscores the judiciary's stance on personal dietary choices and the political agendas that threaten personal freedoms. It concludes by advocating for embracing new culinary experiences and sharing meals to appreciate cultural diversity and prevent the politicization of food. The writer's experiences during culinary heritage walks reveal the gaps in cultural understanding and the universal appeal of diverse cuisines.

Lastly, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce the Intermediate exam results on April 12, with the exams having taken place from March 1 to April 20, 2024. The previous year's pass percentages are also noted, with girls outperforming boys. The results can be checked on the official website using the roll number and date of birth.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/march-09-forty-years-ago-delhi-on-high-alert-9258975/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the key points from the article:

- **Security Alert in Delhi**: The Punjab police have warned the Delhi police and the Home Ministry of potential extremist threats from Punjab targeting VIPs in Delhi. The alert, issued by Punjab CID chief H.S. Randhawa, mentions terrorist activity around the Golden Temple and the risk of these groups entering the capital, prompting heightened security measures.

- **Indo-Bangla Border Fence**: India's High Commissioner to Bangladesh, I.P. Khosla, has stated that the construction of barbed wire fencing along the Bangladesh border will continue to prevent infiltration. Despite a protest note from Bangladesh, the construction is said not to breach the existing border agreement.

- **Space-Earth Communication**: Indian cosmonaut Sqn Ldr Rakesh Sharma, during a space-earth teletalk, shared his experiences of viewing stars and planets from space, describing them as small lights. He spends his free time gazing at the vastness of space through a window.

- **India-Libya Relations**: India and Libya have agreed to enhance their economic and technical cooperation and seek a deeper political relationship. This development came after discussions between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, marking a significant step in their bilateral relations.

The article also mentions various cultural and entertainment news, such as collaborations in the Indian film industry, societal observations, and reflections on the state of Indian cinema by actor Manoj Bajpayee.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-2024-free-and-fair-elections-eci-poll-code-violation-9258952/</link>
			<description>The article presents a critical examination of India's status as a democracy, contrasting the traditional view of democracy with the reality on the ground. It highlights three key features of democracy as perceived by most Indians: free and fair elections, a law-making elected body, and an executive state that implements laws. However, it notes that international agencies have downgraded India's democratic status, citing concerns over freedom of expression, association, religion, and fair trial.

The author, a professor at IIT Bombay, emphasizes the importance of democracy in enabling material, cultural, and social progress through informed choice and collective action. The article points out that countries like Canada produce detailed reports on various indicators of societal well-being, which foster discussion, innovation, and employment.

In contrast, the article describes the lack of such informative reporting in India, using a typical district in Maharashtra as an example where issues like water quality, road maintenance, and healthcare are not officially acknowledged or addressed. It argues that the bureaucracy and academia in India do not engage in the necessary community science and collective thinking to address these issues.

The article also touches on the national level, mentioning India's poor air quality and the absence of these critical issues from electoral discussions. It raises concerns about the education system, citing ASER reports that indicate a significant percentage of youth struggle with basic arithmetic and comprehension, questioning whether citizens can make informed choices.

The article concludes by questioning whether India is a functional democracy or merely a nation that holds regular elections, suggesting that the true answer is obscured by the noise of current affairs. The author's views are stated as personal, and the article ends with a brief mention of Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's comments on Indian cinema and the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films.</description>

			<title>How electoral bond verdict puts individual rights at risk</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-electoral-bond-verdict-puts-individual-rights-at-risk-9258951/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the implications of retrospective laws and judgments in India, focusing on two instances: the retrospective tax law of 2012 and the illegality of electoral bonds in 2024. It argues that while these measures were intended to protect sovereignty and democracy, they neglected the practical consequences, leading to economic costs and a loss of confidence in private investment. The article criticizes the judiciary's lack of accountability compared to the government, which is subject to checks by the electorate and independent institutions. It suggests that the judiciary should seek public opinion to improve accountability and highlights the need for alternatives to safeguard democracy without violating individual rights. The authors, Ravi and Kapoor, emphasize the importance of protecting private investment and property to maintain people's faith in the country's institutions.</description>

			<title>Express View on IIT Delhi’s Academic Progress Group: Reaching out</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-iit-delhis-academic-progress-group-reaching-out-9258967/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the tragic issue of student suicides in India, particularly at prestigious institutes like IITs. It highlights the case of Anil Kumar, a 21-year-old student from Uttar Pradesh who died by suicide at IIT-Delhi. In response to the increasing number of such incidents, IIT-Delhi established an Academic Progress Group (APG) to support students facing academic challenges. The APG has identified 192 students as struggling academically and has made accommodations for some to stay with family on campus.

The article notes that there have been five student suicides across various IITs in 2024 alone, and 98 suicides in central educational institutes over the past five years. It points out the immense pressure students face, which is often exacerbated for those from marginalized communities. Nearly half of the suicides at IITs since 2018 involved students from SC, ST, and OBC backgrounds.

The article calls for educational institutes to become more sensitive to the needs of students from deprived backgrounds to enable them to succeed. It concludes by mentioning the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education's announcement of results for over 10 lakh students who took exams from March 1 to April 20, with instructions for students to collect their mark sheets from their schools.</description>

			<title>Express View on Supreme Court linking climate change and fundamental rights: A call to action</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-supreme-court-linking-climate-change-and-fundamental-rights-a-call-to-action-9258966/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has emphasized the importance of the Fundamental Rights to Equality and Life and Liberty in addressing climate change, a critical global challenge. The Court's recent verdict highlights the urgency of protecting lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change, such as increased flooding, altered rainfall patterns, and heatwaves that pose health risks. Despite the growing evidence of climate vulnerability, environmental concerns have not been a priority for India's political class, often addressed only by academics, civil society, and activists.

Historically, the Supreme Court has linked environmental protection with human rights, asserting the right to a pollution-free environment as part of the Right to Life. The Court has now connected human rights with climate change mitigation, stressing that a clean environment is essential for the full realization of the right to life and health.

The ruling criticizes the government's lack of action in respecting the Court's decisions on environmental issues, which are often ignored until they become emergencies. The Court has called for effective measures to mitigate climate change, marking the ruling as a significant call to action.

In a separate note, the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce the results of the first and second year intermediate public exams today, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes. The results will be available on official websites, and students are advised to collect their original mark sheets from their respective schools.</description>

			<title>For peace, Myanmar needs outside help. Friends, including India, must step in</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/peace-myanmar-outside-help-friends-india-9257002/</link>
			<description>The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the ongoing conflict in Myanmar, which has been exacerbated by the military coup in February 2021. The United Nations has expressed concern over the escalating violence and the humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced and in need of aid. Despite the dire situation, the State Administration Council (SAC) and the Resistance are unable to agree on a way forward to de-escalate violence and provide humanitarian assistance. External help from ASEAN partners and neighbors like China, India, and Bangladesh is deemed necessary. The article suggests that India, as a significant neighbor, should develop practical proposals to address the crisis. The need for dialogue and a pathway to normalcy is emphasized, with a balance between the SAC's and the Resistance's visions for Myanmar's future. The article also notes the irony of Aung San Suu Kyi's absence from current discussions, despite her potential key role in a political solution.

In a separate note, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) will announce the results for the intermediate public exams today, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their results. The results will be available on official websites, and students are advised to collect their original mark sheets from their schools. 

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the article and my knowledge up to 2021. For the most current details and developments, I recommend checking the latest updates from reliable news sources.</description>

			<title>Ahead of 2024 polls, a gender manifesto</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ahead-of-2024-polls-a-gender-manifesto-9256980/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving role of women voters in India and the expectations for the next government to address gender equity. It highlights the increased turnout of female voters, who are now making independent voting decisions, and the anticipation of 47 crore women voting in the upcoming elections. The article emphasizes the need for political parties to recognize and support the aspirations of women and LGBTQ+ persons.

Key points from the gender manifesto mentioned in the article include:
- The need for political parties to adopt a gender agenda that ensures equity and dignity for all, especially marginalized communities.
- The Supreme Court's ruling on marriage rights and the call for legislative action to enable LGBTQ+ persons to choose their partners.
- The urgency to eliminate marital rape from the penal code and adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards gender-based violence.
- The importance of unlearning gender norms, reforming educational materials, and integrating gender sensitisation workshops into school curricula.
- The recognition of childcare as a shared responsibility and the implementation of paid paternity leave and creches in government offices.
- The emphasis on women's health rights, including free cancer screenings and increased financial support for pregnant and lactating mothers.
- Economic policies to support women's economic prosperity, such as funding for women-led start-ups, recognition of women farmers, and incentives for organizations employing women.
- The passage of the Women's Reservation Bill and the need for its swift implementation to ensure women's political representation.

The article concludes by stating that achieving gender parity will take over a century, but with determined government action, the recommendations can be realized within its tenure.

Additionally, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) will announce the results for the intermediate public exams today, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their results. Students are advised to check the official websites and collect their mark sheets from their schools. Please note that I cannot provide copyrighted content in full, but I hope this summary helps!

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/march-08-forty-yers-ago-ppp-poll-boycott-9257011/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article you provided:

- **Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Boycott**: The PPP has announced a complete boycott of the upcoming elections promised by Gen Ziaul Haq, criticizing his regime as illegal and unconstitutional, and accusing him of destroying Pakistan's 1973 constitution.

- **PM on Iran-Iraq War**: Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has called for an end to the Iran-Iraq war and for Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, expressing regret over the unresolved conflicts in the region.

- **The Punjab Problem**: With the Akalis withdrawing their agitation after the government agreed to consider Article 25, efforts are underway to resolve the Punjab issue, with ongoing secret talks between the government and Akali leadership.

- **Conflict in Nagaland**: An encounter between the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and the Burmese army resulted in 15 NSCN and 5 Burmese soldiers' deaths in northern Burma.

- **Andhra Pradesh Exam Results**: The BIEAP is set to announce the results of the first and second year intermediate public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes.

			<title>Express View on PM’s ‘guarantee’ for Indian economy: Goal worth setting</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-pms-guarantee-for-indian-economy-goal-worth-setting-9257013/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's economic growth and development under the Narendra Modi government. Here's a summary:

- **Economic Ranking**: India's economy was ranked 10th globally in 2013-14 and has risen to 5th by the end of the Modi government's second term, with aspirations to become the 3rd largest economy.
- **GDP Growth**: The rise in ranking was achieved with an average annual GDP growth of 5.9% from 2014-15 to 2023-24, which is lower than the 6.8% growth during the previous 10 years under the Congress-led government.
- **Per Capita GDP**: Despite the overall growth, India's per capita GDP remains low at just over $2,500, significantly less than China's $13,000. In 1990, India's per capita GDP was higher than China's, indicating China's rapid growth over three decades.
- **Development Goals**: The Modi government aims for a 'Viksit Bharat' or developed India by 2047, which would require quadrupling the per capita GDP to $10,000 in today's prices. India is currently classified as a "lower-middle income" country by the World Bank.
- **Policy Focus**: The article suggests that setting targets for per capita GDP could lead to more focused policy-making, similar to the goal set by Prime Minister Modi in 2016 to double farmers' income by 2022.
- **Social Welfare**: The article concludes with a mention of the Bombay High Court's surprise over the Maharashtra government's inability to provide monetary benefits to the family of late Major Anuj Sood, who was awarded the Shaurya Chakra posthumously.

The article emphasizes the importance of improving the standard of living and per capita GDP, rather than just focusing on the total size of the economy, to truly develop the nation and enhance the lives of its citizens.</description>

			<title>Vandita Mishra writes: BJP has upped the stakes in this election. Can the Opposition step up to it?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-bjp-opposition-9256554/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contrasting campaign strategies of the BJP and Congress in the assembly polls preceding the Lok Sabha elections. The BJP ran a centralized campaign with PM Modi at the forefront, while Congress focused on local issues and candidates. The Congress's approach seemed to be a reaction to the BJP's dominance on larger national issues, leading to a "me-too" race on matters like public Hindu religiosity and economic promises.

As the Lok Sabha elections approach, the article questions whether Congress can afford a decentralized campaign or if it needs to establish a clear national agenda, especially in light of recent political actions by the BJP government, such as the arrest of opposition chief ministers and investigations against political opponents.

The article suggests that Congress needs to bridge the gap between its central leadership and local workers, find a more vivid and empathetic language to connect with voters, and translate its message of "democracy in danger" into relatable terms. The stakes are high, and the BJP has raised them further, leaving Congress and the opposition with the challenge of stepping up in the coming days and weeks.

The article also briefly mentions other topics, such as Imtiaz Ali's collaboration with Diljit Dosanjh, the decline of Urdu language in Delhi, and a viral video of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, but these are not the main focus of the summary. If you need more details on any specific part, feel free to ask!</description>

			<title>From ‘Kissa Kursi Ka’ to ‘The Kerala Story’: Power, propaganda and Doordarshan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/doordarshan-kerala-story-power-propaganda-9256307/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the evolution of television in India and its impact on democracy and media autonomy. It traces the journey from the analog era of cathode ray tubes to the digital revolution, highlighting the struggle to maintain liberal spaces against centralization of power. The establishment of Doordarshan, India's state-controlled media unit, marked a significant development in Indian broadcasting, with daily transmissions beginning in 1965 and nationwide telecast starting in 1976.

The piece delves into the historical and cultural significance of terms like "Akashvani" and "Doordarshan," and their mystical connotations within the national consciousness. It also touches upon the role of television in shaping public opinion and the political motivations behind controlling media units, particularly in post-colonial South Asia.

The article discusses the foresight of India's Constitution architects in anticipating conflicts between government and federal components, with the Seventh Schedule outlining the division of powers, including broadcasting and censorship.

Despite constitutional safeguards, conflicts have arisen, challenging the autonomy of media. The B G Verghese Committee's report in 1978 and the subsequent establishment of Prasar Bharati in 1997 aimed to address these concerns, though the extent to which the original vision was realized remains debatable.

The author concludes by emphasizing the ongoing struggle for media autonomy against propaganda, the need for vigilant citizenship, and the symbolic representation of truth, godliness, and beauty in Doordarshan's logo. The article ends with a poetic reference to Rabindranath Tagore's vision of freedom and a mention of a viral social media video featuring cricketers Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.</description>

			<title>Like LeBron James, Hardik Pandya should embrace being IPL’s villain</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lebron-james-hardik-pandya-ipl-hate-9255984/</link>
			<description>The article draws a parallel between the backlash faced by Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya after moving from the Gujarat Titans to the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, and the criticism LeBron James received when he left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010. Both athletes were seen as disloyal by fans, and both faced significant abuse—LeBron for creating a "superteam" and Hardik for casteist and colorist reasons.

The article suggests that Hardik could learn from LeBron, who embraced his role as the NBA's "villain" rather than trying to win over his critics. LeBron's acceptance of this persona made for compelling viewing and ultimately led to success, with his team winning two subsequent finals. Similarly, Hardik is encouraged to embrace the negative attention and use his talent to become a player that fans love to hate, which could lead to a turnaround in public perception, much like LeBron's current respected status in the NBA.

The article concludes with a brief mention of the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP), which is set to announce the results for the first and second year intermediate public exams (IPE) today at 11 am, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their results.</description>

			<title>The unpleasant soundtrack of the boo</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ipl-hardik-pandya-booed-rohit-sharma-hardik-mumbai-indians-9255343/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the mixed reactions Hardik Pandya has received during the IPL season, particularly the boos from fans due to his transfer from Gujarat Titans to Mumbai Indians. It reflects on the nature of franchise cricket and fan loyalty, comparing it to instances in other sports where players faced similar treatment. The article also touches on the history of such reactions in Indian cricket, citing examples of Tendulkar and Gavaskar. It suggests that while Pandya may be disheartened by the response, his performance could win back the fans' affection, just as other cricketers have done in the past.

The article concludes with a separate news piece about the arrest of Ajit P Menon, a close aide of the Cox and Kings owner, in connection with a Rs 400 crore fraud case involving Yes Bank. Menon was apprehended at Cochin International Airport after being wanted for three years. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) suspects he diverted loan money to foreign companies, although his appointment as managing director of a sister concern was not officially recorded.</description>

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: Modi as a Congress role model</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-congress-poll-manifesto-congress-nyaya-patra-9255333/</link>
			<description>The article is a political commentary on the recent election manifesto released by India's Congress Party. The columnist expresses disappointment, noting that the party's leaders appeared defeated and that their manifesto seemed to borrow heavily from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rhetoric and promises, particularly the use of the word 'guarantee.' The Congress Party's economic proposals, such as job guarantees for the unemployed and financial gifts for women, are criticized for being too left-leaning and impractical, with concerns about the impact on the nation's budget.

The columnist also highlights the urgent need for a strong opposition in India, pointing out the continued poverty despite government schemes. A visit to a village in Maharashtra is described, where the Adivasi community lives in dire conditions, with inadequate housing and lack of access to basic amenities like water, despite government welfare programs.

The article concludes with a critique of the Congress Party's approach to alleviating poverty, suggesting that instead of offering freebies, the party should focus on providing sustainable solutions like education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. The manifesto is seen as a sign that the party has not learned from past mistakes and is unlikely to gain from the government's failures in lifting citizens out of poverty.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: Constitutional morality is at stake</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/constitutional-morality-is-at-stake-9255312/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complexities surrounding the arrest of a serving chief minister on corruption charges, highlighting the legal, political, and constitutional implications. It emphasizes the presumption of innocence and the established democratic process of electing and unseating a chief minister. The article points out that while there are legitimate ways to unseat a chief minister, such as elections or a no-confidence motion, other methods like 'Operation Lotus' and the use of investigative agencies to arrest a chief minister can destabilize a government and challenge the principles of parliamentary democracy.

The author questions whether the arrest and detention of a chief minister align with constitutional morality, especially in a country following the Westminster model of government. The article suggests that some countries have adopted immunity clauses for their heads of government to protect against malicious political actions, and debates whether similar implied immunity should be recognized for prime ministers and chief ministers in India to uphold constitutional morality and the principles of parliamentary democracy.

Lastly, the article briefly mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce the results for the intermediate public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes.</description>

			<description>The article discusses several key points related to Indian politics and foreign policy:

- **NSA Ajit Doval**: At 79, Ajit Doval is considering retirement to spend time with his grandchildren. Despite his son not receiving a BJP ticket, Doval remains influential, having shaped India's assertive foreign policy stance against anti-national elements abroad.
- **Foreign Operations**: There have been a number of deaths of individuals deemed enemies of India in foreign countries, with some attributing these to orders from India. This includes the case of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, with the US sending a stern warning against such actions.
- **Legal Proceedings**: The US is seeking extradition of an individual from the Czech Republic for involvement in an assassination attempt, with suspicions about the involvement of an Indian government official.
- **Bollywood and Politics**: Efforts by BJP leaders to recruit Bollywood celebrities for the 2024 elections were largely unsuccessful, reflecting the industry's reluctance to engage in the current polarized political climate.
- **Political Maneuvering**: Varun Gandhi declined to contest the Lok Sabha elections against Priyanka Gandhi, and discussions about his political future are ongoing.
- **Leadership Dynamics**: Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik emphasized that no one is indispensable within the party, reflecting on past experiences with other leaders.
- **Political Rallies**: A recent opposition rally in Delhi saw a full stage but less than expected crowd participation, with AAP's performance on its home ground particularly noted.
- **Education**: The Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education is set to announce results for public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes.

			<title>Express View on NCERT revisions: Narrowing the view</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-ncert-revisions-narrowing-the-view-9257019/</link>
			<description>The article discusses two main issues:

**1. NCERT Textbook Revisions:**
The investigation highlights significant changes in NCERT textbooks for classes VI to XII, emphasizing that while updates to educational material are necessary, the revisions seem to be influenced by current political narratives rather than academic advancements. Key concerns include:
- **Omission of Recent Research:** Important archaeological findings about the Indus Valley Civilization and contemporary historiography, especially regarding India's Northeast, are not adequately incorporated.
- **Political Overtones:** The revisions are said to downplay complex political events like the Babri Masjid demolition and social issues related to caste.
- **Ideological Influence:** Changes in the textbooks, such as the removal of references to the socio-economic struggles of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, suggest a political agenda rather than an educational one.

**2. EOW Arrest in Bank Fraud Case:**
The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has arrested Ajit P Menon, a close aide of the Cox and Kings owner, in connection with a Rs 400 crore Yes Bank fraud case. Menon, a British national, was apprehended at Cochin International Airport after being wanted for three years. The EOW suspects that he diverted loan money to foreign companies and his official records do not reflect his reported position as managing director of a sister concern.

The article concludes by advocating for classrooms to provide objective education that acknowledges social complexities, urging NCERT to facilitate this rather than obstruct it.</description>

			<title>Army inquiry in Rajouri deaths: Upholding justice, winning hearts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/army-inquiry-in-rajouri-deaths-upholding-justice-winning-hearts-9254858/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the complexities of military operations in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the hinterlands, where Indian Army troops face severe restrictions due to internal security and proxy war conditions. It highlights an incident on December 21, 2023, where the interrogation of villagers suspected of aiding terrorists led to the deaths of three civilians. The Raksha Mantri's visit emphasized the dual responsibility of the Army to protect the country and win the hearts of the people.

The article outlines three key points for public awareness:
1. **Proxy War Operations**: The need for a balanced approach by security forces, acknowledging both successes and setbacks. Decentralization is crucial for quick decision-making based on intelligence.
2. **Army's Reputation**: The vulnerability of the Army's reputation to attacks aimed at undermining its relationship with the local population, which is central to operations.
3. **Allegations and Justice**: The importance of correctly judging allegations against the Army's conduct, with serious ones requiring timely investigation and due process.

The inquiry into the Rajouri incident revealed lapses by personnel, and the article suggests that transparency in such investigations could reduce the need for protections like AFSPA. The writer, a former corps commander, stresses that the people remain the center of gravity in these operations.

Additionally, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) will announce Intermediate exam results on April 12, 2024, which can be accessed on their official website. The exams took place from March 1 to April 20, 2024, with the previous year's pass percentages being 61% for the first year and 72% for the second year, with girls outperforming boys.</description>

			<title>From J K Rowling to Congress Manifesto for 2024: Where is India’s queer voter?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-queer-voters-lok-sabha-elections-congress-manifesto-9254729/</link>
			<description>The article discusses several key issues related to LGBTQ+ rights and visibility in India, juxtaposed with global events. Here's a summary:

- **Congress Manifesto &amp; LGBTQ+ Rights**: The Congress party in India has pledged to expand constitutional protections to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and has proposed legalizing civil unions for LGBTQ+ couples after consultations.

- **J.K. Rowling Controversy**: The author has sparked another debate by challenging a new hate crime law in Scotland that protects transgender individuals, with her comments leading to discussions about freedom of speech.

- **Social Media &amp; Debate**: The article suggests that social media often prioritizes sensationalism over substantive policy discussion, noting that Rowling's controversy has overshadowed the Congress party's manifesto on LGBTQ+ rights.

- **Transgender Healthcare in India**: It highlights the inadequate healthcare facilities for transgender individuals in India, citing the lack of implementation of the Transgender Persons Rules, 2020, which mandate separate wards and washrooms for trans patients.

- **NALSA Judgment Anniversary**: April 15 marks a decade since the NALSA v Union of India judgment, which recognized transgender people as socially and economically backward and mandated reservations for them, yet no central government policy has been enacted to support this.

- **Employment &amp; Education for Transgender People**: The article points out the low formal employment rate among transgender persons and the lack of transgender students and staff in central universities, except for IGNOU.

- **Need for Localized Solutions**: It argues for homegrown solutions to secure and implement rights for transgender persons in India, considering the unique cultural and socioeconomic context.

- **Election Considerations**: The piece reflects on the absence of LGBTQ+ issues in the current election discourse and the need for these topics to be addressed in future elections.

- **Andhra Pradesh Exam Results**: Separately, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce results for the first and second year intermediate public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes.

The article concludes by urging reflection on the lack of LGBTQ+ representation in the election and how to bring about change in the next electoral cycle.</description>

			<title>Why there were no tech startups and unicorns in electoral bond purchaser list</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-there-were-no-tech-startups-and-unicorns-in-electoral-bond-purchaser-list-9254565/</link>
			<description>The article by Meghna Bal discusses the absence of tech entrepreneurs from the list of electoral bond purchasers in India, which raises concerns about their influence on public policy. Despite the government's support for technology and innovation, as evidenced by Nehru's and Modi's pro-technology statements, tech companies often face unpredictable policies and stringent regulations. The article suggests that while large investments favor established firms, disruptive innovation typically comes from smaller startups. It emphasizes the need for a bottom-up approach to policy formation, giving smaller tech companies a voice in policymaking. The U.S.'s Small Business Innovation Research Program is cited as a model for supporting small tech firms. The article concludes with a call for campaign finance reform to ensure fair representation of business interests and advocates for greater involvement of tech entrepreneurs in policy formation to align pro-innovation rhetoric with actual policy action. The writer is the Director of Esya Centre, a tech policy think tank, and the views expressed are personal. Additionally, the article mentions deep belly breathing as a beneficial technique for relaxation and stress relief.</description>

			<title>Why bail — even for UAPA and corruption charges — must not be denied</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pmla-arrests-uapa-corruption-charges-bail-9254486/</link>
			<description>The article by Anita Abraham discusses the stringent bail laws under Special Acts like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which often result in "jail, not bail," contrasting with the principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Supreme Court of India, through a recent order, has questioned whether a separate bail law should be enacted, as suggested in a 2022 judgment, to ensure that bail remains the rule and jail the exception, in line with Article 21 of the Constitution.

The article highlights the punitive nature of the arrest process and the Supreme Court's stance against prolonged custody without trial. Special laws like PMLA, NDPS, and UAPA have restricted the courts' discretion to grant bail, leading to potential miscarriages of justice due to lengthy trials. The author argues for swift justice and reasonable bail conditions, emphasizing the state's obligation to expedite fair trials. The Supreme Court has underscored the importance of expeditious trials, noting the immeasurable injustice to individuals from delayed justice and poor jail conditions.

In conclusion, the article calls for bail laws that balance the rights of the accused, victims, and the common good, adhering to the constitutional mandate of life and liberty. The author is an advocate practicing in Karnataka and Delhi courts.

Additionally, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) will announce the results for the intermediate public exams today, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their results. The results will be available on official websites, and students are advised to collect their original mark sheets from their schools.</description>

			<title>April 6, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Government orders stricter the National Security Act in Punjab</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/forty-years-government-orders-stricter-the-national-security-act-in-punjab-9253909/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the key points from the article you've provided:

- **National Security Act in Punjab**: The government has made the National Security Act more stringent for detainees in Punjab through an ordinance signed by President Zail Singh during a Lok Sabha discussion on the Punjab situation.

- **Rakesh Sharma's Space Journey**: Squadron Leader Rakesh Sharma, when asked by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi about India's appearance from space, famously replied, "Saare Jahan Se Achcha." This exchange occurred during a six-minute televised conversation where Mrs. Gandhi congratulated Sharma and his Soviet cosmonaut colleagues on their successful mission, which she believed would make India more aware of space and inspire its youth.

- **Authors' Royalties**: The Foreign Exchange Regulation Appellate Board ruled that authors do not require government approval to publish their books abroad and earn royalties. This decision came in the case of Arun Bose, a Delhi University teacher who challenged an enforcement directorate's penalty for publishing two books in Britain without government permission.

- **Iran-Iraq Conflict**: Iran dismissed the possibility of mediation by the non-aligned movement to resolve its ongoing conflict with Iraq. The Iranian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hossein Sheikh-ul-Islam, stated at a news conference that Iran expects India, as the chair of the movement, to address the issue of Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons in the conflict.

The rest of the article mentions various cultural and entertainment topics, including collaborations in the film industry, the decline of a language, the influence of behavior among monkeys, and a viral social media video featuring cricketers Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.</description>

			<title>Now in Chandigarh, a film festival with a fresh focus</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/now-in-chandigarh-a-film-festival-with-a-fresh-focus-9253878/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the significance of film festivals in the age of streaming platforms, using the Cinévesture International Film Festival (CIFF) in Chandigarh as a case study. It argues that while digital content is readily available, the communal experience of a film festival is unique and irreplaceable. CIFF, founded by Nina Lath Gupta of Cinévesture, is praised for its well-organized and thoughtfully curated event, which included panels with prominent film personalities and a diverse selection of films. The festival is seen as a startup-like venture with the freedom to create a strong team and the potential to provide a springboard for fresh cinematic ideas. It aims to foster a new audience for meaningful cinema through workshops and by showcasing a mix of international titles and Indian independent films. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of curating good cinema and the role of film festivals in preserving the art form against profit-driven content.

Please note that the last paragraph about the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) announcing exam results seems unrelated to the main content of the article and may have been included inadvertently. If you need information on that topic, I can provide it separately.</description>

			<title>IPL introducing sign language for commentary is a welcome move</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/ipl-introducing-sign-language-for-commentary-is-a-welcome-move-9253907/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a significant step towards inclusivity in Indian sports, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL). It highlights the introduction of real-time sign-language and descriptive commentaries for spectators with auditory or visual disabilities, marking a first in India. This initiative is seen as a strong move in a country where disability rights and inclusivity are still developing, and often viewed through an ableist lens.

Internationally, sign language assistance has been integrated into sports events for some time, with notable examples being football clubs like Barcelona, Arsenal, and England's national team at Wembley Stadium. In contrast, India faces challenges in providing equal access to public spaces and activities for its estimated 63 million people with significant hearing impairments.

The article emphasizes that while the IPL's adoption of sign-language commentary is a positive development, there is a broader need for societal change and recognition of the rights of all individuals. It also mentions a viral social media video of cricketer Virat Kohli showing sportsmanship towards Rohit Sharma, underscoring the spirit of camaraderie in sports. The overall message is one of progress and the ongoing need for equality and accessibility in sports spectatorship.</description>

			<title>Express View: Manifesto &amp; speech</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-manifesto-speech-9253908/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Congress party's new manifesto, "Nyay Patra," ahead of the upcoming elections. It highlights a shift from the party's previous stance, with a focus on nuanced politics and policy. The manifesto aims to revisit laws affecting free speech and bail conditions, asserts the Delhi government's autonomy, and advocates for full statehood for Jammu &amp; Kashmir. It avoids discussing the Old Pension Scheme due to its financial implications and includes proposals like the Employment Linked Incentive Scheme to emphasize job creation and the private sector.

The article questions why the balanced approach of the manifesto is not reflected in Congress leaders' speeches and campaigns. It critiques the party's political messaging, which has ranged from mimicking the BJP to Rahul Gandhi's campus-style rhetoric, and the lack of an alternative vision to the BJP's governance. The manifesto is seen as a late start in offering innovative policy proposals, with the challenge for Congress being to translate these ideas into persuasive campaign language with credibility.

Additionally, the article mentions that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) will announce Intermediate exam results on April 12. The exams took place from March 1 to April 20, 2024, and the results will be available on the official website.

Please note that I cannot verify the currentness of this information, as my last update was in 2021, and I recommend checking the latest sources for the most recent updates.</description>

			<title>India’s message to China: Respect the rules you expect everyone else to follow</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-china-mea-response-influence-beijing-9253623/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing geopolitical tension between China and India over Arunachal Pradesh. It highlights China's practice of renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh, which India rejects. The article also touches on China's historical claims and its use of history as a tool for territorial expansion. It then shifts focus to India's response, particularly the actions of External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who, during a visit to the Philippines, affirmed India's support for a rules-based international order and the country's readiness to support the Philippines against China's claims in the South China Sea. This stance is seen as a departure from India's traditional policy and demonstrates its willingness to engage in global affairs. The article concludes with a mention of the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education's announcement of exam results, unrelated to the main geopolitical theme.

Here's a brief summary:

- **China's Renaming Efforts**: China has been renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh, which India dismisses as senseless.
- **India's Stance**: India, through its External Affairs Ministry, rejects China's attempts and emphasizes adherence to a rules-based order.
- **Historical Claims**: China uses historical narratives to justify long-term territorial claims, such as those in Arunachal Pradesh and the South China Sea.
- **India's Global Role**: India shows readiness to support the Philippines against China's maritime claims, indicating a more assertive global presence.
- **China's Reaction**: China perceives India's actions as strategic, aimed at engaging nations with conflicts with China.
- **India's Message**: India advocates for peace, stability, and credibility in international relations, urging China to respect a rules-based order.
- **Local News**: The article ends with a brief note on the Andhra Pradesh intermediate public exam results announcement.</description>

			<title>Why RBI has been wary of declaring an early victory over inflation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-rbi-wary-of-declaring-early-victory-over-inflation-9253330/</link>
			<description>Here's a summary of the article:

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained its policy stance on April 5, aligning with market expectations due to strong economic growth and inflation above target. The economy has shown resilience, particularly in non-farm sectors, with a GDP growth of 7.6% for the fiscal year, supported by high-frequency data like the robust PMI of 61.8 in March. However, agricultural growth was modest at 0.7%.

GDP growth has been investment-driven, with private consumption lagging but remaining crucial for balanced growth. CRISIL forecasts a GDP growth moderation to 6.8% for the current year, influenced by the ongoing transmission of RBI's rate hikes and regulatory measures affecting credit growth.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the challenge of achieving the disinflation target of 4%, with the RBI cautious about declaring victory over inflation too soon. The RBI projects a 7% GDP growth and a decrease in inflation to 4.5% for 2024-25, assuming normal monsoon and stable crude oil prices.

Food inflation, particularly for vegetables, has been high and persistent, impacting lower-income groups more significantly. A normal monsoon and healthy agricultural output are expected to alleviate food inflation and boost rural consumption. Fuel inflation risks are considered low, with crude oil prices expected to be around $80-85 per barrel.

Internationally, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are not rushing to cut rates, but reductions are anticipated by mid-year. India's monetary policy is primarily influenced by domestic conditions, but global rate cuts could affect emerging markets. Improved fiscal-monetary coordination in India suggests a conducive environment for rate cuts by the end of summer, although factors like monsoon and crude oil prices could disrupt this trajectory.

The article concludes with insights from the Chief Economist at CRISIL Limited and mentions other subscriber-only topics related to India's socio-economic landscape. Additionally, it notes that the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education will announce exam results for over 10 lakh students, with results available on official websites.</description>

			<title>What I learnt about love from a 60-year-old Hindi novel</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-i-learnt-about-love-hindi-novel-9253011/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Hindi novel "Ve Din" (Those Days) by Nirmal Verma, which explores the theme of ephemeral love and its profound impact. The novel's narrative revolves around a fleeting yet intense three-day romance between the narrator, a young man in Prague, and Raina Ramon, a visiting Austrian single mother. Their connection defies conventional definitions of love, focusing on the joy of the present moment without expectations or judgments.

The story challenges the reader to consider the value of transient experiences and the depth of emotions that can exist outside societal labels. It suggests that sometimes, embracing the present fully, even if it's short-lived, can be more fulfilling than a long-term relationship that lacks passion. The novel encourages taking risks for rare and unique encounters, highlighting that such experiences can be as real and meaningful as lifelong partnerships.

The article also references the enduring love story of author Amrita Pritam and artist Imroz, which contrasts with the novel's brief affair but similarly transcends traditional relationship norms. The question posed by Raina at the end, "Is it not enough, what we have received in these few days?" invites readers to reflect on their own perceptions of love and fulfillment.

The article concludes with a mention of a viral video featuring cricketer Virat Kohli giving a supportive gesture to Rohit Sharma, indicating a moment of camaraderie between the two sportsmen.</description>

			<title>Are queer couples protected by the Indian judiciary?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/are-queer-couples-protected-by-the-indian-judiciary-9252637/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the evolving legal landscape in India regarding non-traditional intimate relationships, particularly focusing on the LGBTQ+ community. It highlights several court cases where the judiciary's approach to live-in and same-sex relationships has been under scrutiny. 

**Key Points:**
- The **Allahabad High Court** made observations last year that live-in relationships could harm the institution of marriage and society's stability.
- The **Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court** faced criticism for refusing to protect a woman in a same-sex relationship, with a judge equating constitutionality with morality.
- The **Supreme Court of India** set a precedent by striking down Section 377 IPC, decriminalizing same-sex relationships among consenting adults.
- The article points out instances where high courts have been accused of moral policing in cases involving habeas corpus petitions related to LGBTQ+ individuals.
- A case from **Kerala** reached the Supreme Court, which criticized the High Court's direction for psychological counselling of a woman in a same-sex relationship.
- On March 11, 2024, the Supreme Court issued guidelines for handling such cases, emphasizing respect for individual identity and sexual orientation without imposing "counselling".
- The Supreme Court's guidelines mandate that habeas corpus petitions in cases of intimate relationships should be prioritized without moral judgment, ensuring the detained person's autonomy.
- The judgment aims to protect the privacy and dignity of individuals in non-traditional relationships and calls for legislative support for such relationships.
- The article also touches upon the issue of safe housing for such couples, suggesting that state intervention may be necessary.

The article concludes by reflecting on the need for empathy and legal protection for non-traditional relationships, hoping for a positive change in judicial attitudes. It also briefly mentions the unrelated case of Mohammed Abdul Arfath, whose family is dealing with the aftermath of his death and associated financial burdens. 

**Authorship:**
- The article is authored by Sinha, an Advocate-on-Record of the Supreme Court of India, known for the book "The Great Repression — the story of sedition in India".</description>

			<title>Ahead of 2024 polls, how government can generate employment through universal healthcare</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ahead-of-2024-polls-how-government-can-generate-employment-through-universal-healthcare-9252095/</link>
			<description>The article emphasizes the importance of healthcare as a strategic investment for India's prosperity, especially in the context of the upcoming general elections. It argues that healthcare should be prioritized in the national budget, with a commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP by 2025. However, the current allocation is only 28% of the required amount.

The government's role is highlighted as a catalyst for change, encouraging public-private partnerships to improve healthcare services. The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is discussed as a transformative initiative providing hospitalization cover to over 60 crore people, but challenges such as low reimbursement rates for private hospitals are noted.

The article calls for addressing healthcare infrastructure gaps, with India needing nearly 24 lakh more beds. It suggests granting the health sector national priority status for better financial support and incentives, and highlights the potential for healthcare to create 4 crore jobs.

The piece concludes by stressing the urgency for action and political commitment to ensure the long-term benefits of healthcare investment. The writer's credentials as a healthcare executive and chair of a public health task force are mentioned, and the views are stated as personal.

Additionally, the article briefly mentions the Bombay High Court's request for an affidavit from the Maharashtra government regarding monetary benefits for the family of late Major Anuj Sood, who was awarded the Shaurya Chakra posthumously.</description>

			<title>Kate Middleton diagnosis: How to talk to your child about a life-threatening illness</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kate-middleton-diagnosis-how-to-talk-to-your-child-about-a-life-threatening-illness-9252094/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the delicate issue of communicating a parent's life-threatening illness to children, particularly in the context of Indian society where such matters are often kept from the young. It highlights the confusion and emotional turmoil children face when left to deduce the truth themselves, leading to feelings of hate, guilt, and grief. CanSupport, an organization mentioned in the article, observes the negative impact of this silence on children, including behavioral regressions and emotional outbursts.

The piece emphasizes the importance of age-appropriate communication, providing support without overwhelming the child with information. It suggests using physical gestures and simple explanations to reassure children of their safety and continued love. The resilience of children is noted, advocating for proper guidance and preparation to help them adapt to challenging situations.

The article also touches on the need for parents to prepare children for the possibility of a parent's death, addressing their natural curiosity and fears in a sensitive manner. It advises involving children in the care process to make them feel valued and cautions against overburdening them, which could lead to resentment.

In conclusion, the article stresses the significance of maintaining joy and laughter in the family, regardless of the circumstances. It asserts that the way parents handle challenges will greatly influence how their children cope with their own future challenges. The writer, the Founder-President of CanSupport, underscores the necessity of parental love and open communication for helping children navigate their emotions and the realities of life.

Additionally, the article briefly mentions Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's insights into the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films in Indian cinema, citing South Indian stars like Yash and Allu Arjun as examples of how audiences find inspiration in their screen heroes amidst an unfulfilling reality.</description>

			<title>Express View on Indians seeking surrogacy abroad: For love of a child</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indians-seeking-surrogacy-abroad-for-love-of-a-child-9252032/</link>
			<description>The article discusses two main topics:

**Surrogacy Laws in India:**
- The tightening of surrogacy laws in India has led to a trend of affluent Indians seeking commercial surrogacy abroad.
- Countries like the US, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and some East European nations have become popular destinations, with costs varying from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 6 crore.
- The demographic of those seeking surrogacy is diverse, including single individuals, same-sex couples, and married couples.
- India's surrogacy regulation has evolved, with commercial surrogacy being legal since 2002 but restricted in 2015 to prevent exploitation.
- Currently, only altruistic surrogacy without compensation is permitted, with strict criteria excluding live-in partners, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and singles.
- The article criticizes the patriarchal bias of the laws and calls for more inclusive legislation that recognizes diverse family structures.

**Indian Cinema Commentary by Manoj Bajpayee:**
- Manoj Bajpayee commented on the appeal of massy actors and grand films in Indian cinema.
- He cited South Indian actors like Yash and Allu Arjun as examples of how audiences find inspiration in film stars amidst their own realities.

The article highlights the need for surrogacy laws to adapt to societal changes and the role of cinema in providing escapism and inspiration.</description>

			<title>Best of Both Sides: The BJP’s ‘400 Paar’ slogan is about absolute power</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/best-of-both-sides-bjp-400-paar-slogan-absolute-power-9251575/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) ambitious goal of winning more than 400 seats in the Indian elections, an increase from its previous target of 300-plus seats. This target is seen not just as a numerical goal but as a symbol of a dominant and unyielding political mandate. The article raises concerns about the implications of such a majority, suggesting it could lead to a lack of accountability and a permanent majority that is not subject to the checks and balances of a democratic system.

It highlights the BJP's strategies and actions, such as arresting opposition leaders and using government agencies against political rivals, which may be seen as efforts to consolidate power and weaken the opposition. The article contrasts this with the past, where even a government with a large majority faced active opposition and challenges, leading to a vibrant democracy.

The piece also touches on the current state of opposition parties, which appear to be struggling with internal issues and reduced influence, making the BJP's goal of a "400-paar" majority a concerning prospect for the democratic system. It concludes by suggesting that a large mandate does not necessarily equate to better governance, as history has shown with the Rajiv Gandhi government of the 1980s.

Lastly, the article mentions a separate news item about the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) announcing results for intermediate public exams, which is unrelated to the main political discussion.

			<title>Ahead of 2024 polls, not ‘Arogya Mandirs’ but a healthcare manifesto</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ahead-of-2024-polls-not-arogya-mandirs-but-a-healthcare-manifesto-9251413/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the need for a comprehensive overhaul of India's healthcare system, especially in light of the upcoming general elections post-Covid-19. It highlights the "People's Health Manifesto" by Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, which proposes seven key shifts in health policy:

1. **Primary Healthcare Focus**: Expansion and improvement of public health facilities at the primary level, using successful models like Mohalla Clinics and Family Health Centres.

2. **Increased Public Health Financing**: A substantial increase in government spending on health, aiming to provide better access to free healthcare and reduce out-of-pocket expenses for families.

3. **Decentralised Care**: Enhancing social accountability and decentralised management to ensure resources improve public health delivery effectively.

4. **Fair Compensation for Healthcare Workers**: Regularisation of employment and fair wages for all healthcare workers to strengthen public health services.

5. **Regulation of Private Healthcare**: Standardisation of hospital rates and transparency in pricing to protect patients' rights and prevent overcharging.

6. **Access to Affordable Medicines**: Expansion of price control to all essential medicines and implementation of a generic medicine policy to reduce costs.

7. **Universal Healthcare System**: Moving towards a rights-based approach to healthcare, ensuring free, quality care for all, inspired by models like Thailand's universal healthcare.

The manifesto calls for political commitment to these changes, emphasizing that the Covid-19 experience has made it imperative to prioritize health in India's social and political agenda. Additionally, the article briefly mentions Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's insights into the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films in Indian cinema.</description>

			<title>Nirmala Sitharaman, election finances and revelations about BJP’s limitations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/nirmala-sitharaman-election-finances-revelations-bjp-limitations-9251387/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a series of candid admissions by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at a media event, which diverged from her usual public persona. She expressed that she lacks the financial resources to contest Lok Sabha polls and highlighted the winnability criteria based on community and religion within her party, the BJP. Sitharaman's remarks also touched on the party's openness to individuals charged with corruption, suggesting a departure from combativeness to a more accepting stance.

The article interprets Sitharaman's statements as an acknowledgment of a political malaise, where nationalist narratives are overshadowed by the influence of money and identity politics. It suggests that her comments reflect a broader issue within the BJP, challenging the party's narrative of unity and questioning the effectiveness of its empowerment and idealism.

Furthermore, the article speculates on the implications of Sitharaman's statements for her party colleagues and the RSS, the BJP's parent organization. It questions whether her personal views reveal a deeper dilemma within the party and how her colleagues might perceive her candidness.

Lastly, the article mentions the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education (BIEAP) announcing results for the first and second year intermediate public exams, with over 10 lakh students awaiting their outcomes.

This summary captures the essence of the article, focusing on the key points and themes presented. If you need more detailed information or have specific questions, feel free to ask!</description>

			<title>Express View on Court’s warning to Ramdev: No free pass</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-courts-warning-to-ramdev-no-free-pass-9249837/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Supreme Court of India's criticism of Baba Ramdev and his company, Patanjali Ayurved, for making deceptive claims about their products' abilities to cure various diseases, which contradicts the allopathic system of medicine. Despite a court order to cease such advertisements, the company continued to promote its products as superior to allopathic medicine. The Supreme Court described Patanjali's response to the controversy as insincere.

The article also touches on the popularity of alternative medicine in India, supported by the government's promotion of yoga and Ayurveda through initiatives like Jan Aushadi stores and the AYUSH ministry. However, the Supreme Court's remarks highlight the need for strict regulatory protocols and evidence-based policies, especially in a country where unscientific practices are prevalent.

Furthermore, the article mentions the Indian Medical Association's legal action against Patanjali for misleading advertisements and the Supreme Court's repeated admonishments of both Patanjali and the AYUSH ministry for their claims. It concludes with a call for the government to enforce regulations more rigorously and a brief mention of Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's commentary on the appeal of larger-than-life films and actors in Indian cinema.</description>

			<title>At 75, NATO sees reasons to rejoice, facts suggest otherwise</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/at-75-nato-sees-reasons-to-rejoice-facts-suggest-otherwise-9249830/</link>
			<description>The article presents a critical view of NATO's history and actions, particularly from the perspective of Russia. It argues that NATO, which was originally established to defend its member states from aggression, has instead been involved in numerous military conflicts without facing direct threats. The article cites instances such as the bombing of Yugoslavia and the invasion of Iraq as examples of NATO's offensive actions that have led to destruction and instability rather than peace.

The expansion of NATO since 1991, especially in relation to Ukraine and Russia, is described as provocative. The article suggests that NATO's actions are not in pursuit of global peace but rather serve to maintain Western hegemony under the guise of promoting democracy and human rights.

NATO's designation of Russia as a significant threat at the 2022 summit in Madrid and the buildup of its capabilities in various domains, including cyberspace, are highlighted as aggressive moves. The article also mentions NATO's efforts to extend its influence into the Indo-Pacific region through various partnerships.

The piece concludes by stating that Russia is taking measures to protect its national interests and is open to dialogue for a sustainable security system that considers its concerns. It suggests that unless NATO changes its approach, its slogan "All for one, one for all" will effectively mean "The West against the rest."

The article ends with a separate note on the Bombay High Court's surprise over the Maharashtra government's stance on not providing monetary benefits to the family of late Major Anuj Sood, who was awarded the Shaurya Chakra posthumously.

			<title>India’s fall in fertility rate may be a boon in disguise. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-fall-in-fertility-rate-may-be-a-boon-in-disguise-heres-why-9249832/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the future of India's population dynamics based on various projections and studies. Here's a summary:

- **UN Population Division's Projection**: India's population is expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2065 before declining.
- **The Lancet's Report**: Suggests India's total fertility rate (TFR) will drop to 1.29 by 2051, which is lower than the government's and UN's projections. This could mean India's population may stabilize before 2065.
- **Demographic Transition**: Economic development, lower mortality rates, women's education, and improved living conditions have contributed to a demographic shift in India.
- **Economic Impact**: A lower TFR leads to a higher proportion of working adults, potentially boosting economic growth. However, it will also result in a larger elderly population, increasing the dependency ratio.
- **State Variations**: The decline in TFR is uneven across India, with some states like Odisha transitioning faster than others.
- **Labour Productivity**: The demographic transition is expected to increase labour productivity through better capital allocation, education, and a higher fraction of the labour force.
- **Policy Implications**: The changing population structure has implications for policy, particularly in skill development and education.
- **Women's Workforce Participation**: A declining TFR could lead to more women entering the workforce due to reduced childcare responsibilities.
- **Workforce Shift**: There's a trend of labour moving from agriculture to industries and services, necessitating skill development, especially among underprivileged groups.
- **Labour Migration**: North-to-south labour migration is balancing the labour market, with modern sectors attracting cheaper labour from northern states.
- **Asia 2050 Report**: Predicts Asia, with India as a key player, will dominate the 21st century, but this is not guaranteed without proper workforce management and skill development.
- **Healthcare Demand**: Improved life expectancy will increase the demand for healthcare facilities, presenting challenges that India must address.

The article concludes with the authors' credentials and mentions other subscriber-only articles, followed by an unrelated note about the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education announcing exam results.</description>

			<title>Arvind Kejriwal’s ‘special privileges’ should be every prisoner’s right</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arvind-kejriwals-special-privileges-should-be-every-prisoners-right-9249833/</link>
			<description>The article delves into the attention garnered by the living conditions of high-profile prisoners like Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been remanded to judicial custody. It questions why basic amenities like medication, pens, paper, and access to books are seen as privileges rather than standard provisions for all prisoners. The piece highlights the overcrowded and under-equipped state of Delhi's prisons, emphasizing the need for standards and reforms in prison management. It calls for a shift in perspective towards rehabilitation rather than punitive treatment of prisoners. The author, a lawyer and prison reform expert, underscores the importance of challenging societal norms that accept the inhumane treatment of individuals in prison.</description>

			<title>With a hopeless war in Gaza, how anti-Netanyahu protests are giving Israelis agency</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/hopeless-war-gaza-anti-netanyahu-protests-israelis-agency-9249601/</link>
			<description>Massive protests are rocking Israel as citizens express frustration with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to rescue Israeli hostages held by Hamas. His handling of the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza has raised concerns among international allies, who are critical of Israel's military approach. Despite extensive military operations, Hamas's military commander remains at large, highlighting the Israeli army and intelligence's shortcomings.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with thousands dead and millions displaced, has fueled global condemnation of Israel. Even traditional allies like the US and major European powers are expressing concern. India's External Affairs Minister emphasized the importance of respecting international humanitarian laws and advocated for a two-state solution.

Israeli citizens, disillusioned with Netanyahu's leadership, have launched mass protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, demanding accountability, early elections, and a compromise with Hamas to secure the release of hostages. The protests have united various groups, including families of hostages, individuals affected by the conflict, and anti-war activists. Netanyahu, facing mounting pressure, addressed the nation but warned against early elections, citing potential instability.

The protests reflect a growing sense of agency and direction among Israelis, reminiscent of their successful opposition to Netanyahu's judicial reforms. Amidst the despair of the Gaza conflict, citizens are seeking hope and change through collective action.</description>

			<title>From the Indian Meteorological Department, an extreme heat warning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-meteorological-department-extreme-heat-warning-9248759/</link>
			<description>The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an advisory about the upcoming summer's scorching temperatures, warning of heat wave conditions in various regions, with temperatures already reaching 42°C in some areas. The forecast suggests that northwest, Maharashtra, and parts of South India will experience the hottest weather in the coming days. The IMD's early warning on April 1 underscores the severity of the situation, with eastern Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, Rayalaseema, and northern Karnataka likely to face worsening conditions.

The article also highlights the alarming findings of the 2023 IPCC report on climate change, indicating that urgent action is needed to mitigate its impact. The report warns that even if carbon emissions were to cease immediately, the remaining carbon budget would still be exceeded, making it unlikely to limit global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. The consequences include heat waves, droughts, starvation, the spread of infectious diseases, and potentially millions of deaths by the end of the century.

The damage caused by global warming is irreversible, with ecosystems and communities already suffering. Despite increasing evidence of the need for action, carbon emissions continue to rise unabated. The article stresses the importance of national joint efforts for heat mitigation in India and the necessity of committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and transitioning to alternative energy sources.

The piece concludes with a call for expert advice and emphasizes the need for a sustainable and equitable future, urging action now for the well-being of future generations</description>

			<title>The many truths of Katchatheevu that no party wants to acknowledge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/many-truths-of-katchatheevu-9248725/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contentious issue of the ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka by the Indian government in 1974 and the subsequent implications, particularly for Tamil Nadu fishermen. It criticizes various political parties, including the BJP, Congress, and DMK, for exploiting the issue for electoral gains without addressing the underlying concerns of territorial loss and the plight of fishermen. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent mention of Katchatheevu is viewed as possibly a campaign tactic rather than a genuine commitment to resolving the issue. The article questions why the government has not taken concrete action despite acknowledging the suffering of Indian fishermen detained by Sri Lanka. It also highlights the contradictory stance of the Ministry of External Affairs and the lack of meaningful debate on the issue. The author argues that politics should serve justice and that elections provide an opportunity to revisit unresolved issues like Katchatheevu.</description>

			<title>Why elites need to listen to the margins</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/elites-need-listen-margins-9248267/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on a conversation between Harvard professor Michael Sandel and moderators Anant Goenka and Aakash Joshi. It suggests that while Sandel's views are well-articulated, there's uncertainty about whether editorial pages align with his political philosophy. The debate emphasizes the need for greater awareness and intensity, questioning whether intellectual discussions are disconnected from reality.

It delves into the role of philosophy, particularly political philosophy, in public discourse, arguing that it should be grounded in the concerns of everyday citizens. There's criticism of elites for failing to offer compelling alternatives and for overlooking cultural and religious factors in politics. The article highlights the populist backlash against governing elites and calls for a reevaluation of political, economic, and governance models that have exacerbated inequality and environmental degradation.

Sandel's perspective on the importance of addressing cultural and spiritual sources in politics is emphasized, along with the rise of nationalist right-wing politics globally. The article also reflects on the history of secularism in India and the need to incorporate diverse beliefs and values into public discourse.

Looking ahead, it suggests that opposition parties need to articulate alternative visions that encompass national identity and pride. It acknowledges Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to address these issues effectively. The article concludes by suggesting that India's current geopolitical and technological landscape favors progress, urging a proactive approach to seize opportunities.</description>

			<title>India’s atmanirbhar defence sector</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/atmanirbhar-bharat-indias-defence-sector-defence-transformation-defence-ecosystem-9247668/</link>
			<description>The article highlights significant developments in India's defense ecosystem, focusing on key institutional and policy changes driving defense indigenization, domestic procurement, and exports. Initiatives like Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make In India aim to enhance self-reliance and mitigate supply chain risks. The Defense Acquisition Procedure (DAP) 2020 emphasizes indigenous content in procurement contracts and encourages foreign OEMs to set up facilities in India. Positive Indigenisation Lists and portals like Srijan facilitate the localization of defense production. Additionally, two defense industrial corridors have attracted substantial investments.

India has made notable progress in building naval platforms, such as the INS Vikrant aircraft carrier, and is focusing on enhancing capabilities in various defense technologies. The government is also reviewing the functioning of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to enhance domestic R&amp;D capabilities. Significant portions of the defense capital procurement budget are diverted to the domestic industry, resulting in increased defense production value.

Initiatives like Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) aim to involve various stakeholders, including MSMEs and startups, in defense innovation. India has set ambitious defense export targets, aiming for Rs 35,000 crore by 2025. The government's efforts to provide equal career opportunities for women in the armed forces, through initiatives like Nari Shakti, are noted. Overall, these transformations aim to make India's defense sector more resilient, self-reliant, and integrated into global defense value chains, aligning with the goal of a developed India by 2047.</description>

			<title>Express View on IMD’s heat wave alert: Act Now</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-imds-heat-wave-alert-act-now-9247664/</link>
			<description>Climate change is significantly impacting the Indian summer, with observable effects over the past decade. Springs are shortening, and temperatures are rising, with 2022 experiencing the hottest March since 1901. Heatwaves are starting earlier and lasting longer, with the India Meteorological Department warning of extended heatwave spells. The health effects of heatwaves are still being studied, but there's a consensus on the need to protect vulnerable populations.

In response to heat-related tragedies, initiatives like the Heat Action Plan (HAP) have been implemented since 2013, focusing on early warning systems, healthcare capacity building, and public awareness. While credited with saving lives, critics argue that such plans often lack regular updates, funding, and adaptation to vulnerable communities' needs.

There's a call for more localized weather observatories and fine-tuning heatwave criteria to consider factors like humidity. Dealing with climate change demands immediate action, especially after recent alerts from the IMD.</description>

			<title>Express View: Don’t politicise Katchatheevu</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-dont-politicise-katchatheevu-9247645/</link>
			<description>The article discusses how foreign policy issues are being brought into India's national election campaign, particularly by the BJP led by Narendra Modi. One such issue is the dispute over Katchatheevu, an island near Tamil Nadu, which the BJP is using to criticize the Congress and DMK. This tactic is concerning because it risks complicating delicate diplomatic matters. The article explains the historical context of the Katchatheevu dispute and its emotional significance in Tamil Nadu. It also highlights the BJP's efforts to gain ground in Tamil Nadu ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, despite facing challenges from Dravidian politics. The article emphasizes the need for nuanced handling of the Katchatheevu issue, considering the large Tamil populations in both India and Sri Lanka. It suggests that resolving the issue requires diplomatic engagement after the elections, without the pressure of electoral politics. Additionally, the article mentions the Bombay High Court's response to the Maharashtra government's stance on granting benefits to the family of late Major Anuj Sood, who was posthumously awarded the Shaurya Chakra for sacrificing his life during a counter-terrorism operation.</description>

			<title>Katchatheevu controversy: Sound and fury signifying nothing</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/katchatheevu-controversy-sound-fury-signifying-nothing-9247495/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the history and significance of Katchatheevu, a 285-acre uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. Originally part of Indian territory, it was ceded to Sri Lanka by the Indira Gandhi government in 1974. The cession was portrayed as a masterstroke of diplomacy, aimed at fostering regional peace and securing India's interests amidst geopolitical tensions.

The article highlights the complex factors contributing to tensions around Katchatheevu, including disputes over fishing rights and unresolved issues from the Sri Lankan civil war. It argues that blaming the 1974 agreement overlooks broader historical and geopolitical contexts, including India's other territorial concessions and efforts to maintain regional stability.

Despite the cession, issues such as illegal fishing and ecological concerns persist in the region. The article suggests that focusing solely on Katchatheevu's handover deflects attention from more pressing national and global challenges.

Overall, the author portrays the cession of Katchatheevu as a strategic move that, while facing criticism, served broader diplomatic goals for both India and Sri Lanka</description>

			<title>From UPA government to CM Manohar Parrikar: When governments listen to the Election Commission</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/election-commission-governments-9247059/</link>
			<description>The article discusses concerns raised by former chief election commissioners (CECs) in India regarding recent actions by the Income Tax department and Enforcement Directorate (ED) against opposition parties and their leaders. These actions, such as issuing notices, freezing accounts, and raising tax demands, are seen to potentially disrupt the level playing field during elections. The former CECs suggest that such actions could be perceived as interference with free and fair elections and urge the Election Commission (EC) to intervene by meeting with the agencies to defer these actions until after the elections.

The article highlights instances where the EC has intervened in the past to ensure impartiality during elections, such as advising enforcement agencies to act neutrally. It also discusses the EC's role in regulating government announcements during election periods to prevent any undue advantage to the ruling party.

The author, a former CEC, emphasizes the importance of upholding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) to ensure fairness in elections. They recount a situation in Goa where the EC advised the chief minister to defer the induction of a new minister to avoid swaying voters before an election. The chief minister's compliance with the advice demonstrates a commitment to the spirit of the MCC and strengthens India's democratic process.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the film "Crew," which diverges from mainstream cinema norms by featuring three leading women — Tabu, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Kriti Sanon — in a heist comedy. Despite recent attempts to highlight feminist ideas in films, there's often a tendency to overtly criticize patriarchy, which might not always be effective. "Crew" takes a lighter approach, focusing on the independent and ambitious nature of its female characters. They don't rely on male saviors and are unapologetic about their desires. The chemistry and performances of the leading ladies drive the narrative, leading to the film's success at the box office. The article also praises the supportive male characters portrayed by Diljit Dosanjh and Kapil Sharma. Overall, "Crew" is seen as a step forward in showcasing more diverse and compelling female characters in Indian cinema.</description>

			<title>A legally-guaranteed MSP may do more harm than good</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/minimum-support-price-farm-solution-msp-legal-guarantee-9245604/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing debate over the demand for a legally-guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) by farmers in India, particularly in Punjab. While MSP is crucial for farmer livelihoods, there are disagreements on its implementation and scope. Farmers argue that legally-guaranteed MSP would require the government to physically procure all crops, which is impractical. There are also concerns about the financial burden on the government and the ambiguity in MSP calculation.

The article highlights the complexity of the issue, including regional disparities in MSP benefits and the potential impact on states' finances. Additionally, it questions the focus solely on MSP without considering broader interventions to support farmers, especially those with small landholdings.

Overall, the article suggests the need for a more comprehensive approach to agricultural policy, beyond just MSP, to address the diverse needs of farmers across India.</description>

			<title>Why the rich legacy of Carnatic music cannot be reduced to Brahmanical patriarchy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sangita-kalanidhi-award-t-m-krishna-madras-music-academy-carnatic-music-9245646/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding the Sangita Kalanidhi award given to T M Krishna by the Madras Music Academy. This award holds significant cultural importance in South India. Several prominent musicians, including Ranjani and Gayatri, the Trichur Brothers, Dushyanth Sridhar, and Chitravina Ravikiran, have decided not to perform at the academy's festival in December in protest of Krishna's award. Even the family of the legendary mridangam vidwan, Palghat Mani Iyer, returned his Sangita Kalanidhi award in protest.

The article criticizes Krishna for his outspokenness and activism, suggesting that he should stick to his singing. It questions the impact of his activism on training Dalit and deprived musicians and points out the presence of Brahmins in the Music Academy's advisory committee despite its denouncement of Brahminical patriarchy.

The writer emphasizes the spiritual core of Carnatic music and criticizes Krishna for what is seen as disrespect towards traditional figures like Thyagaraja. They argue against Krishna's retrospective idealizations and call for a more nuanced approach to addressing biases in the arts.

The article concludes by highlighting the need for equitable performance opportunities and criticizes Periyar's statements against Brahmins, framing them as acts of violence. Finally, it praises the resistance of artists and hopes for the continuation of sublime music for many more decades.</description>

His influence extends to various fields like policymaking, finance, and consumer behavior, providing a deeper understanding of ourselves.

Additionally, the article briefly mentions the upcoming announcement of exam results by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education, emphasizing the importance of collecting original mark sheets from schools.</description>

			<title>April 02, Forty Years Ago: BJP warns Centre amending Article 25 would smack of appeasement of extremists in Punjab</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/april-02-forty-years-ago-nirankari-meet-9245674/</link>
			<description>In Amritsar, three women and a child were killed, and around 30 others injured in a terrorist attack during a religious congregation of Nirankaris.

			<title>Express View on Alwar caste violence: What politics and policy forget</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/lok-sabha-elections-caste-census-dalit-atrocities-caste-violence-9245689/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the prevalent issue of caste-based violence in India, highlighted by recent incidents of brutality against Dalit individuals. It begins with the case of an eight-year-old Dalit boy who was assaulted for touching a bucket of water in a government school in Rajasthan. The perpetrator not only physically attacked the boy but also hurled casteist slurs and expressed impunity afterward.

Despite efforts such as educational schemes aimed at equality, caste violence remains pervasive, as indicated by data from the National Crime Records Bureau. The statistics reveal a significant increase in crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in 2022 compared to the previous year, with states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Bihar reporting the highest number of cases.

The article underscores the human toll of this discrimination, citing incidents such as the death of a 15-year-old Dalit boy in Uttar Pradesh and the fatal injuries inflicted on a nine-year-old in Rajasthan by upper-caste individuals. These incidents expose a stark contrast between the government's vision of progress and the harsh reality on the ground.

It emphasizes the need for more comprehensive measures to address caste-based discrimination, including institutional reforms and increased awareness and protection for marginalized communities. Despite political rhetoric about justice and empowerment, the article suggests that substantial action is required to tackle this deeply entrenched injustice.</description>

			<title>Turbat, Dasu, Gwadar: Terror attacks in Pakistan are of its own making</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/turbat-dasu-gwadar-terror-attacks-pakistan-own-making-9244763/</link>
			<description>Pakistan has been hit by three major terror attacks within a week, with the Balochistan Liberation Army claiming responsibility for two attacks in Balochistan targeting Chinese interests, and another in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa killing Chinese engineers. China's significant investment in Pakistan, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), makes security a critical issue. Despite public calmness, China is reportedly pressuring Pakistan privately to address the threat. Pakistan's security challenges, including terrorism and tensions with neighbors like India and Afghanistan, have hindered CPEC progress. Pakistan often blames India for terrorism while ignoring its own flawed policies, exacerbating internal tensions and affecting regional stability. China's involvement in Balochistan has fueled local resentment. Pakistan's response to terrorism has been mainly military-focused, lacking a more comprehensive approach. Amidst this, there's a call for Pakistan to reassess its trade policy with India, with hopes for a more constructive approach. The terror threat extends beyond the region, as seen with ISIS-K's involvement in attacks in Iran and Russia.</description>

It concludes by urging the opposition to offer a positive vision for development instead of focusing on dynasty and corruption.</description>

			<title>Express View: Lesson from wheat fields</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-lesson-from-wheat-fields-9243899/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current state of wheat stocks in government warehouses in India, highlighting concerns due to the lowest stock levels in seven years. However, there's optimism regarding a potentially bumper harvest in key wheat-producing states like Punjab, Haryana, UP, and Bihar, as weather conditions have been favorable during the crucial grain formation and filling stage. The article points out the susceptibility of wheat production to climate change, with recent years witnessing adverse effects from both early summer heat stress and delayed winter conditions. While there are concerns about lower yields in central India due to temperature fluctuations, the overall wheat production in the country could still surpass previous years. The author suggests the need for India to invest more in breeding for climate-resilient wheat varieties in the long term. Additionally, the article briefly mentions Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's insights on the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films in Indian cinema, drawing examples from South Indian stars.</description>

Home Minister P C Sethi announced this decision, expressing hope that it would lead to the withdrawal of the Akali Dal's proposed agitation. Consequently, the Akali Dal called off its "Panth Azad Week" agitation, which involved burning copies of Article 25 in Punjab's district headquarters. Meanwhile, the issue of sharing Ganga waters during the lean season between India and Bangladesh remains unresolved, with Minister for Irrigation Ram Niwas Mirdha stating that political-level discussions are necessary. Additionally, there are discussions about potentially splitting the Supreme Court into two courts, with one focusing solely on cases of constitutional importance. In other news, a close aide of the owner of Cox and Kings has been arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in connection with a Rs 400 crore fraud case involving Yes Bank. British national Ajit P Menon, suspected of diverting loan money to foreign companies, was apprehended at Cochin International Airport.</description>

			<title>In Maharashtra, BJP is challenged by its own machinations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/maharashtra-bjp-ncp-shiv-sena-lok-sabha-elections-9243276/</link>
			<description>The article provides a detailed analysis of the complex political landscape in Maharashtra, India. It traces the historical context of political alliances in the state, starting from the 1995 Shiv Sena-BJP victory over Congress. Over the years, various shifts and splits occurred, with parties like the Shiv Sena, BJP, Congress, and NCP vying for power.

Recent developments, including high-profile splits and realignments, have further complicated the political scenario. The BJP, aiming to diminish the influence of rivals like the Pawars and Thackerays, has faced challenges as splinter groups emerge and alliances shift.

Currently, Maharashtra features multiple political players, including factions of major parties and smaller regional outfits. This fragmentation makes the state susceptible to political storms, with alliances needing at least three parties to secure power.

The article concludes that the BJP's attempts to dominate the political landscape have led to the proliferation of smaller parties and factions, making political stability elusive. It suggests that it may take multiple elections for the political situation to stabilize.</description>

			<title>INDIA members write: Opposition rally is a clarion call for citizens to help save our democracy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-members-opposition-rally-democracy-9243098/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the concerning state of democracy in India, highlighting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government's departure from constitutional and institutional norms. It describes how the BJP has manipulated state institutions, coerced defections, and undermined opposition parties, leading to an uneven electoral playing field. Despite the BJP's efforts to paint itself as anti-corruption, its actions, including the electoral bonds scandal, have raised doubts about its intentions.

The piece argues that progressives should support the opposition parties collectively referred to as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), rather than solely criticizing them. It calls for a united effort from various sectors of society to defend democracy, drawing parallels with historical movements for freedom in India.

The article emphasizes the need for grassroots activism and creative initiatives to counter the BJP's narrative dominance and mobilize support for the opposition. It urges individuals to recognize the significance of the current moment and actively engage in efforts to safeguard democracy.

Additionally, the article briefly mentions a personal story about a family dealing with the tragic loss of a loved one and the financial burden of repaying an education loan.</description>

			<title>The Sangita Kalanidhi and Carnatic music’s great divide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-sangita-kalanidhi-and-carnatic-musics-great-divide-9242439/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the controversy surrounding Carnatic classical vocalist T M Krishna being awarded the Sangita Kalanidhi by The Music Academy, which has led to divisions within the Carnatic music community. Krishna, known for his questioning of societal norms and his exploration of diverse themes in his music, has faced criticism from some quarters for his views and artistic choices. However, the article argues that his contributions to the art form are undeniable, regardless of one's agreement with his ideology.

Similarly, the article mentions the withdrawal of Ranjani-Gayatri and others from the prestigious December Music Season in Chennai after Krishna was awarded the Sangita Kalanidhi. It highlights the complexity of the situation, with some musicians feeling that Krishna's views and actions have insulted revered figures like Tyagaraja and M S Subbulakshmi, while others see his questioning as an important aspect of artistic growth and societal reflection.

The author defends Krishna's right to question the status quo within Carnatic music and suggests that the opposition to his receiving the Sangita Kalanidhi is misplaced. They argue that such divisions within the community reflect deeper issues that need to be addressed, and that Krishna's award serves as a message for introspection within the Carnatic music world.

In addition to discussing the Carnatic music controversy, the article also briefly mentions the upcoming announcement of results for the first and second year intermediate public exams by the Andhra Pradesh Board of Intermediate Education.</description>

			<title>History Headline | 1920: The start of India’s election journey</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/1920-the-start-of-indias-election-journey-9242440/</link>
			<description>In 1920, the British colonial government in India held its first direct elections, marking a significant shift in governance. Abdul Majid, a Delhi resident with humble origins, surprised everyone by winning a seat in the legislature, despite being dismissed initially as a "ridiculous candidate." This election was a result of the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, which aimed to increase Indian representation in legislatures. The reforms recommended setting up a national legislature with directly elected members and also suggested state-level legislatures. The elections were governed by the Government of India Act, 1919, which laid out qualifications for voters and candidates, resulting in a relatively small electorate. However, the election process faced challenges, including violence and boycotts, as part of the non-cooperation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. Despite these challenges, the elections marked a significant step towards Indian self-governance. Since then, India has made strides in ensuring free and fair elections, with a focus on expanding the electorate and combating electoral malpractices.</description>

			<description>The article highlights various political maneuvers and strategies employed by the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) in India ahead of elections. It points out the BJP's significant financial resources, including funds from electoral bonds, and its tactic of encouraging defections from other parties.

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: India must not hesitate to confront some harsh truths</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/surreal-reality-and-reality-9242353/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the stark contrast between the grand visions of India's future presented by political leaders and the harsh realities experienced by many citizens, particularly in rural areas. While leaders like Narendra Modi emphasize a vision of a fully developed India by 2047, critics argue that significant challenges remain unaddressed, such as poverty, lack of sanitation, and inadequate education. The author highlights the surreal nature of political spectacles, like Modi's discussion with Bill Gates on AI, juxtaposed with the dire conditions witnessed on drives through rural India. Despite progress in some areas, such as increased national pride, the article calls for a sober assessment of India's current state and the need for substantive changes to achieve the dream of becoming a fully developed country.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pakistan-arvind-kejriwal-arrest-congress-frozen-accounts-9241962/</link>
			<description>The article discusses several significant events and issues:

1. Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Delhi excise policy case. The editorial from Dawn suggests a link between this arrest and revelations from electoral bond data, potentially indicating political targeting.

2.

Some see this as a positive step towards peace, while others doubt its effectiveness.

3. Six sitting judges of the Islamabad High Court alleged interference from Pakistan's military intelligence agency, the ISI, in judicial matters. The Supreme Court ordered the formation of an inquiry committee to investigate these claims, sparking commentary on the government's responsibility and the judiciary's independence.

4. Pakistan experienced five suicide bombing attacks between March 16 and March 26, with concerns arising about their impact on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects and bilateral military cooperation with China.

5. Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee shared insights on the current state of Indian cinema, highlighting the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films, with examples from South Indian stars like Yash and Allu Arjun.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/t-m-krishna-and-the-caste-of-music-9241769/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the musical talents of Carnatic classical vocalists T M Krishna and Ranjani-Gayatri, highlighting their artistic brilliance despite differences in their political views and ideologies.

The author also criticizes the opposition to Krishna's recognition, suggesting it is rooted in prejudice rather than valid artistic concerns.

			<title>Why India must put Africa at the heart of its Global South vision</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-india-must-put-africa-at-the-heart-of-its-global-south-vision-9240875/</link>
			<description>President Droupadi Murmu's recent visit to Mauritius highlighted India's commitment to the region, resulting in the inauguration of community development projects and the announcement of a forensic science laboratory with Indian assistance.

The concept of the Global South, championed by India, is debated for its impact on global governance. While some see it as a force for inclusivity, others criticize its oversimplification. Nonetheless, as India aims to lead the Global South, it must prioritize engagement with African countries.

India's relationship with Africa presents vast economic opportunities, with significant investments and trade. Additionally, Africa's influence in global forums aligns with India's vision for inclusive global governance.

Two key areas for sustainable development cooperation between India and Africa are identified: critical minerals sector cooperation and technical capacity building. Leveraging Africa's mineral reserves and investing in workforce development could benefit both regions.

As geopolitical dynamics evolve, India's relationship with Africa is poised for transformation. Historical partnerships and collaboration with African nations remain crucial as India navigates its role in the Global South.</description>

			<description>In 2024, Time magazine labeled it "the election year," with elections taking place in 64 countries, involving almost half of the world's population. Notable contests include India, the US, the UK, Mexico, South Africa, and the European Parliament. The US Presidential election is especially anticipated globally, with potential for significant global impact.

In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is expected to win a third term, with excitement over the anticipated majority. Modi's governance track record, economic performance, and initiatives like women-led and youth-led development contribute to a widespread "feel-good" factor in the country. Key events like the abrogation of Article 370 and the construction of the Ram temple have bolstered popular support across political lines.

PM Modi's personal credibility and the BJP's organizational strength are crucial factors in the elections. The BJP has extensive grassroots outreach, with over 180 million primary members and strategic initiatives like booth committees and call centers. Opposition parties, including the Congress party, face challenges, with leadership issues and dynastic politics hindering their effectiveness.

Despite occasional controversies, India's elections are known for transparency and efficiency. Modi's vision includes ambitious goals like ending poverty and corruption, achieving social justice, and positioning India as a global leader. He envisions a "Viksit Bharat" (developed India) by 2047 and aims for long-term prosperity and global leadership.

In another article, Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee discussed the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films, citing examples from South Indian cinema and how they provide solace and inspiration to audiences.</description>

			<description>The Congress (I) party won 47 out of 72 seats in the Rajya Sabha elections, strengthening its position in the 244-member House but still falling short of a two-thirds majority. Sri Lanka warned that India's expression of regret over the killings of Jaffna Tamils by the Sri Lankan air force could harm bilateral relations. The killing of Harbans Singh Manchanda led to controversy in the Lok Sabha, resulting in an opposition walkout to protest against law and order issues in Delhi. Violence escalated in Punjab with shootings near the Golden Temple in Amritsar and attacks on security forces in Firozpur and Faridkot districts. Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee discussed the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films, citing examples from South Indian stars like Yash and Allu Arjun.</description>

			<title>Song lyrics today are no worse than before</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/editorials/song-lyrics-today-are-no-worse-than-before-9240929/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in Scientific Reports suggests that song lyrics have become simpler and more repetitive. Researchers analyzed over 12,000 English-language songs and found this trend across genres. While some may lament this shift, it's worth noting that complaints about changing musical tastes are common across generations. Even revered classics have their lyrical flaws, like America's "The Horse with No Name" or The Doors' "Riders on the Storm." The simplicity of modern lyrics may be influenced by the streaming era, where songs quickly gain and lose popularity, requiring catchy and easy-to-remember hooks to capture listeners' attention. Despite lacking complexity, these songs can still enjoy chart success.</description>

			<title>Express View: Taking on TB</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/editorials/express-view-taking-on-tb-9240926/</link>
			<description>The India TB Report 2024 indicates progress in the country's fight against tuberculosis (TB), with a decrease in under-reporting and achievement of treatment initiation targets. However, challenges persist, especially with the epidemic of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). The report highlights improvements in MDR-TB testing but emphasizes the need for more comprehensive testing methods. Experts recommend transitioning to shorter-duration drugs like bedaquiline, especially considering the low completion rates of current treatments. The recent decision by India's patent office regarding bedaquiline could lead to the development of cheaper generic versions. Mental healthcare is increasingly recognized as crucial in TB treatment, but it's not adequately implemented. The poor, slum dwellers, and HIV/AIDS patients are disproportionately affected by TB. The article also briefly touches on Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's insights into Indian cinema.</description>

			<title>Express View on governance challenge in Delhi: Caution, please</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/editorials/express-view-on-governance-challenge-in-delhi-caution-please-9240911/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the possibility of imposing President's Rule in Delhi following the arrest of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged corruption case. While the Lieutenant Governor hinted at this option, there are concerns about the move given the circumstances and the current political landscape.

In 2014, President's Rule was imposed in Delhi after Kejriwal resigned following the stalling of his party's efforts to introduce the Jan Lokpal bill. However, the situation now is different as Kejriwal's party holds a significant majority in the assembly.

The article argues against the imposition of President's Rule, stating that it would undermine democracy and the aspirations of the electorate. It also highlights the need for the AAP to find a successor to Kejriwal and for the Centre to reconsider its approach, as imposing President's Rule would not be in the best interest of democratic principles.</description>

			<description>Sanjeev Sanyal, an economist and author, stirred controversy with comments criticizing UPSC aspirants and Bengalis for what he termed a "poverty of aspiration." He suggested aspiring to be like Elon Musk or Mukesh Ambani instead of pursuing government jobs. His remarks were met with criticism for being out of touch and victim-blaming. While acknowledging issues with the obsession over government jobs, critics argue Sanyal's statements are elitist and fail to address systemic issues hindering private sector opportunities. Additionally, his remarks about Bengalis were deemed stereotypical and misguided. Critics challenge Sanyal to offer substantive solutions rather than making sweeping statements.</description>

			<title>Derek O’Brien writes: No warranty for ‘Modi Ki Guarantee’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-warranty-for-modi-guarantee-9240444/</link>
			<description>The article outlines the promises made by Narendra Modi and the BJP, contrasting them with the realities on the ground. Here are some key points:

1. **Jobs**: Despite the promise of creating 25 crore jobs, only 1.2 crore jobs have been created since 2014. Unemployment remains high, especially among young graduates.

2. **Doubling farmers' income**: The actual growth in farmers' incomes has been much lower than needed, with suicide rates among farmers remaining distressingly high.

3. **Demonetisation**: The goals of demonetisation, such as curbing black money, terrorism, and corruption, have not been achieved, with 99% of the demonetised currency returning to the system.

4. **Ujjwala scheme**: Many households have not benefited from the Ujjwala scheme, despite subsidies.

5. **Bullet Train**: The project has faced delays since its announcement in 2017.

6. **Swachh Bharat Mission**: Despite the mission, deaths related to hazardous cleaning activities have occurred, and pollution levels in the Ganges remain high.

7. **Other initiatives** like Namami Gange, Sagarmala Project, PM Kisan, Atma Nirbhar Bharat, Digital India, Railway infrastructure, Nari-shakti, UDAN, and Hunger relief are also criticized for various shortcomings and failures.

The conclusion is that while Narendra Modi and the BJP offer guarantees, the actual outcomes often fall short, leaving many promises unfulfilled.</description>

			<title>Amit Shah’s idea of AFSPA removal in J&amp;K is welcome. Return of Kashmiri Pandits with dignity must be next step</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-and-kashmir-amit-shah-afspa-removal-kashmiri-pandits-return-9240128/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the aftermath of India's decision to revoke Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, almost five years later. It highlights Home Minister Amit Shah's recent interview declaring the transformation in J&amp;K and plans for upcoming elections. Despite initial concerns, there has been limited international backlash.

			<title>Is India’s growth rate overestimated?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/is-indias-growth-rate-overestimated-9239003/</link>
			<description>The Indian economy has been growing at a rate of 7-8% recently, but there are uncertainties in measuring this improvement. One major issue lies with the GDP deflator, which seems to be underestimating inflation, leading to an overstatement of real growth. The current methodology adopted in 2015 relies on deflating nominal GDP by price indices to derive real numbers, making the deflator crucial. However, India's deflator faces two problems: it doesn't use the international standard measure of output prices, and it doesn't employ the double deflation methodology used by most G20 countries.

The first problem arises because the National Statistics Office (NSO) uses the wholesale price index (WPI) as a proxy for the producer price index, which doesn't accurately track producer prices, especially for services. This discrepancy leads to inflated real GDP figures, particularly when WPI inflation falls due to global commodity price declines while consumer price index (CPI) inflation remains high.

The second issue stems from India's use of single deflation instead of double deflation in calculating real gross value added (GVA) in the manufacturing sector. Single deflation can misstate growth when input prices diverge from output prices, amplifying nominal increases in GVA.

An interim solution proposed is to use the CPI series to deflate nominal value added, as it's closer to producer prices than the WPI. Implementing this change would significantly affect growth figures, especially in sectors like trade/transport/communication and financial services.

In summary, the current method of measuring GDP in India may overestimate growth due to flaws in the GDP deflator. Using the CPI as a deflator and adopting double deflation methodology could mitigate these issues and provide more accurate growth estimates.</description>

			<title>PM Modi on Swami Smaranananda: A Viksit Bharat blessed by seers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-on-swami-smaranananda-a-viksit-bharat-blessed-by-seers-9238992/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the passing of Srimat Swami Smaranananda ji Maharaj, a revered spiritual leader, within the context of India's Lok Sabha elections. The author expresses deep sadness at the loss, recalling their personal interactions and discussions with Swami Smaranananda ji and Swami Atmasthananda ji. Both were influential figures in spreading the teachings of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sharada Devi, and Swami Vivekananda worldwide.

The author highlights the significant contributions of the Ramakrishna Mission, particularly in areas of education, rural development, and humanitarian service. They reminisce about instances where the Mission provided aid during natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, emphasizing the selfless service ethos of Swami Atmasthananda ji and Swami Smaranananda ji.

The article also praises the Mission's focus on social empowerment, education, skill development, and women's empowerment under the leadership of these spiritual figures. It commends their respect for diverse cultures and traditions, illustrating Swami Atmasthananda ji's proficiency in speaking Gujarati, acquired during his travels across India.

Ultimately, the author pays homage to these saintly figures and expresses confidence in the continued legacy of the Ramakrishna Mission. The article ends with a message of peace and unity, affirming the enduring principles that guide the nation's development.</description>

			<title>US has gone after Big Tech. That makes it easier for India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/us-has-gone-after-big-tech-that-makes-it-easier-for-india-9238996/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing dispute between Google and various Indian firms over Google's alleged exploitation of its dominant position in the Android and Play Store ecosystem. The complaint, filed several years ago with the Competition Commission of India (CCI), accuses Google of coercing app developers to use its billing system or pay a fee if they opt for a competitor. The article highlights the implications of Google's actions and the regulatory response, with the CCI initiating an investigation.

The author explores the broader issue of monopolies in the digital space, arguing that while markets theoretically function better due to increased information availability, successful firms can easily create monopolies, undermining market dynamics. The article discusses the historical context of antitrust enforcement, highlighting shifts in the US approach and recent lawsuits against tech giants like Apple, Google, Meta, and Amazon for abusing market power.

The author suggests that the changing stance in the US toward antitrust enforcement could have implications globally, making it easier for countries like India and the EU to take action against tech firms for violations. The article emphasizes the need for effective regulation to prevent monopolistic behavior and ensure competition and innovation.</description>

			<title>Express View on India’s falling fertility rate: A wake-up call</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indias-falling-fertility-rate-a-wake-up-call-9238994/</link>
			<description>A recent report in The Lancet highlights that India is on track to become an aging society within the next three decades. The report indicates that India's Total Fertility Rate (TFR), the average number of children born to a woman, will drop to 1.29 by 2050, with one in five individuals being over 60 years old. This demographic shift has been previously noted by the UN Population Fund (UNPF), projecting a doubling of India's elderly population from 149 million in 2022 to 347 million by mid-century. 

The experience of other countries, like China, serves as a cautionary tale. China's working-age population peaked around the middle of the last decade, coinciding with impressive economic growth, but has since seen a decline due to a low TFR. This underscores the importance for India to capitalize on its current demographic dividend, which is expected to peak in the late 2030s or early 2040s. 

Policymakers must address skill deficits, particularly in the knowledge economy, and focus on creating quality jobs outside of agriculture to fully leverage this demographic advantage. Additionally, there is a need to develop adequate social security and healthcare provisions for the growing elderly population while harnessing their skills effectively. 

The varying TFR rates across Indian states present a unique challenge, with some regions aging faster than others. Policymakers must understand these demographic shifts comprehensively and prepare accordingly. In summary, proactive measures are required to navigate the impending demographic changes and ensure a sustainable future for India.</description>

			<title>Express View: China, Pakistan and a fragile Corridor</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-china-pakistan-and-a-fragile-corridor-9238993/</link>
			<description>Pakistan has recently experienced three significant attacks on strategic sites within a week, highlighting the vulnerability of its political-economy. These attacks include a suicide bombing near Besham that killed five Chinese nationals and a Pakistani driver, an attack on a naval airbase in Turbat by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and an earlier attack on Gwadar port, a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). These incidents underscore broader security challenges and the risks associated with Pakistan's heavy reliance on the CPEC. China has condemned the attacks and called for perpetrators to be brought to justice, but the situation reflects a deeper systemic issue that requires a more comprehensive response than just military measures. Pakistan's leadership needs to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on China, potentially by opening up trade ties with India. This would not only signal maturity but also make Pakistan less vulnerable to destabilization, as disruptions to the CPEC could have far-reaching consequences.</description>

			<title>Daniel Kahneman — a psychologist among economists</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/daniel-kahneman-a-psychologist-among-economists-9239002/</link>
			<description>Daniel Kahneman, a renowned psychologist who passed away recently, challenged conventional thinking with his insights into human decision-making. His famous riddle about a bat and a ball illustrated how people often make quick, confident decisions without thorough examination. Kahneman's work, including his influential book "Thinking, Fast and Slow," highlighted the errors and biases inherent in human thinking. He won the Nobel Prize in Economics for integrating psychological research into economic science, questioning the assumption of rationality in economic agents. His contributions laid the groundwork for behavioral economics, inspiring further research in the field. Despite recognizing society's preference for overconfidence, Kahneman emphasized the importance of acknowledging uncertainty. His legacy continues to shape our understanding of decision-making processes.

On a different note, deep belly breathing, advocated by yoga practitioners, offers benefits for sleep and stress relief. By engaging the diaphragm to take slow, deep breaths, this technique triggers the body's relaxation response, lowering heart rate and blood pressure. Consistent practice can make deep belly breathing a natural part of one's bedtime routine, promoting overall well-being.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the unexpected success of the movie "HanuMan," directed by Prasanth Varma, which draws inspiration from the mythological figure Hanuman.

			<title>How to fix India’s urban water crisis, from Bengaluru to Chennai and beyond</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-fix-indias-urban-water-crisis-from-bengaluru-to-chennai-and-beyond-9236931/</link>
			<description>Bengaluru is grappling with its worst water crisis in years, exacerbated by a weak monsoon and urban growth. Similar issues plague other Indian cities like Chennai. Only 10% of Indian cities meet drinking water standards, with water quality declining due to aging infrastructure. This has led to increased reliance on water purifiers and packaged drinking water, despite access to piped water. The decentralised model of water treatment and delivery, like the one used by the packaged drinking water industry, is gaining traction, with initiatives like water ATMs emerging. However, concerns about affordability and the impact of water purification methods on mineral content persist. The article suggests exploring alternative water supply models, emphasizing decentralised treatment and non-pipe delivery systems. Meanwhile, Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee recently discussed the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films in Indian cinema, highlighting the role of screen heroes in providing solace and inspiration to audiences.</description>

			<title>Pop faith</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pop-faith-9236943/</link>
			<description>The article explores the evolving portrayal of Hinduism in Indian politics, particularly during the 2024 General Elections. It highlights key events and images that symbolize this shift, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi's public displays of Hindu rituals and visits to temples, which are increasingly embraced by other politicians and public figures.

This blending of Hindu rituals, technology, and nationalism is described as captivating and comforting for many, with the narrative often emphasizing the triumph of good over evil and the resurgence of Hindu identity. There's also a growing sentiment of Hindu assertiveness and marginalization of the "Other," along with a notion of common civilizational lineage among Indians.

However, the article raises questions about whether this trend reflects the core principles of Hinduism. It outlines fundamental beliefs such as Nishkama karma (selfless action), adherence to truth, and respect for all faiths, which seem to be overshadowed by the performative and often divisive aspects of contemporary Hindu politics.

Ultimately, the article suggests that by prioritizing electoral gains over the essence of Hinduism, politicians may be diluting its profound teachings and robbing Hindus of their spiritual agency. It calls for a deeper engagement with the timeless principles of Hindu philosophy amidst the spectacle of political theatrics.</description>

			<description>The article reflects on the evolution of political movements in India, particularly focusing on the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement led by Arvind Kejriwal and the author's own anti-corruption efforts. The author, a former bureaucrat and Union minister, initially supported Kejriwal's movement but later became disillusioned with his governance as Chief Minister of Delhi, criticizing his failure to deliver on promises and his perceived hypocrisy. The author also questions the timing and implications of Kejriwal's recent arrest by the Enforcement Directorate, arguing that no one is above the law. The article concludes with a quote from Anna Hazare, a key figure in the IAC movement, suggesting that Kejriwal's arrest is a consequence of his actions.</description>

This advancement, while seen as a technological feat, raises concerns about reducing the art of brewing to numbers and potentially diminishing the joy of discovery in creating new recipes. The article draws parallels to Roald Dahl's story "The Great Automatic Grammatizator," suggesting that technology may eventually overshadow human creativity in various fields. Finally, it briefly mentions Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's insights on Indian cinema, focusing on audience preferences for larger-than-life films and actors.</description>

			<title>Express View on SAD-BJP separation in Punjab: Two apart</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-sad-bjp-separation-in-punjab-two-apart-9236934/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the political landscape in Punjab, particularly regarding the SAD-BJP alliance. The alliance, which had been a significant force in Punjab politics, is not expected to be revived for the upcoming elections. The BJP has confirmed that it will contest independently. The rift between the parties became apparent in 2020 due to the farm laws, which led to a prolonged agitation. Although there are signs of discontent in the farming community, a full-fledged protest has not yet materialized. Additionally, there are ongoing protests for the release of Sikh political prisoners.

The SAD-BJP alliance emerged after a turbulent period of militancy in Punjab, with promises of fostering harmony between communities and addressing regional concerns. Despite initial unity, tensions arose over power-sharing, leading to the eventual separation. Speculation about a reunion has been circulating, but both parties seem focused on rebuilding their support bases independently. The BJP, in particular, is bolstered by Sikh leaders defecting from the Congress.

The article also briefly touches on Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee's insights into the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films in Indian cinema, drawing examples from South Indian stars like Yash and Allu Arjun.</description>

			<title>Express View on employment data: Jobs, still</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-employment-data-jobs-still-9236933/</link>
			<description>Recent data indicates positive growth momentum for the Indian economy, with forecasts for GDP growth in 2023-24 raised to 7.6%. However, concerns persist about the state of the labor market and the need for more productive employment opportunities. While there has been an increase in labor force participation, much of the employment growth has been in self-employment and casual labor, particularly among women. The challenge is to create more productive job opportunities, especially for the millions entering the labor force annually. Despite government measures, progress has been limited. Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach, including improving education and skills, and promoting labor-intensive manufacturing. Meanwhile, Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee discussed the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films, highlighting how audiences find solace and inspiration in them.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/march-28-1984-forty-years-ago-sc-restrains-police-9236937/</link>
			<description>The article highlights several key events:

1. **Confrontation Between Judiciary and Legislature**: The chairman of the Andhra Pradesh legislative council ordered the arrest of a Telugu daily editor for breach of privilege, leading to a potential confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. However, the Supreme Court intervened and ordered the Police Commissioner to ensure that the editor was not arrested.

2. **India-Bangladesh Water Dispute**: India and Bangladesh are set to meet at the Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) in Dhaka to address their differences regarding the augmentation of Ganga waters. This meeting is crucial as it occurs shortly before the expiration of the current water-sharing arrangement.

3. **Opposition Unity Efforts**: Janata Party president Chandra Shekhar is making renewed efforts to foster opposition unity, particularly within the United Front and the Janata Party itself. He has engaged in discussions with Lok Dal president Charan Singh in an attempt to address reported crises within the parties.

4. **Violent Dispute in Delhi**: A landlord-tenant dispute in West Delhi turned violent, resulting in two deaths and three serious injuries from gunshot wounds. The dispute escalated near the Raja Garden chowk, leading to casualties on both sides.

5. **Reflections on Indian Cinema**: Bollywood actor Manoj Bajpayee commented on the current state of Indian cinema, emphasizing the appeal of massy actors and larger-than-life films to audiences. He highlighted the inspiration and solace that viewers seek from screen heroes in their everyday lives.</description>

			<title>Vandita Mishra writes: The Rajya Sabha cross-voting scandal that wasn’t</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rajya-sabha-cross-voting-9193734/</link>
			<description>The Rajya Sabha elections revealed the BJP's success in winning seats beyond its MLA tally, while the Congress faced a setback. Cross-voting and MLAs switching from non-BJP parties to the BJP were seen, without significant scandal, partly due to a lack of public outrage and political polarization at higher levels contrasting with routine party switches at the ground level. The author suggests reasons for this include weakened party structures and personalized politics, as well as a narrow political field with high barriers to entry.

The apparent impunity with which politicians switch sides, coupled with euphemisms like "Operation Lotus," masks the underlying political maneuvering and corruption that involves buying MLAs and splitting opposition parties. The Congress's weakness, as well as the SP's loss of seven MLAs who cross-voted in favor of the BJP, highlights larger issues within these parties.

The SP faces challenges under Akhilesh Yadav's leadership, including internal divisions, a less engaged leadership style, and the formidable reputation of the ruling Yogi Adityanath government in UP, which criminalizes public protest. Additionally, the SP struggles to counter Hindutva politics effectively. The cross-voting by SP MLAs in the Rajya Sabha elections reflects these broader predicaments.</description>

			<title>With Shehbaz Sharif at its head, a vulnerable new government forms in Pakistan</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/shehbaz-sharif-at-its-head-a-vulnerable-new-government-forms-in-pakistan-9193628/</link>
			<description>**Post-Election Political Landscape in Pakistan:**

* A coalition of PML-N and PPP has formed the government at the center, with Shehbaz Sharif as Prime Minister.
* PPP will have Asaf Ali Zardari as the President, and the PML-N has Maryam Nawaz Sharif as Chief Minister of Punjab.
* PTI, led by Imran Khan, has formed a government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

**Key Differences from Previous Coalition:**

* Military backing remains, but there are changes in high constitutional posts.
* Asaf Ali Zardari replaces an Imran Khan ally as President, and the former Supreme Court Chief Justice has retired.
* Imran Khan has emerged as a significant independent political force, challenging the military.
* Nawaz Sharif's political influence has diminished, with his brother assuming the role of Prime Minister.

**Challenges for the New Government:**

* Anti-military sentiment remains strong, with Imran Khan leading the charge.
* The PML-N and PPP coalition lacks a clear mandate and faces internal distrust.
* The economy, internal security threats, and troubled neighborhood relations pose significant challenges.
* India-Pakistan relations are unlikely to see significant progress in the near future.</description>

			<title>‘Anatomy of a Fall’ refuses to make monsters out of ambitious women</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/anatomy-of-a-fall-ambitious-women-monsters-9193362/</link>
			<description>A popular comic by Emma exposed the "mental load" carried by women in heterosexual relationships, where they are expected to manage household chores and caregiving responsibilities, regardless of their own careers.

Justine Triet's film "Anatomy of a Fall" inverts this concept by presenting Sandra, a successful novelist on trial for her husband's murder. Recordings of their arguments highlight her refusal to conform to traditional gender roles, leaving her husband burdened and unable to pursue his writing.

Triet explores the double standard faced by ambitious women, who are often vilified for not prioritizing family responsibilities. Films like "Black Swan" and "The Devil Wears Prada" portray these women as distorted and cautionary figures.

However, "Anatomy of a Fall" refuses to demonize Sandra. By giving her the role traditionally played by men, it humanizes her ambition and challenges the societal expectations that punish women for deviating from traditional gender norms.</description>

			<title>Donald Trump vs the Democrats: In 2024, the US will fight for a definition of reality</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/donald-trump-democrats-2024-us-elections-9193319/</link>
			<description>The article argues that Donald Trump embodies the "new rainbow coalition" in America, appealing to diverse voters with a message of hope and common-sense morality. His opponents, on the other hand, are seen as having alienated middle Americans by prioritizing politically expedient rhetoric over addressing their concerns. The 2024 election is presented as a referendum on the Democrats' failed message of peace and truth and Trump's warning that America needs to address its decline in basic values like law and order and free speech. The Democrats' attempts to discredit Trump as a racist have backfired, while Trump has welcomed independent voices like Tulsi Gabbard and Vivek Ramaswamy. The election is ultimately seen as a symbolic battle for the soul of America, with Trump representing shared human values and his opponents promoting divisive dogmas that undermine common sense.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: There are no poor in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/poverty-nsso-poverty-report-hces-niti-aayog-9192461/</link>
			<description>The NITI Aayog claims that poverty in India has been reduced to 5%, basing their statement on the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES). However, the author argues that this claim is misleading.

The HCES data shows that the bottom 20% of earners in rural areas spend only Rs 2,112 per month, while those in urban areas spend Rs 3,157 per month. The author argues that these individuals are clearly living in poverty and that the NITI Aayog is ignoring these realities.

The author also points to other indicators of poverty, such as high rates of anemia, stunting, and wasting among children, as well as the large number of homeless people and those dependent on government welfare programs.

The author concludes that the NITI Aayog's claim is a way of justifying the government's focus on the rich at the expense of the poor.</description>

			<description>Despite India's economic progress, only 46 of 485 Indian cities provide clean water, leading to thousands of daily deaths from diarrhea. Despite Prime Minister Modi's efforts in sanitation, rivers and water sources remain polluted. While Sri Lanka achieves a 92% literacy rate, India stands at 72%, with concerns that even this is inflated. Economic growth must prioritize basic needs, and the media should focus on issues beyond political disputes. India must address discrepancies in sanitation, cleanliness, and literacy to truly become a developed nation.</description>

			<title>Legacy of Poykayil Appachan is still a beacon of hope</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/poykayil-appachan-legacy-prds-religious-movement-kerala-9192724/</link>
			<description>On February 17th, thousands celebrated the birth anniversary of Poykayil Appachan, founder of the Prathyaksha Raksha Daiva Sabha (PRDS) movement. Appachan aimed for spiritual emancipation and social upliftment of oppressed castes in Kerala. His movement used songs, speeches, and strategies to mobilize for social change.

Appachan rejected colonial roots but embraced modernity's benefits. He emphasized economic progress and cultural politics over religious reform. He encouraged understanding of ancestral heritage over reliance on foreign religious figures.

Appachan reinterpreted Travancore's history, portraying upper castes as Aryan invaders and lower castes as indigenous Dravidians. This empowered the latter by celebrating their culture. He was seen as a prophet with divine powers, inspiring hope and land acquisition among Dalits.

In the movement's second phase, Appachan focused on developing social resources. He established schools, industries, and religious centers. He promoted education, inter-caste marriages, and engagement with the broader world. As a Legislative Council member, he introduced policies supporting the marginalized, such as midday meals, land distribution, and free education.

Appachan's legacy continues to inspire equality and spiritual autonomy among marginalized communities in Kerala, serving as a beacon of resilience and hope.</description>

			<title>History Headline: 60 years ago, when a Rajya Sabha election was declared void</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rajya-sabha-elections-history-first-void-9192427/</link>
			<description>India's Rajya Sabha elections are typically uneventful, as MLAs are the voters and there are often no contests. However, occasional surprises occur when political figures lose elections due to cross-voting. In the recent round, 41 of 56 seats were uncontested.

Cross-voting controversies have plagued Rajya Sabha elections for decades. In 1964, a Congress candidate lost due to cross-voting, leading to a legal challenge that established the precedent of annulling an election for corrupt practices.

Concerns over money and muscle power in these elections have been raised since 1970, with MPs calling for strict party discipline to prevent cross-voting.</description>

			<description>Three women from diverse backgrounds share experiences of bullying that damaged their self-esteem. One, from a small town, faced criticism for her skin color and appearance, leading her to limit her clothing choices and avoid certain colors. The second, raised in a city, also struggled with body image issues. Both women experienced self-doubt and withdrew from social situations. However, both eventually gained confidence and self-acceptance through anonymity and self-discovery. The article highlights the widespread impact of bullying on women's self-image and the need for societal change to foster self-respect and challenge unrealistic beauty standards.</description>

			<title>How we can avoid human-animal conflicts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/avoid-human-animal-conflicts-9192292/</link>
			<description>Human-wildlife conflicts in India present challenges due to high biodiversity and human population density. Co-adaptation practices, such as elevated buildings in elephant habitats, have been historically successful. However, dependency on these practices declined after hunting nearly exterminated species like elephants and leopards. Renewed co-adaptation efforts are needed, including monitoring individual animals' behavior and identifying vulnerable areas and populations. The media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and promoting safety measures. Local stakeholders and cross-sectoral collaboration are also important for managing conflicts and finding equitable solutions that balance human safety and biodiversity conservation.</description>

			<title>What Sheikh Shahjahan episode says about strongmen who bend the law</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sheikh-shahjahan-sandeshkhali-episode-tmc-9191769/</link>
			<description>Sandeshkhali, a West Bengal island, has become embroiled in controversy after alleged irregularities in the public distribution system and land grabbing by ruling party member Sheikh Shahjahan. Local women accuse Shahjahan and his associates of sexual abuse. Despite the Enforcement Directorate's raid in January, Shahjahan managed to escape and remained at large for 55 days due to alleged court delays and police inaction. The incident prompted outrage from various authorities, including the Governor, the National Commission for Women, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, the Calcutta High Court, and the NHRC. They criticized the state government's negligence and the police's failure to apprehend Shahjahan. The author argues that such incidents reflect a deeper malaise in the police system, pointing to a lack of independence and political interference. They emphasize the need for police reforms and the implementation of the Supreme Court's directions to insulate the police from external pressures.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-with-mauritius-joining-project-indias-rising-power-in-the-indian-ocean-9191087/</link>
			<description>Agalega, a remote atoll in the Indian Ocean, has gained strategic importance with the development of its airstrip and harbor by India and Mauritius. Despite initial skepticism, the project aims to improve connectivity and living conditions for the atoll's inhabitants. However, critics have raised concerns about the potential for a military presence, which Mauritius has refuted. The improved infrastructure is seen as a part of India's "necklace of diamonds" strategy to secure the Indian Ocean, countering China's "string of pearls" ports. The project also aligns with India's ambition to play a greater role in global security and maintain the Indian Ocean as a "zone of peace."</description>

			<title>DK Joshi writes: India’s growth surprise</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dk-joshi-writes-indias-growth-surprise-9191094/</link>
			<description>India's GDP has grown surprisingly high, with an estimated 7.6% growth as per the National Statistical Office's latest estimates, exceeding previous predictions. This surge was driven by rising net taxes and gains from economic momentum in Q3.

Despite the impressive growth, it's important to note that real GDP is still below pre-pandemic levels. However, the government's focus on infrastructure and policy has aided the economy's recovery. While the RBI projects a 7% GDP growth for next year, experts anticipate a moderation due to factors like high interest rates and reduced fiscal impulse.

Consumption growth, especially in rural areas, has trailed overall GDP growth due to high food inflation. However, there has been a shift in consumption expenditure towards non-food items over time, and within food, from cereals to processed items.

Household savings make up around 61% of total national savings, but net financial savings have fallen sharply, while physical savings have increased. This suggests households are using borrowings to acquire physical assets like houses.

The data also provides insights into investment trends, with public and household investments growing faster than private corporate investments in FY22-23. While corporate investments have shown signs of recovery in the current fiscal, a broad-based revival is crucial for sustained high growth rates.</description>

			<title>Express View on ‘love jihad’ in Kota: Leave the kids alone</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-love-jihad-in-kota-leave-the-kids-alone-9191106/</link>
			<description>In Rajasthan's Kota school, a play and registration error sparked fear-mongering about "love jihad" and conversion. The school suspended three Muslim teachers, showing the dangers of divisive politics in education. The suspension was based on claims that clips from the play held on Republic Day showed the school's alleged nefarious intent. The state education minister has made controversial statements on Akbar and promised stricter action if charges are proven. This heavy-handed response demonstrates the system's complicity in conspiracy theories, jeopardizing the classroom's sanctity. Similar incidents in Madhya Pradesh have occurred, with a minority-run school facing derecognition and a teacher's arrest. Such actions allow bigotry to flourish. Classrooms should be sacrosanct spaces that foster inclusivity and soften political schisms. Students at the Kota school have protested the suspensions, demanding the reinstatement of their teachers. The school administration and local officials refute the accusations, and civil society and political leadership must push back against prejudice in education.</description>

Today, the Po Valley in Italy faces the potential loss of unique rice varieties due to reduced snowmelt and erratic rainfall. Similar concerns exist in West Africa for cocoa production and in growing regions for coffee beans. Despite agriculture's contribution to climate change, efforts are underway to develop resilient crops through gene editing to ensure future generations can enjoy culinary delicacies like risotto and coffee.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rahul-gandhi-bharat-jodo-nyay-yatra-pm-modi-image-making-exercise-9190426/</link>
			<description>Politicians' images evolve through public perception, formed by conversations, media representations, and imagination. In the digital age, images and narratives around politicians are significant. Rahul Gandhi's image is associated with the INDIA grouping, and his recent Bharat Jodo Yatras aim to enhance and reshape it as trustworthy. The yatras provide opportunities for viral social media content and media coverage. However, contradictions between Gandhi's projected image and his actions, such as controversial statements, have emerged. Gandhi's lineage, once an asset, is now seen as a liability, and his image faces competition from Prime Minister Modi, who has successfully connected with the public. Gandhi's yatras have reduced negativity but failed to provide a coherent message, leaving him with an incomplete image as a political leader.</description>

			<title>How the Supreme Court has helped make elections free, fair and transparent</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-elections-free-fair-transparent-9190450/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's recent decision on electoral bonds (EBs) has been hailed as historic. The Court declared the 2018 EB scheme unconstitutional, holding that it violated voters' right to information under Article 19(1)(a) and compromised democratic principles of transparency and accountability.

This ruling expands the scope of Article 19(1)(a) to include information about political funding, recognizing its importance in allowing citizens to make informed voting decisions. The Court rejected the government's argument that EBs were necessary to curb black money, stating that they impinged on fundamental rights without adopting the least restrictive measures.

The judgment affirms the evolving nature of India's Constitution and the increasing judicial oversight over free and fair elections. It follows earlier rulings that recognized the disclosure of candidates' financial status and criminal antecedents as essential for informed voting.

The Court highlights the need for transparency in political funding, not only during elections but throughout. It emphasizes the importance of regulating not only donations but also expenditure by political parties to prevent illicit practices.

This landmark decision is seen as a defense of constitutional ideals of participative democracy and a restoration of public faith in the electoral process.</description>

			<title>Leaked papers and cheating scandals: How to fix India’s exams</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/anti-cheating-bill-paper-leaks-exam-loopholes-national-testing-agency-9189092/</link>
			<description>Despite the recent enactment of the Public Examinations Prevention of Unfair Means Act, another question paper leak has occurred in Uttar Pradesh. This act criminalizes cheating with severe penalties, but no convictions have been made under similar laws in other states.

The author argues that increased punishments alone are not a solution and that a comprehensive approach is needed. The examination system must be made more reliable, valid, objective, clear, and comprehensive through advanced IT systems and professional exam-conducting bodies like the NTA.

Online exams have introduced new challenges, such as outsourcing to untested service providers and vulnerability to hackers. To disincentivize cheating, the importance of exams should be reduced by making them qualifying exams rather than the sole basis for selection.

A special investigation agency is needed to investigate cheating offenses effectively. Rather than fear, the key to fair and reliable exams is a robust, foolproof, and innovative system.</description>

			<description>Despite flagship schemes aimed at empowering women, the patriarchal mindset of the ruling BJP government led by Prime Minister Modi has hindered their effectiveness. Examples highlight government negligence and denigration of women:

* Female farmers faced marginalization and suicide due to exploitative policies, leading to protests ignored by the government.
* Women in Shaheen Bagh protested unconstitutional citizenship laws, facing violence but remaining defiant.
* Champion sportsperson Brij Bhushan Singh's misconduct towards female wrestlers demonstrates the hypocrisy of passing the Women's Reservation Bill.
* Community healthcare workers (ASHA) received global recognition but faced exploitation and delayed payments.
* The government failed to address the stripping of women in Manipur, despite nationwide protests.
* Wages of MGNREGA workers in West Bengal, predominantly women, were withheld, jeopardizing their livelihoods and breaking a parliamentary promise.</description>

They politicize proceedings and vilify the judiciary when their efforts fail. The judiciary's role as guardian of the Constitution is undermined by selective outrage, manipulation of public sentiment, and attacks on its independence. Despite its swift response to protect opposition leaders, the judiciary has faced criticism for its involvement in politically sensitive matters, which has been weaponized to undermine its authority. Retired judges have also played a role in this conspiracy, damaging the judiciary's reputation. To safeguard democracy, it's crucial to defend the judiciary's independence and integrity against these orchestrated attacks.</description>

			<title>Patanjali controversy and the lure of a magic cure: Safety standards dangerously fail consumers</title>

			<description>The article criticizes the misleading marketing of Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (ASU) drugs in India. Despite legal prohibitions, companies like Patanjali continue to advertise illegal claims, prompting the Supreme Court to intervene.

The Drugs and Cosmetics Act differentiates between classical ASU medicine, based on ancient texts, and patent and proprietary (P&amp;P) medicine, which combines traditional recipes with new ingredients. P&amp;P medicine requires efficacy and safety testing, but many products make unverified claims.

The Drugs and Magic Remedies Act prohibits advertising for specific medical conditions, but enforcement is weak, and public awareness is low. The Ayush Ministry has mandated clinical trial registration, but compliance is unclear.

The article highlights the dangers of self-medication with ASU drugs, which are often sold without proper regulation or knowledge. It calls for a unified structure to regulate and administer ASU drugs, ensuring safety and quality control.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/twinkle-on-mom-9189121/</link>
			<description>In Bollywood, female actors have traditionally faced limited career longevity due to perceptions of marriage and motherhood impacting their success. However, actresses like Alia Bhatt, Deepika Padukone, and Kareena Kapoor Khan are challenging this stereotype by openly embracing pregnancy and motherhood while maintaining their careers. These women have achieved significant professional recognition and are using their platforms to normalize the experiences of pregnancy and childbirth, shifting the industry's focus from appearances to the female perspective. Their actions reflect a growing confidence in the maturity of the audience, who are more willing to embrace diversity and challenge traditional perceptions.</description>

			<title>Express View on India’s GDP: Reading the spike</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/reading-the-spike-9189135/</link>
			<description>India's GDP is projected to grow at 7.6% in 2023-24, higher than the earlier estimate of 7.3%. However, net taxes on products may account for some of this difference. GVA growth remains at 6.9%.

The agricultural sector faces challenges and is estimated to grow only 0.7%. In contrast, the industrial sector (mining, manufacturing, electricity, etc.) is robust, with manufacturing growing at 8.5% and construction at 10.7%.

The services sector has decelerated slightly compared to last year, with consumption growth at 3% for the full year. Despite this, investment activity remains strong at 10.2%.

The NSO estimates suggest the economy will grow at 5.9% in the fourth quarter.</description>

			<title>Express View on Gujarat National Law University: Campus in the dock</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/campus-in-the-dock-9189120/</link>
			<description>The Gujarat High Court criticized Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) authorities for suppressing allegations of assault, harassment, and discrimination on campus. A fact-finding committee's report revealed institutional failures in student safety and the mandated investigative process. The independent body initially assigned included a potential conflict of interest, leading to its disbandment. The court condemned the university's apparent cover-up attempts and emphasized the importance of student safety and access to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). The incident highlights the lack of adequate safety measures in institutions and the onus placed on them under the POSH Act to create a safe environment. The court's stern response serves as a warning to all campuses that student safety should not be sacrificed for institutional reputation.</description>

			<title>March 01, Forty Years Ago: Budget 1984-85</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/march-01-forty-years-ago-budget-1984-85-9189115/</link>
			<description>The 1984-85 Union Budget by Pranab Mukherjee featured a marginal income tax rate reduction and significant excise duty reductions on consumer items. Despite relying on customs duties for additional revenue, it left an uncovered gap of Rs 1,763 crore.

Opposition criticized the budget as an "election budget" offering no employee relief or measures to address unemployment and inflation.

In Amritsar, a hand grenade explosion at a Shivratri festival killed three and injured 35, leading to police firing and further injuries.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary G V Ramakrishna resigned amidst differences with Chief Minister N T Rama Rao, becoming the second to depart in 14 months.

The news also includes movie reviews, a career networking article, an interview with Arjun Rampal, and an art honor at the Dior show. Additionally, there were two incidents of explosions in Hussainpura and Bengaluru, resulting in injuries and investigations.</description>

			<title>Pakistan’s new government has internal turmoil, India must wait and watch</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pakistan-elections-govt-india-9188530/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's recent election has resulted in political uncertainty due to widespread poll rigging and flawed mandates. The new government, led by PML(N) and supported by PPP, faces challenges due to an unwieldy coalition, economic woes (deficits, inflation, IMF deadline), and a precarious security situation (terrorism, regional tensions).

Despite the army's setback, it remains influential in governance. Nawaz Sharif has invested in Punjab to revive his party's fortunes. The government's weakness and instability are likely to exacerbate these challenges.

Expanding the thaw with India is appealing internally but constrained by the government's preoccupation, political polarization, and the army's influence. India should adopt a wait-and-watch approach to the new government's move and respond positively to any constructive initiatives.</description>

			<title>Making sense of Aaron Bushnell’s self-immolation for Gaza: Can suicide be a moral act?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/making-sense-of-aaron-bushnells-self-immolation-can-suicide-be-a-moral-act-9188316/</link>
			<description>Aaron Bushnell's self-immolation during a protest against Israel's treatment of Palestinians has sparked controversy. While some view such acts as symptoms of mental health issues, others believe they are a form of political solidarity and agency. Emile Durkheim's theory of social facts suggests that suicide can be influenced by external societal forces, but Bushnell's act does not fit neatly into his categories. David Hume argues that suicide is not inherently immoral and may be a result of profound suffering. Bushnell's protest was a response to the suffering he witnessed in Gaza and his refusal to be complicit in mass killing. While his death is a tragedy, his act holds the hope that others will open their eyes to injustice and prioritize empathy over complacency.</description>

			<title>What consumption expenditure survey leaves unanswered</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-consumption-expenditure-survey-leaves-unanswered-9187003/</link>
			<description>While the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23 provides a glimpse into current household consumption patterns, certain caveats limit its comparability with previous surveys.

The HCES's revised survey design, including multiple household visits and separate questionnaires, likely introduces an upward bias in consumption expenditure estimates. The absence of a subset of households surveyed with the older methodology hinders accurate comparison.

Imputed values for free-of-cost social welfare items may also affect validity, calling for the release of unit-level price and quantity data.

Despite these limitations, within-survey indicators reveal a decline in rural-urban inequality and a narrowing of inter-caste gaps in urban MPCE. Rural inter-caste gaps have remained largely unchanged, while food expenditure has declined across regions.

The survey raises concerns about the potential impact of survey instrument changes on the measurement of change over time. Longitudinal panel surveys in other countries demonstrate the feasibility of balancing the need for survey adaptation with the maintenance of comparability.</description>

			<title>On surrogacy, Indian law goes a step further — but not far enough</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-surrogacy-indian-law-goes-a-step-further-but-not-far-enough-9187014/</link>
			<description>India's Surrogacy (Regulation) Act and Rules have undergone amendments, including clarifying the use of donor gametes and tightening eligibility criteria. Only married couples and single women who are widowed or divorced can seek surrogacy, with a focus on using their own gametes. This move highlights societal norms, with alternative family structures facing exclusion. The amendment allowing donor gametes for couples with medical conditions does not extend to single women. The regulations prioritize biological relatedness and potential hierarchies between different family-making methods. However, a previous parliamentary report emphasized the importance of equal choice between surrogacy and adoption, without implied disparities in status.</description>

			<title>AI, sovereignty and Isaac Asimov’s warning</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ai-sovereignty-and-isaac-asimovs-warning-9187012/</link>
			<description>Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot" explores ethical concerns surrounding AI and robotics, emphasizing the importance of safety and alignment with human values. It highlights the limitations of the Three Laws of Robotics and the potential dangers of AI becoming autonomous.

The article emphasizes the risks AI poses to national security and sovereignty:

1. **Reshaping Sovereignty:** AI creates new digital spaces which can challenge traditional state control, shifting power dynamics between nations, corporations, and individuals.
2. **Influence on Democracy:** AI can be used by foreign powers to manipulate information and influence public opinion, potentially undermining democratic processes.
3. **Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems:** LAWS raise ethical and technical concerns, posing risks of unintended escalation and discrimination in military conflicts.
4. **Cybersecurity Threats:** AI-enhanced cybersecurity methods can penetrate critical infrastructure, threatening national stability and well-being.

To address these challenges, the article calls for a robust global AI governance body and national-level regulations tailored to mitigate threats to sovereignty posed by AI.</description>

			<title>Why India’s youth is chasing the sarkari naukri</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-indias-youth-chasing-the-sarkari-naukri-9187008/</link>
			<description>Postgraduate students primarily aspire for government employment due to its perceived job security, benefits (healthcare, housing), and power. However, income data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey shows that only 9% of earners are in government service.

Among salaried employees, income is higher for government service compared to self-employment in lower income groups (below Rs 25,000 per month). However, self-employed individuals earn more in higher income groups.

The attractiveness of government jobs stems from access to affordable facilities like healthcare and housing. If the government provided equal access to these facilities for all, self-employment would become more appealing.</description>

			<description>Four Indian air force officers (Prasanth Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Pratap, and Shubhanshu Shukla) have been selected for India's first human space flight mission, Gaganyaan. They received their astronaut wings from Prime Minister Modi. Gaganyaan aims to send humans to low Earth orbit by 2024, demonstrating India's indigenous spaceflight capabilities and putting it on par with other spacefaring nations. The mission's success will boost India's space program, which has seen recent achievements with missions like Mangalyaan and Chandrayaan. India aims to create an ecosystem that can compete globally in scientific research, with initiatives such as opening up the space sector and increasing foreign investment. The selection of these astronauts symbolizes a significant step in India's ambition to establish a competitive and thriving scientific and technological landscape.</description>

			<description>The Rajya Sabha elections saw cross-voting by Congress and SP MLAs, resulting in BJP victories and setbacks for the opposition. BJP's aggressive "Operation Lotus" strategy includes floor-crossing and splits in rival parties. While the BJP has gained ground in the Upper House, Congress faces further disorganization. Himachal Pradesh's Congress government faces instability due to internal turmoil and BJP opportunism. In Uttar Pradesh, SP's lack of leadership has contributed to its loss. The BJP's "winner-takes-all" approach, which involves using tactics like fear and favoritism, has raised concerns. While it may yield short-term results, it comes with long-term consequences that the ruling party should consider.</description>

The Munich Conference emphasizes support for Ukraine and Western concerns about Russia's potential ambitions. In contrast, the Raisina Dialogue questions the rules-based order and highlights India's growing influence and the rise of Eastern powers.

Both conferences expose the widening intellectual divide between the West and the Rest, prompting questions about fostering global cooperation. Platforms like the Raisina Dialogue empower different voices, reflecting the evolving global landscape where Eastern powers are gaining prominence.</description>

			<title>Could Supreme Court have done justice in Chandigarh if EVMs were used?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/could-supreme-court-have-done-justice-in-chandigarh-if-evms-were-used-9185620/</link>
			<description>An editorial discusses the small-scale election for the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, which highlights a concerning issue with India's electoral system. Despite known party affiliations, 8 votes for the opposition candidate were declared invalid, prompting a legal challenge that reached the Supreme Court. The editorial raises concerns that similar irregularities could occur in more significant elections for governing states or the country.

The author suggests adopting a simpler voting system that retains EVMs but eliminates VVPATs and Control Units. Instead, a printer would produce a slip with the candidate and party symbol and a barcode for machine counting. Voters would deposit these slips directly into a ballot box for counting.

The author believes this proposed solution addresses the transparency issues in the current EVS and deserves consideration. They question what the Supreme Court would have examined if the Chandigarh election had used EVMs, VVPATs, and Control Units, emphasizing the urgent need for addressing these concerns now.</description>

			<description>**Arrests in Punjab**
Nine Akali Dal leaders, including Parkash Singh Badal and SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, were arrested for insulting national honor by burning or defacing Article 25 of the Constitution, which mentions Sikhs.

**Bandh in Delhi**
A general strike organized to protest violence in Punjab and Haryana was successful, with most markets and businesses closed. Essential services were exempted.

Pakistan released six opposition leaders from detention, including Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari, the head of the banned National Democratic Party.

**BCCI Player Retainership**
The BCCI announced the annual player retainership list for 2023-24, which excluded Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer. Despite being available for the Ranji Trophy semi-final, Iyer skipped the quarter-final due to back pain. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, and Ravindra Jadeja are in Grade A+.</description>

			<description>"Yesterday," originally titled "Scrambled Eggs," was inspired by a dream melody Paul McCartney claimed to have had. The lyrics, now attributed to McCartney and John Lennon, may have been a subconscious apology to McCartney's mother, who he lost to cancer when he was young. McCartney's admission of this personal connection adds depth to the song's meaning. Despite its original inspiration, "Yesterday" has taken on new associations over time, including a misinterpretation as a reference to LSD. McCartney's revelation is expected to enhance its legacy.</description>

			<title>Remembering Pankaj Udhas: His art — of loss, longing and a letter</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/remembering-pankaj-udhas-his-art-of-loss-longing-and-a-letter-9184874/</link>
			<description>Pankaj Udhas, a ghazal singer known for his uncomplicated voice, passed away at 72 from pancreatic cancer. Despite initial skepticism, Udhas's song "Chitthi Aayi Hai," with its evocative lyrics and his emotional delivery, resonated deeply with audiences, evoking feelings of loss and longing.

Udhas's transition to ghazals in the 1980s gained him popularity among those who appreciated the clarity and simplicity of his music, which lacked the virtuosity of some established singers. His accessible style appealed to a wide audience, including those with limited Urdu proficiency.

Udhas's music also found success in the pop genre, with soft-pop ghazals like "Ahista" and "Chandi Jaisa Rang." His ability to connect with listeners on an emotional level, as exemplified by "Chitthi Aayi Hai," remains a testament to his talent and the enduring power of his music.</description>

			<title>Why culture was recognised as a goal for the first time under India’s G20 presidency</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-culture-was-recognised-as-a-goal-for-the-first-time-under-indias-g20-presidency-9184873/</link>
			<description>Under India's G20 presidency, members unanimously agreed to advance culture as a standalone goal, acknowledging its significance for inclusive and sustainable development. Despite its impact on society, culture lacks a specific SDG, overlooking its role in rights-based and inclusive models.

Culture serves as a facilitator for various developmental goals, aligning with the cross-cutting nature of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It plays a role in achieving all 17 SDGs, from poverty reduction to environmental preservation.

Recognizing culture as a standalone goal in the post-2030 development agenda is crucial for its transformative impact. This would galvanize global action, empower marginalized communities, and safeguard vulnerable heritage.

India's support for culture is grounded in its rich heritage and commitment to sustainability. Traditional wisdom and cultural practices offer innovative solutions to contemporary challenges, demonstrated by India's low-waste economy and emphasis on responsible resource utilization through its "Lifestyle for Environment" initiative.</description>

			<title>Open book exams — a step towards ‘learning without burden’ for students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/open-book-exams-a-step-towards-learning-without-burden-for-students-9184811/</link>
			<description>The open-book examination, aimed at reducing stress on students, is not a novel concept in education. Despite government efforts, the issue of student stress persists and has worsened.

The Yash Pal committee in the 1990s attributed the problem to a false notion of knowledge, poor curriculum design, and competitive societal pressures. However, a recent report highlights that stress has evolved into pervasive anxiety due to dwindling economic opportunities.

Coaching institutes have capitalized on this pressure, promoting MCQ-based testing that undermines students' understanding. The popularity of technology in education has exacerbated the issue, although its impact remains largely unexplored.

Despite the gains made in curriculum and teacher education reforms, the COVID-19 pandemic has nullified some progress, creating new challenges such as shortened and more difficult textbooks and teacher shortages.

While open-book exams may alleviate stress, the underlying problem of intrinsic motivation remains unaddressed. The author suggests that another RK Narayan is needed to draw attention to this societal madness that robs children of their curiosity and interest.</description>

			<title>Express View on India’s Test win: The young ones</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indias-test-win-the-young-ones-9184853/</link>
			<description>India's Test series win against England holds special significance despite a shaky start for England. The visitors' aggressive "Bazball" approach initially challenged India's dominance, but injuries to key players (Rahul, Jadeja) and the absence of Kohli put pressure on India's batting.

Despite setbacks, young players like Gill and Jaiswal stepped up with crucial performances. Pitch changes to counter England's spinners helped India regain control. The series showcased the growth of India's young guns and the resilience of Ashwin and Kuldeep.

In contrast, Himachal Pradesh MLA Vikramaditya Singh resigned from his cabinet position due to alleged humiliation by the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu government. The move has raised concerns about the future of the Congress party in the state, especially after six Congress MLAs voted for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls.</description>

			<title>Express View on India’s tariff regime: Costs of a barrier</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indias-tariff-regime-costs-of-a-barrier-9184852/</link>
			<description>Since 1990, India has lowered tariffs significantly. However, since 2014, there have been substantial tariff increases, raising the average tariff to 18%, placing India among the highest in the world.

High tariffs harm domestic manufacturers, exports, and consumers, as well as have adverse effects on sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals due to India's reliance on Chinese imports.

Amidst growing protectionism, some government officials are advocating for a more nuanced approach. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has urged tariff reductions on mobile phone components.

The government has reduced import duties on components used in mobile phone manufacturing. it should also pursue trade agreements, as it has recently done with the UAE and Australia.</description>

			<title>Our classrooms showed us the world. They must be protected from politics of division</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/classrooms-politics-of-division-9184080/</link>
			<description>The explication of a poem in a Christian school in Mangalore led to protests by parents, students, and Hindutva activists. The initial claim was that an English teacher had made disparaging remarks against Lord Ram and Hinduism, which was later revealed to be a malicious voice message.

Missionary schools in Dakshina Kannada played a crucial role in erasing caste and religious hierarchies. They allowed students of all castes to sit together, breaking upper-caste purity rules and providing access to English education and skills that enabled them to enter the lower levels of the colonial judiciary.

Prominent figures like the author of the first Kannada novel, Gulwadi Venkat Rao, were educated in Mission schools and contributed to social reform movements and the freedom struggle.

The Mission schools introduced a radical idea of learning and knowledge that emphasized equality, new epistemologies, and creative exchanges between religions and cultures.

The author, a professor at Mangalore University, emphasizes the need to protect educational spaces from political and moral manipulation and highlights the importance of critical thinking, questioning, and civil dialogue in a polarized society.

The Supreme Court criticized yoga guru Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved for violating an undertaking given to the court about its products and medicinal claims.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-donald-trump-christian-nationalism-opportunity-bjp-9183839/</link>
			<description>Donald Trump is wooing Christian nationalists in the US by promising to protect Christian values and end the "persecution" of Christians. Christian nationalists seek to overturn the separation of Church and state, curtail LGBTQ rights, abolish abortion rights, and reverse immigration. This rise of Christian nationalism is gaining traction across the Western world and is also reflected in the BJP's growing dominance in India. The BJP has begun to connect with conservative parties in Europe, creating new international possibilities for the Modi government.</description>

			<title>Varun Grover’s ‘All India Rank’: The quiet joy of life beyond exams, of nothing happening</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/varun-grovers-all-india-rank-the-quiet-joy-of-life-beyond-exams-of-nothing-happening-9183639/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the film "All India Rank," which explores the lives of young students preparing for IIT exams in an IIT-coaching centre town during the years following India's liberalization. The film captures the essence of the 1990s, referencing Flop Show, Rangeela, and Brainvita. The story follows Sarika, who has a genuine passion for ideas and education beyond exams, and Vivek, whose father desires him to achieve a high IIT rank. The film portrays a repressed world where sex is considered a perversion but hints at the early signs of the sinister nationalism that would eventually grow. The ending emphasizes the realization that life is too vast to be confined to exam results and success stories, and that one should appreciate the process and the actions in the moment.</description>

			<title>What each district says about India’s progress – and how it can help frame better policies</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-each-district-says-about-indias-progress-and-how-it-can-help-frame-better-policies-9182656/</link>
			<description>India's diversity is reflected in its districts, which vary greatly in terms of socioeconomic development. A multidimensional index like the District Development Index for Maharashtra captures this diversity by considering both potential and existing levels of development. The index reveals inter-generational mobility in education and improvements in financial access and health metrics. However, there are significant disparities in income concentration across districts.

Top-down policies have contributed to progress in sanitation, healthcare, nutrition, and rural job guarantee, while bottom-up policies focus on data collection, best governance practices, and collaboration. The Aspirational Districts Programme targets deprivation in crucial areas and has achieved notable progress in health, financial inclusion, and education.

Schemes like One District One Product aim to promote district-level productivity and value creation. Creating industrial clusters that leverage the district's geography, culture, and institutions can further enhance district-level value creation.

A one-size-fits-all policy doesn't work; tailored responses are needed to address the diverse needs of different regions. Effective administration requires coordination, agency, and accountability at the local level.

Initiatives like the District Development Index provide transparency and accountability, supporting socioeconomic and infrastructure development at the district level and driving growth in Viksit Bharat.

The upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh are expected to be intense, with potential contests in Uttar Pradesh and internal discord in Himachal Pradesh.</description>

			<title>How to make CUET a success</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-make-cuet-a-success-9182660/</link>
			<description>The article emphasizes the dilemma between exit and entry exams in the Indian education system, focusing on the introduction of the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) as a potential solution. The CUET is intended to reduce student stress, provide equal opportunities, and standardize admissions processes. However, it may also exacerbate issues such as coaching class culture, dummy schools, and digital divide. The author raises concerns about the MCQ format, potential shift in teaching focus, unfairness to diverse state board curricula, and undermining university autonomy. To address these challenges, stakeholders should collaborate in designing and reviewing the exam, prioritize subject-specific competencies, and ensure alignment with state board curricula. The upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh are mentioned briefly, with potential drama expected.</description>

			<title>Express View on government’s new grain storage plan: More in store</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-governments-new-grain-storage-plan-more-in-store-9182666/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi launched a massive grain storage plan through primary agricultural credit societies in 11 states, aiming to establish 700 lakh metric tons of storage infrastructure at a cost of Rs 1.25 lakh crore over five years. This plan seeks to double the current storage capacity of Food Corporation of India and state agencies, reducing losses and enabling farmers to sell their produce at optimal prices. The government's emphasis on cooperatives, evident through the establishment of the Ministry of Cooperation and computerization of PACS, aligns with PM Modi's belief in their role in addressing farmers' concerns. The plan highlights the diminishing expectations of private sector investments in agricultural infrastructure and marketing.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-kumar-shahani-form-is-the-story-9182669/</link>
			<description>Indian New Wave cinema emphasized artistic collaboration in films that depicted social transformation. Films by Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak featured prominent musicians and performers that seamlessly enhanced the narratives. Kumar Shahani's "Maya Darpan" is particularly notable for the integration of Hariprasad Chaurasia's flute and the Mayurbhanj Chhau troupe's performance, which became a leitmotif in his later works. Despite his exceptional credentials, Shahani's recognition was slow due to his unconventional style that blended minimalism, neo-realism, formalism, and flamboyance. His distinctive approach was not initially appreciated by critics, including Satyajit Ray, who criticized his film "Maya Darpan." However, for Shahani, the form was crucial in depicting the incremental and insidious changes within a society.</description>

			<title>Vandita Mishra writes: As Sonia Gandhi moves House</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/vandita-mishra-writes-sonia-gandhi-moves-house-9168212/</link>
			<description>Sonia Gandhi bids farewell to her constituency in Rae Bareli through a heartfelt letter, expressing gratitude and mentioning her health constraints. However, her move to transition from Lok Sabha to Rajya Sabha at a crucial political juncture for Congress is viewed as a sign of defeatism. The letter hints at making space for the next Gandhi family generation, potentially Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. This shift raises concerns about Congress's strategy and the need for a more proactive approach in the upcoming elections. Additionally, the article contrasts Sonia's subdued departure with the BJP's active narrative-building strategies, exemplified by PM Modi's recent statements.</description>

			<title>The Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi is a beacon of decolonisation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hindu-temple-abu-dhabi-beacon-decolonisation-9161915/</link>
			<description>The construction of a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi reflects the growing relationship between India and the UAE. This event signifies more than just ceremonial importance or a diplomatic gesture. It holds the potential to redefine multiculturalism and showcases Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mission to foster unity in a world filled with religious and cultural hostilities. Previously, PM Modi inaugurated the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which resolved a historical conflict between Hindus and Indian Muslims. This shift from a religious debate to a cultural one represents a reconnection with history and reaffirmation of Hindu identity. PM Modi's efforts to present Hindu views globally have boosted morale among Hindu ideologues and challenged Western-centric ideas and culture. The temple's inauguration redefines multiculturalism by acknowledging religious coexistence as necessary for cultural evolution. It also highlights the value of secularism in respecting different perspectives. The Islamic world's assessment of India under Modi's regime shows a comfort and affinity that surpasses the West's influence. PM Modi's diplomatic outreach represents a departure from Western frameworks and a de-Westernization of diplomacy. India has the opportunity to lead the ideological mission of redefining modernity by giving micro-cultures their rightful space. Hindu philosophy, grounded in realism, can counterbalance the unsettling effects of neoliberalism and materialism. The message from Abu Dhabi extends beyond India's domestic discourse, emphasizing the need for new ideas and beginnings to foster secularism and a world free from hostilities.</description>

			<title>Why does our education system keep punishing children?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-does-our-education-system-keep-punishing-children-9147540/</link>
			<description>Hmm, it is indeed concerning to hear about the high number of suicides among students, especially those from lower castes. The socio-economic conditions and caste discrimination seem to play a significant role in these tragic incidents. It raises the question of what factors in our educational spaces contribute to such despair. One aspect is the suppression of discussions on socio-economic conditions and the perpetuation of caste-based judgments. The other aspect is the perversion of modern norms of equality and justice, which often oppose provisions for equality, including reservation. These issues create a complex and oppressive social reality for individuals, leading to psychological distress. It is crucial for society, including academics, the media, judiciary, intellectuals, and politicians, to take responsibility and work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive educational environment. Education should aim to cultivate autonomous individuals who can navigate their rights and duties, promote justice and equality, and adapt to various ends.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rule-of-law-rule-by-law-international-humanitarian-law-geneva-conventions-9142888/</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: The article discusses the difference between Rule of Law and Rule by Law. Under Rule of Law, the law is supreme and all rulers must abide by it, while under Rule by Law, the rulers are supreme and the law serves them. The article also mentions the rules of war, which include protecting the sick, wounded, and civilians, as well as treating prisoners of war with humanity. However, these rules have been violated in conflicts such as Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, Russia-Ukraine, and Israel-Hamas. Violations of the rules of war can lead to prosecution in UN Courts. The article also briefly touches on the rules of love, with quotes from William Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and Albert Einstein. Lastly, it mentions the distinction between the law on politics and the rules of politics, highlighting how the game of politics is often played according to unstated rules.</description>

			<title>Express View on Neuralink human trials: Mind and matter</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-neuralink-human-trials-mind-and-matter-9137722/</link>
			<description>Neuralink, a venture by Elon Musk, recently announced that the first human received an implant from Neuralink and is recovering well. This marks an important milestone in the development of human-computer interfaces that can potentially address physical and cognitive limitations. The implant contains a chip and electrodes that register thoughts related to movement, with the goal of enabling people with disabilities to control devices through their thoughts. However, it is important to consider privacy concerns and ensure that data extracted from brains is not exploited. Regulation, public funding for research, and ethical considerations are crucial as this technology progresses. The potential impact of brain-computer interfaces is significant, but careful navigation of its challenges is necessary.</description>

			<title>Express View on South Korea’s dog-meat ban: Something about dogs</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/something-about-dogs-9118084/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the difference between the consumption of dogs and other animals bred for food. It highlights the recent ban on the breeding, slaughter, and sale of dog meat in South Korea, which has been met with international criticism. The decline in the culinary tradition of consuming dogs is mainly attributed to older generations with nostalgia for the traditional meal. Activists have raised concerns about the cruelty faced by dogs bred for meat, including unhygienic living conditions, confinement in cages, and disease. The article questions whether there is a relevant distinction between the treatment of dogs and other animals bred for food. It emphasizes the importance of considering this difference, particularly in the context of policing dietary choices as a means of exploiting the vulnerable. The key distinction mentioned is that dogs were not widely domesticated for food, and there is research suggesting that humans evolved and developed emotions through their connection with dogs. However, it also acknowledges that this may be a narrative people tell themselves while enjoying meat from other animals.</description>

			<title>Januray 20, Forty Years Ago: NDA Agitation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/januray-20-forty-years-ago-nda-agitation-9118055/</link>
			<description>The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), consisting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Lok Dal, has decided to launch a nationwide agitation to draw attention to what they perceive as the Congress party's failure in addressing the country's economic issues. Demonstrations are planned to be held in February, and the NDA intends to prepare a charge sheet highlighting the supposed wrongdoings of the Congress.

Meanwhile, the Akali Dal has instructed its "do or die" squad volunteers to be prepared for some form of revolutionary action by January 26. The party has previously set this date as a deadline for the government to meet its demands. The Akali Dal has formed a force of 1.25 lakh volunteers as part of its preparations.

In a separate incident, during preparations for the Republic Day parade, an elephant at the Delhi zoo got loose, causing chaos and resulting in the death of a zebra. The mahout eventually regained control of the elephant after two hours of frenzied searching in the dark.

Additionally, the Islamic Conference Organisation (ICO) summit meeting in Casablanca has adopted a resolution on West Asia, which some perceive as a new peace plan. The resolution is based on a 1982 Fez peace project that implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist. There are also ongoing efforts to seek a new United Nations resolution on Palestinian rights.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-india-afghanistan-nail-biter-doubly-super-9116244/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the excitement and unique nature of Super Overs in cricket. Super Overs are compared to watching a bomb-disposal specialist in a movie, as they provide intense moments and can determine the outcome of a game in a short span of time. The article highlights a recent Super Over between India and Afghanistan, where Ravi Bishnoi defended 11 runs by taking two wickets in three balls, leading to India's victory. The decision-making process of the captains in choosing players for the Super Over is also mentioned, with Rohit Sharma opting for Ravi Bishnoi to bowl. The article emphasizes that the Super Over offers a fresh start to the game, erasing previous achievements and mistakes. It also contrasts cricket's Super Overs to penalty shootouts in football, as cricket maintains its team aspects and doesn't reduce the game to just a striker and a goalkeeper. The author concludes that Super Overs provide an exhilarating experience for both players and fans.</description>

			<title>January 19, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Bangalore Violence</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/january-19-1984-forty-years-ago-bangalore-violence-9116241/</link>
			<description>The article highlights various incidents of violence and political strife in different parts of India. In Bangalore, clashes during a bandh organized by supporters of Kannada matinee idol Raj Kumar resulted in a dusk-to-dawn curfew being imposed in certain areas. The clashes involved large-scale violence, arson, and numerous stabbing incidents, resulting in two deaths and injuries to 21 people, with two in critical condition.

In Amritsar, a bomb blast occurred in Chitra cinema, causing injuries to 16 individuals, four of whom were seriously injured. The blast happened towards the end of an evening show, leading to 12 people being admitted to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in precarious conditions.

In Delhi, the metropolitan party of the Congress (I) expressed discontent with the actions of Lt-Governor Jagmohan, who oversees the Union Territory of Delhi. The party's councillors are planning to meet Rajiv Gandhi, the Congress (I) general secretary, to discuss their concerns. They alleged that Jagmohan was taking credit for the work done by the administration, sparking their anger.

Internationally, the Soviet Union accused the United States of engaging in an arms build-up that aimed at achieving military superiority. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko raised these concerns at a European disarmament conference, stating that the deployment of new US missiles in Europe was undermining security. Gromyko also criticized what he perceived as the exportation of militarism, enmity, and war hysteria to Western Europe by the United States.</description>

			<description>This article discusses the story of Angrez Singh, a man from Punjab's Fazilka, who impersonated his girlfriend to take a health workers exam on her behalf.

While he may have failed to help her pass the exam, he has passed the test of love.</description>

			<title>For India, the easiest way to decarbonise is to scale up renewable capacity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/climate-change-global-carbon-project-report-cop28-carbon-emissions-decarbonisation-9109362/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the latest Global Carbon Project report, which projects that India's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will exceed 3 gigatons by the end of 2023. This growth rate is double that of China, although China's emissions are four times higher than India's in absolute terms. The article emphasizes the need for India to strategize its decarbonization process, particularly in sectors such as power generation, transportation, and heavy industries. It mentions the challenges and potential solutions for reducing fossil fuel usage, including the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, electric vehicles (EVs), and green hydrogen. The article also highlights the importance of scaling up renewable capacity and addressing policy issues to achieve India's goal of being net-zero by 2070.</description>

			<title>From the ground in Punjab, stage seems set for a multi-cornered election</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lok-sabha-elections-2024-india-bloc-punjab-politics-congress-aap-akali-dal-9109361/</link>
			<description>With the Lok Sabha elections approaching in Punjab, the political landscape is uncertain. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress are in conflict, while the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) is fighting for survival. The BJP, although resurgent nationally, is still finding its footing in Punjab. AAP had a landslide victory in the state in the previous election, but faced setbacks in subsequent polls. The alliance between AAP and Congress seems contradictory given their previous rivalry. The Akali Dal and BJP, former allies, may reconcile, but it is unlikely given current circumstances. The Akali Dal is facing an important battle to revive its influence. The state could witness a multi-cornered contest if party leaders do not cooperate. The article also raises questions about the lack of strong leaders for the upcoming elections.</description>

			<title>Express View on Mumbai Trans Harbour Link: Bridge to prosperity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/atal-setu-inauguration-narendra-modi-atal-setu-toll-rates-mumbai-trans-harbour-link-9109377/</link>
			<description>The Atal Setu, also known as the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, is India's longest sea bridge, spanning 22 kilometers with six lanes. It was inaugurated last week at a cost of Rs 17,840 crore. The bridge aims to reduce travel time between central Mumbai and Navi Mumbai from 2 hours to about 20 minutes, alleviating traffic congestion. However, it is important to view the Atal Setu not just as a solution to traffic woes but as a significant step in India's efforts to enhance its physical infrastructure and attract global investments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as a symbol of a developed India. The government has implemented structural reforms over the past decade to strengthen the economy and make it an attractive investment destination. Indian banks have been revitalized, and infrastructure development has been prioritized through increased capital expenditure and improved project implementation. This focus on infrastructure, both physical and digital, is crucial for India to capitalize on the shifting global supply chain dynamics and replace China as a preferred destination for developed country markets and investors. To sustain long-term growth, it is essential for the private sector to play a role alongside government spending in enhancing infrastructure.</description>

			<title>Maldives, India, China: history shapes the present</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-maldives-diplomatic-row-mohamed-muizzu-narendra-modi-9108315/</link>
			<description>The Maldives is a fascinating study in contradictions. It managed to maintain relative independence from European colonization despite being an archipelago of nearly 1,200 islands. While it is now a constitutionally Muslim nation, its culture was originally rooted in Buddhism. The Maldives attracted the attention of European explorers and came under British influence before gaining independence in 1965. The country has developed ties with India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, with India being the first to establish a resident mission in Male. China has also played a significant role in the Maldives' infrastructural development. The challenges facing Indo-Maldivian relations include the increasing Islamization of Maldivian society and concerns about the economic impact of foreign influences.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: A Daniel come to judgement</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bilkis-bano-case-supreme-court-verdict-2002-gujarat-riots-9108302/</link>
			<description>In the article, the author discusses the story of Bilkis Bano, a woman who experienced a heinous crime during the violence in Gujarat in 2002. Bilkis Bano was attacked, her family members were killed, and she was gang-raped. The perpetrators were later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, on August 15, 2022, the government of Gujarat remitted the remainder of their sentence and set them free. The released convicts were welcomed and celebrated, which caused outrage.

The article also highlights the legal proceedings related to the case. The Supreme Court intervened and directed the convicts to report to jail authorities to serve their sentence. The Court emphasized the importance of respecting women, regardless of their social status. It also criticized the actions of the Gujarat government and the Gujarat High Court for granting remission without proper jurisdiction and in violation of established precedents.

The author concludes by emphasizing the lessons learned from the Bilkis Bano case. While violations of dignity, liberty, privacy, and human rights occur, there are police officers and judges who strive to punish the guilty. The rule of law prevails, and public outrage can lead to corrective actions. Bilkis Bano's words, "I can breathe again," symbolize hope and resilience in the face of despair and darkness.

			<title>Why I will light a diya for Sita</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/light-diya-sita-ram-mandir-religion-9108033/</link>
			<description>The article emphasizes the importance of science in fostering a spirit of inquiry and the ability to question established norms and traditions. It criticizes the education system for not encouraging critical pedagogy and limiting discussions on diverse religious and philosophical traditions. The author expresses concern about increasing superstition and religious dogmatism, while highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of different spiritual paths. The upcoming inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is seen as a majoritarian political project, but the author emphasizes the importance of developing a scientific and questioning mindset inspired by figures like Meghnad Saha, Rabindranath Tagore, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. The article concludes with a tribute to Sita, symbolizing an independent spirit and the refusal to conform.</description>

			<title>Tapping into the janta’s pulse: How BJP’s welfare model has undone the faults of Nehruvian socialism</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-welfare-model-faults-nehruvian-socialism-9107790/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the shifting economic ideology in India from Nehruvian socialism to competitive welfarism and its impact on the country's political landscape. Nehruvian socialism, implemented by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, focused on state-led industrialization and central planning but resulted in slow economic growth and societal challenges. The article highlights the transition to economic liberalization in the late 20th century and the current emphasis on competitive welfarism, which combines market-friendly policies with welfare programs to stimulate economic growth and uplift underprivileged communities. This shift has influenced electoral outcomes, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gaining success through its welfare-oriented policies. The article concludes by emphasizing the dynamic nature of Indian politics and the continuous reshaping of ideologies to align with the needs and aspirations of the population.</description>

			<title>Why can’t doctors with disabilities pursue specialisation?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/persons-with-disabilities-mbbs-nmc-supreme-court-intervene-9107603/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the case of a girl who was denied admission to the MBBS course due to a language and speech disability. The Supreme Court intervened and granted her admission. However, new guidelines issued by the National Medical Commission (NMC) for postgraduate admission now bar candidates with a 40% or higher speech disability. These guidelines have been criticized by doctors with disabilities and the NMC's own panel of experts. The NMC's position on mental illness and disabilities contradicts previous court rulings and lacks an objective method of assessment. The article argues that the guidelines violate the Constitution and deny equal opportunities to individuals with disabilities. The burden of fighting for their rights falls on individuals with disabilities, and the article calls for the courts to uphold principles of equality and non-discrimination.</description>

			<title>To combat climate challenges, the Finance Commission needs to step up</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/climate-change-global-warming-indian-finance-commission-climate-challenges-9107312/</link>
			<description>India has been actively involved in global efforts to improve forest cover and combat climate change. These initiatives have helped build resilience in communities and ecosystems while reducing carbon emissions. Fiscal federalism, specifically through the Finance Commission (FC), has incentivized states to conserve forests. The 15th FC allocated a significant portion of the central tax pool, based on forest cover, to the forestry sector. The 16th FC, currently appointed, has the opportunity to prioritize climate action by incorporating climate vulnerability and emission intensity into tax devolution formulas. Performance-based grants can be provided for sectors that contribute to emissions reduction and sustainable land and forest management. The FC can also address ecological challenges such as crop burning, mangrove restoration, and forest fires. By considering scientific data and designing a performance-based funding system, the 16th FC can play a crucial role in India's climate readiness and harmonize economic growth with environmental imperatives.</description>

			<title>January 13, Forty Years Ago: Opposition Meet</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/january-13-forty-years-ago-opposition-meet-9107320/</link>
			<description>The fourth opposition conclave aims to formulate a common economic program, highlighting the economic challenges faced by different opposition governments due to insufficient cooperation from the Centre. The draft economic resolution emphasizes the need for a planned country-wide movement. The Soviet Union has requested Bangladesh to postpone the departure of its official trade delegation scheduled to sign a new annual barter protocol in Moscow. The pradesh Congress (I) has resumed its agitation in the state after failed talks between Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and Prime Minister Mrs Gandhi, with January 14 designated as a protest day. Opposition leader M Veerappa Moily accused ministers H D Gowda and S R Bommai of implementing coercive measures and imposing a "mini emergency" in Karnataka, restricting the functioning of other ministers and legislators.</description>

			<title>Express View on Ranji Trophy and Andhra team: The field experiment</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-ranji-trophy-and-andhra-team-the-field-experiment-9107335/</link>
			<description>The Andhra cricket team in the Ranji Trophy season has chosen not to celebrate individual achievements in order to prioritize teamwork. In their matches, they remained silent when their batsmen reached a hundred, only cheering when the team took the lead. This approach is unusual in a cricket ecosystem known for celebrating individual players. However, some argue that denying domestic performers the acknowledgment of their teammates is harsh. The respect and applause from the dressing room are seen as the ultimate acknowledgment of a player's skills. While Andhra's experiment continues, there is a need for Indian cricket's stakeholders to reconsider promoting team games as individual face-offs, focusing more on the overall experience and personal storylines for fans.</description>

			<title>Express View on inflation: A matter of interest</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-inflation-a-matter-of-interest-9107323/</link>
			<description>Retail inflation in India increased slightly to 5.69% in December, driven primarily by higher food inflation, according to data released by the National Statistical Office. The consumer food price index rose to 9.53% in December, with elevated inflation in cereals, vegetables, pulses, sugar, and spices. However, core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, has moderated. The index of industrial production slowed down to 2.4% in November. The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India will meet for the last time this financial year, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the interim Union budget soon. The MPC had previously voted to maintain the status quo on rates and stance, focusing on aligning inflation with the target. However, there is a growing argument among MPC members for an interest rate cut to prevent excessive real interest rates. The RBI has projected inflation to moderate in the coming quarters. The MPC should provide forward guidance on the trajectory of interest rates, especially considering the possibility of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.</description>

			<title>January 12, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Drivers Robbed</title>

			<description>The article reports on several incidents and developments. Sikh extremists carried out an attack near Duburji octroi post in Amritsar, killing a driver and looting truck and tanker drivers. Eyewitnesses say there were seven extremists, who escaped after a brief encounter with the police. 

In other news, the Central issue price of rice distributed through fair price shops is being increased by 20 paise per kilogram from January 16. This increase is attributed to the recent hike of Rs 10 per quintal in the procurement price of paddy and to compensate for other cost escalations. 

Within the Communist Party of India, pro-Mrs. Gandhi elements abstained from voting on a political document adopted by the party's central executive committee. This has given more ground to the party's general secretary, C Rajeswara Rao, who advocates for the CPI to oppose Mrs. Gandhi's domestic politics while exploring cooperation with left and democratic parties. 

Additionally, the Bombay Apartment Ownership Act will soon be extended to Delhi in order to make flat ownership more appealing. This decision aims to boost co-operative housing activity in the capital and alleviate the housing situation. Consequently, there has been a surge in membership applications for co-operative housing societies since registration opened.</description>

			<title>How will the Telecommunication Act impact competition, tech neutrality in India?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/open-up-the-playing-field-9105807/</link>
			<description>The Telecommunication Act 2023 replaces older acts, adapting to changing technology and communication needs. It introduces changes like spectrum allocation flexibility and infrastructure improvement mechanisms. However, there are concerns about provisions that grant the government excessive power in emergencies, potentially infringing on citizen privacy. The article emphasizes two overlooked objectives: promoting competition and mobilizing resources for infrastructure upgrades. India faces challenges in 5G adoption due to limited connectivity beyond major cities, but opening the market to new players and improving competition can attract investment and innovation. The article suggests that telecom services should be technology-neutral and new players should have equal access to infrastructure to compete with established entities. Functional separation, as implemented in other countries, can address market concentration but should be balanced to avoid negative outcomes. India needs to transition from wireless to wireline architecture for high-quality digital applications, emphasizing the importance of investing in fiber infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. The article also highlights the need for regulatory convergence between telecommunications, internet, and broadcasting, as the lines between these sectors blur. The new Act aims to unleash competition, facilitate the transition to fiber-based networks, and promote technology dynamism for India's telecom industry.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-new-maharashtra-model-9105803/</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for recognizing Chief Minister Eknath Shinde as the leader of the Shiv Sena party, despite his split from the Uddhav Thackeray-led group. The decision is seen as a mockery of the Constitution and a disregard for legislative procedures. The article highlights several flaws in the Speaker's decision, including the violation of the Supreme Court's ruling on the appointment of a whip. It also questions the Speaker's inconsistent stance on disqualifying MLAs who violated the party whip. The article suggests that this decision is likely to lead to more legal battles and discusses the BJP's role in engineering defections in Maharashtra. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of the judiciary in upholding "constitutional morality" in such cases.</description>

			<title>Express View on EU carbon tax: Costs of a levy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/costs-of-a-levy-9105805/</link>
			<description>Indian industry is concerned about the European Union's Carbon Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which requires exporters to submit extensive data about their production methods. This could compromise trade secrets and erode competitive advantage. In 2022, a significant portion of India's exports to the EU were iron, steel, and aluminum, and EU tariffs under CBAM could raise costs by 20 to 35 percent. India plans to contest CBAM's protectionist nature at the WTO and collaborate with other affected countries. One suggestion is to impose tariffs but direct the funds to developing countries instead of the EU's corpus. The Indian government is considering a similar levy to encourage carbon footprint reduction and fund domestic green transition. Concerns exist that other developed economies, like the US, may adopt similar measures. Large companies are preparing for the challenge, but smaller ones will need support from governments, regulators, and financial institutions to implement emission abatement technologies.</description>

			<description>The article criticizes the Congress party for refusing to attend the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The Congress claims that religion is a personal matter and the temple inauguration is a political project. The article argues that the Congress fails to engage with Hindus who see the temple as a symbol of their faith and lacks a clear stance on Hinduism. It also suggests that the Congress needs to develop its own alternative ideas and politics instead of merely reacting to the BJP's agenda. The article concludes that boycotting the Ayodhya ceremony is not a strategic political move.</description>

			<title>Express View on Golden Globes: Roll up the red carpet</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-golden-globes-roll-up-the-red-carpet-9100779/</link>
			<description>The 2024 Golden Globe awards had a few standout moments, such as Lily Gladstone becoming the first indigenous person to win Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Drama) for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Ali Wong also made history as the first woman of Asian descent to win Best Actress for the limited series Beef. However, the overall ceremony lacked surprises and was overshadowed by an awkward opening monologue by host Jo Koy. This has led to discussions about whether the traditional glamorous award ceremony is losing its appeal, especially considering the declining viewership ratings in recent years. One major issue is the predictability of the winners, with films like Oppenheimer and shows like Succession racking up awards as expected. The excitement of discovering hidden gems has been taken over by social media and streaming service recommendation algorithms. The difficulty in securing a host, as demonstrated by the last-minute selection, further suggests a need to reevaluate the event. Perhaps it's time to reconsider the significance of red carpet events.</description>

			<title>January 06, Forty Years Ago: Boycott of Governor</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/january-06-forty-years-ago-boycott-of-governor-9097183/</link>
			<description>The Left Front in West Bengal has decided to boycott functions attended by state Governor A P Sharma, except for Chief Minister Jyoti Basu. This move comes as a protest against the governor's actions. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party has expressed its continued support for the Hegde government in Karnataka. The party's national executive discussed the political situation in Karnataka and backed the current government. In another development, Union Education Minister Sheila Kaul's letter to the Director of IIT Madras, P V Indiresan, expressing dissatisfaction with his observations on reservation policies for SCs and STs in IITs has sparked a debate in academic circles. The main focus of the debate is on restrictions faced by academicians as well as the reservation policy itself. Furthermore, legal proceedings are underway in response to Thailand’s request for the extradition of Charles Sobhraj, a notorious underworld figure in Asia. The Indian magistrate will determine whether there is a valid case for extradition under the Indian Extradition Act, even though there is no bilateral extradition treaty between the two countries.</description>

			<title>The Mirwaiz of Kashmir remembers Ghulam Mohiuddin Wani: My teacher, my guide</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-mirwaiz-of-kashmir-remembers-ghulam-mohiuddin-wani-my-teacher-my-guide-9095696/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on the impact of Ghulam Mohiuddin Wani, also known as Mahad Sahab, on the author's life as a spiritual mentor and guide. Mahad Sahab played a crucial role in helping the author transition into the position of Mirwaiz (chief cleric) after the author's father's passing. Despite belonging to the orthodox Salafi school of thought, Mahad Sahab possessed a Sufi temperament and emphasized understanding Islam with humility and gratitude. He introduced the author to the unique learning system of Wa'az-o-Tableegh, which combines oral traditions, listening, repetition, and absorption. Mahad Sahab's knowledge of ancient manuscripts and his guidance in maintaining moderation and balance in religious teachings left a lasting impression on the author. Unfortunately, since the author's house arrest in August 2019, they were unable to meet Mahad Sahab. With his recent passing, the author mourns the loss of their guiding light.</description>

			<title>Express View on pineapple pizza: Why not?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-pineapple-pizza-why-not-9095706/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a controversy in Naples, Italy, where a popular pizzaiolo named Gino Sorbillo has created a pizza topped with pineapples. This unconventional topping has sparked outrage among traditionalists who see it as a violation of pizza-making norms. Sorbillo defends his creation by highlighting the flavor contrast between the sweet fruit and the smoked cheeses he uses. The debate raises the question of how much a dish can deviate from its authentic form before it becomes something entirely different. Italians generally associate pizza with traditional toppings such as tomatoes, Italian cheeses, vegetables, and certain meats, while considering pineapple to be unacceptable. However, the article suggests that pizza's worldwide popularity stems from its adaptability, as seen in various unconventional toppings like reindeer meat in Finland and haggis in Scotland. It suggests that it may be time to accept that pizza has become a global dish.</description>

			<title>Express View on India’s MSP policy: The right support</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indias-msp-policy-the-right-support-9095704/</link>
			<description>This article highlights two forms of policy discrimination faced by oilseeds and pulses farmers. Firstly, the minimum support prices (MSP) for these crops are often not effectively implemented, unlike for rice, wheat, and sugarcane. This results in lower selling prices for crops like mustard and chickpeas compared to their MSPs. Secondly, there is a bias in favor of imports, with zero import duty on edible oils like palm, soybean, and sunflower, as well as most pulses. This has led to a significant increase in edible oil imports, negatively impacting domestic production.

The article also points out the lack of research and development attention given to oilseeds and pulses compared to crops like wheat, rice, and sugarcane. Furthermore, the denial of approval for genetically-modified hybrid mustard and herbicide-resistant soybean technologies reflects the government's indifference towards these crops.

Various government departments have raised concerns about the existing MSP and procurement policies, which only benefit a few crops. The article suggests that MSPs should complement market forces rather than replace them. It proposes replacing price-based supports, such as MSPs and input subsidies, with per-acre income transfers as a more effective solution.</description>

			<title>Bangladesh elections tug-of-war: Islamic fundamentalism vs democracy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-elections-tug-of-war-islamic-fundamentalism-democracy-9095409/</link>
			<description>The upcoming elections in Bangladesh are significant for consolidating democratic practices, promoting progressive development, and enhancing participation in global affairs. The ruling Grand Alliance, led by Sheikh Hasina, has achieved economic growth and other improvements during its 15-year tenure. However, the government has faced challenges such as criticism from the international community and opposition demands for a caretaker government. Electoral violence and the role of Islamist forces are also key concerns. Bangladesh is sensitive to foreign criticism and seeks to reassure observers about its commitment to free and fair elections. The country's quest for democracy and identity, as well as its balanced foreign policy, contribute to its aspirations for economic growth and global partnerships.</description>

			<title>Why the BJP’s strategy with SCs, STs works — and how the Opposition can put a dent in it</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-bjp-strategy-with-scs-sts-works-9095167/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the BJP's success in mobilizing marginalized communities in recent assembly elections in India. The BJP has employed strategies to engage with the socially marginalized groups, such as offering general welfare measures and emphasizing rapid economic development. They have also supported demands for reservation from dominant agrarian castes. Additionally, the BJP curates emotive narratives about history and caste pride to create social divisions. While these strategies have garnered support from marginalized groups, the article highlights the need for substantive economic justice and inclusion in public institutions for these communities. The opposition can challenge the BJP's dominance by raising issues of economic justice and ensuring equitable participation in the economy.</description>

			<title>The politics and geopolitics of AI governance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-politics-and-geopolitics-of-ai-governance-9094938/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the need for a single international organization to oversee the governance and legislation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It highlights the challenges of domestic legislation and the potential for lower regulatory standards in underdeveloped countries. The creation of the International Agency for AI (IAAI) is proposed to establish fundamental principles accepted by all nations. However, geopolitical difficulties and the preference for self-regulation by the private industry hinder the feasibility of such an organization. The article suggests that existing sector-specific institutions, such as standard-setting organizations, should develop AI governing principles to ensure harmonization without disruptions. Incorporating these standards into new organizations can facilitate global AI governance.</description>

			<title>Express View | Mickey and Minnie characters are now free to use</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/mickeys-and-minnies-9094182/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent release of iconic characters into the public domain, allowing for fresh creativity. Characters such as Mickey and Minnie, Tigger, and Peter Pan are now free to be used in different ways. The article suggests potential reimaginations, such as exploring queer relationships between Pooh and Tigger or portraying Peter Pan as a flawed character facing the consequences of his actions in the real world. It references Disney's willingness to subvert expectations by casting a black actor as Ariel and reimagining Ursula in The Little Mermaid reboot. However, the article also highlights the limitation of reimagining copyrighted content, often leading to predictable horror twists. The author emphasizes the need for responsible and engaging storytelling to fully utilize the opportunities presented by the release of these characters.</description>

			<title>January 4, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Assailant Arrested</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/january-4-1984-forty-years-ago-assailant-arrested-9094162/</link>
			<description>The article reports on multiple incidents and statements. 

First, it mentions Sukhdev Singh, who was arrested after a robbery and shootout in Connaught Place. It is revealed that Singh is a deserter from the army, having enlisted in 1977 and left in 1981. He apparently informed the police that he received additional training in weaponry and commando methods at the Guru Ram Das Sarai in the Golden Temple complex.

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's speech at the 71st session of the Indian Science Congress is also discussed. She emphasized the importance of science permeating various aspects of national life and regions to prevent disparities within the country, similar to what has occurred internationally over the past two centuries.

The article then describes an Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian guerrilla base and ammunition depot in Beirut, which drew heavy ground fire from the Syrian-held area. Additionally, it mentions that a lone motorcycle gunman in the capital seriously wounded the French consul's driver. Beirut Radio initially reported the driver's death but later retracted the statement.

Lastly, the Election Commission's decision is mentioned. The commission chose not to pursue its recommendation of imposing President's rule in states before holding assembly elections. This recommendation caused confusion among political parties, and the Chief Election Commissioner, R K Trivedi, expressed regret that it had been interpreted in the context of center-state relations and the recent Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections.</description>
