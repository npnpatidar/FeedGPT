			<title>From Kerala film industry sexual harassment to P Diddy arrest: The perils and heartbreaks of seeing childhood heroes fall</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kerala-film-industry-sexual-harassment-diddy-arrest-9578681/</link>
			<description>An article discusses the recent #MeToo movement resurgence in Kerala's film industry, highlighting accusations against prominent figures and the systemic issue of sexual entitlement within the industry. The author draws parallels to the arrest of Sean "Diddy" Combs, accused of leading a criminal enterprise that exploited women, emphasizing the prevalence of such abuse in various sectors. 

Critiques are leveled at the media's hypocrisy in selectively pursuing justice and the likelihood of lenient consequences for the accused in Kerala, referencing the protracted legal proceedings against actor Dileep.  The article concludes by questioning the blind adoration of artists and suggesting a shift in focus towards addressing the underlying causes of such abuse rather than separating art from the artist.</description>

			<title>In Bengaluru, a cautionary tale against the gig economy and how it does disservice – to workers and customers alike</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bengaluru-gig-economy-workers-9578450/</link>
			<description>An incident in Bengaluru involving an auto-rickshaw driver and a student who cancelled a ride went viral, highlighting the complexities of the gig economy and the role of ride-hailing apps. The driver, allegedly assaulted the student, leading to his arrest and subsequent blacklisting by platforms. 

The case sparked debate about women's safety, linguistic tensions, and the responsibilities of ride-hailing apps. Critics argue that apps, by prioritizing efficiency and impersonality, create a disconnect between drivers and passengers, potentially leading to frustration and aggression. They also point to the power dynamics inherent in the platform model, where algorithms control driver earnings and passenger ratings, leaving drivers with limited autonomy and vulnerability to customer actions.</description>

			<title>Why One Nation, One Election must be challenged</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-one-nation-one-election-must-be-challenged-9577733/</link>
			<description>The Union cabinet has approved a proposal for "One Nation, One Election" as suggested by a committee headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind. This proposal suggests holding simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, followed by elections to panchayats and municipalities within 100 days.  This move has raised concerns regarding its constitutionality and the potential impact on free and fair elections. The proposal bypasses the Election Commission, which is a constitutional authority, and has been criticized for lacking representation and expertise. Critics argue that the scheme disregards the federal structure and states' rights, particularly by suggesting amendments to the Constitution concerning state legislative assembly terms without ratification.  The proposal is expected to face legal challenges and strong opposition in Parliament and from the public.</description>

			<title>The Third Edit: On Booker shortlist, women aplenty</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-third-edit-on-booker-shortlist-women-aplenty-9577696/</link>
			<description>The 2024 Booker Prize shortlist features a historic five women authors, a stark contrast to the past where  gender inequality in literary awards was prevalent. Despite progress, literary awards like the Nobel and Booker Prize have historically favored male authors.  

This discrepancy stems from societal biases that perceive female literature as less impactful or with a narrower scope compared to male writing.  Women's works are often categorized into niche genres, diminishing their recognition as equally valuable literary expressions.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/audacity-ambition-and-unity-at-the-paris-2024-games-9577734/</link>
			<description>The Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games were a historic event, celebrated for their inclusivity, diversity, and sustainability. They saw remarkable achievements from athletes and para-athletes from around the world, including India's first-ever gold medal in para archery. 

The Games achieved gender parity, witnessed global participation with billions tuning in, and set new records for ticket sales.  Beyond athletic excellence, Paris 2024 made a significant contribution to society by promoting inclusivity for people with disabilities through accessible infrastructure and the creation of 'inclusive clubs'. 

The Games also highlighted the unifying power of sport and its role in strengthening health and preventing illness. The legacy of Paris 2024 extends to its commitment to sustainability, with initiatives like the cleaning of the Seine River and the transformation of Olympic facilities into public green spaces.</description>

			<title>Express View: The Fed’s pivot</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-the-feds-pivot-9577693/</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, marking the beginning of a rate cut cycle. This move reflects the Fed's confidence that inflation is heading towards its target and a focus on supporting employment, given a rising unemployment rate. The Fed projects further rate cuts in 2024 and 2025. 

This action is expected to influence other central banks, including the RBI in India. The RBI's next monetary policy meeting will likely consider domestic and global economic factors, along with new members' perspectives, to determine its next steps.</description>

			<title>New criminal codes, same old challenges of the justice system</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/new-criminal-codes-same-old-challenges-of-the-justice-system-9577694/</link>
			<description>The newly enacted Indian criminal laws, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA), aim to expedite trials and enhance public access to justice. However, there are concerns about the system's capacity to meet the stringent timelines, given the existing backlog of cases and understaffing in the judiciary. 

The BNSS extends the provision for bail to first-time offenders, but concerns remain about the implementation of this right in practice. The new laws mandate videography for victim statements in sexual violence cases and search and seizures, but the lack of sufficient resources for forensic investigations raises questions about their effectiveness.  

Implementation of these complex reforms necessitates substantial infrastructure upgrades, training for stakeholders, and addressing the existing shortage of judges and forensic personnel. Without prioritizing these crucial aspects, the potential benefits of the new laws may not be realized.</description>

			<title>One Nation, One Election promises a more efficient democracy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/one-nation-one-election-promises-a-more-efficient-democracy-9577731/</link>
			<description>India has witnessed a long democratic journey marked by both triumphs and challenges. While the country has made remarkable strides in strengthening its electoral processes, the frequency of elections poses significant drawbacks.

Simultaneous elections, as recommended by the committee headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind, hold immense potential to address these issues. Holding elections for both Lok Sabha and state assemblies concurrently would reduce the burden on administrative resources, limit disruptions to development work, and enhance political stability. The proposal involves constitutional amendments to ensure consistent election schedules and has garnered support from a majority of political parties. Implementable from 2029, one nation, one election, aims to create a more effective, vibrant, and participative democracy, allowing citizens to directly influence their governance.</description>

			<title>Express View on Indus Water Treaty: Tread cautiously</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indus-water-treaty-tread-cautiously-9577695/</link>
			<description>India has issued a notice to Pakistan demanding a review and modification of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).  The dispute centers around India's construction of hydroelectric projects on the Jhelum and Chenab rivers, which Pakistan argues violate the treaty. Despite a ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in favor of India on one project, Pakistan has refused to engage in mediation. India emphasizes its need to develop clean energy as part of its climate action plans, citing the Ratle hydroelectric project as an example. While India maintains its right to utilize the rivers for non-consumptive purposes, the situation highlights the need for cooperation between the two countries to ensure the treaty's longevity in light of evolving circumstances.</description>

			<title>Devdutt Pattanaik writes: Religion and the illusion of equality</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/devdutt-pattanaik-writes-religion-and-the-illusion-of-equality-9577692/</link>
			<description>The concept of equality, often attributed to Abrahamic religions, has significantly shaped modern thought and driven social progress. However, the article explores how the pursuit of equality is increasingly challenged, even in seemingly egalitarian systems. 

It examines various societal structures, including religious practices, social gatherings, and economic systems, where inequality persists despite the ideal of equality. The author argues that human nature is inherently competitive, leading to a desire for status and preference, which manifests in various forms of social stratification.   The article concludes by highlighting the tension between the aspiration for equality and the reality of human behavior, questioning the true meaning and applicability of equality in contemporary society.</description>

			<title>September 20, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Congress MP Expelled</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/september-20-1984-forty-years-ago-congress-mp-expelled-9577698/</link>
			<description>F M Khan, an MP, was expelled from the Congress for protesting against the handling of loyalists. This move is seen as an attempt to stifle a potential uprising from followers of Sanjay Gandhi, who have been sidelined since Rajiv Gandhi took over.  The UN Development Programme in India faces criticism for granting refugee status to three Afghan airline officials who defected.  The Akali Dal plans a march on October 1st to reclaim control of the Golden Temple complex, refusing to accept any government conditions. The Delhi Pradesh Youth Congress is grappling with a leadership crisis, with a convention called to oust the current president.</description>

			<title>In death of young woman in Pune, a wake-up call for India Inc</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/death-young-woman-pune-wake-up-call-india-inc-9577072/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the negative impact of corporate culture in India, drawing parallels with its American counterpart.  It highlights the prevalence of long working hours, fueled by a  "boss culture" and societal acceptance of "putting company first."  The author cites statistics from the International Labour Organisation  showing a significant percentage of Indian employees work over 48 hours a week. 

The article further discusses "quiet quitting" as a coping mechanism among Gen Z workers facing unreasonable pressure. It argues that this unsustainable work culture, which prioritizes endless work over employee well-being, ultimately harms economic growth and the  "demographic dividend." Citing examples from South Korea and Europe, the author advocates for institutional reforms, such as a 40-hour work week and the "right to disconnect," to ensure a healthier and more fulfilling work-life balance for Indian employees.</description>

			<title>Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and beyond — what Indian cities can do to cope with floods</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-bengaluru-chennai-indian-cities-cope-with-floods-9576678/</link>
			<description>Indian cities face increasing risks from flooding, exacerbated by climate change. While infrastructure is crucial, cities need to adapt, requiring both government action and citizen participation. Spatial planning is essential but many Indian cities lack active master plans. This lack of forward-looking planning hinders effective disaster management and limits the capacity to integrate green infrastructure. Citizen participation, vital for successful planning, is often absent due to a lack of recognition for cities as distinct governance units. Ward committees, envisioned in the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, offer a platform for citizen engagement and hold potential for improving disaster preparedness. Devolving governance functions to city governments, as seen in other developing nations, could empower cities to prioritize local needs and enhance resilience against climate change-related disasters.</description>

			<title>Pager attack in Lebanon: Can nations be allowed to cause violence and death using digital techniques?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pager-attack-in-lebanon-violence-digital-techniques-9576343/</link>
			<description>In September 2023, attacks targeting Hezbollah personnel led to fatalities and injuries across Lebanon. Thousands of detonated pagers, followed by explosions in handheld radios, cellphones, and laptops, were attributed to Israeli agencies. This incident raises concerns about supply chain compromises and the growing threat of physical attacks enabled by cyber technology.  

The use of explosives in devices compromised through remote triggers highlights the convergence of physical and cyber warfare.  This attack could signal a dangerous escalation in cyber warfare tactics, blurring the line between digital and physical realms and posing a significant risk to critical infrastructure and global security.  


The incident emphasizes the ongoing need for international cooperation to define cyber warfare norms and establish legal frameworks to prevent such attacks. As technology advances, nations must work together to ensure that digital advancements are not exploited for violence and destruction.</description>

			<title>Express View: Two years of cheetahs in Kuno</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-two-years-of-cheetahs-in-kuno-9575122/</link>
			<description>Two years after reintroducing cheetahs to Kuno National Park, India has a population of 24 of these animals.  While promising, the project faces challenges.  Critics question the decision to introduce African cheetahs instead of the native Asiatic subspecies, and concerns are raised about the lack of transparency surrounding the project. The death of a male cheetah in August has further fueled these concerns and highlighted the need for greater expert input.  The project's goal has shifted from establishing a self-sustaining breeding population to managing a metapopulation through assisted dispersal.   As the project expands to Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary, the authorities face the urgent task of addressing these challenges and ensuring the long-term survival of these reintroduced animals.</description>

			<description>India is concerned about the US sharing strategic information with Pakistan, specifically an incident where the US allegedly informed Pakistan that it couldn't locate Indian Jaguar aircraft. This information was later found to be inaccurate. Tensions exist within the Delhi Congress, with some members criticizing Minister H K L Bhagat's leadership style. In Andhra Pradesh, Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi was removed as pro tem Speaker, and P Mahendranath was appointed in his place.  Separately, the Indian government is requesting a review of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, citing changed circumstances and unresolved disputes.</description>

			<title>How the South outpaced North India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/how-the-south-outpaced-north-india-9575123/</link>
			<description>India's economic landscape has undergone significant transformation over the past six decades.  States like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Punjab, once major contributors to the GDP, have witnessed a decline in their share. In contrast, southern states, alongside Gujarat and Maharashtra, have emerged as economic powerhouses.  

This shift has created a disparity in the distribution of tax revenue, with southern states receiving a smaller share despite their substantial economic contribution. This has led to tension between the central government and these states. 

Concerns also exist regarding the potential impact of the Lok Sabha delimitation exercise, which could alter the representation of southern states in Parliament. Addressing these concerns through balanced federal policies is crucial to maintain a stable and functional system.</description>

			<description>Indian hockey has enjoyed a decade of dominance in Asia, reclaiming the Asian Games title in 2010 and adding another gold, an Olympic bronze, and an Asian Champions Trophy defense in recent years. This success coincides with a decline in other Asian teams, leaving India to focus on competing with global powerhouses like Australia and European nations.  The team, currently in transition, needs to maintain its momentum and improve to reach a higher level. The 2026 World Cup semifinals is a tangible target, with success there potentially indicating progress towards Olympic success in 2028.</description>

			<title>Arvind Kejriwal and hero worship in Indian politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arvind-kejriwal-and-hero-worship-in-indian-politics-9575072/</link>
			<description>Arvind Kejriwal's resignation as Delhi CM can be seen as both a political maneuver and a strategic effort to reshape his image.  

His resignation allows him to counter BJP's attacks and focus on electoral campaigning. It also provides him an opportunity to reassert his image as a morally upright individual fighting against corruption, a narrative crucial to his political style. This strategy plays into the prevalent "saintly" idiom of Indian politics, where leaders present themselves as morally superior to gain legitimacy. 

Kejriwal's resignation aligns with this trend as he portrays himself as a victim of a corrupt system, seeking to reconnect with the "common man" image that resonates with voters.  He aims to leverage this narrative in the upcoming elections and reclaim his positive portrayal despite internal criticisms about the AAP's lack of internal democracy.</description>

			<title>The story of Kamala Harris, caste and an Indian law few know about</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-story-of-kamala-harris-caste-and-an-indian-law-few-know-about-9575105/</link>
			<description>In 1924, R Veerian, a Dalit member of the legislative council in Madras Presidency, protested being barred from a road in his village due to caste restrictions. This incident led to the enactment of the Madras Local Boards Amendment Act in 1926, the first law in India to outlaw untouchability. The law criminalised discriminatory practices and prescribed penalties.  However, the historical significance of Veerian's legislation has been overshadowed, with credit often attributed to Chakravarti Rajagopalachari's 1938 law, which was merely declaratory and lacked penal consequences.</description>

			<description>The article argues against the BJP-led NDA government's push for "One Nation, One Election,"  claiming it's a move to concentrate power and undermine democracy.  The author points out that while elections are crucial for democracy, they are only one aspect.  

The author suggests that the government should address issues like the Model Code of Conduct and election spending through reforms rather than overhauling the entire system. They also warn that "One Nation, One Election" could benefit dominant parties, limit states' ability to hold governments accountable, and weaken  deliberation and responsiveness to citizen needs.</description>

			<description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei's declaration that true Muslims must acknowledge the suffering of Muslims in Gaza, Myanmar, and India has sparked international controversy.  This statement, viewed as an attempt to define a "true Muslim" and assert leadership over the global Muslim community, lacks the mandate associated with historical Islamic leadership roles. 

India has  expressed strong disapproval, particularly regarding  comparisons of the situation of Indian Muslims with the Rohingya crisis and the Palestinian issue. 

The statement has also been criticized for overlooking the plight of other minorities, particularly in Iran itself, where systemic discrimination against unrecognised religious and ethnic groups is prevalent. The Iranian government's actions contradict its pronouncements regarding the suffering of minorities worldwide. 





This incident highlights the complex diplomatic realities India faces, particularly its multifaceted relationships with countries like the US, Israel, Iran, and Russia.  While India strives for de-hyphenated engagement, ill-conceived statements like Khamenei's can destabilize this delicate balance.</description>

			<title>Why Taylor Swift is the perfect PR progressive for the Kamala Harris campaign</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/taylor-swift-perfect-pr-progressive-for-kamala-harris-campaign-9574484/</link>
			<description>The article discusses Taylor Swift's potential political influence, particularly in the context of the 2024 US election. 

It argues that Swift embodies the brand of progressivism within the Democratic party, focusing on domestic issues while largely ignoring foreign policy concerns, such as the war in Gaza. Despite growing public awareness and activism surrounding the conflict, the article suggests that major political figures, including presidential candidates, are downplaying its significance on the campaign trail.  

It criticizes this approach as enabling a narrow, self-absorbed perspective on progressive values that fails to address global issues and the realities of US foreign policy. The article concludes with a warning that ignoring the growing public concern about the war in Gaza could have significant political consequences.</description>

			<title>Talking about caste hasn’t helped – it has just created new inequalities</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/talking-about-caste-hasnt-helped-it-has-just-created-new-inequalities-9573844/</link>
			<description>The article critiques the common understanding of caste as a rigid, hierarchical system. It argues that  real-world practices are more complex, with admixtures and fluidity between castes.  The author points out historical examples like the Nath Panthis and the Yadavs, demonstrating the fluidity of caste identity.

The article further criticizes the political framing of caste as a tool for division and discrimination. It suggests that this approach,  popularized by British census records, obscures the more nuanced realities of caste in India. It  emphasizes that the focus on caste has diverted attention from building robust public institutions that could genuinely address social inequality.  
 
Ultimately, the  article calls for a more nuanced understanding of caste that considers its historical complexities and challenges the simplistic binary of power structures.</description>

			<title>The Third Edit: ‘Lord of the Flies’ completes 70 years. Its message still rings true</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-third-edit-lord-of-the-flies-completes-70-years-its-message-still-rings-true-9573293/</link>
			<description>"Lord of the Flies", William Golding's 1954 debut novel, explores the dark side of human nature through the chilling tale of a group of stranded schoolboys who descend into savagery. Initially facing rejections, the novel's groundbreaking theme – the potential for chaos and moral decay even in innocent children –  eventually found publishing success. The first draft, alongside Golding's personal writings, will be showcased at the University of Exeter to celebrate the book's 70th anniversary. "Lord of the Flies" challenged the optimistic portrayal of children in similar stories, revealing their capacity for both kindness and cruelty, a theme that continues to resonate with readers today.</description>

			<title>How a fertiliser cap can help fuel India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/how-a-fertiliser-cap-can-help-fuel-india-9573292/</link>
			<description>The increasing use of rock phosphate in electric vehicle batteries poses a threat to fertilizer production.  As demand for this raw material grows, less will be available for making phosphorus-based fertilizers. This "food versus cars" dilemma mirrors the "food versus fuel" debate arising from the use of crops for biofuels. India, heavily reliant on fertilizer imports, is particularly vulnerable to this trend.  

Therefore, India needs to prioritize efficient nutrient application in agriculture.  The government should encourage the use of less nutrient-intensive fertilizers and promote good agricultural practices to reduce fertilizer consumption and import dependence.</description>

			<title>Why extending national health insurance scheme to elderly is not enough</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-extending-national-health-insurance-scheme-to-elderly-is-not-enough-9573246/</link>
			<description>The government's decision to extend AB-PMJAY to older adults is a positive step towards mitigating the financial burden of healthcare, especially given the increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases and inadequate social security measures for seniors. However, the allocated budget falls short of the estimated requirement to effectively cover the intended beneficiaries. 

The scheme's focus on secondary and tertiary care excludes essential outpatient services crucial for preventive care and long-term management of chronic conditions. To achieve comprehensive healthy ageing, a substantial increase in public health spending is necessary, coupled with expanded public health infrastructure and a focus on primary healthcare.

The current approach, reliant on insurance-based schemes, risks inflating healthcare costs and neglecting the need for a holistic, integrated approach to senior healthcare, similar to successful models in Canada, Europe, and Australia.</description>

			<title>Chief Minister Atishi</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/chief-minister-atishi-9573247/</link>
			<description>Arvind Kejriwal, the former chief minister of Delhi, is facing challenges to regain his political standing after his recent arrest in a corruption case. With the Delhi assembly elections scheduled for February 2025, Kejiwal is calling for early elections in November, positioning himself as a victim of political persecution. He wants a "certificate of innocence" from the people of Delhi.  However, this strategy has been criticized as a distraction from the AAP government's declining governance record. Despite controlling the Delhi government and the MCD, the AAP has been criticized for neglecting issues like urban decay, waterlogging, and disease outbreaks. Atishi, the new chief minister, faces the challenge of  reviving the government's focus on governance and addressing the pressing needs of Delhi's citizens.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kangana-ranaut-writes-pm-birthday-life-service-nation-9572867/</link>
			<description>Narendra Modi, a central figure in Indian politics, was born in 1950.  He joined the RSS at a young age and became involved in political activism against the Emergency declared by Indira Gandhi in 1975.  Modi joined the BJP in 1985 and rose through its ranks, playing a key role in its 1990s success. 

He was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 and led the BJP to a historic landslide victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, becoming India's Prime Minister. His re-election in 2019 solidified his position as a dominant leader, known for economic reforms, social welfare programs, and a focus on national security. Modi led the BJP to another resounding victory in 2024, securing a third consecutive term as Prime Minister.  His journey, marked by dedication to India's progress and a vision for a "New India," continues to shape Indian politics and society.</description>

			<title>Is ‘The Bear’ a comedy? The Emmys thought so — and we can’t disagree</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bear-comedy-emmys-we-cant-disagree-9572438/</link>
			<description>The 76th Emmy Awards, overshadowed by a previous ceremony earlier in the year, sparked debate about the categorization of "The Bear" as a comedy.  The traditional view of comedy stems from Aristotle's notion of it as an exaggeration of the mundane. Shows like "Seinfeld" and "The Office" fit this mold, but others like "The Sopranos" blur the lines. "The Bear", while intense, utilizes the characters' heightened reactions and the absurdity of their situations to induce humor.  This style of comedy, similar to dark humor found in shows like "Nanette" and "Baby Reindeer",  reframes comedy as a space that can be dark, existential, and tragicomic. Ultimately, the context and our perception determine whether something is funny or tragic.</description>

			<title>Why the case against Wikipedia in India is a challenge to freedom of speech and information</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-case-wikipedia-india-challenge-freedom-speech-information-9572234/</link>
			<description>Wikipedia functions as a collaborative platform where volunteers strive to maintain accurate and neutral information. It relies on a system of sourcing and referencing, demanding verifiable information for all content.  Despite its strengths, Wikipedia acknowledges its limitations, recognizing the potential for bias in sources and the complexities of interpreting information.

The platform actively combats misinformation through a combination of AI-driven tools and a vigilant community of editors who scrutinize edits and engage in discussions to ensure neutrality. 

Recently, a legal challenge against Wikipedia in India raises concerns about freedom of speech and the platform's open editing model. The case highlights the importance of understanding Wikipedia's collaborative nature and its commitment to providing free access to information.</description>

			<title>Ahead of J&amp;K Assembly elections, New Delhi’s latest political gambit — Engineer Rashid</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-and-kashmir-assembly-elections-new-delhi-latest-gambit-engineer-rashid-9572028/</link>
			<description>The political landscape of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has undergone a significant shift since 2014, characterized by new political players and the erosion of established parties. New Delhi has actively engineered this change, favoring parties like Sajad Lone’s People’s Conference and Altaf Bukhari’s Apni Party while isolating the National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The NC, with its deep roots and history, proved more resilient to these tactics. However, the recent entry of Engineer Rashid, released from jail to contest elections, has become a pivotal factor. New Delhi appears to be strategically utilizing Rashid to divide the opposition vote and consolidate its influence in Jammu. His entry into the fray has created an unpredictable political environment, potentially impacting the outcome of upcoming Assembly elections and shaping the future of J&amp;K's politics.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yogendra-yadav-writes-why-its-time-to-stop-the-conspiracy-theories-about-evms-9571458/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India. It argues that the debate has become unproductive, focusing on unfounded suspicions of EVM manipulation rather than addressing more substantial electoral reforms. 

The author points to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where the surprising outcome disproved widespread claims of EVM rigging. They criticize the Election Commission for failing to address concerns about discrepancies in vote counts and delays in declaring turnout figures, which have fueled conspiracy theories. 

The article advocates for a national consensus on EVM reliability, suggesting solutions like voter verification methods and making VVPAT paper slips the official record. It emphasizes the need to shift focus from EVM debates to larger issues like unequal access to state power and media, which pose a greater threat to free and fair elections.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/himanta-biswa-sarma-writes-on-rahul-gandhi-congresss-selective-amnesia-9571466/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi's recent US trip has sparked controversy due to his critical remarks about India's democracy, institutions, and social issues. Critics argue that his statements, made on foreign soil, paint an inaccurate picture of India and risk emboldening separatist movements.  Gandhi's comments about caste-based reservations, wealth inequality, and alleged restrictions on Sikhs have been seen as playing into the narratives of groups like the Khalistanis. His meeting with US Representative Ilhan Omar, who has introduced anti-India resolutions, further raised concerns about his judgment and potential impact on India's image abroad.  
The article argues that Gandhi's rhetoric, while focused on social justice issues, overlooks the complexities of these problems in India and could have detrimental consequences for national unity and stability. The author emphasizes the need for introspection within the INDIA alliance and cautions against complacency on matters of national security and foreign perception.</description>

			<title>Why Tavleen Singh is wrong about Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on elections and caste</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-tavleen-singh-is-wrong-about-rahul-gandhis-remarks-on-elections-and-caste-9571349/</link>
			<description>Tavleen Singh criticizes Rahul Gandhi for questioning the fairness of the 2024 election process. The authors argue that Gandhi's concern stems from genuine issues such as the freezing of Congress bank accounts, the targeting of opposition politicians, and a media landscape influenced by political bias. They draw parallels to the situation in Peru, where media manipulation played a role in consolidating power.  The authors defend Gandhi's call for a socio-economic caste census, pointing out the BJP's previous support for such an endeavor. They also criticize Singh's claim that education alone can solve societal problems, highlighting the persistent barriers faced by marginalized communities in accessing quality education. They conclude by suggesting that Singh's criticism of Gandhi is outdated and fails to recognize the growing public concern over issues like inequality and democratic erosion.</description>

			<title>Why Supreme Court must look into compensation for surrogates</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-supreme-court-must-look-into-compensation-for-surrogates-9571347/</link>
			<description>The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 prohibits payment to surrogates, aiming to prevent exploitation. While this was enacted to address concerns about commodification, it has raised questions regarding the fairness of expecting women to act altruistically.  Advocates argue that women should be compensated for the physical and emotional labor involved in surrogacy, akin to compensation providing for death scenarios. Previous drafts of the Act proposed scheduled payments to address concerns about the sale of children.  However, the transition to a purely altruistic model has faced challenges, with reports of underground arrangements and difficulties for intending parents finding surrogates.  The Supreme Court's stance on the issue of fair compensation for surrogates remains to be seen.</description>

			<title>Express View on women outnumbering men in medicine: Whole numbers, dark truths</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-women-outnumbering-men-in-medicine-whole-numbers-dark-truths-9571393/</link>
			<description>The number of women studying medicine in India has been steadily increasing, closing the gap with male enrollment. This positive trend is evident across all medical fields, including traditionally male-dominated areas like cardiology, oncology, and neurology. Despite this progress, the medical system still lacks adequate support for women doctors. Issues such as sexism, insufficient facilities, and safety concerns remain prevalent. The rise in female medical professionals presents an opportunity to address these issues and create a more inclusive and supportive work environment for all.</description>

			<title>Welfare and not a yearning for popularity is what drives PM Modi, a rare thinker-leader</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/welfare-popularity-pm-modi-rare-thinker-leader-9571008/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's approach to governance is heavily centered around the power of ideas. He utilizes slogans and initiatives that inspire national unity, self-reliance, and progress.  Concepts like "Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat" and "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" aim to motivate citizens while addressing key development priorities. 

Modi emphasizes inclusivity and citizen participation, as seen in slogans like "Sab Ka Sath, Sab Ka Vikas," and "Sab Ka Prayas."  He also promotes a positive outlook, replacing terms like "Most Backward District" with "Aspirational District" to foster hope and inspire growth. 

Beyond slogans, Modi champions practical initiatives like "Swachh Bharat" and "Lifestyle for Environment" to encourage behavioral change and address environmental concerns. His focus on India's cultural heritage, as seen in initiatives like International Yoga Day and International Year of Millets, further demonstrates his commitment to integrating tradition with modernity.</description>

			<title>From iPhone 16 to paying too much for ‘bhutta’ — let’s stop calling our expensive indulgences ‘investments’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/iphone-16-paying-bhutta-stop-calling-expensive-indulgences-investments-9570757/</link>
			<description>This article delves into the concept of paying for extravagant experiences and possessions, using the example of pricey restaurant dishes and Apple product launches.  The author argues that while these items are often marketed as status symbols or investments, they ultimately provide a feeling of indulgence that may not be objectively justifiable. 

The piece draws parallels between the allure of high-end electronics and dining experiences, questioning the perceived value proposition behind such exorbitant prices. It suggests that consumers should be more transparent about their motivations for indulging in luxury, acknowledging that not every purchase or experience needs a deeper, more rational explanation.</description>

			<title>Of cats, cat ladies and Mr Trump</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/of-cats-cat-ladies-and-mr-trump-9570343/</link>
			<description>The article criticizes Donald Trump's claim that Haitian refugees are eating cats and dogs. It humorously explores the logistical absurdity of this scenario, highlighting the challenges of catching, killing, and cooking cats in a society with readily available resources. 

The author argues that the claim reflects poorly on America, suggesting that if individuals are resorting to such measures, it indicates a failure of the nation's social safety net.

The article concludes that the existence of "childless cat ladies" adequately protects cats from harm and satirizes Trump's remarks, implying they are illogical and nonsensical.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/september-16-1984-forty-years-ago-pm-on-governance-9569697/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi affirmed her commitment to the existing parliamentary system of government, acknowledging public interest in discussing alternate systems like the presidential model.

In a separate event, the Information and Broadcasting Minister addressed Doordarshan's silver jubilee, dismissing Opposition claims of unfair coverage while alleging the journalist's question reflected opposition viewpoints. 

An all-party bandh in Andhra Pradesh, demanding the removal of the current government and reinstatement of the previous one, concluded peacefully. Meanwhile, flooding in Assam necessitated Army intervention in rescue and relief efforts.  

A high-ranking official from ISRO expressed his personal belief that there is no life beyond earth, based on current scientific understanding and the absence of evidence for extraterrestrial life.</description>

			<title>Governments should encourage more players in the power sector, not less</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/governments-should-encourage-more-players-in-the-power-sector-not-less-9569701/</link>
			<description>India's shift to competitive bidding for electricity procurement has yielded progress with falling solar and wind tariffs and increased private sector investment. Recent innovations like storage-linked tenders address the intermittency of renewables. The sector's lower entry barriers encourage participation from various players, driving continuous learning and improvement. However, a new trend of composite bidding, combining coal and solar tenders, threatens this positive trajectory.

These large-scale tenders pose challenges for smaller players due to the massive investments required and disadvantage developers lacking thermal power expertise. Concentrating procurement in large composite tenders risks stifling competition, innovation, and the potential for further tariff reductions.  A more diversified, phase-wise approach to procurement, utilizing annual procurement calendars, is recommended to maintain the progress made in the sector.</description>

			<title>Behind Mamata Banerjee’s failure to read the protests, the establishment’s unfamiliarity with its new language</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mamata-banerjee-failure-protests-kolkata-establishment-9569700/</link>
			<description>The article analyzes Mamata Banerjee's political career, focusing on the recent protests in Kolkata sparked by the rape and murder of a junior doctor. It highlights how Banerjee, previously known for her role as an anti-establishment figure, now faces criticism for her handling of the situation. The article contrasts her earlier image as a champion of the masses, who gained strength from her working-class background and outspoken nature, with her current position as the establishment leader, struggling to respond to the changing dynamics of protests and public discourse. 

It discusses Banerjee's ability to connect with the people, particularly the urban intelligentsia and the agrarian population,  and her utilization of media to amplify her message. However, the article argues that her failure to anticipate and effectively address the current crisis reflects a growing disconnect between her and the people. It concludes by questioning whether she can recover from this setback and regain public trust.</description>

			<title>Disbanding of committee on statistics: Undermining credibility, evading questions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/disbanding-of-committee-on-statistics-undermining-credibility-evading-questions-9569699/</link>
			<description>The Indian government disbanded the Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) citing similarity to the Steering Committee for National Sample Surveys. However, this move raises concerns as the committee's dissolution coincides with delays in conducting the decennial Census 2021.  A reliable census is crucial for accurate sample surveys which underpin various economic and social indicators like urbanization, consumption patterns, inflation, and poverty levels. The lack of updated data distorts the statistical framework, impacting policymaking. This incident further erodes the already declining credibility of India's statistical system, drawing attention to its reliability at a time of global economic scrutiny.</description>

			<title>Ashok Gulati writes: Giving farms their due</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ashok-gulati-writes-giving-farms-their-due-9569711/</link>
			<description>The Modi government, despite falling short of its election targets,  remains focused on its policy agenda.  Agriculture and rural development are key priorities.  

The government has announced a new Union Minister with experience in agricultural development, alongside continued funding for the PM-KISAN scheme. They aim to implement seven new schemes totaling Rs 14,000 crore, covering areas like digitalization, climate-resilient agriculture, and rural infrastructure.

Digitalization is seen as crucial, with efforts to better identify farmers, particularly tenants who lack access to credit and benefits.  The government plans to leverage data from various sources to improve efficiency in fertiliser and food subsidies. 

Rural development initiatives include an additional 20 million houses and significant investment in rural roads, aiming to boost the rural economy and create jobs.</description>

			<title>With Rahul Gandhi’s recent comments in the US, Congress has failed Sikhs again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/with-rahul-gandhis-recent-comments-in-the-us-congress-has-failed-sikhs-again-9569715/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi's recent comments about Sikhs in India have been met with disappointment and dismay. The author, a Sikh and a government minister, refutes Gandhi's assertion that Sikhs feel insecure in India, highlighting the deep connection Sikhs have to their homeland. The author criticizes Gandhi for these remarks and draws attention to the 1980s violence against Sikhs under the Congress party, including Indira Gandhi's Operation Blue Star and the subsequent anti-Sikh riots.  

The author contrasts this by pointing to the current BJP government's efforts to support and empower the Sikh community, citing actions such as restoring the names of Sikhs who were blacklisted, facilitating the repatriation of Sikh families from Afghanistan, and acknowledging Sikh heritage.  
The author concludes by condemning Gandhi's remarks as disgraceful and urging him to understand the history of the Congress party's treatment of Sikhs.</description>

			<title>Express View on removal of export curbs on onion and basmati: Restoring balance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-removal-of-export-curbs-on-onion-and-basmati-restoring-balance-9569698/</link>
			<description>The Indian government recently eased export restrictions on onions and basmati rice, coinciding with upcoming elections in key agricultural states. Export duties were reduced, and import duties on vegetable oils were increased. These moves appear driven by both political and economic factors, aiming to bolster farmer incomes and address concerns over food inflation.  Soybean prices have been low, and a good monsoon is expected to yield abundant harvests. The government's agricultural trade policies have primarily favored consumers, with export curbs and import liberalization. Experts recommend a neutral approach, allowing for duty-free imports to manage prices and building buffer stocks.</description>

			<title>From the Opinion Editor: About bun, cream and GST</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bun-cream-gst-nirmala-sitharaman-annapoorna-9569345/</link>
			<description>Businesses continue to face challenges due to the GST's multiple rate structure, as seen in discrepancies like the different tax rates on buns and cream buns. This has led to customer confusion and  businesses experiencing compliance burdens.  

Examples of  rate anomalies include the differing GST on pizza eaten in vs. delivered, and the taxation of milk products. There's also criticism regarding the 18% GST on medical and life insurance.  

The multiple-rate structure increases compliance issues, especially for small and medium enterprises, and raises concerns about rent-seeking and potential litigation. 

While the GST Council has acknowledged the need for rate rationalization, there's been hesitation in making changes. This inaction contrasts with the simpler tax systems adopted by most countries worldwide.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court frees Arvind Kejriwal, but ties his hands</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-frees-arvind-kejriwal-but-ties-his-hands-9568986/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, but imposed controversial conditions. These conditions prevent Kejriwal from visiting his office, holding meetings, or signing official files without the Lieutenant Governor's approval. 

While one judge saw no issue with these restrictions, the other expressed strong reservations, believing they effectively prevent Kejriwal from functioning as Chief Minister. Critics argue that these conditions curtail the will of the Delhi electorate and hinder effective governance. They suggest that the law should evolve and not be bound by rigid interpretations of judicial discipline in the face of constitutional rights. The article raises questions about  the balance between bail conditions and the elected official's ability to serve their constituents.</description>

			<description>The article criticizes the handling of the conflict in Manipur by the Indian government. The author highlights the Prime Minister's refusal to visit the state despite widespread violence and the Home Minister's alleged mismanagement of the situation.  

The conflict has escalated to the point where Manipur is effectively divided into two states, with the Kuki-Zomi and Meitei communities controlling respective areas. The author accuses the Chief Minister of incompetence and calls for his resignation, while blaming the BJP government for exacerbating the situation. They lament the lack of dialogue and government action to address the deep-seated ethnic tensions, concluding that Manipur is trapped in a cycle of violence and mistrust.</description>

			<description>The article critiques Rahul Gandhi's recent trip to the United States, focusing on statements made during his visit.  

The author finds Gandhi's claim that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were rigged to be illogical and hypocritical, given his family's history of alleged electoral manipulation. 

They also criticize Gandhi's assertion that Sikhs in India face restrictions on wearing turbans and kada,  pointing to the inflammatory reaction from a Canadian Khalistani leader.  

The author expresses concern that Gandhi's rhetoric, especially when abroad, undermines the need for a strong opposition in India. They argue that Gandhi should focus his efforts on addressing India's educational shortcomings rather than continuing to dwell on issues like caste reservations.</description>

			<title>Salim-Javed in ‘Angry Young Men’, Yash Chopra and ‘Romantics’: The perils of nostalgia as PR</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/salim-javed-angry-men-romantics-nostalgia-perils-pr-9567433/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the current trend of nostalgia in Indian cinema, citing re-releases of old films and OTT series focusing on Bollywood history. It argues that while nostalgia is a powerful marketing tool, it shouldn't solely focus on declaring certain films "great." 

The article criticizes recent documentaries on Bollywood, claiming they prioritized good PR over in-depth analysis of the subjects' work. Instead, it suggests alternative ways of remembering cinema: through fan communities and by studying the work's influence and reinterpretations. 

The author examines the influence of older films on Salim-Javed's iconic screenplays, using "Deewar's" "mere paas maa hai" scene as an example. This analysis highlights how contemporary filmmakers draw inspiration from the past, reinterpreting classic themes and dilemmas in new contexts. Finally, the article suggests that a future where popular cinema more accurately reflects audience complexities and hypocrisies would resonate more deeply.</description>

Bangladesh presses India to investigate these killings and hold perpetrators accountable. The recent deaths of two Bangladeshi youths, Swarna Das and Jayanta Kumar Singh, have further fueled anger and demands for justice.  Alongside the geopolitical tension, labor unrest has gripped Bangladesh following the fall of the previous government. Factories face protests demanding better wages, working conditions, and other benefits.  There are concerns about  violence and the potential for job losses as a result of the unrest.

Yechury is praised for his organizational abilities, oratory skills, and unwavering belief in social justice. 

The author emphasizes Yechury's contributions to the left movement, his role in drafting ideological documents, and his opposition to communal forces. They acknowledge his impact on the formation of political alliances and his consistent advocacy for the farmers' movement. Yechury's sudden passing leaves a void that is difficult to fill, both politically and personally.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-the-un-the-world-needs-9566522/</link>
			<description>The UN is facing a crisis as it struggles to effectively address contemporary global challenges.  Established after World War II, its structure reflects an era of Western dominance, a reality that has become increasingly problematic as the global power landscape shifts.  

The organization is seen as ineffective in resolving conflicts like those in Ukraine and Gaza, and in addressing issues of food security and climate change. This  paralysis stems from a lack of democratic representation and  the unwillingness of powerful nations to concede their influence.  Some, like India, are calling for a greater voice and say for nations like India in the UN's affairs, raising  questions about the future of the organization itself.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sanjay-jha-writes-why-bjp-is-obsessed-with-rahul-gandhi-and-his-speeeches-9566521/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the perceived shift in the political landscape, where Rahul Gandhi is now seen as more impactful and the BJP as more anxious. The author attributes this to Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, which seems to have transformed his image, and his ability to engage with international audiences and present alternative viewpoints to the state-controlled narrative. The BJP's focus on criticizing Gandhi's interactions abroad, according to the author, highlights their discomfort with his growing influence and their inability to match his open and direct communication style.  

The author contrasts Gandhi's approach with the BJP's increasingly theatrical and divisive politics, arguing that India deserves a more substantive and thoughtful political discourse.</description>

			<title>Gaurav Bhatia writes: In the US, Rahul Gandhi was divisive as usual</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/gaurav-bhatia-writes-in-the-us-rahul-gandhi-was-divisive-as-usual-9566520/</link>
			<description>During his recent US trip, Rahul Gandhi made several controversial statements about India. He accused the Prime Minister of attacking the Constitution, a claim refuted by pointing to the history of the Congress party's own actions. Gandhi also suggested that India is not fair and implied that the BJP government is against the wearing of turbans and visiting gurdwaras, which was seen as disrespectful to the Sikh community. 

He criticized the implementation of Hindi and alleged that India dishonors skilled individuals, ignoring BJP's recognition of such individuals with awards like the Bharat Ratna. Gandhi praised China while remaining silent on the country's human rights violations. He further attacked the RSS, disregarding its role in India's history and social fabric. 



The article concludes by highlighting the BJP's commitment to development, unity, and national interest, contrasting it with Gandhi's alleged divisive rhetoric and disregard for traditions.</description>

			<description>The Indian chess teams are making a strong showing at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, winning their first two matches convincingly.

These young prodigies, led by Gukesh, are considered favorites for gold and are demonstrating their dominance on the world stage.  Garry Kasparov, a former world champion, has even called it an "Indian earthquake" in world chess.</description>

			<title>Arvind Kejriwal’s bail: From Supreme Court, a limited relief</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arvind-kejriwals-bail-from-supreme-court-a-limited-relied-9566516/</link>
			<description>Justice Ujjal Bhuyan's judgment granting bail to Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy case raises concerns about the CBI's  tactics. Justice Bhuyan believes the arrest was illegal and aimed at preventing Kejriwal from obtaining bail in a separate ED case. He criticizes the CBI's reliance on vague grounds for arrest, like evasive replies and lack of cooperation, questioning the practice of using procedure as punishment. 

The judgment highlights the need to reconsider the right against self-incrimination in pre-trial investigations,  referencing the outdated Supreme Court judgment in State v Kathi Kalu Oghad (1961). Justice Bhuyan also condemns the Delhi High Court's insistence on Kejriwal approaching the trial court for bail, emphasizing the judiciary's responsibility to protect personal liberty. Ultimately, the judgment serves as a critique of the criminal justice system, pointing to a worrying trend of courts prioritizing government interests over individual rights in high-profile cases.</description>

			<title>Express View on Kejriwal’s bail: Calling out the Parrot</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-kejriwals-bail-calling-out-the-parrot-9566525/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently reinforced the principle of bail as the norm and jail as the exception, emphasizing the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.  This reassertion is particularly significant given concerns about the misuse of investigative agencies against political opponents. In a recent case involving Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the court granted bail, highlighting the importance of due process and fairness in investigations. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan's judgment went further, criticizing the delay and questionable timing of Kejriwal's arrest, urging the CBI to act as an impartial and uninfluenced agency. The court's stance underscores the delicate balance between state power and individual rights, emphasizing that fairness in investigation is essential to a just legal system.</description>

			<title>Why protesters in Kolkata must talk to Mamata Banerjee</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/why-protesters-in-kolkata-must-talk-to-mamata-banerjee-9566517/</link>
			<description>Doctors in West Bengal are protesting the murder of a colleague at a state-run hospital, demanding justice, increased security, and an end to government intimidation. Their protests, met with accusations and resistance from the state government, have led to a stand-off.  Despite the CM's initial denials and accusations against the protesters, she has now expressed a willingness to negotiate. It is crucial that both sides engage in good faith dialogue to address the doctors' concerns and ensure systemic change within the healthcare system.  The political posturing and unhelpful statements from authorities must be put aside to allow for meaningful conversation and progress.</description>

			<title>September 14, 1984, Forty Years Ago: AP Speaker quits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/september-14-1984-forty-years-ago-ap-speaker-quits-9566519/</link>
			<description>The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly witnessed a dramatic turn as pro tem Speaker M Baga Reddy resigned shortly after the session began to discuss a motion of trust in the Bhaskara Rao ministry. Governor S D Sharma swiftly appointed MIM leader Salahuddin Owaisi as Reddy's successor. Opposition leaders, including N T Rama Rao, viewed this as a conspiracy to avoid a likely defeat for the ruling party. Meanwhile, in Punjab, a bandh was called in response to the killing of innocent passengers by terrorists in Gurdaspur.  Governor K T Satarawala condemned the act and announced financial aid to the families of the victims. The opposition also submitted a memorandum to President Zail Singh demanding the dismissal of the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and restoration of the previous government.</description>

			<title>Atishi writes on Arvind Kejriwal’s bail: The BJP has tried to bury us, but it does not realise — we are seeds</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arvind-kejriwal-bail-atishi-bjp-tried-to-bury-us-9566235/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi excise policy case, questioning the CBI's motives and alleging political interference. The incident highlights the Modi government's alleged weaponization of laws like the PMLA, making it difficult for the accused to secure bail. The AAP has been a target of this "lawfare," with multiple cases against its leaders, but each has largely failed in court. Despite these challenges, the AAP has remained resilient, with its leadership uniting and regaining strength.</description>

			<title>From Ukraine today to India Post-Independence, how fashion can heal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ukraine-to-india-post-independence-how-fashion-can-heal-9566001/</link>
			<description>Creativity, particularly in fashion, has long served as a coping mechanism and a tool for resilience during times of crisis.  The Ukraine Fashion Week, held amidst the ongoing war, exemplifies this by showcasing Ukrainian talent and embedding traditional motifs into designs, asserting cultural identity and providing an outlet for processing the emotional turmoil.  

Historical examples such as Indian cinema after independence and Parisian fashion after World War II demonstrate how fashion movements have helped individuals and societies heal and navigate challenging periods.  In these instances, fashion became a means of unifying people, expressing hope, and reclaiming a sense of dignity.</description>

			<title>Gurugram — where ambition of many swallows the privilege of few</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/gurugram-ambition-swallows-privilege-few-9565945/</link>
			<description>The article contrasts the "noisy set" of aspirational individuals in Gurugram, focused on showcasing wealth and status, with a quieter, more integrated segment comprising migrants who form the city's backbone. 

The author argues that while the noisy set is outwardly prominent, it's the quieter, less privileged group who are more deeply connected to the city's realities and understand its silent workings. This is illustrated through the story of Dhoni, a migrant vegetable vendor who has risen economically and socially despite starting humbly. The piece suggests that Gurugram exemplifies a shift in India, where ambition from diverse backgrounds is reshaping the dynamics of power and privilege.</description>

			<title>Along with James Earl Jones, there were many unsung artists whose work made Darth Vader unforgettable</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/james-earl-jones-many-unsung-artists-who-made-darth-vader-unforgettable-9565582/</link>
			<description>The distinctive voice of Darth Vader, one of cinema's most iconic villains, came about through a collaborative effort involving various individuals. While George Lucas had a clear vision for Vader, the actor David Prowse's natural accent proved different from what was anticipated. James Earl Jones, a renowned stage actor, was ultimately chosen to provide the voice, bringing his deep, resonant tones to the character. Sound designer Ben Burtt further enhanced Vader's sound by experimenting with different audio techniques, such as recording through a scuba tank regulator. This combination of acting talent, technical ingenuity, and creative vision resulted in Vader's unforgettable voice that has captivated audiences for generations.</description>

			<title>Why PM Modi and CJI Chandrachud’s public display of faith is troubling</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-cji-chandrachud-ganesh-puja-9565154/</link>
			<description>The article critiques a public Ganesh puja hosted by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) with the Prime Minister in attendance.  The author argues that this display of religious practice by two high-ranking constitutional officials, particularly in light of the CJI presiding over cases related to the Shiv Sena, raises concerns about the separation of powers and the perception of impartiality within the judiciary. 

The author cites the Supreme Court's stance on secularism and questions the CJI's adherence to his oath of office, which mandates  neutrality and impartiality.  Several probing questions are posed regarding the motivations behind the event and potential implications for public trust in the judiciary.</description>

			<title>PM Modi and CJI Chandrachud’s display of faith is personal, not political</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-and-cjis-display-of-faith-is-personal-not-political-9564740/</link>
			<description>Ganesh Chaturthi, a major festival celebrated across India, symbolizes unity and new beginnings. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice of India, D Y Chandrachud, participating in a puja together at the CJI's residence reflects the harmonious functioning of Indian institutions and the personal interactions common in Indian democracy. This act of sharing faith has faced criticism from some quarters who lack understanding of Indian traditions.  Such interactions are not new and instances of judges and politicians engaging personally have occurred before without causing concern. Attempts to politicize such personal choices are unwarranted and undermine the strength of Indian institutions based on dialogue and debate rather than confrontation.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/derek-obrien-writes-how-direct-benefit-transfer-empowers-women-9564741/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the underrepresentation of women in India's workforce and highlights Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) as a potential tool to empower them. It points out that while DBT has proven beneficial in providing financial autonomy to women, its political impact varies. 

The effectiveness of DBT schemes in influencing election outcomes is examined through examples from different states. The article argues that a national DBT scheme targeted at women could significantly improve their socio-economic status and address the concerning gender disparities in India. 


It concludes by referencing the praise received by India's DBT programs from both governmental and international bodies.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manipur-violence-meiteis-kukis-9564735/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the ongoing conflict in Manipur, highlighting the government's inaction and indifference towards the escalating violence. It points to the BJP's role in exacerbating the conflict through its majoritarian policies and  opportunistic alliances that have crumbled under its own weight. The article questions the lack of clarity in the chain of command in Manipur, with security advisor seemingly operating without direct accountability to the Chief Minister. 

It criticizes the media for overlooking the Manipur crisis and the government for its mishandling of security operations. The piece further analyzes the BJP's strategy of using the conflict to justify increased authoritarianism and redirect blame to external conspiracies. The escalating ethnic tensions and the government's persistent failure to address the root causes of the conflict pose a serious threat to the stability of the region.</description>

			<description>The expansion of  Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) to cover senior citizens above 70 is a positive step towards universal healthcare in India. This move will benefit around six crore individuals  but  more comprehensive changes in welfare policies are needed to address the growing elderly population.  Despite the scheme's success in providing hospital coverage, challenges remain, including out-of-pocket expenses and reports of doctors bypassing the scheme. To improve the scheme's effectiveness,  the government should focus on addressing these issues and ensuring adequate healthcare facilities for the elderly.</description>

			<description>B-Girl Raygun, who faced online criticism for her Olympics performance, is now the world's top ranked woman breaker, according to the World DanceSport Federation. This ranking is due to a smaller pool of competitors in the past year, as many top breakers focused on Olympic preparation. Raygun won the Oceania Continental Championships, securing her position. Although her reign is temporary, it offers some validation after the negative online attention.  Her story highlights the fleeting nature of success and failure, especially in the digital age where viral moments are quickly replaced.</description>

			<description>Sitaram Yechury, the late general secretary of the CPM, was a key figure in Indian communist politics.  Known for his pragmatism, Yechury advocated for issue-based alliances, including with the Congress, recognizing the need to adapt communist ideology to the changing political landscape of India.  He was a strong advocate for addressing caste inequality, a topic often neglected by hardline communists.  Yechury also possessed a unique ability to build bridges across political divides, known for his affability and willingness to engage with both friends and rivals, a quality sorely lacking in contemporary politics.  His clear ideology, tactical acumen, and personality made him a vital leader for both his party and the broader opposition coalition.</description>

While the festival welcomes a Gen-Z friendly lineup with artists like Zedd and John Summit, the absence of  rock and metal acts is lamented by long-time fans of the genre. Indian artists like Niladri Kumar, Sahil Vasudeva,  and hip-hop acts like Hanumankind and Raftaar x Kr$na also feature. However, the lack of international and Indian rock and metal artists is a disappointment, especially considering the genre's history with Lollapalooza.</description>

			<title>The wisdom of mothers: From Saroj Devi, Neeraj Chopra’s mother, to Uma Mishra, bereaved mother of Aryan Mishra, why love is the resistance we need</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mothers-saroj-devi-neeraj-chopra-uma-mishra-love-resistance-9563488/</link>
			<description>This article examines the reactions of two mothers, Uma Mishra and Saroj Devi, to recent events involving their sons. Uma's son Aryan was killed by self-styled "cow vigilantes," highlighting the normalization of violence against Muslims. Saroj's son Neeraj Chopra, an Olympic medalist, lost to Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem in a recent competition. Despite the tension between India and Pakistan, Saroj expressed pride in both her son and Nadeem, rejecting divisive narratives. 

The author draws parallels to the strength and resilience of women in India who have led protests against injustice, such as the farmers' demonstrations and the Shaheen Bagh protests.  These women have shown the power of love and unity in the face of hate and division. The article concludes by urging the "silent majority" to follow their lead and resist the prevailing culture of violence and intolerance.</description>

			<title>Harris-Trump presidential debate and two classic American stories</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/harris-trump-presidential-debate-and-two-classic-american-stories-9562902/</link>
			<description>The presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump saw Harris perform confidently, effectively addressing key issues and distancing herself from President Biden's policies. Trump, on the other hand, relied on his usual tactics of superlatives and attacks on his opponent's character, but failed to convincingly counter Harris's arguments. 

The debate highlighted the contrasting narratives of the US political spectrum, with Harris representing a liberal, inclusive vision and Trump embodying a conservative, nationalist one. Harris  emphasized the rule of law and social justice, while Trump appealed to traditional values and economic anxieties.  

Though the debate's impact on voting behaviour remains uncertain, it served to establish Harris as a capable debater capable of standing up to Trump's aggressive style.</description>

			<title>Why inequality between South and West India, and North and East could grow – and the dangers that carries</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-inequality-between-south-and-west-india-and-north-and-east-could-grow-and-the-the-dangers-that-carries-9562898/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the economic disparity between the richer southern and western states of India and the poorer northern, central, and eastern states. It highlights that despite possible efforts for convergence,  the gap might widen based on current trends. 

The south's success is attributed to historical factors, government policies, and market forces, fostering a skilled workforce, manufacturing base, service ecosystem, and infrastructure. However, the article argues that the growth pattern is not likely to change drastically in 15 years. The potential consequences include increased migration, infrastructure strain in rich cities, demands for reservation, and populist government policies. 


The situation calls for government intervention to address structural impediments in less developed regions, though the article acknowledges the challenge of achieving substantial change in a short timeframe.</description>

			<title>Suhas Palshikar writes: Why Manipur seems so far away</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/suhas-palshikar-writes-why-manipur-seems-so-far-away-9562880/</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the Indian government's handling of the ongoing violence in Manipur. It argues that the government's inaction and distorted view of state power, along with its flawed Hindu nationalist ideology, have exacerbated the situation.

The author points to a pattern of non-response to crises, from the CAA-NRC protests to the farmers' agitation, highlighting the government's reliance on repression and manipulation of public perception.  Furthermore, the article contends that the government's definition of "state" prioritizes a symbolic image of strength over actual governance and fails to address internal challenges or safeguard the interests of diverse communities.

The author concludes by stating that the government's Hindutva-based nationalism, which pits Hindus against non-Hindus, has further alienated communities and contributed to the violence in Manipur.  The crisis in Manipur, therefore, represents a failure of the government's governance model, its understanding of statehood, and its vision of a truly inclusive nation.</description>

			<title>Express View on Indian workers: Fill the skill gap</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indian-workers-fill-the-skill-gap-9562882/</link>
			<description>An investigation revealed that Indian workers sent to Israel to address a labor shortage were facing skill mismatches, leading some to return home and others to be redeployed.  Despite this challenge, the surge in global demand for Indian labor, particularly in areas like construction and healthcare, presents a significant opportunity.  

To effectively capitalize on this demand, India needs to focus on bridging the skill gap by providing vocational and technical training that aligns with market needs.  The focus should be on improving the entire training ecosystem, including institutes, trainers, and curriculum.  Adapting successful models like Sri Lanka's pre-departure training for overseas workers could be beneficial.</description>

			<title>Making India a start-up nation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/making-india-a-start-up-nation-9562903/</link>
			<description>India's economy has experienced rapid growth fueled by factors like UPI, telecom revolution, and the pandemic. With a large and young population, and a growing startup ecosystem, India aims to achieve ambitious economic goals by 2047. 

However, creating sufficient employment opportunities for the burgeoning workforce is crucial.  

The article suggests that fostering entrepreneurship, particularly among graduates of higher education institutions, could significantly contribute to job creation. Citing successful models in the US and UK, it emphasizes the need for academia-industry collaboration and a shift in mindset towards prioritizing entrepreneurship as a key metric for success in higher education.  India needs to increase its R&amp;D expenditure and promote a synergistic approach integrating education, entrepreneurship, and employment to achieve its economic aspirations.</description>

			<description>The US presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was a psychological battle where Harris emerged as the stronger candidate. She effectively defended her record while attacking Trump's positions on key issues like abortion rights. Harris skillfully avoided direct criticism of President Biden while promoting her vision for a new generation of leadership. 

Her confident performance has shifted the dynamics of the race, making it more competitive. While the debate lacked substance on policy, voters were likely impressed by Harris's personality and composure.</description>

			<title>Why women of my generation both admire and envy the young Vinesh Phogat</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-women-my-generation-admire-envy-young-vinesh-phogat-9562159/</link>
			<description>This article reflects on the changing landscape of female empowerment in India, using Vinesh Phogat's entry into politics as a case study.  The author, drawing parallels to the transformative experiences of women in politics and sports, applauds Phogat's courage and the societal shift towards accepting women's strength. It recounts the initial challenges Vinesh Phogat faced due to a history of sexual assault allegations against the former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.  

The article contrasts Phogat's grit and unwavering support with Singh's frustrated attempts to discredit her, highlighting the growing acceptance of women's physical prowess and political ambition. While acknowledging the journey towards fully embracing women's strength across all segments of society is ongoing, the author views Phogat's political debut as a significant turning point in India's democratic history.</description>

He was dropped from the national team in 1987 despite his achievements, leading him to switch careers. He believes the article's argument holds true for many athletes in India who face limited opportunities and support.  He highlights the contrast between the US's strong university sports system and the shortcomings of Indian sports federations, often run as personal fiefdoms.  He expresses hope for the Khelo India system, urging it to provide support for athletes who don't reach the top level.</description>

			<title>US Presidential debate: Why Donald Trump had no chance before a Kamala Harris who had done her homework</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-kamala-harris-winner-9561597/</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris's campaign strategy centers around contrasting herself with both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. During the debate, she positioned herself as a more composed and informed alternative to Trump, highlighting his outbursts and lack of policy specifics. 

While Harris successfully distanced herself from Biden's legacy, she struggled to articulate clear policy stances on several key issues like fracking, the Israel-Gaza conflict, and climate change.  Her answers on these topics were often vague or directed attacks at Trump. 

Ultimately, Harris's campaign may hinge on her image as a more stable and knowledgeable leader compared to Trump's chaotic and controversial persona. The narrative of a mixed-race daughter of immigrants defeating a wealthy, white billionaire may resonate with voters and propel her to victory.</description>

			<title>India’s Digital Public Infrastructure: How to ensure healthy competition</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-digital-public-infrastructure-how-to-ensure-healthy-competition-9561138/</link>
			<description>India has successfully implemented Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), with transformative initiatives like Aadhaar, UPI, and CoWIN. 

DPIs, categorized as foundational and sectoral, provide a platform for innovation and public-private partnerships. However, this platform-like structure can lead to market concentration and monopolies, as seen in the UPI payment system.

To mitigate these risks, India's G20 task force emphasizes the need for regulatory frameworks that ensure fair competition and address data privacy, security, and interoperability.

Concerns remain regarding data usage, innovation, and risk-reward sharing in DPI projects.  A balanced approach is needed to protect public interest while fostering private innovation, potentially using a combination of soft law guidelines and more rigid regulations for specific aspects.</description>

			<title>Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh: A poet of his times – and ours</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/gajanan-madhav-muktibodh-a-poet-of-his-times-and-ours-9561136/</link>
			<description>Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh, a prominent Hindi poet and critic, died at the age of 46 in 1964. Though he  published posthumously, his poetry gained widespread acclaim. His works often explored complex themes like Marxism, Gandhian ideals, Indian tradition, and the tensions of the Nehruvian era. Muktibodh's poetry is known for its length, intricacy, and unflinching portrayal of societal issues.  He served as both a witness and participant in the realities of his time. 

Muktibodh's work transcended its era, resonating with contemporary concerns about violence, injustice, and the erosion of conscience. His poetry, characterized by surreality and a blend of social and moral commentary, continues to inspire generations of writers and critics. Considered a unique figure in Hindi poetry, Muktibodh's legacy lies in his profound explorations of the human condition and his unwavering commitment to social responsibility.</description>

			<description>A protest in Kolkata sparked by the rape and murder of a junior doctor has escalated into a nationwide movement demanding justice and women's safety.  The movement, notable for its spontaneity and widespread participation,  has surpassed calls for justice in a single case, addressing broader gender-based inequities and exposing a perceived "dark underbelly" within the otherwise popular government of West Bengal. 

The government's handling of the case has been criticized, particularly its decision to reward the college principal. A loss of public trust, fueled by accusations of inefficiency and a potential cover-up, has amplified public anger.  While political elements may be involved in some instances, the majority of protesters have rejected attempts to politicize the movement, demanding direct action from the government.  


This wave of protests signifies a significant reclaiming of women's space in public life, demonstrating their collective strength and resolve.</description>

			<description>Modern dating often feels impersonal, relying on algorithms and quick judgments. In contrast, hobby apps like Strava and Letterboxd are emerging as unexpected platforms for finding romance.  These apps allow individuals to connect over shared passions before considering romantic possibilities, fostering genuine connections based on mutual interests. While traditional dating apps can be stressful and superficial, hobby apps offer a more organic and authentic approach to meeting people, blurring the lines between friendship and romance. This trend reflects a desire for genuine connections and a return to real-life interactions, moving beyond the confines of the digital world.</description>

			<title>Express View on suicide prevention: Pull back from the edge</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-suicide-prevention-pull-back-from-the-edge-9561119/</link>
			<description>1.71 lakh people died by suicide in India in 2022, marking the highest rate ever recorded. A new Lancet study emphasizes that focusing solely on individual risk factors, while important, is insufficient to tackle this global public health crisis.  

The study calls for a broader approach that considers social determinants like poverty, healthcare access, and cultural values, as well as commercial factors like the alcohol and firearm industries.  The study highlights examples like the US, where a minimum wage increase correlated with fewer suicide deaths. India's high suicide rates, particularly among farmers, daily-wage laborers, and students, necessitate a comprehensive policy response that addresses these underlying issues.</description>

The council has deferred decisions on tax rates for health and life insurance, intending to address this issue in November after a Group of Ministers report.  

The council must also decide on the future of the GST compensation cess, which was originally intended to compensate states for revenue loss but could be repaid earlier than projected.  Rate rationalization, potentially merging the 12% and 18% tax slabs, is also on the agenda.</description>

			<title>C Raja Mohan writes: India’s role in peacemaking in Ukraine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-indias-role-in-peacemaking-in-ukraine-9561126/</link>
			<description>As peace efforts around Ukraine gain momentum, India is considering a more active role in peacemaking. While India supports peace and diplomacy, it's crucial to understand the limitations. The US holds significant power in shaping a new European security order, with negotiations ultimately determining the outcome. Several factors suggest a possible new peace dynamic:

* Russia and Ukraine understand that the US holds the key to peace.
* A new round of peace talks is being coordinated by Switzerland. 
* The EU, despite internal divisions, recognizes the need for negotiations and is willing to consider compromises.

India should focus on managing the geopolitical consequences of the war, which will undoubtedly reshape global and regional orders. A restoration of peace in Europe, coupled with a new understanding between Russia and the West, would be the most beneficial outcome for India's economic and security interests.</description>

			<title>The problem with India’s political thought comes from Delhi — and being away from the people</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-political-thought-problem-delhi-9560302/</link>
			<description>The article argues that vibrant political thought stems from addressing the everyday concerns of ordinary people. It proposes a model of India's political structure characterized by a concentration of power at the Centre, a limited role for states, and a decline in the intellectual capacity of the citizenry.  

This structure, the author contends, hinders the ability to tackle basic material problems like delayed public buses, dwindling groundwater, and the impact of pan-national business on local economies.  The author calls for decentralization, a revival of intellectual pursuits, and improved engagement between the people, institutions, and the government to foster genuine political thought and action in India.</description>

			<title>Ananya Pandey’s ‘Call Me Bae’ and Uorfi Javed’s ‘Follow Kar Lo Yaar’: Anyone can be a star</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ananya-pandey-call-me-bae-uorfi-javed-follow-kar-lo-yaar-9560295/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent releases of two web series, "Follow Kar Lo Yaar" featuring Uorfi Javed and "Call Me Bae" with Ananya Pandey, highlighting the democratization of showbiz through digital platforms.  It contrasts the backgrounds of the two actresses, Javed, an outsider who rose to fame through social media and outlandish appearances, and Pandey, a star kid with a privileged upbringing and established Bollywood connections. 

The article explores how both actresses, despite their different paths, navigate the pressures and aspirations of the entertainment industry, aiming for success and recognition. Javed aspires to reach Shah Rukh Khan-level fame, while Pandey seeks to connect with a wider audience on social media. The overlapping themes of ambition, struggle, and the pursuit of success in the Mumbai entertainment landscape are emphasized, presenting a glimpse into the lives of these contemporary celebrities.</description>

			<title>Abhaya. Nirbhaya. Tilottama. Damini. Amanat: What the names given to rape victims say about us</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rape-victims-given-nams-nirbhaya-abhaya-rg-kar-kolkata-case-9559621/</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the media's practice of giving symbolic names to rape victims like Abhaya and Nirbhaya. While well-intentioned, these names serve to distance us from the reality of the horrific violence committed against these women.  

The author argues that these chosen names allow us to avoid introspection about our societal role in perpetuating sexual objectification and failing to protect women.  The article highlights the irony that these names, intended to inspire courage, ironically make some fathers more fearful for their daughters.  It concludes by suggesting that the anonymity of the "unknown soldier" allows for a more universal empathy, while naming the victim retroactively imposes undue symbolic weight on a tragedy that should simply be about justice.</description>

			<title>India’s unwillingness to give asylum to Bangladeshi Hindus signals a policy shift</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-unwillingness-to-give-asylum-to-bangladeshi-hindus-signals-a-policy-shift-9559192/</link>
			<description>India's decision to permit Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina safe passage while denying refuge to persecuted Bangladeshi Hindus creates a disconcerting dilemma. This contradicts India's established position as a refuge for persecuted Hindus, particularly given the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in 2019. 

Despite reports of numerous attacks against minority groups in Bangladesh post-August 5, including deaths and threats, India has opted to form a monitoring committee instead of extending asylum. This stance deviates from India's historical humanitarian record of hosting refugees, exemplified by its welcoming of East Pakistani refugees during the 1971 liberation struggle. The limited current number of Bangladeshi refugees seeking asylum pales in comparison to previous instances, making the current policy shift particularly perplexing.  This hardened stance on refugees raises concerns about its potential humanitarian consequences and impact on India's international image.</description>

			<title>The Anusandhan National Research Foundation aims to make India a knowledge-driven economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-anusandhan-national-research-foundation-aims-to-make-india-a-knowledge-driven-economy-9559203/</link>
			<description>The operationalisation of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a significant milestone for India's research landscape. 
The foundation aims to bridge the infrastructure gap in universities and promote research by streamlining funding processes, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and fostering industry-academia collaborations.  ANRF's focus on supporting lower Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) research in academia complements the government's efforts in funding higher TRL research through Focused Research Organisations (FROs) and deep-tech startups. Drawing inspiration from models like the US National Science Foundation, ANRF seeks to create a vibrant ecosystem for high-risk, cutting-edge research and foster technology transfer, ultimately positioning India as a knowledge-driven economy.</description>

			<title>How Swachh Bharat Mission advanced progress on safety and dignity, health and economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-swachh-bharat-mission-advanced-progress-on-safety-and-dignity-health-and-economy-9559189/</link>
			<description>The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), launched in 2014 with the ambitious goal of eliminating open defecation by 2019, has achieved significant success. The mission, driven by Prime Minister Modi's leadership, resulted in the construction of over 100 million household toilets and successfully transitioned over 550 million Indians to using these facilities. A recent study published in Nature validates the SBM's positive health impact, attributing the saving of 60,000-70,000 infant and child lives annually to the program.


Beyond health benefits, the SBM brought about economic advantages, improved the dignity and security of women and girls, and spurred a sense of national pride. 

The program's success has been widely recognized globally, with its "four Ps" framework – political leadership, public financing, partnerships, and people's participation – being adopted as a model for implementing transformative development initiatives in the sanitation sector worldwide.</description>

			<title>The Third Edit: What he meant to say — Sanewashing Donald Trump’s speeches</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-third-edit-what-he-meant-to-say-sanewashing-donald-trumps-speeches-9559095/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the phenomenon of "sanewashing," where media outlets  tend to reframe or justify the often illogical and inflammatory rhetoric of politicians, particularly Donald Trump. 

Critics argue that this practice distorts reality and fails to hold politicians accountable for their words, potentially misleading the public. The article questions the ethical implications of sanitizing political speech and whether it serves the public good in a post-truth era.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yogendra-yadav-writes-the-books-our-children-need-9559204/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the rise of quality children's literature in India. The author acknowledges a past dearth of engaging and well-produced Indian children's books compared to Western counterparts, but celebrates the emergence of a new wave of independent publishers producing innovative and culturally relevant content. 

The author highlights the work of  publishers like Tulika, Ektara, Katha, and Pratham, praising their efforts to diversify genres, improve production quality, and cater to a wider readership.  The article emphasizes the importance of expanding access to these books, urging parents to prioritize Indian titles, encourage reading in mother tongues, and support authors and illustrators. The author suggests government intervention, public library development, and philanthropic support as crucial steps to solidify this positive trend and ensure a richer future for Indian children's literature.</description>

			<title>Why a noisy classroom must not be silenced</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-a-noisy-classroom-must-not-be-silenced-9559194/</link>
			<description>The article critiques the growing culture of agreement in academia, arguing that it stifles intellectual discourse and dissent. The author, drawing parallels with pedagogical practices and societal norms, suggests that this emphasis on harmony has led to a suppression of "noise," which is essential for critical thinking and productive debate. This "agreementative" approach, the author contends, prevents genuine conversation and understanding with those who hold differing views, ultimately hindering intellectual and social progress. The author calls for a return to a more robust and challenging environment where disagreement is valued and encouraged.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/september-10-1984-forty-years-ago-shoot-at-sight-orders-in-hyderabad-9559184/</link>
			<description>Hyderabad faced severe communal violence during the Ganesh immersion procession, prompting the Army to be deployed and shoot-at-sight orders to be issued. A curfew remains in effect. The Janata Party released a "White Paper" condemning the Indian government's practice of toppling non-Congress state governments, calling it a constitutional subversion.  The agenda for the crucial Andhra Pradesh Assembly session is yet to be finalized, with no notice received for a proposed vote of confidence motion.  In the Delhi University Students Union election, the Janata Vidhyarthi Morcha secured victory for the fifth consecutive year. &lt;/ &gt;</description>

			<title>Signboard warnings in Uttarakhand: When state abdicates responsibility to uphold rule of law</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/signboard-warnings-in-uttarakhand-when-state-abdicates-responsibility-to-uphold-rule-of-law-9559133/</link>
			<description>Recent warning signs in Uttarakhand targeting "non-Hindus/Rohingya Muslims"  highlight a concerning rise in intolerance and the state's failure to uphold the rule of law. Incidents like the 2023 "love jihad" protests in Purola demonstrate how these tensions persist even after a period of seeming normalcy, fueled by divisive rhetoric and the government's inaction. The passing of the Uniform Civil Code has further deepened anxieties, creating an environment where hate speech and violence are increasingly tolerated.  It is crucial that the state government takes immediate action to address these threats, ensuring the safety and security of all its citizens and reaffirming its commitment to constitutional values.</description>

			<title>The message from Jawhar Sircar’s resignation that Mamata Banerjee, TMC refuse to heed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-message-from-jawhar-sircars-resignation-that-mamata-banerjee-tmc-refuse-to-heed-9559164/</link>
			<description>Jawhar Sircar's resignation highlights the Trinamool Congress's and Mamata Banerjee's failure to listen to criticism, particularly regarding the handling of the doctor rape and murder case at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital.  The government's response has been inadequate, focusing on allegations of a "conspiracy" rather than addressing the calls for justice and institutional reforms.   Instead of engaging with protesters and offering a roadmap for change, Banerjee's accusations further alienate the public and contradict the party's image of being a champion for women and their safety. The rushed "Aparajita Woman and Child" bill, proposing the death penalty, is seen as a superficial response that fails to address the deeper issues surrounding women's safety and access to public spaces in West Bengal.</description>

			<title>In politics as in films, Kangana Ranaut is a disruptor charting her own course</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kangana-ranaut-politics-films-disruptor-charting-her-course-9558181/</link>
			<description>Kangana Ranaut is a Bollywood actor known for her disruptive and confrontational nature.  She has challenged the industry's norms, speaking out against nepotism and abusive relationships.  Despite her success, she has faced backlash and criticism for her outspoken views.

Ranaut's foray into politics has also been controversial.  aligning herself with the right-wing, she has spoken out against various political figures and movements. However, she has recently faced setbacks due to the release delay of her film "Emergency", highlighting the political pressures she is navigating. 

Ranaut's journey demonstrates her resilience and willingness to challenge the status quo, but it also raises questions about the costs of such resistance in both the film industry and politics.</description>

			<title>Aryan Mishra’s killing: Is the ideology being protected by the gau rakshak worth the price?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aryan-mishras-killing-is-the-ideology-being-protected-by-the-gau-rakshak-worth-the-price-9558024/</link>
			<description>The death of Aryan Mishra, allegedly killed by "gau rakshaks", raises concerns about the dangerous normalization of violence by groups with alleged links to the police.  These individuals, often referred to as protectors, are not vigilantes but essentially function as subcontracted law enforcement, blurring the lines between official and unofficial authority. The questioning of due process, where instant justice takes precedence over legal procedures, is further highlighted by Mishra's death, mirroring a disconcerting trend of extrajudicial killings across the country. The incident also exposes the dangerous undercurrent of religious prejudice, with the suspected killer expressing regret for killing a Brahmin, implying discrimination against Muslims. This tragic event compels a critical examination of the ideology these "gau rakshaks" purportedly protect and whether the price is too high.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-raise-a-boy-modernity-patriarchy-9557799/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the pervasive nature of patriarchy in Indian society, highlighting its insidious presence even in seemingly innocent aspects of life.  The author shares a personal anecdote about his son's initial exposure to gender stereotypes through a children's book illustration. This experience sparked a conversation about societal expectations and the need to challenge them. 

The author emphasizes that patriarchy starts at home and permeates various aspects of life, from unequal inheritance to double standards for women's behavior. He stresses the importance of educating the younger generation about these issues and promoting gender equality. The article concludes with a call to overcome societal conditioning and embrace a more equitable future.</description>

			<title>Learning from the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/learning-from-the-success-of-the-swachh-bharat-mission-9557184/</link>
			<description>A study published in Nature found that the construction of over 11 crore household latrines under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has saved an estimated 60,000-70,000 infant lives annually. The decline in open defecation, facilitated by the subsidized provision of toilets, has significantly reduced the incidence of water and food contamination, leading to lower rates of infant and child mortality. 

The study highlights the crucial role of sanitation in improving child health outcomes, alongside efforts to ensure universal access to safe drinking water.  Sustained national sanitation programs, like SBM, coupled with initiatives like the Jal Jeevan Mission, have the potential to further reduce stunting and wasting in children by addressing the root causes of malnutrition.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manoj-kumar-jha-writes-government-is-not-the-nation-9557245/</link>
			<description>This article explores the concept of patriotism in India, particularly in light of recent political developments. The author argues that true patriotism is rooted in the values of the freedom struggle: truth, non-violence, liberty, inclusiveness, and progress. These values, enshrined in the Constitution, define a nation built on diversity and the principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.  

The author criticizes the current government's use of nationalism as a tool for division and control, warning against conflating love for the government with love for the nation. They emphasize that holding the government accountable and questioning its actions are essential aspects of patriotism, as is protecting the nation's foundational values. The article concludes by urging citizens to recognize the dangers of majoritarianism and to actively safeguard the ideals that make India a truly inclusive and progressive nation.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-we-mean-by-good-digital-public-infrastructure-9557241/</link>
			<description>India has achieved significant progress in financial inclusion through its digital public infrastructure (DPI), serving as a model for other nations.  The Citizen Stack, built on the success of India Stack, acts as a certifying body for DPIs, ensuring they meet high standards of quality, security, and inclusivity.  

To define a "good DPI," Citizen Stack has established five guiding principles: upholding the citizen's relationship with the market and the state, safeguarding citizen empowerment and privacy, preventing lock-in by monopolies, ensuring techno-legal regulation, and fostering public-private innovation. Citizen Stack emphasizes a holistic approach to DPIs, prioritizing public good and ethical technology use.</description>

			<description>S P Malaviya, secretary of Lok Dal, opposed the proposed alliance of non-communist parties against the Congress (I) in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Despite this, the party president, Charan Singh, was engaged in discussions with leaders of various parties. Assam Chief Minister Hiteshwar Saikia and his cabinet colleagues met with Home Minister P V Narasimha Rao to discuss the Election Commission's plan to use the 1971 electoral rolls for voter list revision.  

F M Khan, a Congress (I) member, claimed that many party MPs were unhappy with "opportunists" taking control of the party. Meanwhile, in Andhra Pradesh, reports of a revolt against N T Rama Rao prompted a close aide to investigate the situation.</description>

			<title>Vandita Mishra writes: In the Modi government’s third term so far, signs of politics opening up, and remaining frozen</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/modi-government-third-term-politics-9557090/</link>
			<description>The 2024 election results have led to a more balanced political landscape, pushing the ruling government to adopt a less authoritarian approach.  The Supreme Court has shown signs of institutional pushback, affirming individual rights and condemning practices like "bulldozer justice."  

Within the BJP, there are visible cracks with the RSS chief seemingly challenging PM Modi's stance.  Additionally, the party is facing internal struggles due to ticket distribution complexities in the upcoming Haryana elections. However, concerns remain as the Court's authority on hate crimes appears weak, exemplified by the recent assault on a Muslim man on a train.  Police inaction and the escalating climate of impunity fueled by vigilantism pose a threat to social harmony. The government's silence on these issues further compounds the concern.</description>

			<title>Express View on film about the Emergency: Let it play</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-film-about-the-emergency-let-it-play-9556412/</link>
			<description>The film "Emergency", directed by Kangana Ranaut who portrays Indira Gandhi, has been embroiled in controversy since its trailer release. Despite initial clearance by the CBFC with minor modifications, objections from Sikh groups and a PIL seeking a ban have arisen. While the film's quality is not the primary concern, the incident raises questions about the CBFC's role as a tool for political censorship, especially given the government's focus on commemorating the Emergency as a violation of democratic principles.  The incident echoes the banning of "Kissa Kursi Ka", a satirical film about Indira and Sanjay Gandhi, highlighting the danger of silencing dissenting voices through censorship.</description>

			<title>‘IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack’: Why Bollywood gets intelligence and security work so wrong</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-why-bollywood-gets-security-work-so-wrong-9556307/</link>
			<description>The hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 in 1999 was a significant blow to India's intelligence and security. While the involvement of Pakistan's ISI and the terrorist group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM) was evident, Indian intelligence failed to prevent the hijacking due to temporary loss of valuable assets and insufficient anticipation of Pakistan's strategy. The hijacking highlighted vulnerabilities in India's security apparatus and exposed the reality of Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan under the Taliban. 
The Netflix series "IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack" distorts the events by suggesting involvement of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, despite no evidence to support these claims. The series also depicts inaccurate details about the role of R&amp;AW and the presence of specific terrorists among the hijackers.  The incident underscores the need for accurate historical accounts and wider access to information from retired intelligence personnel.</description>

			<title>Inside Track: Perception test</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/inside-track-perception-test-9555723/</link>
			<description>While the BJP has secured a strong majority in the recent election, Prime Minister Modi faces challenges as perceptions surrounding his leadership style shift.  His previous two terms saw an image of absolute power, which, while appreciated by some, also raised concerns about democratic norms.  Recent events, such as backtracking on amendments to the Waqf Board Act and changes in Assam’s legislature rules, have fueled perceptions of weakness and raised concerns among allies. Modi's unwavering stance during the farm protests and Brij Bhushan Singh controversy seems to have backfired electorally.  Moving forward, Modi needs to strike a balance between projecting strength and exhibiting pragmatism, while also addressing concerns over the use of the Enforcement Directorate to target political opponents and fostering greater consultation with allies.</description>

			<description>You won't believe this! During the article, it highlights Prime Minister Modi's claims regarding India's economic growth over the past decade. An analysis reveals that while the economy has grown, the growth rate hasn't met expectations compared to previous periods.  

The author questions the claim of "renewed confidence" amongst the people, citing a large number of applications for low-paying government jobs. They further argue that the recent election was a vote for change, constitutional governance, and growth with equality, contrasting it with the BJP's focus on continuity and economic growth. 

The article stresses the urgent need to address unemployment, criticizing the government's inaction despite promises in the budget. It points to layoffs in various sectors, low graduate placement rates, and stagnant salaries.  Finally, it laments the lack of progress in addressing trade policies that could boost employment in labor-intensive industries.</description>

			<title>To Port of Spain, India’s I-Day present — a chair</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/to-port-of-spain-indias-i-day-present-a-chair-9555722/</link>
			<description>In 1968, India gifted Trinidad and Tobago a Speaker's Chair, symbolizing shared democratic values, six years after the nation gained independence. The chair was delayed due to the intricate craftsmanship involved and the illness of one of the two specialized woodcarvers.  The gift, presented by then-Indian High Commissioner Muni Lal, was acknowledged by the Parliament as a reminder of the unity between the two countries,  especially given the historical contribution of Indian indentured laborers to Trinidad and Tobago's present society. The chair now continues to be used by the country's Speaker, representing a lasting symbol of their connection.</description>

			<description>One month after the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh is under interim government led by Muhammad Yunus.  Yunus is receiving praise for his connection with the people and his openness to engaging with the media, a welcome change from the previous administration.  The focus has shifted to the role of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the country's future.  The media urges the BNP to distance itself from the past and engage in constructive reforms to seize the opportunity presented by the current political climate. There is  a call for  the BNP to abandon revenge-driven politics and embrace public sentiment.</description>

			<title>Eight years after I became the first woman para-athlete to bring India a medal, I have goosebumps watching Sheetal Devi shine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/paralympics-paris-para-athletes-medals-sheetal-devi-9555026/</link>
			<description>Over the past three Paralympic Games, the number of medals won by Indian women para-athletes has surged from zero to eleven.  This progress is attributed to policy changes, increased societal acceptance, and a shift in the perception of para-sports.  

The Paralympic Committee of India has transitioned from a charitable organization to a professional sporting body, providing athletes with training, support, and funding. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Khelo India" initiative and national youth para-games have further boosted grassroots talent identification and development. 

The 2024 Paris Games showcase India's largest-ever women's para-athlete contingent, competing across various sports and disability categories.  This success signifies a step towards equal opportunity and empowerment for women in para-sports, demonstrating the transformative power of sport in challenging societal norms and fostering inclusivity.</description>

			<title>Pavel Durov arrest: Why Elon Musk and Russia have a problem with Telegram</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/elon-musk-russia-telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-9554981/</link>
			<description>Pavel Durov's recent arrest in France has significant implications for Telegram and the broader social media landscape. 

The arrest, which stemmed from allegations of non-compliance with law enforcement requests, has sparked debate about the balance between free speech and content moderation. Durov argues that Telegram actively combats harmful content and has cooperated with authorities, while critics contend that the platform's policies create a breeding ground for extremism and illegal activity. 

The incident raises concerns about the potential for censorship and highlights the challenges of regulating social media platforms, especially those with global reach and strong encryption measures.  The future of Telegram’s operations in France remains uncertain, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussion surrounding online safety and user privacy.</description>

			<title>Ram Madhav writes: How Modi government tackled Maoism in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-how-modi-government-tackled-maoism-in-india-9554358/</link>
			<description>The Maoist insurgency in India, a five-decade-long violent movement rooted in Mao Zedong's ideology, is nearing its end.  The movement, which gained prominence in the 1970s and reached its peak in 2010, controlled significant territory and claimed thousands of lives. While earlier governments struggled to contain it, the Modi government's approach, focusing on counter-terrorism, state coordination, and development in affected regions, has significantly weakened the Maoists. Through military operations, infrastructure development, and incentivizing surrenders, the government has reduced Maoist influence and violence drastically.  Disillusionment within Maoist ranks, coupled with global failings of communist ideology, further contributes to their weakening.</description>

			<title>How our lifestyle is creating an epidemic of mental ill health</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-our-lifestyle-is-creating-an-epidemic-of-mental-ill-health-9554357/</link>
			<description>India is experiencing rapid economic growth, but this progress comes at a cost to the mental well-being of its youth.  Studies reveal a concerning rise in mental health issues among adolescents, linked to factors such as early smartphone usage, high consumption of ultra-processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, and weakened family relationships.  Alarmingly,  youth from wealthier backgrounds, who consume more processed foods, are less physically active, and experience strained family ties, demonstrate poorer mental health compared to their less affluent peers who engage in healthier habits and maintain strong family connections.  This trend highlights the urgent need for intervention. Policymakers, schools, parents, and the private sector must work together to address this growing mental health crisis before it jeopardizes India's demographic dividend.</description>

			<title>Sanjay Srivastava writes: Why we must talk about caste</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sanjay-srivastava-writes-why-we-must-talk-about-caste-9554353/</link>
			<description>The article argues that ignoring caste in India doesn't make it disappear; it only reinforces existing inequalities. The author critiques the idea that caste is simply a matter of thought and memory, pointing out that it manifests both formally and informally.

Rahul Gandhi's comment about the lack of representation of lower castes in beauty pageants, though seemingly trivial, highlights the pervasiveness of caste discrimination. The author suggests that to truly understand this issue, we need to analyze not only the visible barriers but also the invisible ones embedded in societal attitudes and cultural capital. 

The author uses examples of conversations about caste in Haryana and academia to illustrate how upper castes often justify their privilege by attributing "merit" and "inclinations" to specific castes, perpetuating a hierarchy that limits opportunities for others.  The article concludes that acknowledging and addressing both formal and informal discrimination is crucial to dismantle the caste system effectively.</description>

			<description>The article analyzes India's strategic position, highlighting challenges and opportunities. It criticizes India's declining influence in its neighborhood due to perceived "big brother" behaviour and domestic political polarization, which negatively impact its image. 

The article emphasizes the importance of robust statecraft, including a comprehensive strategic agenda, to address security threats from China and Pakistan.  It underscores India's vulnerability due to a ballooning trade deficit with China, dependence on foreign defense imports, and adversaries who have gained nuclear advantages. 

Finally, the article calls for India to forge strategic alliances and partnerships to bolster national security and achieve its economic and military ambitions, reminding the leadership that national security  requires prioritization.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/in-india-changes-in-food-consumption-patterns-capture-important-trends-9554351/</link>
			<description>A new study analyzing household spending patterns reveals that for the first time in independent India, food expenditure accounts for less than half of the average monthly budget. This decline, attributed to the success of government food security policies and improved infrastructure, is seen as a significant progress marker. 

The study highlights the declining share of cereal spending, particularly among the poorest households, suggesting a shift towards a more diversified diet.  This trend, while positive, raises questions about the need to adjust agricultural policies to encourage diverse crop production. Additionally, the study notes a rise in spending on processed food, prompting a need to assess its health implications and refine public health policies accordingly.</description>

			<title>How does a disabled professor teach?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-does-disabled-professor-teach-9553902/</link>
			<description>Teachers' Day should be a time to reflect on the challenges faced by marginalized academicians, including disabled professors. Disabled professors disrupt ableist assumptions about universities and knowledge production, bringing unique perspectives and experiences. However, they often face systemic barriers like a heavy workload, ableist expectations of "neutral" knowledge, and limited opportunities for agency.  The emphasis on "publish or perish" metrics can be particularly disadvantageous, as these often prioritize knowledge derived from abled experiences.

It is crucial to recognize that disabled professors challenge dominant paradigms and offer a more inclusive approach to knowledge formation.  Their presence enriches the academic environment and contributes to a more equitable and democratic understanding of knowledge.  By challenging ableist structures and celebrating the diverse experiences of disabled professors, we can move towards a truly inclusive and enriching academic community.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/amid-infighting-in-israel-can-netanyahu-carry-on-with-his-war-policy-in-gaza-9553239/</link>
			<description>Israel faces a complex and volatile situation. The ongoing war in Gaza, coupled with internal tensions between the government and the military, presents a major threat to Israel's national security. 

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has publicly criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war, generating further instability. The government's policies in the West Bank, perceived by some as encouraging violence against Palestinians, have further exacerbated the situation. These internal divisions come as Israel navigates external challenges, including threats from Iran, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.

			<title>R G Kar case shows stricter rape laws are necessary</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/r-g-kar-case-shows-stricter-rape-laws-are-necessary-9552728/</link>
			<description>India faces a severe rape epidemic, with a reported case every four hours. The societal stigma surrounding rape and inadequate legal response often leave victims marginalized and vulnerable. 

Despite legal advancements and stricter laws like the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, the rate of rape persists. Recent cases highlight the need for stronger deterrents. The West Bengal government's proposed Aparajita Woman and Child Bill, 2024, which includes capital punishment for rape resulting in death or vegetative state, aligns with the urgent demand for swift and severe consequences.  The writer advocates for capital punishment in such cases and a quick judicial process to effectively deter future instances of rape and create a safer environment for women in India.</description>

			<title>A new generation of tennis stars in rising</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/tennis-grand-slam-us-open-semifinal-9552700/</link>
			<description>American men's tennis has struggled in recent decades, with Andy Roddick being the last American man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 2003. However, the US Open 2023 semifinals feature an all-American matchup with Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz, signaling a potential shift in the sport. The emergence of these players coincides with the decline of the "Big 3" (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic), creating an opportunity for new stars to dominate. In contrast, US women's tennis remains strong, with the Williams sisters' legacy carried on by players like Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, and Sofia Kenin.</description>

			<title>NMA has done well to roll back changes to medical curriculum</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/lesbianism-nmc-medical-curriculum-9552703/</link>
			<description>The National Medical Commission (NMC) initially made positive changes to the competency-based medical education (CBME) curriculum, removing discriminatory language and outdated concepts.  However, these changes were reversed, reinstating harmful definitions of virginity and "defloration,"  and removing crucial training modules on  disability and LGBTQI+ healthcare. This reversal  contravenes existing laws that mandate inclusive healthcare for marginalized groups.  The outdated definitions perpetuate stigma and discrimination, further hindering access to quality healthcare for  LGBTQI+ and disabled individuals.   The NMC must prioritize the dignity and well-being of all citizens by fully integrating inclusive and ethical healthcare practices into medical education.</description>

			<title>Harsher rape laws do little to prevent sexual violence</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/harsher-rape-laws-do-little-to-prevent-sexual-violence-9552727/</link>
			<description>The recent rape and murder of a doctor has sparked debate about harsher punishments for sexual offenders. The West Bengal government has proposed amendments to criminal laws, including mandatory death penalty for rape resulting in death or permanent vegetative state.  

However, critics argue that this approach is ineffective and a distraction from addressing the root causes of sexual violence. They point out that harsher punishments have been implemented before without significant impact on preventing such crimes.  

Instead, they advocate for broader social reforms, improved criminal justice institutions, and a focus on addressing the systemic factors that contribute to sexual violence, such as patriarchal structures and gender inequality.  


They argue that the death penalty does not deter crime effectively and fails to address the needs of victims who face numerous challenges throughout the justice process.</description>

			<title>A Constitution museum: Bringing the republic to the public</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/constitution-museum-republic-9550865/</link>
			<description>The Constitution of India, adopted on November 26, 1949, and coming into effect on January 26, 1950, marks a significant milestone in India's history.  Drafted during a time of great social, economic, and political change, it reflects a vision of social revolution and not just a legal document. Completed after numerous sessions by the Constituent Assembly, the Constitution embodies the ideas of parliamentary government, fundamental rights, and directive principles of state policy.  Its ongoing interpretation by courts and amendments by Parliament have made it one of the world's most dynamic and evolving constitutions.  A Constitution Museum is proposed to celebrate this history, democratize access to constitutional knowledge, promote civic education, recognize the contributions of the framers, and foster public discourse on the Constitution's relevance to contemporary India.</description>

			<title>Express View: Who’s a clever dog?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-whos-a-clever-dog-9550788/</link>
			<description>A study found that dogs can remember up to a dozen object names for years, even if they haven't seen the objects recently. This suggests a strong connection between long-term memory and language comprehension, offering insights into brain function.  

Dogs' exceptional memory, combined with their emotional intelligence and understanding of human behavior, makes them suitable for various roles like service animals and in search and rescue operations. 

While other animals display intelligence, dogs' cognitive abilities seem to have evolved due to their long-standing relationship with humans.  Puppies are particularly adept at understanding human cues and using them to navigate their environment, showcasing the impact of domestication on canine intelligence.</description>

			<title>West Bengal’s anti-rape law: A knee-jerk reaction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/west-bengals-anti-rape-law-9550787/</link>
			<description>The Aparajita Woman and Child Bill 2024, passed unanimously by the West Bengal Assembly, proposes stringent punishments for rape, including the death penalty in certain cases. While the bill aims to address the loopholes in existing laws, it raises concerns about its effectiveness in combating a deeply rooted culture of misogyny. Studies show that stricter laws alone do not deter crime, and institutional challenges like a lack of due process and system-wide insensitivity towards survivors persist. The bill also overlooks the need for broader societal change, including challenging patriarchal norms at the grassroots level. True progress requires addressing the systemic factors that contribute to gender-based violence, not just enacting punitive measures.</description>

			<title>World Bank raises India’s growth forecast: An upward tick</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/world-bank-india-growth-9550786/</link>
			<description>The World Bank has increased its growth prediction for the Indian economy to 7 percent for the current year, citing a rebound in rural incomes due to a good monsoon and increased consumption.  While investment growth is expected to moderate, the Bank remains optimistic about India's medium-term prospects, predicting an average growth rate of 6.7 percent between 2025 and 2027. 

However, the report points out that India has struggled to capitalize on the export opportunities created by China's receding market share in low-skill manufacturing.  This is partly attributed to high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, leading to a decline in both direct and indirect export-related employment.


The Bank recommends reducing tariffs, entering into more free trade agreements, and increasing integration with global value chains to address these challenges.</description>

			<title>Why India should not have the Right to Disconnect</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/right-to-disconnect-india-9550785/</link>
			<description>India's unique economic context makes a blanket application of the "Right to Disconnect" law potentially harmful.  While advocating for work-life balance is crucial,  the "Right to Disconnect" philosophy, which emphasizes disconnecting from work-related communications outside official hours, might not be suitable for a rapidly developing economy like India's.

The Indian workforce, driven by ambition and a strong work ethic, typically views work as a source of identity and purpose.  Lowering work hours could impede progress and limit India's ability to compete in the global market. 

Instead of solely focusing on disconnecting, a more balanced approach that recognizes the importance of hard work and productivity while ensuring a healthy and motivated workforce is essential for India's continued growth.</description>

			<description>Radhakrishnan's inaugural lecture at Oxford, "The World's Unborn Soul,"  examines the global crisis of the 20th century. He highlights the interconnectedness of humanity due to advancements in technology and economics, yet observes a disconnect in our political structures and identities, leading to a sense of disquiet.

He analyzes the erosion of established ideologies and the emergence of a fragile sense of self, pushing individuals towards therapy and fueling the rise of the state and nationalism. Radhakrishnan posits that a solution lies in cultivating openness to diverse cultures and understanding the true meaning of spirituality—the transcendence of the ego.</description>

			<description>The recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to India significantly strengthened bilateral relations. This partnership has progressed from an "enhanced strategic partnership" to a "comprehensive strategic partnership,"  reflecting  growing economic and diplomatic cooperation.

Both countries are also collaborating on digital technologies and exploring currency trading arrangements. The visit also saw an agreement on the recruitment, employment, and repatriation of workers, addressing the concerns of the substantial Indian diaspora in Malaysia.  While the South China Sea issue was addressed, with India reiterating its stance on freedom of navigation, the talks focused on building a more just and multipolar world order.

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ic-814-the-kandahar-hijack-controversy-9549638/</link>
			<description>. A recent controversy arose over the Netflix series "IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack", with some accusing the makers of distorting the religious identity of the hijackers. The series, based on a memoir by the pilot of the hijacked flight, used aliases for the hijackers, which sparked outrage and calls for a ban. The aliases, however, are documented in media reports and the Ministry of External Affairs website.  This incident highlights a pattern of manufactured outrage in the Indian entertainment industry, where creatives face pressure to avoid potentially offensive content. This stifles artistic expression and creates a climate of fear. Concerns arise about the long-term impact on the industry and the potential for  silencing diverse voices.</description>

			<title>What the Hema Committee reports tells us about workers’ rights — and how to ensure them</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hema-committee-report-workers-rights-9549435/</link>
			<description>The Hema Commission report, investigating women's issues in the Malayalam film industry, exposed systemic problems and validated complaints about harassment, wage disparity, and lack of safety measures. The report empowered women workers to speak out, highlighting the fear of repercussions and the silencing of those who demand fair treatment.  

The report echoes past inquiries that called for worker rights protection and  better working conditions.  It proposes a tribunal to address complaints, challenging the existing Internal Complaints Committee's effectiveness. The report also addresses issues faced by  below-the-line workers and emphasizes the need for gender balance in production. 

A crucial takeaway is the need for systemic change beyond mere funding initiatives. The report's impact is being felt nationwide, prompting calls for similar interventions in other Indian film industries. The challenge lies in translating public attention into concrete policy changes that ensure safety and equality for all workers in the film sector.</description>

			<title>How agriculture can be an engine for growth</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/agriculture-engine-growth-9549171/</link>
			<description>Indian agriculture needs to transform to be a driver of growth and create desirable jobs. While the sector has seen growth, it faces ecological and technological challenges.  To improve productivity and income, irrigation, particularly rainwater harvesting and micro-irrigation, needs to be expanded. Soil health must be addressed through crop diversity and agro-ecological farming.  

Institutional innovations such as voluntary farmer cooperatives can help overcome the limitations of small farm sizes. These groups can pool resources, invest in technology, and negotiate better market prices. Connecting agriculture with allied sectors like livestock and fisheries, and strengthening linkages with the rural non-farm sector can further boost growth and job creation.</description>

			<title>How to ensure food safety and reduce waste</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-ensure-food-safety-and-reduce-waste-9548814/</link>
			<description>Food plays a vital role in India's culture and economy. Ensuring food safety and security is crucial for the nation's progress.  Food safety incidents can have significant economic and health consequences. To address these challenges, India is investing in food irradiation technology, which extends product shelf life, reduces spoilage, and minimizes food loss. Irradiation is a safe and effective method, globally recognized and adopted by countries with strict safety standards.  

While initial investments in irradiation facilities are substantial, the long-term benefits are considerable. The technology offers a promising investment opportunity in the growing Indian food processing sector, supporting both domestic and export markets. The government is providing financial assistance to encourage the establishment of new irradiation facilities, underscoring its commitment to advancing food safety and security.</description>

			<title>PM Modi in Singapore: A partner in India’s growth story</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-in-singapore-a-partner-in-indias-growth-story-9548766/</link>
			<description>India-Singapore relations are flourishing, marked by frequent high-level interactions and a flourishing trade and investment partnership. Singapore is India's largest trading partner among ASEAN nations and its primary source of foreign direct investment. The two nations share a deep historical and cultural connection, with Singapore hosting a significant Indian diaspora and being a popular tourist destination for Indians.  Beyond economics, India and Singapore collaborate on defense and maritime security, especially within the Indo-Pacific context. 

The upcoming India-Singapore meeting will likely address shared regional concerns like the situation in Myanmar and explore new avenues for cooperation, including potential Chinese investment in India. 


While Singapore's success as a global hub highlights India's potential, it also underscores the need for India to address its own regulatory and structural challenges to fully leverage this partnership.</description>

			<title>SC’s stand against ‘bulldozer justice’ is welcome — but it may be too little too late</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/scs-stand-against-bulldozer-justice-is-welcome-but-it-may-be-too-little-too-late-9548767/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court has condemned "bulldozer justice," the practice of demolishing properties of crime suspects. The court's intervention, long awaited, recognizes the misuse of power and violation of citizen rights.  While the court proposes guidelines, concerns remain regarding its effectiveness. The court faces skepticism over its ability to enforce its directives considering past instances where its pronouncements against hate speech have been largely ineffective. Greater action from lower courts, law enforcement, and a political climate that discourages hate speech are necessary for tangible change. The court must ensure its actions are timely and meaningful, as reversing the damage caused by bulldozer justice is often impossible.</description>

			<title>In Manipur, a continuing saga of political and administrative abdication</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/in-manipur-a-continuing-saga-of-political-and-administrative-abdication-9548768/</link>
			<description>Manipur continues to experience violence and unrest despite the state government's assurances of peace. The recent attack in Koutruk, involving sophisticated weaponry, has underscored the fragility of the situation. A BJP MLA has called for the withdrawal of central forces and a change in the security force command, attributing the continued violence to their ineffectiveness. 

The ongoing crisis stems from deep-rooted ethnic tensions between the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zos, fueled by economic and political marginalization. 

The demand for ST status for the Meiteis and the subsequent backlash from the Kuki-Zos highlight the state government's failure to address these structural issues. Instead of focusing on dialogue and reconciliation, the government has been quick to frame the crisis as a law-and-order problem, diverting attention from the underlying causes.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-in-rahul-gandhi-and-pm-modis-us-visits-a-new-internationalism-9548791/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi's upcoming US visit presents both opportunities and challenges for the Congress Party. While the visit allows the party to rebuild global connections and showcase its leader's vision, it raises questions about the appropriateness of taking domestic criticism of the BJP government to foreign soil.  

The visit coincides with a larger trend of Indian political parties engaging with the diaspora, a development that has grown in significance alongside India's economic and military rise. This engagement, however, is increasingly scrutinized by host countries and potentially prone to domestic political biases.  

The Congress, in particular, needs to revitalize its foreign affairs department to effectively navigate this shifting global landscape. The article contrasts the Congress's historic engagement with the world with its current limitations, suggesting a renewed commitment to internationalism is crucial.</description>

The author, a young Muslim woman, expresses her outrage at the incident, which she sees as part of a larger pattern of violence against Muslims in India. She criticizes the focus on "exposure" as a solution, arguing that everyday acts of discrimination and fear also contribute to the problem. She emphasizes that Muslims should not have to hide their identities and that the responsibility lies with all citizens to challenge Islamophobia and protect vulnerable individuals.</description>

			<title>IndiGo airlines’ pink seats: Putting the onus of safety on women</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pink-seats-onus-safety-women-9547595/</link>
			<description>The author recounts a negative experience of harassment on a flight, highlighting the everyday challenges women face. She praises IndiGo's new feature allowing women to see where other women are seated during web check-in, initially viewing it as a positive step. However, she argues that this move exemplifies "neoliberal feminism," placing the onus of safety on women rather than addressing the root cause of men's entitled behaviour. 

She contends that the feature normalizes male harassment by suggesting women pay for a safer experience. The author concludes that token "feminist" measures are insufficient and true change requires addressing the systemic issues that create hostile public spaces for women.</description>

			<title>In Bangladesh turmoil, a lesson for the Global South</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-bangladesh-turmoil-a-lesson-for-the-global-sout-9546929/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh's history is marked by its struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The newly formed nation grappled with economic challenges, political turmoil, and the interplay between secularism and religious identity. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's first leader, was assassinated in 1975, ushering in a period of military rule and a shift towards an Islamic national identity.  

Eventually, civilian rule returned, witnessing a pendulum swing between the more secular Awami League and the more Islamic BNP.  In the 21st century, Bangladesh saw remarkable economic progress, surpassing India in per capita income. However, this growth did not quell social and political unrest.  The recent fall of the Sheikh Hasina government highlights the importance of balancing economic development with job creation and respecting dissent.</description>

			<description>Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us" achieved massive global success, but was unexpectedly outpaced by "Big Dawgs," a song by Indian rapper Hanumankind.  

"Big Dawgs," filmed in a Kerala "Well of Death," blended Indian sounds with English rap and garnered international attention.  
The song, which tackles themes of identity and colorism, provoked both praise and racist backlash. 

Hanumankind, who grew up between Kerala and Houston, had previously released music in India but "Big Dawgs" marked a breakthrough into the global rap scene.</description>

			<description>The article argues that the debate surrounding a caste census in India is characterized by "ideological" opposition from a largely upper-caste opinion-making class.  

Ten common arguments against the census are presented and debunked. These include claims that the census is a new idea, would be logistically impossible, and would exacerbate caste tensions. The author contends that a caste census is necessary to understand the distribution of resources and opportunities across castes, ultimately aiding in more effective social policy. They emphasize the importance of documenting not just the  disadvantages faced by lower castes, but also the privileges enjoyed by upper castes, to ensure equal opportunities for all. The article concludes by suggesting the caste question should be included in various other data collection exercises beyond the decennial census.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-biodiversity-can-increase-the-resilience-of-cities-9546952/</link>
			<description>Forests are complex ecosystems where every organism plays a vital role in maintaining balance. The example of Yellowstone National Park demonstrates how the reintroduction of apex predators can restore a damaged ecosystem.  Just as forests rely on intricate relationships between plants, animals, and fungi, human societies can learn from the interconnectedness of nature. Biodiversity in forests provides resilience and benefits like clean air, water, and food. To build biodiverse spaces, studying native organisms and reintroducing them is crucial, along with forest protection. Cities like Mumbai can enhance biodiversity by protecting mangroves, investing in sewage treatment, and creating habitat corridors that connect natural areas to urban spaces.</description>

			<title>India’s GDP growth, beyond the headline numbers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-gdp-growth-beyond-the-headline-numbers-9546951/</link>
			<description>India's GDP growth for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025 came in at 6.7%, slightly below the Reserve Bank of India's projections. Despite this, the quarter showed positive trends with robust consumer spending and healthy investment growth.  Private consumption increased significantly, driven by a strong rural rebound.  Investments also grew at a healthy rate, and government expenditure, though slower due to elections, is expected to pick up.  

On the supply side, agriculture growth was modest but the favorable monsoon bodes well for future growth.  The industry and services sectors also performed well.  The RBI's full-year growth estimate of 7.2% seems achievable, given the current economic momentum.  The government is encouraged to implement its nine key budget priorities, including initiatives to support MSMEs and agriculture.  Focus areas include digitizing land records for farmers, promoting agri-value chains, and streamlining credit access for businesses.</description>

			<description>India's robust monsoon has led the government to ease restrictions on certain food commodities. The ban on sugar mills producing ethanol directly from cane has been lifted, and rice can be procured from government stocks for ethanol production.  With bumper crops expected, the government is considering relaxing the ban on white non-basmati rice exports and removing restrictions on sugar exports. Lifting these curbs is crucial to avoid future supply gluts and ensure farmers receive fair prices.</description>

In several cases, the Court reinforced the principle that bail is the rule, not the exception, and highlighted the right to a speedy trial as a fundamental right.  

The Court has also scrutinized stringent penal statutes like the PMLA and NDPS Act, urging them to be interpreted in a way that respects constitutional safeguards and the presumption of innocence.  These judgments stress the paramountcy of the Constitution and the protection of individual liberties against potentially oppressive legal processes.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-raise-a-boy-indian-parents-outdated-gender-distinctions-9546480/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the urgent need for mothers to guide their sons towards a more respectful and compassionate approach towards women. It highlights the alarming statistics of sexual harassment and violence against women in India, attributing it to ingrained societal norms of masculinity that often devalue women and promote entitlement. 

The author emphasizes the importance of challenging traditional gender roles and breaking down harmful stereotypes, encouraging open conversations and critical reflection on societal issues.

			<title>What happens when AI replaces human creativity?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-happens-when-ai-replaces-human-creativity-9546125/</link>
			<description>Richard Linklater's "Boyhood" exemplifies how technology has become a constant in our ever-changing world.  Just as oil shapes our narratives, data and digital technologies are now driving storytelling.  

However, the rise of AI in creative industries raises concerns.  AI models are trained on vast amounts of human-generated data, often without consent or compensation,  potentially leading to the appropriation of cultural heritage. 

This raises questions about the ethics of data use and the need for regulation to protect both creators and consumers.   While AI can offer certain benefits, it’s crucial to ensure it doesn't stifle human creativity, perpetuate biases, or exploit cultural resources for profit.  A balanced approach that prioritizes human values and ethical considerations is essential for the future of storytelling.</description>

			<title>September 2, 1984, Forty Years Ago: Amritsar on high alert</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/september-2-1984-forty-years-ago-amritsar-on-high-alert-9545182/</link>
			<description>Ahead of a world Sikh convention, authorities imposed strict measures in Amritsar, suspending vehicle movement and detaining over 1,250 Akali Dal activists and SGPC members. Despite the restrictions, many leaders managed to enter the Gurudwara Shaheedan, the convention venue. 

In Karnataka, the Congress (I) is strategizing to gain power, with former Chief Minister Gundu Rao leading efforts to unite the state party. Meanwhile, opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh issued an ultimatum to the Governor, demanding an emergency assembly session to reinstate the N.T. Rama Rao Ministry, or face a nationwide bandh. 

Olympic athlete Gurtej Singh sought political asylum in the US citing the situation in Punjab. Notably, the TDI Lake Grove project in Sonipat is attracting Japanese nationals employed with Maruti Suzuki, boosting local businesses and property values.</description>

			<title>Ashok Gulati and Reena Singh write: How to help Haryana and Punjab move away from paddy to less water-guzzling crops</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ashok-gulati-and-reena-singh-write-how-to-help-haryana-and-punjab-move-away-from-paddy-to-less-water-guzzling-crops-9545179/</link>
			<description>Punjab and Haryana have initiated a scheme to encourage farmers to shift from water-intensive paddy cultivation to alternative crops. While the incentive of Rs 17,500 per hectare is a positive step, it falls short compared to the existing subsidies farmers receive for paddy.  To effectively incentivize diversification, the minimum amount should be doubled to Rs 35,000 per hectare, redirecting existing subsidies towards more sustainable crops. This approach, combined with assured Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for alternative crops, would minimize market risks for farmers and promote diversification for at least five years. The benefits of this shift include  reduced water usage, improved soil health, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and enhanced crop biodiversity.</description>

			<title>Why a caste Census is not ‘harmless’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-a-caste-census-is-not-harmless-9545205/</link>
			<description>Arguments for and against a caste-based Census in India are presented.  Supporters believe it will help shape policies and provide valuable data, while opponents argue it risks exacerbating social divisions and undermining national unity. The historical precedent of religious inclusion in censuses leading to societal fractures is cited as a cautionary tale. 

It is argued that caste is a largely outdated social construct with diminishing relevance in modern India, particularly among younger generations. Conducting a caste-based Census is seen as counterproductive to efforts to dismantle the caste system and create a more equitable society.  A focus on promoting a casteless society through education and social reforms is recommended instead of reinforcing caste identities through official data collection.</description>

			<title>Express View on India’s GDP growth: Slow, but steady</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indias-gdp-growth-slow-but-steady-9545181/</link>
			<description>India's economy grew by 6.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, lower than the Reserve Bank of India's projection of 7.1 percent.  Several factors contributed to this slowdown, including reduced government spending, weak agricultural and certain service sectors. However, the agricultural sector is expected to recover with a favorable monsoon, potentially boosting rural consumption and easing price pressures.  While manufacturing growth moderated, corporate sales and profits saw an increase. Construction and private consumption showed strong momentum, while investment held up. Government spending remained subdued due to the general elections, but a potential pick-up in the coming quarters could stimulate economic activity.</description>

			<title>Indian political imagination is not dead. One has to look for it in new</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-political-imagination-is-not-dead-one-has-to-look-for-it-in-new-9545203/</link>
			<description>Yogendra Yadav's article "Where are our Political Thinkers?" presents an exaggerated view of the state of political thought in India. While acknowledging that modern political discourse lacks figures like Gokhale and Ranade, the article argues that political theory is alive and well in research, public commentary, and academic spaces. 

Yadav's claim that political thinking does not influence action is refuted by examples like the Right to Information Act and the abolition of Triple Talaq. The article further highlights the emergence of new perspectives in feminist, Dalit, and decolonization studies, demonstrating the dynamism of Indian political thought. 

Instead of lamenting the absence of comprehensive political explanations, the article encourages a focus on understanding the complexities of contemporary India. 
 It suggests that analyzing everyday spaces like airports can reveal valuable insights into the evolving political landscape and urges a reassessment of concepts like "hustling" as crucial to understanding Indian democracy.</description>

			<title>Why there is a need to reimagine corporate governance in the AI age</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-there-is-a-need-to-reimagine-corporate-governance-in-the-ai-age-9545204/</link>
			<description>The article reflects on a workshop for independent directors concerning the risks of AI. The author finds the workshop's approach limited because it relies on traditional corporate vocabulary and processes ill-suited to address the complexities of AI's disruptive potential.  

The author emphasizes the need for scenario planning that accounts for discontinuity and anticipates radical future developments driven by AI. They argue that traditional governance structures, relying on annual evaluations and homogenized board composition, are inadequate for navigating AI's transformative impact. 

Finally, the author calls for a reevaluation of corporate jargon, urging a shift  towards a more nuanced understanding of concepts like "vision," "strategy," and "governance" in the face of AI's unprecedented challenges.</description>

			<title>Express View on case against the accused of Delhi 1984: Lest we forget</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-case-against-the-accused-of-delhi-1984-lest-we-forget-9545180/</link>
			<description>The 1984 anti-Sikh violence, which resulted in the deaths of over 2,700 people in Delhi alone, remains a deeply troubling event in India's history. Despite numerous investigations and reports implicating senior Congress leaders, the pursuit of justice has been slow.  While the conviction of Sajjan Kumar in 2018 provided a measure of closure for some, many others continue to seek accountability. This week, a Delhi court ordered the CBI to file charges against another high-profile Congress leader, Jagdish Tytler, in a case linked to the violence. 

The decision follows decades of delays and contested investigations. The long-awaited step towards justice in the Tytler case highlights the enduring pain of the 1984 tragedy and the need for comprehensive accountability.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/punjab-closure-anti-sikh-riots-jagdish-tytler-sukhbir-badal-9545083/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the recent complexities in Punjab,  marked by the delayed justice for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the political struggles of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).  

The author highlights the SAD's "punishment" of its leader, Sukhbir Badal, as a potential attempt to salvage their image amidst accusations of inaction during religious incidents, involvement with controversial groups, and failure to address the state's issues. This situation coincides with the lingering challenges of incomplete justice in the 1984 riots and the evolving political landscape in Punjab. 

The article points to the impact of the 2020 farmers' movement, which showcased public disillusionment with traditional leaders, and the subsequent rise and subsequent unraveling of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) governance.  The article concludes by emphasizing Punjab's challenges, including unanswered questions of justice, political instability, and persistent social issues.</description>

			<description>The Malayalam film industry is undergoing a reckoning following the release of the Hema Committee report, revealing widespread sexual harassment and exploitation.  Inspired by this movement, women from other film industries, including Bengali and Telugu, are demanding similar accountability and workplace safety. However, the Hindi film industry has yet to make a collective statement or take significant action. The article highlights the industry's history of silencing victims and perpetuating misogynistic practices, citing the #MeToo movement's limited impact. Despite some positive changes, such as increased representation of women in crew positions and stories centered on female protagonists, the lack of a strong advocacy group like the Women in Cinema Collective in Bollywood is a concerning gap. The article calls upon men in the industry to act as allies, use their platforms to support women, and create a safer environment for speaking out against abuse.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the tragic rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata and the subsequent protests highlighting the safety concerns faced by women in Indian workplaces. 

it draws parallels with similar incidents in Pakistan, where female doctors and students face threats and violence.  

The author argues that while laws against sexual assault exist, a larger misogynistic mindset fuels these crimes. 

They emphasize the need for an open dialogue about the societal attitudes that contribute to violence against women and the importance of men taking responsibility for addressing the issue.  The author concludes with a call to action for women to continue demanding safety and recognition until their voices are heard.</description>

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: Rahul Gandhi’s fixation with people’s castes is not just baffling, but inane</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rahul-gandhi-caste-congress-9543660/</link>
			<description>Rahul Gandhi has become a more prominent political figure, gaining recognition  as a potential successor to Narendra Modi.  His efforts in portraying himself as a man of the people have resonated with some voters, challenging Modi's image. However, Gandhi's focus on caste issues and his sometimes eccentric statements  can hinder his credibility.  Concerns arise about the return of his old "courtiers," who could undermine his progress and allow Modi to regain his footing. Gandhi needs to address this perception of insincerity and avoid dwelling excessively on caste to be taken more seriously as a political leader.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the pervasive issue of sexual harassment in the Indian film industry. 

It highlights the power dynamics that often lead to women being coerced into compromising their morals for career opportunities. The article cites the #MeToo movement and instances of women speaking out against harassment, but also acknowledges the fear of backlash and the difficulty of pursuing justice in an industry where powerful individuals often get away with misconduct.  Despite some progress in terms of awareness and measures like the POSH Act, the article stresses that the fight against sexual exploitation in the film industry is far from over.</description>

			<description>Jammu &amp; Kashmir will hold its first Assembly elections in five years from September 18 to October 1, 2024. This marks the first election since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. The 1962 Assembly elections in J&amp;K,  simultaneously held with national polls, were the first conducted by the Election Commission of India.  Despite the JKNC sweeping both the 1957 and 1962 polls, these elections weren't without controversy. Opposition parties  alleged irregularities and boycotted, while others criticized the EC for not preventing malpractice.  The 1964 saw a significant political shift in J&amp;K, with JKNC leaders joining the Congress and the Praja Parishad merging with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.</description>

			<description>There is a debate in India regarding pensions, particularly the shift from the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) to the New Pension Scheme (NPS). The OPS was a defined benefit scheme with a guaranteed minimum pension, while the NPS is a defined contribution scheme. 

The government argues that the OPS was unsustainable and burdensome financially. The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) aims to address this by being a funded scheme where both the government and employees contribute, while also guaranteeing a minimum pension. However, employee unions are opposed to the employee contribution, creating a dilemma for the government.</description>

			<title>The Supreme Court wants the state to let people protest peacefully</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-supreme-court-wants-the-state-to-let-people-protest-peacefully-9543065/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India has taken the unusual step of initiating suo motu proceedings into the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata. While the immediate trigger was this incident,  the court aims to examine broader issues related to workplace violence against healthcare professionals.  

The court's recognition of public protests as a "moment of national catharsis" and its empathetic stance towards protestors marks a significant shift. It also validates the importance of media reports in situations where public trust in official narratives is low. The court has distinguished between peaceful protestors and disruptive mobs, condemning the police for retreating in the face of violence against protestors.  

This case presents an opportunity to re-evaluate the legal framework surrounding protests, particularly concerning disproportionate state action against demonstrators. The court's willingness to review criminal cases against protest leaders is also encouraging.</description>

			<title>Stop expecting billionaires to act on climate change. They’re part of the problem</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/billionaires-action-climate-change-part-of-problem-starbucks-ceo-private-jet-9542892/</link>
			<description>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, despite the company's commitment to environmental sustainability, will travel to the Seattle headquarters in a company-owned jet three times a week. This practice contradicts the company's encouragement of using eco-friendly alternatives and highlights the disparity in environmental impact between the wealthy and the rest. 

The use of private jets for travel contributes significantly to carbon emissions, far exceeding the environmental footprint of other modes of transportation like trains or commercial planes.  This incident exposes a larger issue: the wealthiest individuals, often those at the helm of major companies, disproportionately contribute to climate change while enacting measures that appear superficially sustainable. Critics argue that these actions are  empty gestures  or attempts to influence climate policies to their advantage.</description>

			<description>While young people are leading in industries and innovation, they remain underrepresented in politics. Despite comprising a large portion of the global population, young individuals hold less than 2% of elected legislative positions. This is a concern globally, particularly in developing nations like India where youth make up a significant portion of the population but lack proportionate representation in government. Political dynasties and nepotism hinder the rise of capable young leaders, emphasizing family connections over merit. 
 
India's Prime Minister has called for change, urging a new generation of leaders who are not from political families.  This highlights the need for a shift in political culture to empower young voices and ensure their participation in shaping the future.</description>

The author argues that India has a unique opportunity to lead the way in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for its aging population.

The article emphasizes the work of community service organizations (CSOs) that are advocating for better policies and services for seniors and showcasing examples of older adults who are actively contributing to society. It acknowledges the government's limited progress in addressing the needs of the elderly and calls for greater involvement from the private sector and society as a whole.  The author expresses hope that India can create a future where longevity is celebrated and older adults are valued for their wisdom and experience.</description>

			<title>What Indian Hindus don’t understand about Hindus in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-indian-hindus-dont-understand-about-hindus-in-bangladesh-9542242/</link>
			<description>The recent student-led protests in Bangladesh that led to the resignation of Sheikh Hasina  raised concerns among Bangladeshi Hindus about their safety.  They fear that, as in the past, political upheaval might lead to attacks on minority communities. However, Bangladeshi citizens of all religions, led by the student protesters, have come together to protect minority institutions.  While demanding a secular democratic government, Bangladeshi Hindus are seeking concrete changes like a Minority Affairs Ministry and reservations in Parliament. 
However, misinformation from some Indian Hindu groups portrays Bangladeshi Hindus as helpless and dependent on authoritarian rule, further endangering them.  Instead of promoting fear and division, Indian Hindus should support the demands of their Bangladeshi counterparts for a truly inclusive and secular democracy in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Hindus are not helpless; they are actively fighting for their rights and seeking solidarity from fellow Hindus to ensure their safety and equal citizenship in Bangladesh.</description>

			<title>Anjum Rajabali writes: Salim-Javed, thank you for ‘Deewaar’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/anjum-rajabali-writes-salim-javed-thank-you-for-deewaar-9542239/</link>
			<description>The documentary "Angry Young Men" explores the lives and careers of screenwriting duo Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, who achieved massive success in the 1970s with films like "Deewaar" and "Sholay".  

The series highlights their early struggles, their intense ambition, and the strong bond they shared. However, it falls short in analyzing their writing, which is the foundation of their legacy.  

While touching upon the success of "Sholay" and the enduring impact of "Deewaar," the documentary doesn't delve into the craft of their storytelling. It fails to examine their evolution, inspirations, or the techniques that made their scripts so impactful.

Despite this, their influence on Indian cinema is undeniable, inspiring aspiring screenwriters and bringing the script to the forefront.  Their work, though lacking social commentary, entertained audiences and left a lasting mark on the industry.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/remembering-a-g-noorani-a-scholar-of-justice-9542243/</link>
			<description>Abdul Ghafoor Noorani, a prominent legal scholar, passed away leaving behind a significant body of work on constitutional law and Indian history.  Known for his meticulous legal analysis and engaging style, Noorani was a respected authority on Kashmir, having authored influential works on Article 370 and the Kashmir dispute.  His scholarship extended beyond constitutional law to encompass Indian diplomacy, civil liberties, and topics such as Islam, the RSS, and Hindutva.  

Noorani was renowned for his moral courage and unwavering commitment to constitutional values, which earned him the admiration of many but also made him a critic of political dispensations. He celebrated secular and progressive India, leaving behind a legacy of rigorous scholarship and unwavering dedication to truth.</description>

			<title>Express View: On Delhi and Beijing, a hint of hope</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-delhi-and-beijing-a-hint-of-hope-9542244/</link>
			<description>Recent talks between India and China on easing tensions in eastern Ladakh offer hope for a breakthrough.  While both sides describe the discussions as "constructive," reaching a resolution remains challenging due to differing approaches.  India insists on a return to the pre-2020 border status as a prerequisite for improved relations, while China advocates for "normalisation" while addressing border concerns separately. 

Despite these differences, both countries appear to be moving towards a negotiated settlement. The focus is now on addressing legacy issues in Depsang and Demchok. China recognizes the economic and diplomatic costs of the stand-off, and India acknowledges the limitations of maintaining strained ties. A potential agreement involves China easing military pressure and India resuming political dialogue and economic engagement. However, any deal requires transparency and public support to navigate India's internal political complexities and strong nationalist sentiments.</description>

			<title>Express View: A timely warning on SME stocks</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-a-timely-warning-on-sme-stocks-9542245/</link>
			<description>The Indian stock market is experiencing a surge, with both large and small companies showing impressive gains. However, concerns have been raised about valuations in the smaller company segment, with some analysts pointing to "froth" and potential manipulation. 

Several recent IPOs from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been heavily oversubscribed, raising questions about the involvement of entities seeking to profit quickly by inflating stock prices. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has acknowledged these risks and urged investors to exercise caution.  

Measures such as a cap on SME IPO issue prices have been implemented, and continued vigilance is necessary to protect investors and market integrity, particularly as the number of new investors continues to grow.</description>

			<title>Recommitting to Test cricket: Afghanistan vs New Zealand, in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/recommitting-to-test-cricket-afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-in-india-9542246/</link>
			<description>The upcoming Test match between Afghanistan and New Zealand holds greater significance than a typical encounter. It serves as a barometer for the health of Test cricket, which faces challenges due to the allure of lucrative T20 leagues. Key players like Rashid Khan and even Kane Williamson are opting out of Test commitments, highlighting the format's struggle.  To address this, the ICC is proposing a dedicated Test cricket fund to ensure minimum match fees and financial support for participating boards. India's hosting of this historic match demonstrates its commitment to Test cricket, making the proceedings at Greater Noida a focal point for the future of the longest format.</description>

			<description>The Indian government announced concessions for the armed forces, aiming to address stagnation and recruitment challenges. 

Six Pakistani soldiers were killed during an attempt to cross the Line of Actual Control in the Uri sector.  The proposed Sikh world convention, banned by the government, could potentially empower Sikh high priests to disband political organizations like the Akali Dal.

			<title>It’s about time marital rape was criminalised</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/time-marital-rape-criminalised-9541894/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court of India is set to hear the case of Hrishikesh Sahoo v the State of Karnataka, which challenges the constitutionality of the marital rape exception (MRE).  The MRE, present in both the Indian Penal Code and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, allows husbands to have sex with their wives without consent.  

This exception is considered discriminatory and a violation of women's rights, as it denies them the same legal protections as unmarried women. Data suggests that marital rape is prevalent in India, with significant psychological and physical effects on victims. Opponents argue that criminalizing marital rape will harm family structures, but advocates contend that true marital harmony stems from consent and respect.  

The Supreme Court will consider whether the MRE violates Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality, non-discrimination, freedom of speech, and the right to life and liberty, respectively. The decision has the potential to significantly impact women's rights in India, aligning the country with international human rights standards.</description>

			<title>Definitely, not maybe: The music of Oasis still resonates</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/music-oasis-band-world-tour-9541228/</link>
			<description>Oasis, the iconic 1990s British band, is reuniting after over a decade for a two-month world tour in July 2024. The brothers, Liam and Noel Gallagher, known for their tumultuous relationship and onstage clashes, have put aside their differences for this highly anticipated comeback. The band rose to prominence with their 1994 album "What's the Story (Morning Glory)?," capturing the zeitgeist of Britpop and echoing the longing for the optimistic era of the 1960s. With their anthemic songs, raw energy and Noel's distinctive guitar work, Oasis became a voice for a generation, achieving both immense success and notoriety for their volatile personalities. Despite their struggles, Oasis' music continues to resonate, with their breakout hit "Wonderwall" recently reaching one billion streams on Spotify, proving their enduring legacy.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-city-and-i-scary-tales-fairy-tales-othering-and-belonging-in-udaipur-9541274/</link>
			<description>This article reflects on the author's experience living in Udaipur.  While acknowledging the city's beauty and tranquility, the author highlights a stark reality beneath the surface.  Incidents of communal tension and caste-based discrimination challenge the idyllic image often portrayed of Udaipur. 

The author recounts encounters with prejudice, including a domestic worker refusing to work for her based on caste and children perpetuating stereotypes. 

The author also observes a rise in ethno-nationalistic sentiments, evidenced by banners, rallies, and online hate speech. These occurrences, culminating in a recent communal riot, have created a climate of fear and foreboding. 

However, the author also emphasizes the presence of hope, citing instances of interfaith harmony, community support, and acts of kindness that offer a counter narrative to the prevailing negativity.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/whats-wrong-if-women-want-to-escape-mr-space-hog-on-a-flight-9540606/</link>
			<description>Indigo Airlines has introduced a new option allowing women passengers to select seats next to other women. While seemingly a simple gesture, this move addresses a long-standing issue of space encroachment by men, often unintentionally, leading to discomfort for women passengers. 

The article highlights the societal conditioning that often leads to men occupying more space and the challenges faced by women navigating these situations. It praises Indigo for responding to customer feedback and proposes potential solutions for ensuring the effectiveness of the new initiative while avoiding unintended consequences. The author also cautions against hastily replicating this approach, citing examples of well-intentioned solutions that ultimately backfired.</description>

			<title>Once again, Supreme Court underlines that jail is the exception, bail is the rule</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/once-again-supreme-court-underlines-that-jail-is-the-exception-bail-is-the-rule-9540585/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" even in cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This is a significant shift from a previous ruling upholding the stringent provisions of the PMLA, amid concerns about misuse against political opponents. 

Recent judgments have introduced safeguards for the accused, such as requiring written grounds for arrests and considering prolonged pre-trial detention in bail decisions. While these steps strengthen procedural protections, the court still needs to comprehensively review its 2022 ruling on the PMLA, which potentially undermined the presumption of innocence.</description>

			<title>Derek O’Brien writes: Between 2012 Delhi rape and R G Kar, little has changed</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rg-kar-doctor-rape-delhi-derek-o-brien-9540589/</link>
			<description>Following the 2012 Delhi gang rape, numerous Members of Parliament expressed outrage and called for severe punishment for perpetrators.  They acknowledged the deep social failure that allowed such crimes to occur and emphasized the need for stronger laws and swift justice. Some called for the death penalty, while others advocated for preventive measures like educating young men about respecting women. 

Twelve years later, the issue of violence against women persists. The article cites several recent cases of horrific crimes against women and girls, emphasizing that parliamentary speeches alone are insufficient.  It calls for action, urging a commitment to turning words into tangible results.</description>

			<title>Women-only airline seats won’t solve problem of male misbehaviour</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/women-only-airline-seats-wont-solve-problem-of-male-misbehaviour-9540599/</link>
			<description>India boasts the highest proportion of women pilots globally, demonstrating progress in gender equality within the aviation industry. However, the issue of sexual safety for women passengers remains a concern. Despite existing protocols, reports of inappropriate behavior on flights continue.  Indigo Airlines' recent "pink seats" initiative, which allows women to see the gender of fellow passengers before selecting seats, aims to address this issue but may inadvertently reinforce the idea that women are responsible for their own safety.  

True solutions require a focus on perpetrator accountability and robust training for airline staff to effectively identify and handle inappropriate behavior. Isolate men rather than women to ensure a safe and comfortable flying experience for all.</description>

			<description>Facing a growing culture where work bleeds into personal time, several countries are enacting "right to disconnect" laws.  Australia is the latest, prohibiting employers from penalizing workers who don't respond to calls or texts outside work hours. This legislation stems from a larger movement emphasizing work-life balance and recognizes that technology has blurred the lines between work and leisure, leading to increased burnout. Studies show that well-rested and rejuvenated employees are more productive and creative, suggesting a win-win for both workers and companies.</description>

			<title>On RG Kar case, Mamata Banerjee must step up, not play victim</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/on-rg-kar-case-mamata-banerjee-must-step-up-not-play-victim-9540586/</link>
			<description>Mamata Banerjee's response to the R G Kar rape and murder case has been criticized as rash and desperate.  Her comments, accusing the BJP of exploiting the situation, are seen as inflammatory and deflecting from the TMC government's shortcomings in handling the crisis. The government has been faulted for its initial handling, including failing to inform the family, investigating as "unnatural death," and poorly addressing the subsequent vandalism at the hospital. 

While Banerjee has called for swift justice and harsher punishments, many believe that true reform requires a more comprehensive approach rather than simply relying on stricter laws.</description>

			<title>R G Kar case is not about violence against a healthcare worker — it is violence against a woman</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rg-kar-rape-murder-doctor-9540584/</link>
			<description>The horrific sexual violence at RG Kar hospital should be seen as a case of assault against a woman, not primarily a workplace safety issue for healthcare workers.  

 While it's important to ensure the safety of all healthcare workers, focusing solely on this diminishes the gravity of the sexual assault and shifts attention from the systemic issues of patriarchy and impunity that allow such crimes to occur.  

The incident highlights the need for a culture shift that addresses violence against women in all settings, not just hospitals.  It also underscores the importance of holding institutions accountable and strengthening legal frameworks to protect women.  


Ultimately, tackling sexual violence requires a multifaceted approach that includes addressing societal norms, promoting ethical practices in healthcare, and ensuring a safe and empowering experience for all healthcare users.</description>

			<title>When cringe works: Why everyone dances to ‘Lovebomber baby’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-everyone-dances-to-lovebomber-baby-9540020/</link>
			<description>The article explores the concept of "cringe" in popular culture, using examples like Kajol's outfit in "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai" and songs by Dhinchak Pooja and Gagni Porwal.  It argues that the internet allows for a democratization of art and expression, leading to both successes and spectacular failures.  We are drawn to these "cringe" moments because they offer a form of relatable authenticity and celebrate the vulnerability of putting oneself out there. The article draws parallels between "cringe" and camp, where sincerity and exaggerated effort combine to create humor and a sense of shared experience. Ultimately, it suggests that appreciating these attempts, even if imperfect, is a valuable part of online culture and a reflection of our own human desire to connect and share.</description>

			<title>A Uniform Civil Code should expand rights of women and young, not restrict them</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uniform-civil-code-women-rights-9539655/</link>
			<description>Two Op-Eds arguing for Prime Minister Modi's call for a "secular civil code"  fail to clearly define what such a code would entail. Both focus on the need to reform Muslim personal law, overlooking the broader context of women's rights and the historical resistance to a uniform civil code.

The original push for a uniform civil code in the Constituent Assembly faced opposition from both Hindu and minority groups, leading to a compromise focusing on a common Hindu civil code which ultimately fell short of achieving women's rights.  

The Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code,  which mirrors these older provisions, raises concerns about its potential to be divisive and detrimental to women's freedoms.  The code restricts interfaith marriages, criminalizes early divorce, and mandates registration of live-in relationships, leaving couples vulnerable to harassment.  A timely Supreme Court judgment is needed to establish constitutional benchmarks for a women's rights-based civil code.</description>

			<title>From Salim-Javed to Kamala Harris, the fantasy of the infallible ‘Ma’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kamala-harris-salim-javed-mother-9539227/</link>
			<description>The concept of "mother" holds immense cultural significance, transcending individual experiences and shaping societal perceptions. From religious figures to cinematic portrayals, the idealized mother embodies unconditional love, sacrifice, and moral authority.  

Hindi cinema often depicts widowed or abandoned mothers as powerful figures, reflecting a cultural yearning for a nurturing, primal maternal figure.  While recent films have explored more complex mother characters, the dichotomy between "good" and "bad" mothers persists, reinforcing traditional roles.  

This idealized image of motherhood exerts influence beyond cinema, impacting political discourse where women leaders are often expected to leverage maternal qualities for legitimacy.  To challenge the status quo for women, it may require moving beyond the solely maternal narrative.</description>

			<title>Bail for K Kavitha: Time to review PMLA’s draconian provisions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bail-for-k-kavitha-time-to-review-pmlas-draconian-provisions-9538774/</link>
			<description>Recent Supreme Court judgments emphasize the principle of bail as the norm in cases under special laws like the UAPA and PMLA, aiming to prevent pretrial detention from becoming punitive. 

The ED's use of stringent PMLA provisions has faced scrutiny, with courts expressing concerns about its impact on individuals and due process. While the government highlights the ED's success in registering cases and attaching assets, critics point to allegations of bias against the opposition and concerns about the lengthy and often unresolved judicial processes.

Questions arise about the ED's capacity to handle the sheer volume of cases and potential for misuse of its powers. The Supreme Court's upcoming review of PMLA provisions is anticipated to address these concerns and potentially bring about necessary reforms to ensure a balance between combating financial crime and safeguarding individual rights.</description>

			<title>AAP’s Saurabh Bhardwaj writes: Offices of governor and L-G must be abolished</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aaps-saurabh-bhardwaj-writes-offices-of-governor-and-l-g-must-be-abolished-9538771/</link>
			<description>This article criticizes the actions of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, arguing that the position has been misused to obstruct the work of the elected government. The author contends that the L-G's role should be limited to land and law and order matters, as originally intended, and that recent interference in other areas has been detrimental to the city's progress. The article highlights several instances of alleged L-G overreach, including the appointment of unfavorable bureaucrats, blocking funds for projects, and disregarding environmental regulations.  

Despite these challenges, the author points to the achievements of the Delhi government in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, arguing that these successes demonstrate the need for a more collaborative relationship between the elected government and the L-G's office. The article concludes with a call to abolish the positions of L-G and governor, deeming them relics of colonialism that hinder democratic principles.</description>

			<title>Express View on Jan Dhan Yojana: For the underserved</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-jan-dhan-yojana-for-the-underserved-9538746/</link>
			<description>The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has significantly expanded access to formal banking services in India.  The scheme has opened over 53 crore accounts, with a majority in rural/semi-urban areas and benefiting women disproportionately. 

This financial inclusion, coupled with Aadhaar and mobile technology, has enabled Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, ensuring more efficient and accurate delivery of social welfare. The JAM trinity has also revolutionized payment systems through the Unified Payments Interface, facilitating millions of daily transactions, especially among low-income households.  

While the focus has been on account opening, the challenge remains to provide tailored financial products and services that cater to the specific needs of low-income individuals.  The Unified Lending Interface holds potential for serving those segments still excluded from formal financial services.</description>

			<title>Neither fear, nor favour: Assam Chief Minister must remember his oath of office</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/neither-fear-nor-favour-assam-chief-minister-must-remember-his-oath-of-office-9538747/</link>
			<description>Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma sparked controversy by declaring he would "take sides" and rejecting claims by Bengali Muslims, referred to as "Miya Muslims", to  "take all of Assam".  His statements followed tensions in Sivasagar stemming from a rape incident allegedly perpetrated by Bengali Muslim youths, leading to threats against those perceived as "Bangladeshis". Sarma's rhetoric is seen as alarmingly divisive, fueling communal anxieties in a state already grappling with identity issues. 

  Bengali Muslims, referred to as "Miyas", face xenophobic attacks, often portrayed by political actors as competing with indigenous Assamese for resources and cultural dominance.  Sarma's controversial statements reflect a pattern of divisive politics that exploits existing insecurities, contradicting the Prime Minister's call for adherence to constitutional morality.</description>

			<title>P B Mehta writes: Uncharted territory for India’s governance matrix</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/p-b-mehta-writes-uncharted-territory-for-indias-governance-matrix-9538745/</link>
			<description>The recent election results have significantly impacted India's governance landscape. The Prime Minister's authority has suffered a decline, both domestically and in his ability to understand public sentiment. This, coupled with internal party dissension, has created a sense of vacuum at the top of the government.

The BJP is increasingly resorting to tactics that exacerbate institutional conflict, evident in their approach towards states under opposition rule and the use of inflammatory rhetoric.  

Furthermore, despite electoral setbacks, the BJP remains committed to the Hindutva agenda, further dividing the nation. Routine governance remains absent, and the government is likely to rely on welfare populism and communal mobilization to appease its base. 

The opposition is emboldened and ready to challenge the ruling party, while the judiciary, though imperfect, offers some resistance against government overreach. This volatile combination sets the stage for an unpredictable governance trajectory for India.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-good-faith-how-to-ensure-that-our-boys-grow-into-good-men-9538743/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the increasing violence against female caregivers in India, highlighting the complex factors contributing to this issue. It argues that societal misogyny, lack of support systems, and a changing cultural landscape, marked by a rise in toxic masculinity and a disregard for respect, are key drivers of this violence. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes by promoting gender sensitivity, peaceful conflict resolution, and empathy from a young age. 

It calls for a collective effort involving families, schools, communities, and religious leaders to create a culture of respect for women and children.  The author stresses the need for strong leadership and societal change to ensure the safety and well-being of caregivers and to foster a more compassionate future.</description>

			<title>The Hema moment gives not only ‘stars’ but also the ‘extras’ a voice</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hema-moment-gives-stars-extras-voice-9537810/</link>
			<description>The Malayalam film industry is facing a crisis following allegations of sexual assault against its members. A 2017 government-appointed committee, headed by retired Justice K Hema, investigated the issue and found widespread violence against women. The committee's report, delayed in its release, shed light on the pervasive exploitation and abuse faced by women in the industry. 

The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), formed by women actors, has been instrumental in supporting survivors and demanding accountability. Their efforts have emboldened other women to come forward, highlighting the deep-rooted misogyny within the industry. The situation has sparked a reckoning, forcing the industry to confront its culture of silence and  the need for systemic change to create a safe and equitable space for women.</description>

			<title>Bail for K Kavitha: Without personal liberty, all other rights are meaningless</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bail-for-k-kavitha-without-personal-liberty-all-other-rights-are-meaningless-9537333/</link>
			<description>Recent Supreme Court of India judgments have reemphasized the fundamental right to life and personal liberty, affirming that this right supersedes restrictive statutory provisions in penal statutes when considering bail. 

The court has stressed that bail should be the rule, with refusal being the exception. 

It has criticized lower courts for denying bail in deserving cases and highlighted the need for speedy trials. The court has also clarified that custodial interrogation is not necessary after charges have been filed, and questioned the fairness of prosecution agencies in using co-accused statements without corroboration.  Beyond bail, theSC has protected procedural rights, such as providing written grounds for arrest and ensuring timely access to legal counsel.  These decisions reflect the judiciary's commitment to individual freedom and checks on executive power, even in times of political shifts.</description>

			<title>For me, a first-generation immigrant born in India, anticipating Kamala Harris’s presidency is exciting and cautionary</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/first-generation-immigrant-born-in-india-anticipating-kamala-harris-presidency-9537170/</link>
			<description>The author, a first-generation Indian immigrant, discusses Kamala Harris's historic potential as the first woman, Black woman, Caribbean American, and Asian American President. While celebrating Harris's nomination, she acknowledges the current climate of racial tension in the US, exacerbated by policies that target diversification. 

The author highlights the unique challenges faced by Indian Americans, who despite being a growing political force, are still subject to racial discrimination and navigate issues like H-1B visas and precarious immigration realities. She criticizes Harris's attempts to appease White voters by emphasizing her commitment to national security and separating "good" immigrants from "bad" ones. 

Despite these criticisms, the author recognizes the significance of Harris's candidacy, particularly for young people of color who see themselves reflected in her story.  She believes Harris's presidency, while not without its challenges, offers hope and inspiration for immigrants and marginalized communities.</description>

			<title>Supriya Sule writes: The people’s voice is finally being heard in Parliament</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/parliament-opposition-supriya-sule-9536702/</link>
			<description>The 2024 Lok Sabha elections resulted in a more balanced Parliament, leading to a different dynamic compared to the previous sessions. The increased Opposition strength has made it harder for the government to pass legislation without debate and has forced them to reconsider certain decisions. 

Significant improvements include a longer discussion on the Union Budget and the referral of contentious bills to Parliamentary Committees.  However, concerns remain regarding the government's transparency, as leaks of bills prior to formal circulation continue.  

Despite calls for greater inclusivity, the government has yet to fill the vacant Deputy Speaker position and has shown reluctance to allot sufficient time for Opposition-led discussions.  These actions, coupled with restricted media access to Parliament proceedings, raise concerns about the government's commitment to a truly democratic and transparent legislative process.</description>

			<title>New Pension Scheme favours a small minority at the expense of majority of uncovered elderly</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/new-pension-scheme-favours-a-small-minority-at-the-expense-of-majority-of-uncovered-elderly-9536701/</link>
			<description>The recent revision of the New Pension Scheme (NPS) in India has sparked debate. While the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) aims to harmonize benefits with the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), critics argue it merely increases government expenditure on existing pensioners and fails to address the core objectives of pension reform. 

The government's focus on aligning benefits with the OPS has been criticized for favoring a small percentage of government employees while neglecting the vast majority of workers and elderly who lack access to institutional pension schemes. 

Experts emphasize the need to reallocate resources from existing pension provisions to expand worker and elderly coverage, highlighting the need for a social contract that promotes inter- and intra-generational equity in public expenditure on old age income support.</description>

			<description>Delhi's population surge, nearing 43 million in the next decade, raises concerns about the city's infrastructure preparedness. The recent monsoon exposed severe infrastructure shortcomings, highlighting failures in managing waterlogging, sanitation, and overall civic services. The rapid growth of unauthorized colonies lacks basic amenities like roads, drainage, and sanitation.  While the government highlights its development projects, citizens grapple with inadequate water supply, overflowing drains, and unsafe living conditions.  The healthcare system faces challenges with the lack of essential medical equipment and staffing in new facilities. Delhi's air quality remains poor, with garbage management a significant concern.  Growing hostility towards other administrative agencies and the judiciary further hampers effective governance.</description>

			<title>PM Jan Dhan Yojana has accelerated financial inclusion, reduced inequalities</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-jan-dhan-yojana-has-accelerated-financial-inclusion-reduced-inequalities-9536553/</link>
			<description>The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has significantly improved financial inclusion in India, with over 80% of adults now having a formal financial account. Launched in 2014, the scheme aimed to include unbanked households by providing basic savings bank deposit accounts. PMJDY accounts have disbursed Rs 38.49 lakh crore through direct benefit transfer (DBT) and plugged leakages worth Rs 3.48 lakh crore.  

The success of the scheme is evident in the increase in account balances, with 55.6% belonging to women, and 66.6% located in rural and semi-urban areas.  The  initiative has also led to a decrease in thefts and consumption of intoxicants in several states. Looking ahead, strengthening the financial ecosystem, expanding product penetration, enhancing consumer protection, and designing customer-centric products are key priorities.  Linking PMJDY accounts with other government schemes will further empower individuals at the bottom of the pyramid.</description>

			<description>Following the announcement of Jammu &amp; Kashmir Assembly election dates, political activity has intensified in the region. The  National Conference and Congress have forged a seat-sharing arrangement, with the NC contesting 51 seats and the Congress 32. This alliance seems to favor Congress, aiming to revive its presence in the state, while the NC seeks to regain its dominant role. However, the alliance faces challenges due to differing stances on issues like Article 370.  Both the BJP and the PDP, previous major players, appear vulnerable. The BJP contends with resistance from allies on various issues, impacting its perceived strength. The PDP, meanwhile, grapples with diminished influence after 2019.  Despite these uncertainties, the return of political engagement is a positive development for the region.</description>

			<title>To make India more climate-resilient, India Meteorological Department’s upgrade is necessary</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/india-meteorological-department-climate-9536545/</link>
			<description>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is planning to upgrade its weather forecasting capabilities to better predict extreme weather events.  While the IMD has made progress in long-range predictions, it struggles with hyper-local forecasts of intense rainfall, leading to unpreparedness for disasters. The new focus will be on developing computer models tailored to specific local areas, requiring more detailed data collection and a denser network of measuring instruments. AI is expected to play a role in analyzing existing weather records and improving forecast accuracy. Collaboration with universities and research institutions is also crucial. Effective communication of weather information, considering local context and vulnerabilities, will be essential for building climate resilience.</description>

			<title>In new criminal codes, a missed opportunity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-new-criminal-codes-a-missed-opportunity-9536700/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the recent amendments to India's criminal justice system, specifically the Indian Penal Code (IPC). While acknowledging the need for some changes, the author argues that the new legislation, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), does not adequately address the challenges of the 21st century, particularly those arising from technological advancements. 

The author points out the absence of provisions specifically dealing with cybercrime, data theft, and other offences prevalent in the digital age. They criticize the BNS for not including clear definitions and safeguards against potential misuse of powers related to  "economic security" and "economic offences."  

Furthermore, the article highlights concerns regarding the gender-neutrality of certain provisions, the criminalization of suicide attempts, and the lack of consideration for practices like hunger strikes. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for the law to evolve and adapt to the rapid advancements in technology and societal norms.</description>

			<title>‘Kalki 2898 AD’ on OTT: Indian cinema’s problem lies in its lazy piggybacking on the Ramayana and Mahabharata</title>

			<description>The article discusses the success of the film Kalki 2898 AD, noting its reliance on familiar tropes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. While acknowledging the broad appeal of these epics, the author argues that this consistent retelling, particularly in simplified and regressive forms, hinders Indian cinema from developing new archetypes and voices. 

The article contrasts this approach with Hollywood, which also recycles stories but often lacks the depth of meaning found in Indian epics. It suggests that Indian cinema should learn from Hollywood's shortcomings and strive for originality, exploring more nuanced and contemporary interpretations of classic narratives. The author ultimately concludes that while these epics remain a part of Indian identity, their constant rehashing may not be beneficial for the 21st century.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the inadequate conversation surrounding sexual violence in India. 

It highlights the tendency to focus on the graphic details of assaults, the victim's actions leading up to the incident, and the outrage that is selectively reserved for certain victims based on their social standing.  The elephant in the room,  the patriarchal culture that perpetuates these acts,  is often ignored. 

The piece further delves into the victim-blaming mentality prevalent in society, where women are held responsible for preventing assault. 

It criticizes the focus on quick justice solutions like capital punishment, arguing that it overlooks the systemic issues at play.  The article concludes by emphasizing the need to acknowledge and address the deeply ingrained patriarchy that enables sexual violence to thrive.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-a-woman-of-colour-in-the-us-my-hope-for-vice-president-kamala-harris-is-greater-than-my-fear-9535146/</link>
			<description>An American author reflects on the historic nomination of Kamala Harris, the first woman of color to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President. 

While her accomplishment should be a source of joy, the author feels a sense of dread, knowing the inevitable prejudice and  low expectations Harris will face. The author highlights the often subtle but pervasive ways in which women of color are judged and undervalued, drawing parallels between Harris's experiences and her own.  The author recognizes the strength and resilience required for Harris to navigate these challenges, but fears the cost this will have on her well-being.  Ultimately, she expresses hope for Harris's presidency, hoping it will lead to a more equitable future for women of color.</description>

			<title>Unified Pension Scheme is a win-win for states, Centre and people</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unified-pension-scheme-is-a-win-win-for-states-centre-and-people-9534617/</link>
			<description>The Maharashtra government's decision to adopt the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) framework is a significant win for cooperative federalism.  This moves counters the trend of some states returning to the unsustainable Old Pension Scheme (OPS) as it maintains  the contributory and funded nature of pensions, ensuring long-term fiscal stability. The UPS provides certainty to pensioners while strengthening state finances, allowing them to prioritize capital expenditure and boost economic growth.  

In addition to the UPS adoption, the Centre's initiatives such as increased special assistance for capital investment and tighter regulations on off-budget borrowings demonstrate a commitment to supporting state finances and promoting transparency. These combined efforts aim to create a more robust and sustainable financial framework for both the central and state governments, ultimately benefiting citizens and enabling greater economic progress.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the decline of political thought in modern India.  It argues that while India once had a strong tradition of political thinkers who grappled with fundamental questions about the nation's direction, this tradition has waned since the mid-20th century.  The author attributes this decline to a lack of imagination, understanding, and judgment in contemporary Indian politics.  While acknowledging exceptions, such as movements focused on feminism, social justice, and critiques of development, the article emphasizes the need for a renewed focus on robust political thought to address the challenges facing India.</description>

			<title>The secret to a long life? Those who lived one can’t tell you</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/the-secret-to-a-long-life-those-who-lived-one-cant-tell-you-9534589/</link>
			<description>Maria Branyas Morera, who lived to 117, offered simple advice for a long life: order, tranquility, family, nature, emotional stability, positivity, and avoiding toxic people.  While her longevity is remarkable, there's no scientific evidence to suggest these are universal keys to a long life.  Reaching such extreme ages is so rare that it's more about being lucky than following specific guidelines. 

The most important lesson from elders, however, is not about living long but living well.  In a society focused on consumption and accumulation, Morera's life teaches us to find happiness in the journey, not just the destination.</description>

			<title>Kamala Harris and climate change: Setting green terms</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-and-climate-change-setting-green-terms-9534594/</link>
			<description>The upcoming US presidential election will see contrasting views on climate change between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. While Harris positioned climate action as a “fundamental freedom” during the Democratic National Convention, Trump has focused on domestic oil production as a solution to high energy costs, framing it within economic nationalism.  

Despite campaign promises to reduce drilling, the Biden administration has faced criticism for approving oil drilling projects. Harris, who initially advocated for a fracking ban, has softened her stance. Environmentalists stress the need for significant energy sector changes to address global warming, and the election will reveal how the Harris campaign navigates this complex issue.</description>

			<title>Express View on reception of Hema Committee report: Steps in a journey</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-reception-of-hema-committee-report-steps-in-a-journey-9534593/</link>
			<description>The release of the Justice Hema Committee report has sparked a wave of accusations of sexual misconduct within the Malayalam film industry. Prominent figures have resigned, and a special police team has been formed to investigate the allegations. This signifies a potential shift towards accountability, but the journey toward justice is long and complex. It stems from years of activism, including the 2017 Malayalam film industry assault case, the 2012 Delhi gangrape, and the 2018 MeToo movement. 

Change requires tackling power imbalances and ensuring the voices of the vulnerable are heard.  New laws and stricter punishments are needed, but addressing systemic issues that enable abuse is equally crucial.  Protecting women's dignity is a shared responsibility of society and the government.</description>

			<description>The hijacking of an Indian Airlines Boeing 737 from Dubai ended after nearly two days, with the safe arrival of 73 passengers and six crew members in Delhi.  The hostages, held captive by seven pro-Khalistan youths, were released following Pakistan's decision to refuel the aircraft.  Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi remained noncommittal about her party's continued support for the Bhaskara Rao ministry in Andhra Pradesh.  In a separate development, 42 life convicts at Tihar Jail threatened a hunger strike demanding prompt hearings before the Sentence Revising Board.</description>

			<title>Awami League lost touch with people, students. But reformed, it deserves political space in Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/awami-league-reformed-political-bangladesh-9534076/</link>
			<description>The Awami League faced mounting challenges in the years leading up to its significant downfall.  The Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict led to a tightening of control by the government, isolating it from critical social and economic concerns. 

Economic mismanagement,  fueled by corruption and a failure to address institutional dysfunction, fueled public discontent.  The government's handling of social movements,  perceived as confrontational and dismissive, further exacerbated the situation.  The party's refusal to engage with dissenting voices and its suppression of internal diversity contributed to its decline.  This crisis of moral authority necessitates a fundamental restructuring of the Awami League, including a sincere apology for past mistakes and a commitment to democratic values. Rebuilding trust and credibility will be crucial for the party to regain public support and emerge as a force for positive change.</description>

			<title>I am Indian-American and a first-time voter. Watching Kamala Harris live in Chicago melted my cynicism</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kamala-harris-chicago-live-indian-american-cynicism-9533857/</link>
			<description>The article recounts the author's experience at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, where Kamala Harris was nominated as Joe Biden's running mate. The author, a young Indian-American woman, was struck by the historic significance of the event and Harris's nomination, noting the palpable energy and excitement in the atmosphere. 

Harris's campaign emphasized American values and her qualifications as a prosecutor and public servant, rather than her identity as a woman or person of color. The author observed that while Harris did not shy away from her racial identity, she focused on policy differences with Donald Trump. The convention was seen as a sign of a surge in momentum for the Democratic campaign, with many people feeling inspired to vote, especially young people. Ultimately, the author decided to vote for Harris because she saw her as a symbol of radical change and progress for America.</description>

			<title>‘Angry Young Men’: Why Deewar’s Vijay may not be so different from Animal’s Vijay</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/angry-young-men-deewar-vijay-animal-9533654/</link>
			<description>The article examines the evolution of male archetypes in Indian culture, contrasting Vikram Seth's depiction of the "cad" with the "Angry Young Man" trope popularized by Salim-Javed in Bollywood.  It argues that the "cad," despite potential flaws, embodies a more nuanced and complex masculinity, subject to both admiration and judgment. The "Angry Young Man," characterized by anger and violence, is seen as problematic for potentially excusing harmful behavior.  

The author criticizes the recent documentary on Salim-Javed for its hagiographic approach, failing to adequately address the problematic representations of women in their films. Ultimately, the article suggests that the "Cad," being subject to both desire and scrutiny from women, represents a more desirable form of masculinity compared to the potentially violent and simplistic "Angry Young Man."</description>

			<description>Hijackers who seized an Indian Airlines plane over Pathankot surrendered in the United Arab Emirates after 38 hours, releasing all passengers and crew unharmed in exchange for passage to the United States. 

Opposition parties held "all-India protest day" demonstrations against the dismissal of the Andhra Pradesh Rama Rao ministry, resulting in some violent incidents.  The Election Commission decided to use the 1971 electoral rolls as the basis for future revisions in Assam. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi denied reports of an Indian invasion plan for Sri Lanka, stating there was no such plan then or in the future. Lastly, the government introduced the Unified Pension Scheme, guaranteeing a 50% pension for central government employees who joined service in 2004 or later.</description>

			<title>Unified pension scheme raises the risk of higher burden on the exchequer</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/unified-pension-scheme-raises-the-risk-of-higher-burden-on-the-exchequer-9533004/</link>
			<description>The Indian government has introduced a new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees. The UPS combines elements of both the old and new pension schemes, offering a defined benefit of 50% of an employee's average basic pay upon retirement.  The government's contribution will increase to 18.5% of the employee's basic salary, while employees will continue to contribute 10%. This change is expected to increase the government's financial burden on pension payments by Rs 6,250 crore in the first year.  The UPS comes amidst a resurgence of support for the old pension scheme in several states, raising concerns about the sustainability of such a defined benefit structure for all government employees.</description>

			<title>Hema Committee report: It can happen only in Kerala</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hema-committee-report-sexual-harassment-exploitation-of-women-in-malayalam-cinema-9532955/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Hema Committee report on sexual harassment and exploitation in Malayalam cinema, focusing on the unique context of Kerala.  It argues that the report's revelations are not surprising given the history of patriarchal structures within the industry and the collision between traditional power dynamics and the increasing education and empowerment of women in Kerala.  

The writer emphasizes the importance of the Women in Cinema Collective's (WCC) struggle, which led to the report's formation, highlighting how educated, middle-class women in Kerala challenged the industry's feudal practices. While acknowledging the resistance to change and the limitations of government action, the article expresses hope for a transformation of societal norms in Kerala through continued discourse and activism.</description>

			<title>Whether it is President Trump or President Harris, US-India relations must continue on an upward arc</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/whether-it-is-president-trump-or-president-harris-us-india-relations-must-continue-on-an-upward-arc-9532976/</link>
			<description>India's relationship with the US has been steadily improving over the past two and a half decades, regardless of the political party in power.  The US is now India's most important partner across various sectors, from trade and technology to national security. A robust and multi-faceted engagement, including strong Congressional support and involvement from the business sector, further strengthens this bond. 

While President Biden's policies are well-known, Vice President Harris's foreign policy approach remains slightly ambiguous. However, her actions and rhetoric suggest continuity in areas crucial for India, such as immigration reform, trade, technology, and Eurasian security. Key areas of convergence, such as countering Chinese influence in Asia, are likely to continue under a Harris administration. 


Maintaining this strong relationship requires sustained effort from both sides. India should address potential disagreements proactively and work towards deepening the partnership in various domains.</description>

			<title>MUDRA 2.0 loans should target greater equity, deepen financial literacy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mudra-2-0-loans-should-target-greater-equity-deepen-financial-literacy-9532994/</link>
			<description>The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) has been a significant initiative for empowering small and micro businesses in India.  The scheme has disbursed over 27.75 lakh crore to 47 crore entrepreneurs, with a high proportion going to women and marginalized groups, promoting financial inclusion and economic growth.  While successful, PMMY faces challenges such as uneven regional distribution of loans, inadequate monitoring, and financial literacy gaps among beneficiaries. This has led to higher NPAs in certain categories and hindered the scheme's full potential. 

Moving forward, MUDRA 2.0 needs to focus on strengthening outreach in rural areas, enhancing financial literacy programs, implementing a robust credit guarantee mechanism, and improving monitoring and evaluation systems.  These measures will help ensure that the benefits of the scheme reach the intended beneficiaries and contribute to sustainable economic development.</description>

			<description>A high-level committee, headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind, has recommended simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies in India. The committee, formed to suggest concrete implementation measures for simultaneous elections, analyzed public opinion, expert insights, and legal provisions. While 80% of the 21,558 responses received favored the concept, opposing parties raised concerns about marginalization of regional players and a potential shift towards a presidential form of governance.  The report proposed amendments to the Constitution, including a new article  "simultaneous elections"  would mean general elections for the Lok Sabha and all Vidhan Sabhas together, excluding Panchayat elections which would be held within 100 days.  The committee emphasized the need for a single electoral roll and acknowledged the logistical challenges and increased expenditure required for simultaneous polls.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape-murder: When a chief minister’s protest becomes a symbol of state abdication</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kolkata-rape-murder-chief-minister-protest-state-abdication-9532140/</link>
			<description>The rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee doctor in Kolkata has sparked widespread protests and ignited a national debate on safety and security, particularly for women. 

The incident has drawn parallels to the 2012 Delhi rape case, highlighting a disturbing trend of violence against women. Political leaders, from differing parties, have expressed concern and called for stronger action against perpetrators. 

A historical figure, Dr Radha Gobinda Kar, whose  hospital the victim worked at, is also being invoked in this context, as his dedication to healthcare resonates with the protesters' demand for a better and safer Bengal. Public anger over the crime stems from a perceived breakdown in law and order and a sense that the state has failed to protect its citizens.  The protests reflect a collective yearning for change, better governance, and a society where women can live without fear.</description>

			<title>Truth about women’s abuse in Malayalam cinema is out. Does anyone really care?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/women-abuse-malayalam-cinema-justice-hema-committee-report-9532112/</link>
			<description>The Hema Committee report, examining workplace issues for women in the Malayalam film industry, exposed  serious sexual harassment and widespread exploitation. However, the response to the report has been marred by apathy, sensationalism, and a focus on individual experiences rather than systemic issues. 

There is a tendency to deflect responsibility and cast doubt on the validity of women's experiences, while simultaneously suggesting they should pursue legal action despite the challenges involved. The report's damning findings highlight the need for concrete action, not mere lip service. The Kerala government, lauded for its initial steps towards gender inclusion, now faces a critical juncture: will it succumb to apathy or demonstrate the political will to implement meaningful change?</description>

			<description>Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix, advocates for a highly competitive work environment based on his "Keeper Test," where employees are constantly evaluated and those deemed unworthy are swiftly let go.  This approach, while fostering freedom for high performers, creates a climate of fear and anxiety.  The system is compared to a sports team with players constantly vying for their position, and critics argue it reflects a primal "survival of the fittest" mentality within the modern workplace. Hastings' ideology, while successful for Netflix, raises concerns about the long-term impact on employee well-being and the sustainability of a workplace built on constant pressure and elimination.</description>

			<title>50 years ago, a nurse was attacked in a Mumbai hospital. What changed, what didn’t</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/50-years-ago-a-nurse-was-attacked-in-a-mumbai-hospital-what-changed-what-didnt-9531412/</link>
			<description>In 1973, nurse Aruna Shanbaug was sexually assaulted and left in a vegetative state by a colleague at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. The attacker, a contract sweeper, was convicted of attempted murder and robbery, but not sexual assault. 

Aruna lived in a hospital ward for 42 years until her death in 2015.  Her case highlighted the vulnerability of women health workers and sparked discussion about passive euthanasia.  

Despite Aruna's case and other incidents of violence against women in healthcare settings, concerns surrounding safety and security for women in healthcare remain largely unaddressed.</description>

			<title>Inside Track by Coomi Kapoor: Family Friction</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coomi-kapoor-family-friction-9531427/</link>
			<description>A recent rape and murder at a medical college in Kolkata has exposed a rift between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. While Abhishek demands harsh punishment for the accused, Mamata faced criticism for her handling of the case, including alleged attempts to protect a tainted former principal. Tensions within the ruling Trinamool Congress party have heightened following the incident.  In unrelated news, the ousting of former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power has led to India hosting her in a state of limbo. Seeking asylum, Hasina is currently stuck in India as the UK has delayed its response to her request. This situation has sparked concerns about the potential for political instability in the region, especially in West Bengal.</description>

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: Rape as a political weapon</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tavleen-singh-writes-rape-as-a-political-weapon-9531411/</link>
			<description>The article criticizes the Indian political establishment for its inadequate response to the rampant issue of rape in the country. It argues that politicians' insistence on not "politicizing" these crimes reveals their lack of empathy and genuine commitment to addressing the root causes of sexual violence. The author highlights instances where certain rapes garner political attention while others are ignored, depending on their sensitivity to ruling parties. The article further condemns the freeing of convicts in the Bilkis Bano case and the RSS chief's dismissive remarks regarding the prevalence of rape in India. It emphasizes the need for the media to shed light on every case and calls upon political leaders to prioritize justice and safety for women by enforcing existing laws and preventing further victimization.</description>

			<title>P Chidambaram writes: Vision or division</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/p-chidambaram-writes-vision-or-division-9531409/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 11th consecutive Independence Day speech, his longest yet,  focused on India's progress but also drew criticism for targeting a segment of the population. Modi labeled those who oppose the nation's development as having a "perverse mindset," raising concerns about his tone vis-a-vis democratic dissent. 

The speech also reiterated support for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and One Nation, One Election (ONOE), sparking debate. The PM characterized existing personal law codes as "communal," a statement seen by some as biased and lacking understanding of the nuances involved.  He called for a "secular civil code,"  a goal that requires extensive consultations and careful consideration. 
 
 Modi's speech remained divisive, continuing with rhetoric targeting the Congress party and raising concerns about potential further division through policies like the UCC and ONOE.  The speech's inflammatory language fueled fears that the government might push through legislation that could exacerbate societal rifts.</description>

			<title>In Bangladesh press, a question: Should students be allowed to protest?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-press-question-should-students-allowed-protest-9530990/</link>
			<description>A survey by Prothom Alo revealed strong public support for ending student politics in Bangladesh, attributed to frustration with the current system.  While some outlets see this sentiment as a sign of disillusionment, others view the student protests as a positive force for change, demonstrating youth activism and a renewed sense of hope for democracy. 

Recent floods in eastern Bangladesh, affecting hundreds of thousands and causing casualties, have sparked debate about  India’s role. While India denies opening its Dumbur dam, contributing to the flooding, some Bangladeshi publications see it as a factor.  The focus, however, remains on relief efforts and helping those affected by the disaster.</description>

			<title>After PM Modi’s historic visit to Ukraine, a question: Do Kyiv, the West really want India to play a role in mediating with Russia?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pm-modi-historic-visit-ukraine-question-kyviv-west-india-role-russia-9530985/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine reflects India's intricate balancing act between its desire for peace and its strategic ties with Russia.  While affirming its commitment to international law and a peaceful resolution, India appears hesitant to adopt measures that would significantly antagonize Russia, such as halting oil imports.  

This approach echoes India's stance during the Soviet-Afghan War, where the US pushed for India's influence on Russia but ultimately restricted India's role in shaping the post-withdrawal scenario.  

The current situation presents a similar dilemma for India as the geopolitical landscape is shaped by competing interests between the US-led West and China-Russia alliance.  While PM Modi emphasizes dialogue and innovative solutions, Ukraine's expectations for a more assertive Indian role remain unclear.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-historic-visit-ukraine-question-kyviv-west-india-role-russia-9530985/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ukraine highlighted India's commitment to peace and diplomacy in the conflict.  

While India publicly supports international law and territorial integrity, its pragmatism is evident in its willingness to engage all stakeholders to find practical solutions for peace. India's position is complex, balancing its historical ties with Russia and its desire to uphold global order.  

While Western powers and Ukraine may want India to exert more pressure on Russia, there is no indication that they seek a significant Indian intervention. Nonetheless, India's role as a global player is evolving, and its efforts to mediate the conflict could contribute to finding a lasting solution.  

The visit marks a step forward in India-Ukraine relations, which have historically been strained, but presents challenges in navigating the geopolitical complexities of the conflict.</description>

			<title>Express View on Modi-Zelenskyy meet: Momentous in Kyiv</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-modi-zelenskyy-momentous-kyiv-9530880/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv marks a significant shift in India's foreign policy by rebalancing its relations with Russia and Ukraine.  India's previous avoidance of high-level engagement with post-Soviet Ukraine and Central European countries has ended, signalling a departure from past deference to Russia. Modi's visit to Kyiv signifies a correction to India's approach regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Notably, India has spoken out against Russia's actions, emphasized its commitment to territorial sovereignty, and expressed empathy for the Ukrainian people.

This rebalancing does not diminish India's relationship with Russia but rather elevates its engagement with Ukraine and Central Europe. India's reorientation is a clear indication that 21st-century realities will guide its European policies, moving away from 20th-century ideological constraints.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape case: From Pakistan to India, the same misogyny</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kolkata-rape-case-pakistan-india-same-misogyny-9530671/</link>
			<description>A recent rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata has sparked outrage and protests in India and Pakistan, highlighting the pervasive issue of violence against women, particularly in the medical field.  Female doctors face a lack of safety measures and often experience harassment and intimidation from patients and their attendants.  

Similar incidents have occurred in Pakistan,  leading to calls for better protection and an end to the misogynistic attitudes that contribute to these crimes.  Protests and online campaigns emphasize the need for a societal shift to create safe workplaces for women.  While laws exist against sexual assault, the problem persists due to societal norms, lack of reporting, and inadequate enforcement.  Addressing the root cause of this violence, the desire for power and control over women, is crucial to ensuring a future where women, including doctors, can work and live without fear.</description>

			<title>Why RBI’s attempts to control the Rupee can have adverse consequences</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-rbis-attempts-to-control-the-rupee-can-have-adverse-consequences-9529975/</link>
			<description>The article argues that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent regulatory measures aimed at managing the Indian rupee's volatility are misguided. It contends that currency fluctuations are a natural market response and that using regulations for currency control introduces uncertainty and increases business costs.  Three examples are given: prohibiting speculative trading in rupee-linked derivatives, regulating offshore trading platforms, and instructing banks on trading positions.  The authors believe these actions damage market liquidity, hinder trading, and undermine the RBI's primary role of ensuring financial system stability. They advocate for a market-driven approach to exchange rate management instead.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-jk-assembly-elections-could-end-the-domination-of-family-run-parties-9529974/</link>
			<description>Jammu and Kashmir is set to hold its first assembly elections since becoming a Union Territory in 2019. The elections, spanning three phases, will see major political players including national parties like the BJP and Congress, and regional parties like the NC and PDP vying for power. 

The BJP holds a strong presence in the Jammu region, while the NC hopes to regain its influence in the Kashmir Valley. The emergence of a pro-separatist outfit, the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by Engineer Rashid, adds another dimension to the political landscape. 

The NC's election manifesto, focusing on the restoration of Article 370 and the release of detainees, has sparked controversy, drawing criticism for its alleged separatist agenda and disregard for Jammu's marginalized communities. The elections are expected to be closely contested, with the outcome potentially shaping the future of the region.</description>

			<title>How not to tax multi-national corporations</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-not-to-tax-multi-national-corporations-9529969/</link>
			<description>Recent years have seen a push for a more equitable global tax system.  After the global financial crisis, the OECD spearheaded an initiative that included  15 action points to address  profit-shifting by multinationals.  However, disagreements emerged around the allocation of taxing rights for large tech companies. This led to frustration among developing nations and ultimately a call for a UN-led global tax convention. Despite resistance from developed countries like the US and UK, 125 nations, including India, voted in favor of the convention. The UN has now released a draft convention, which aims to address tax avoidance and evasion, particularly by high-net-worth individuals While promoting sovereignty, it also seeks a fair allocation of taxing rights. However, the success of the UN-led initiative hinges on its ability to overcome both logistical challenges, such as duplicate efforts, and political hurdles, including divergent economic interests.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/time-to-reset-the-gst-system-9529971/</link>
			<description>While GST revenues have been robust, many states oppose changing the five existing tax slabs. However, experts argue that when collections are strong, it's the perfect time to rationalize rates.  This includes reducing the number of slabs and reviewing the items under each one.  The current system is confusing and unfair, with discrepancies in rates for similar products like cement, milk, and edible oils.  Simplifying the slabs would promote economic growth and ultimately lead to higher tax revenues. States should also explore non-tax revenue sources like user charges and property registrations to boost the economy.</description>

			<description>The article critiques the withdrawal of India's lateral entry scheme for government positions.  

It argues that the scheme, aimed at bringing in external professionals, is necessary to improve governance and address complex development challenges. 

The author contends that  competence and commitment, rather than caste, should be paramount in public service.  They criticize the opposition to lateral entry, particularly from those who prioritize quotas, and highlight the need for a more meritocratic system that benefits all citizens, especially marginalized communities.  

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of building expertise in underrepresented groups and fostering a culture of service above all else within the government.</description>

While grief undeniably impacts all living beings, the animal kingdom also offers valuable lessons in navigating its complexities and finding strength in the face of loss.</description>

			<description>Kamala Harris's nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate was met with enthusiasm, seen as a beacon of hope after four years of political turmoil. Her campaign has emphasized her competence and compassion, drawing parallels to a religious fervor. However, her acceptance speech veered towards demonizing former President Donald Trump, employing a "bogeyman" approach that risks alienating potential voters. While the Democrats attempt to frame Harris as a unifier, concerns remain about their ability to address social issues effectively. The election promises to be a closely fought battle, with both parties striving to connect with the anxieties and aspirations of American voters.</description>

			<title>Express View on Tripura floods: Don’t leave it all to the states</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/tripura-floods-agartala-9528229/</link>
			<description>Heavy rainfall in Tripura has resulted in widespread flooding, claiming the lives of at least 10 people and displacing over 50,000. Rivers overflowing their banks have caused significant damage, particularly in the southern districts. The state government is focusing on public safety and relief efforts while the central government has pledged support. 

The floods highlight the need for improved infrastructure and disaster preparedness.  The state's climate action plan, however, lacks concrete measures to address these challenges, leaving vulnerable communities like farmers at risk.</description>

			<title>Express View: Lovebomber baby vs Taylor Swift</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/lovebomber-baby-taylor-swift-9528228/</link>
			<description>Gagni Porwal's song "Lovebomber baby," a heartfelt expression about a painful romantic experience, has unexpectedly become a viral sensation. What sets Porwal apart from past examples of viral "cringe" content, like Rebecca Black's "Friday," is the lack of malicious glee. Porwal's success might be attributed to the relatability of her story, as heartbreak is a universal experience. Additionally, her song offers a message of hope, demonstrating that even without a polished production or mainstream recognition, it's possible to create impactful art from personal experiences.</description>

			<title>How to ensure dignity for the terminally-ill</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/passive-euthanasia-terminally-ill-9528196/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's recent decision denying permission to remove a feeding tube from a patient in a vegetative state has sparked controversy regarding euthanasia in India.  While the court distinguishes between withholding life-prolonging measures in terminal cases and euthanasia, the decision raises ethical questions. Critics argue that prolonging life with no chance of recovery causes suffering for both the patient and their caregivers, and raises concerns about judges making medical decisions. The case highlights the need for legal clarity on end-of-life care in India, involving medical and ethical experts, and promoting open discussions about death and dying.</description>

			<title>Express View on ‘predatory pricing’: Market facts and spectres</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-predatory-pricing-market-facts-spectres-9528220/</link>
			<description>Minister Piyush Goyal raised concerns about predatory pricing practices by e-commerce platforms in India, highlighting the potential impact on small retailers.  While investigations have been conducted against platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Shopee, and Ola, determining predatory pricing can be complex. A report by the Pahle India Foundation suggests that e-commerce, despite rapid growth, accounted for only 7.8% of total retail sales in 2022 and has created jobs and boosted sales for many vendors. The report also found that consumers benefit from increased choice and competitive pricing.  The Competition Commission should ensure fair play, transparency, and protection of competition in the growing e-commerce market.</description>

			<title>Sanjaya Baru writes: Bangladesh crisis underlines the necessity of political risk management</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sanjaya-baru-writes-bangladesh-crisis-underlines-the-necessity-of-political-risk-management-9528195/</link>
			<description>Indian businesses are increasingly investing overseas, but often lack adequate assessment of political risk. Past incidents, like Tata's abandoned Bangladesh project and Adani's Sri Lanka troubles, highlight vulnerabilities. 

While Prime Minister Modi encourages global expansion, Indian firms rely heavily on personal connections and "political protection" rather than comprehensive risk analysis. This dependence on external factors, including government intervention, creates its own political risk.

Despite funding research institutions, Indian think tanks often focus on national security and foreign policy rather than country-specific economic and political risks. The lack of

investment in area studies and local expertise leaves businesses vulnerable to unforeseen political developments.  

A stronger emphasis on analyzing domestic politics and policies of target countries is essential for mitigating risks and ensuring successful overseas investment.</description>

			<title>When PM Modi meets President Zelenskyy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-meets-president-zelenskyy-9527618/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine is a delicate move aimed at balancing India's relationships with Russia, China, and the West.  

Following a trip to Moscow that disappointed Western allies, Modi's visit to Kyiv seeks to restore India's image as a peaceful and principled player on the world stage. While India will likely call for peace dialogue, it is not expected to act as a mediator in the war. 

The visit presents opportunities to rekindle cooperation in areas like defense, technology, and energy. India and Ukraine share historical ties, despite past disagreements, and the war has created new avenues for collaboration. Ukraine needs to rebuild its defense industry, while India seeks to modernize its own arsenal by transitioning away from Soviet-era equipment.  
 
 Both countries are leaders in digital innovation, offering potential for cooperation in e-governance. The visit is a chance for India and Ukraine to forge a stronger partnership as they navigate the complexities of the current global landscape.</description>

			<title>When a woman walks alone at night</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/when-woman-walks-alone-night-9527418/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the safety and mobility of women in cities, particularly highlighting the experiences of women in Delhi. The author recounts her personal experience as a young woman navigating the city and the changes in her behavior after dark.  She then describes the origin of safety audits conducted by women to assess safety concerns in public spaces and the subsequent advocacy work that led to various interventions aimed at improving women's safety.  

The article acknowledges the fear and limitations imposed on women due to violence and harassment, but emphasizes their continued determination to claim their right to public space and city life.  It uses the recent rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata as a stark example, demanding justice and systemic changes to ensure all women can live with dignity. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of a new urban vision that prioritizes the needs and safety of women.</description>

			<title>Centre’s lateral entry policy corrects a historical wrong</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/institutionalisation-lateral-entries-congress-9527403/</link>
			<description>The article argues that the Congress party's criticism of lateral entries in the bureaucracy is disingenuous and a tactic to deflect from its own past actions. 

It points out that the Congress has a history of making ad-hoc lateral appointments, often based on personal connections rather than merit, and that these appointments frequently lacked regard for social justice principles.  The article cites examples of Congress-era lateral entries, including those of prominent figures like Manmohan Singh and Nandan Nilekani, contrasting them with the Modi government's  emphasis on  ensuring  lateral entries  uphold  social justice and historical corrective measures. The writer suggests that the Congress is using the issue of lateral entries to gain political mileage, especially in light of their recent electoral losses.</description>

			<title>‘Stree 2’: When a headless demon’s saga comes to Bollywood’s rescue</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/stree-2-headless-demons-saga-comes-bollywood-rescue-9527343/</link>
			<description>"Stree 2: Sarkate Ka Aatank," a sequel to the 2018 successful horror-comedy, has exceeded expectations by crossing Rs 400 crore in its first week worldwide. The film capitalizes on audience familiarity with the world of Chanderi, where men are terrorized by a spirit, and delivers on the promise of action, humor, and spooky elements. Released at an advantageous time coinciding with a long weekend, it outperformed several big-budget movies earlier this year. The film highlights the importance of good storytelling and "rooted content" in attracting audiences, reminding the industry that entertaining stories with a unique perspective are what truly resonate.  While "Stree 2" leans towards humor and spectacle, it raises the question of whether future installments in the franchise will retain the social commentary and feminist themes present in the first film.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi denied consulting with the Andhra Pradesh Governor, Ram Lal, before his decision to dismiss N T Rama Rao's government.  The Governor, however, defended his actions. N T Rama Rao met with President Zail Singh and demanded the Governor's removal, the Bhaskara Rao ministry's dismissal, and his government's reinstatement. Opposition parties denounced the government's actions, while the government announced plans to create a new National Security Guard force to address extremist and terrorist activities.</description>

			<description>We are experiencing an ironic "age of content" where an overwhelming abundance of material creates a sense of boredom. Research suggests that this isn't due to the quality of content, but rather our own behavior. The constant ability to switch between options and reject things instantly prevents true engagement and immersion.  We become victims of our own choices, influenced by the algorithms that profit from our short attention spans and endless scrolling. This cycle reinforces a culture of instant gratification and undermines the ability to fully appreciate any given piece of content.</description>

			<title>Why the gap between bank credit and deposits is worrying</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/why-the-gap-between-bank-credit-and-deposits-is-worrying-9526347/</link>
			<description>The recent divergence between bank deposit and credit growth, with credit growth exceeding deposit growth, has raised concerns among policymakers.  The gap has led to banks relying more on short-term, non-retail deposits, which could lead to liquidity issues.  This trend is attributed to competitive investment avenues attracting household funds.  

The situation might intensify competition for deposits among banks, potentially driving up funding costs and impacting profitability.  It's been observed that banks are exploring innovative deposit schemes to attract funds. Credit offtake has been moderating, suggesting a possible alignment between credit growth and deposit growth. The RBI anticipates this trend to persist, although the duration is uncertain.</description>

			<description>India's large and growing middle class makes it a lucrative target for multinational corporations.  Despite claims that Indians are price-sensitive,  the success of multiplex chains like PVR demonstrates a willingness to pay more for enhanced entertainment experiences.  

However, the recent tariff hike for mobile services by Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone, though still low compared to other nations, raises questions about price sensitivity in the telecom sector. While low prices have fueled  market disruption and consumer loyalty, the hike might prompt a reevaluation of the perceived value of service quality.</description>

			<title>With PM Modi’s visit, de-hyphenating Russia, Central Europe ties</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/pm-modi-russia-central-europe-9526346/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv is a significant step for India, aiming to shape its engagement with Central Europe independent of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

India’s long-standing relationship with Russia, particularly from the Cold War era, influences its stance on the ongoing war. However,  India is increasingly recognizing the need to pursue its own interests and de-hyphenate its ties with Russia from those with Europe. 

Modi's visit is not about "compensating" for a recent trip to Russia but rather about fostering good relations with both countries. While India's role in peace talks is limited, the focus is on strengthening bilateral cooperation and discussing perspectives on resolving the conflict peacefully.</description>

			<title>Why laws on sexual violence continue to be skewed against women</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sexual-violences-law-women-9526341/</link>
			<description>A recent rape and murder case in Kolkata highlighted the deep-rooted issue of sexual impunity in India. Despite legislative changes aimed at addressing gender justice, including the renumbering of the penal code and the introduction of the death penalty for rape, crimes against women remain rampant.  

These changes have failed to create a culture of deterrence, and the state continues to fall short in providing adequate support and safety for women. Resources are allocated towards male-centric forensics while neglecting basic necessities for survivors, like providing them with items necessary after their clothes are taken for analysis. 

The criminalization of protest and the de-funding of women's organizations further exacerbate the problem. The societal response is often fueled by patriarchal bias and exposes the selective and partisan nature of the justice system. The reliance on carceral approaches and the persistence of negative stereotypes surrounding rape perpetuate a cycle of violence and impunity.</description>

			<description>The article criticizes the recent UPSC advertisement for lateral entry into government positions, arguing that the lack of reservation provisions perpetuates social inequality and marginalizes Dalits and ST communities. It contends that meritocratic ideals don't address systemic biases that disadvantage these groups, leading to their exclusion from decision-making bodies. The author calls for a more inclusive and equitable approach, urging for a review of the reservation policy and  transparent recruitment processes. They emphasize the importance of representation from marginalized communities to ensure diverse perspectives and counter the hegemonic dominance of certain social groups.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/railway-jobs-pm-cares-funds-internet-shutdowns-evasions-modi-government-parliament-9525657/</link>
			<description>Questions asked in Parliament are increasingly being rejected under various pretexts, such as "sensitive nature" or "hypothetical propositions." This trend contradicts the historical practice of allowing a wider range of questions. 

The government's unwillingness to disclose information about the cost of the new Parliament building, internet shutdown orders, petroleum imports, and even the delay in conducting Census 2021 raises concerns about transparency. 

Furthermore, the quality of answers provided has also declined, often resorting to evasiveness and semantic gymnastics. This decline in parliamentary discourse weakens the ability of MPs to effectively scrutinize the executive branch, ultimately undermining democratic governance.</description>

The author recalls past experiences of the hospital's squalid conditions and the broken sense of community among students.  This tragic event is placed within a larger context of anxieties surrounding education and competition for secure positions in India. The author cites instances of drowning deaths in a Delhi coaching center and the NEET question leak fiasco, pointing to the immense pressure and vulnerability of young aspirants for a better future. The article concludes by questioning the very purpose of education and training in a system where even those pursuing noble professions are unsafe, urging readers to consider the grim realities faced by aspiring doctors, engineers, and civil servants in India.</description>

			<title>What the government doesn’t get about public administration</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-the-government-doesnt-get-about-public-administration-9524415/</link>
			<description>The Indian government is grappling with perceptions of administrative inadequacy and exploring lateral entry from the private sector to address it. However, the article argues that this approach is misplaced. While lateral entry can be effective for specific, well-defined objectives, it's not a solution for the broader systemic issues within the civil service. 

The author contends that the core problem lies in the rigid, bureaucratic nature of the system itself, not the individuals serving within it.  They advocate for a fundamental shift in approach, drawing inspiration from models adopted by countries like Australia and New Zealand, while emphasizing the need for political ownership and coordination at both the national and state levels.</description>

			<description>The Justice Hema Committee report, released after four years, exposes the harsh reality of the Malayalam film industry for women. The report details instances of sexual harassment, lack of basic facilities, unfair remuneration, and threats. While it marks a significant step in acknowledging the issues, the report calls for more substantial action.  

Recommendations include enacting a law specific to women's concerns in the industry and establishing a dedicated tribunal to address their complaints. However, the report emphasizes the need for a fundamental shift in the industry's culture to effectively combat deeply entrenched sexism and power imbalances. It urges the industry to move beyond progressive content in films and implement real changes to ensure a safe and equitable work environment for all.</description>

			<title>Express View on lateral entry in bureaucracy: No short-cuts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-lateral-entry-in-bureaucracy-no-short-cuts-9524392/</link>
			<description>The recent cancellation of a lateral entry advertisement for 45 mid-level specialists by the Modi government, following controversies and criticism, highlights a trend of government backtracking on certain initiatives. While lateral entry has been advocated for bringing in fresh ideas and expertise, the government faced pushback concerning its potential to undermine reservation policies, particularly in light of recent electoral concerns. 

This incident underscores the need for the government to balance the demands for expertise with the principles of social justice.  The Modi government, with its reduced majority, needs to demonstrate a willingness to listen to dissenting voices, both from within its coalition and the opposition, to ensure better decision-making and more responsive policies.</description>

			<title>Kolkata rape and murder: When the law fails women</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kolkata-rape-and-murder-when-the-law-fails-women-9524396/</link>
			<description>The article argues that while laws regarding rape have been strengthened, the true issue lies in the lax treatment of other crimes against women. Dowry deaths, domestic violence, stalking, and harassment are often under-reported and inadequately punished, leading to a culture where violence against women is tolerated. The author highlights the shockingly low conviction rates in dowry death cases and the lenient bail norms for offenses like domestic violence. 

They emphasize the need for a comprehensive review of laws and judicial procedures to reflect the gravity of these crimes.  Stronger penalties, a stricter bail regime, and a fast-track justice system are crucial to deterring violence and instilling fear of the law. Until then, women will remain vulnerable and abusers emboldened.</description>

			<title>‘Productive’ sleeping: Dream a little dream</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/productive-sleeping-dream-a-little-dream-9524394/</link>
			<description>Aldous Huxley's call to "dream pragmatically" is being challenged by modern science, particularly in California, where companies are exploring lucid dreaming for productivity enhancement. 

Lucid dreaming, the ability to be aware and control dreams, has a long history and is estimated to be experienced by half the population. While some have sought to harness its creative potential, recent projects aim to turn it into a tool for learning, knowledge acquisition, and even remote control of devices. 

This commodification of dreams raises ethical concerns, blurring the line between the mystical and the mundane, and potentially diminishing the inherent inspiration and creativity of the dreaming mind.</description>

			<title>August 21, 1984, Forty Years Ago: NTR Alleges Plot</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/august-21-1984-forty-years-ago-ntr-alleges-plot-9524414/</link>
			<description>N T Rama Rao, the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, and his supporters arrived in Delhi to demonstrate their majority. Their attempt to meet the President was delayed by a technical issue. Opposition parties urged the President to remove the Governor and reinstate Rama Rao. Meanwhile, the former Governor faces legal action for alleged illegal activities during his tenure. 
The situation has created a political dilemma for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who is facing criticism for the crisis and its impact on the Opposition.</description>

			<title>PM Modi’s visit to Ukraine, Poland: India’s Central European foray</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modis-visit-ukraine-poland-central-europe-india-9524102/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine signifies India's growing interest in strengthening its ties with Central Europe.

This trip marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland since 1979 and to Ukraine since its independence.  It highlights Delhi's recognition of the region's strategic importance in the current geopolitical landscape, particularly given the ongoing war in Ukraine. 

India aims to build long-term partnerships with Poland and Ukraine, viewing its engagement with Central Europe as complementary to its relationship with Russia. 

The visits underscore India's broader strategy of elevating its diplomatic engagement with Europe, expanding beyond traditional ties with major European powers to include closer collaboration with Central European nations.   This shift is driven by factors such as Poland's economic growth and strategic location, and Ukraine's potential for post-war reconstruction.</description>

			<title>Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification of SCs, STs is blinkered to historical discrimination of Dalits</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-sc-st-dalits-9523850/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's recent verdict on sub-categorization within reservation policies, while seemingly addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, may exacerbate social tensions among Dalits. Despite the state's claims of safeguarding marginalized communities, reservation policies have failed to achieve true diversity in institutions. The implementation of these policies is flawed, with reserved posts often remaining vacant.  

The Court's focus on economic mobility through reservations overlooks the pervasive social discrimination and violence faced by Dalits. It also fails to acknowledge the shrinking public sector and the dominant role of capitalism, which has largely excluded Dalits, Adivasis, and OBCs from economic development.  

A more effective approach would involve diversifying the economy to empower these communities as business leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators, ensuring they are stakeholders in India's growth.</description>

			<title>Who is behind the violence in Bangladesh? It’s unlikely to be the students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/violence-in-bangladesh-unlikely-students-9523696/</link>
			<description>The situation in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been described as chaotic.  The violence that erupted mirrors the events leading to the 1971 Liberation War, targeting members of the Awami League, religious minorities, and secular intellectuals.  

While student protests initially sparked the unrest, there is suspicion that Islamist groups, potentially including Jamaat-e-Islami, are orchestrating the violence, receiving support from external actors.  The destruction of landmarks associated with the 1971 Liberation War raises concerns about the preservation of Bangladesh's history and principles.

India,  worried about the unfolding events and potential threats to its security interests, has withdrawn non-essential staff from Bangladesh and suspended visa operations. 
 
The situation remains uncertain with calls for judicial investigations into the violence and speculation about constitutional changes and a potential new Army Chief.</description>

			<title>After Wayanad, time to empower common people to claim their rightful inheritance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/wayanad-time-empower-common-people-claim-rightful-inheritance-9523710/</link>
			<description>Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence found resonance in India's fight against environmental degradation. Landslides fueled by quarrying and construction are devastating communities, prompting calls for action. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel's report, highlighting these issues, faced resistance but also generated public support. 

A successful people's movement in Chemban Mudi demonstrates the power of collective action. Advances in technology, particularly smartphones, empower commoners to advocate for their rights. The author proposes several steps for improving environmental sustainability and community well-being in Wayanad and other affected regions. These include localizing quarry management, prioritizing tribal-led homestays over tourist resorts, and establishing labor cooperatives for tea estates.  The author also advocates for revisiting Wildlife Protection Act regulations to ensure better protection of human lives and property.</description>

			<title>Secular Civil Code will unify, not divide Indians</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/secular-civil-code-will-unify-not-divide-indians-9522698/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a Secular Civil Code (SCC) during India's Independence Day speech has reignited debate. The SCC aims to unify the nation under a single legal framework for civil matters, ensuring equality for all citizens regardless of religion. 

Opponents argue it threatens religious freedom, but proponents emphasize that true secularism lies in equal treatment under the law. They point to discriminatory aspects of existing personal laws, particularly towards women, and cite examples of other democracies with successful SCC implementations. 

The SCC is seen as a step towards modernizing India's legal system, simplifying its framework, and reducing the burden on the judiciary. Supporters view it as a constitutional duty and a moral imperative for achieving social justice and fulfilling the vision of equality enshrined in the Indian Constitution.</description>

			<title>To be secure or viksit, India’s leaders must listen to those left behind</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/to-be-secure-or-viksit-indias-leaders-must-listen-to-those-left-behind-9522695/</link>
			<description>India faces a multitude of challenges in governing its diverse population. While secularism, intended to ensure equality for all religions, has been met with resistance from some Hindus promoting "Hindutva,"  a stricter version of Hinduism. This emphasis on Hindu identity creates insecurity, reminiscent of Israel, surrounded by non-Jewish populations.

Furthermore, India grapples with deep-rooted caste divisions, economic disparity, and a growing youth population needing employment. The widening gap between the wealthy and the working class fuels social unrest, as “bread-and-butter economics” supersede GDP growth in public concern.  

India's future hinges on addressing these issues, moving beyond divisive rhetoric and prioritizing the needs of its citizens, particularly the working class, to ensure a secure and prosperous future.</description>

			<title>Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes: In Kolkata, after the crime, indignity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pratap-bhanu-mehta-writes-in-kolkata-after-the-crime-indignity-9522680/</link>
			<description>This article critiques the politicisation of a rape and murder case in Kolkata.  It argues that while public outrage and calls for justice are understandable, such cases often become entangled with political agendas, ultimately reducing the victim to a political tool. 

The author points to the limitations of protest movements, highlighting their episodic nature, urban focus, and tendency to be overshadowed by  complex societal issues.  They contend that  the absence of tangible reforms in law enforcement and the judiciary prevents these movements from achieving lasting change. 

Furthermore, the article criticizes the West Bengal government's handling of the case, accusing them of avoiding responsibility, suppressing dissent, and prioritizing political expediency over the pursuit of justice. Ultimately, the author laments the pervasiveness of political instrumentalization of such sensitive crimes, emphasizing the enduring stain it leaves on society's collective conscience.</description>

			<title>Mohun Bagan and East Bengal’s joint protest: A team effort</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/mohun-bagan-and-east-bengals-joint-protest-a-team-effort-9522678/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the unusual unity displayed by fans of rival Kolkata football clubs, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan,  during a protest against the rape and murder of a young doctor. 

The rivalry between the clubs is deeply rooted in the history of Bengal and the divide between communities. However, in this instance, the shared sense of outrage and desire for justice united them. 

This act of solidarity highlights the power of collective action, demonstrating that seemingly insurmountable differences can be overcome when a common cause is pursued.  The author uses this example to illustrate the universal right to fight for justice, regardless of background or affiliation.</description>

			<title>Kamala Harris, out of Biden’s shadow</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/kamala-harris-out-of-bidens-shadow-9522676/</link>
			<description>Kamala Harris has unexpectedly become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee after Biden's withdrawal. Despite facing challenges due to her performance in the 2020 primaries, Harris has gained momentum and is currently tied with or leading Trump in polls.  Democrats are hoping she can rally young and minority voters and counter the Republican attacks on their economic policies.  

However, the ongoing conflict in Gaza presents a significant challenge for the Harris campaign.  Protests against US support for Israel are expected at the Democratic National Convention, and growing dissatisfaction among some Democratic voters could impact the election.</description>

			<title>Yogendra Yadav writes: Where are our political thinkers?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yogendra-yadav-writes-where-are-our-political-thinkers-9522697/</link>
			<description>This article argues that modern Indian political thought has declined, leading to a stagnation in political vision and action. 

The author points to a rich tradition of political thinkers in post-independence India who were deeply engaged in shaping the nation's future. However, this tradition gradually faded away, leaving a void in political discourse. While intellectuals still exist, their work is often disconnected from practical politics.  

The result, the author claims, is a diminished capacity for political imagination and a lack of compelling alternatives to the dominant political paradigm. Reclaiming the spirit of Indian political thought is presented as crucial for revitalizing Indian democracy.</description>

			<title>Express view on SSLV launch: India’s space</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-sslv-launch-indias-space-9522674/</link>
			<description>India recently successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), a smaller, more agile rocket designed to carry smaller satellites. This event is significant because it opens up space access to universities, startups and individual innovators, diversifying the space sector beyond traditional players like ISRO and NASA.  

SSLV's rapid assembly time and lower cost make it ideal for the growing market of small satellites used in various sectors including weather forecasting, communications, and disaster management.  India aims to increase its share in the global space economy, currently at 2%, to 8% by 2033 through initiatives like SSLV and private sector involvement.</description>

			<title>Outrage over reform in capital gains tax is overblown. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/capital-gains-tax-reform-outrage-overblown-explained-9522238/</link>
			<description>The Union Budget 2024-25 has sparked debate due to changes in capital gains tax, particularly the removal of inflation indexation  benefits for property sales. While these changes appear stringent, a comparative analysis reveals that India's capital gains tax regime remains relatively moderate compared to other G20 nations. 

The budget simplifies existing provisions by unifying holding periods for short-term and long-term capital gains, increasing the short-term capital gains tax rate, and introducing a flat long-term capital gains tax rate.  The removal of indexation aligns with international practices, with few countries currently offering this benefit.  

The reforms aim to create a simpler, more equitable tax structure, discouraging speculative trading and promoting long-term investments. The increased exemption limit for lower and middle-income groups aims to make the tax system more progressive. Although there may be short-term challenges, these changes have the potential to foster a more robust and fairer economic environment in the long run.</description>

			<description>The article examines the public response to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, highlighting the need for a critical analysis of the discourse surrounding such incidents. 

It argues that focusing solely on punishing the perpetrators ignores the systemic factors that enable and protect them. The article criticizes the failure of institutions to provide safety, the media's disregard for victim anonymity, and the government's suppression of dissent. 

It emphasizes the importance of questioning societal norms and structures that perpetuate gender-based violence and silence survivors. The writer stresses the need for sustained activism and political engagement to bring about meaningful change.</description>

			<description>India's 78th Independence Day calls for reflection on achieved milestones and areas needing improvement to reach the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047.  While India has made strides in food security since independence, China's rapid economic growth presents both opportunities and challenges. China's success in agriculture, driven by reforms and targeted support for farmers, has significantly boosted its per capita income. India can learn from China's approach, particularly in incentivizing production of pulses, which are both nutritious and environmentally friendly.  Addressing the challenge of nutritional security remains crucial, with efforts needed to improve the well-being of young children.  Further investments in research, irrigation, and value chain development are essential for ensuring sustainable food security in the face of climate change.</description>

			<title>SC verdict on states taxing mining activities: Unfounded spectre of retrospective taxation</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/sc-verdict-on-states-taxing-mining-activities-unfounded-spectre-of-retrospective-taxation-9521069/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to levy royalties on mining activities, overturning a previous 1989 judgment.  

The court applied this ruling retrospectively to 2004, the date of a separate ruling that signaled a potential change in policy. While this was done to clarify legal confusion, it has raised concerns about retrospective taxation. 

The court clarified that this isn't technically retrospective taxation as it upholds a legal position that was always viable, even if not recognized. States are now empowered to collect royalties from mining companies, leading to financial implications for the industry. This situation highlights the need for stable policy environments and the importance of  policymakers ensuring a balanced approach to mineral development within the federal system.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-in-india-bangladesh-ties-stakes-are-high-9521141/</link>
			<description>The recent conversation between Prime Minister Modi and Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh's chief advisor, highlights the importance of the India-Bangladesh relationship.  Both sides expressed willingness to move past past tensions and focus on shared goals like development and stability. While concerns remain in Delhi about the new government's legitimacy, there's a shared understanding of the need for cooperation.  

Both countries must be cautious in navigating this delicate period. India should encourage former Prime Minister Hasina to refrain from political activities on Indian soil, while Bangladesh should avoid extradition attempts that could strain relations. 


The stability of Bangladesh hinges on its ability to achieve internal reconciliation and address its contested history.  India's support for Yunus, the new government's leader, is crucial in mitigating the risk of further instability and violence.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-independence-day-speech-between-the-lines-9521056/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 11th Independence Day speech lacked the groundbreaking pronouncements that characterized his initial addresses. 

In contrast to his 2014 speech, which addressed sanitation and female empowerment with a direct and personal touch, this year's address felt more restrained.  The absence of a compelling "outreach moment" may reflect a loss of confidence due to recent electoral setbacks and a realization that key promises, like improved sanitation and reduced violence against women, remain largely unfulfilled. The speech focused on broader aspirations, such as a developed India by 2047, and addressed the controversial Uniform Civil Code, albeit cautiously, emphasizing a "secular" approach and the need for public discourse.</description>

			<title>Faizan Mustafa writes: UP’s anti-conversion law will create social disharmony</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/faizan-mustafa-writes-ups-anti-conversion-law-will-create-social-disharmony-9520641/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the contentious issue of religious conversion in India. It argues that while the right to freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution, the issue of conversion remains a source of tension, particularly with the enactment of stricter anti-conversion laws.  

The author challenges the effectiveness of these laws and questions whether they truly address the root causes of conversion, which often involve socioeconomic factors. They argue that the laws create an environment of mistrust and can fuel communal conflict. 

The article concludes by invoking Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a tolerant and pluralistic India where religions coexist peacefully, urging a move away from legislation that impinges on individual religious freedom.</description>

			<title>R G Kar Hospital incident underline needs for legal protection for safety of healthcare workers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/r-g-kar-hospital-incident-underline-needs-for-legal-protection-for-safety-of-healthcare-workers-9520441/</link>
			<description>The recent murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata highlights the urgent need for nationwide legislation to protect healthcare workers in India.  Violence against doctors and other healthcare personnel has been increasing, leading to widespread calls for a central law. Although a draft bill was proposed, it was withdrawn due to concerns about similar requests from other professions. Healthcare workers face unique risks due to their constant interaction with the public, often during times of stress and emotional vulnerability. Several states have enacted their own laws, but a lack of uniformity creates loopholes and inconsistencies. Protections are crucial, not just during emergencies like pandemics, but for everyday safety. Healthcare workers are merely seeking the security necessary to perform their duties effectively and serve the public without fear. It is time for lawmakers and the public to recognize their vital role and support legislation that safeguards them.</description>

			<title>Mental health of medical students can no longer be ignored</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/medical-students-mental-health-nmc-policy-9520076/</link>
			<description>A surge in suicides among medical students has prompted the National Medical Commission to address the alarming mental health crisis in the medical field. Surveys reveal high rates of mental health conditions and suicidal thoughts among students, highlighting the urgent need for policy interventions. While existing policies aim to prioritize mental health, implementation remains a challenge due to limited resources and a lack of clarity on strategies.  

India's experience combating HIV-AIDS offers valuable lessons for tackling mental health challenges.  Successful implementation of the National Aids Control Programme involved creating evidence-based interventions, engaging diverse stakeholders, addressing systemic issues, and prioritizing community-led approaches.  

Emulating these strategies, the government needs to invest in robust mental health infrastructure, implement community-based interventions, and ensure accessible and affordable care for all. Civil society plays a crucial role by providing research and evidence-based models for successful rehabilitation and care.</description>

			<title>A safe space, between home &amp; our clinic</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/where-are-our-safe-spaces-9519754/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the safety concerns faced by women doctors, particularly highlighting the recent rape and murder of a female doctor in Kolkata. The author recounts personal experiences of harassment and violence during her time as an intern and resident, emphasizing the prevalence of such incidents. She calls for immediate security measures like official transport, adequate lighting, CCTV coverage, and clear signage against violence. 

The article also stresses the need to address the systemic issues contributing to this vulnerability, including implementing the Central Healthcare Protection Act and mandatory training on gender sensitivity. The author concludes by stating that the recent incident is just the tip of the iceberg and that a culture of respect is crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of women doctors.</description>

			<title>Disparity among Dalits needs to be acknowledged</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/disparity-among-dalits-needs-to-be-acknowledged-9519753/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's decision to allow sub-classification within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked debate. While there is consensus against applying a "creamy layer" exclusion to SCs and STs,  views on sub-classification are divided. Critics argue it will fragment the "pan-Dalit identity" and  highlight the limited impact of reservation, urging its effective implementation instead.  However, proponents argue that sub-classification is necessary to address the vast socio-economic disparities within SC communities and ensure that the most marginalized benefit from reservation. The demand for sub-classification stems from observations that welfare benefits often concentrate among numerically larger and politically organized SC groups.  Numerous commissions across India have recommended sub-categorization based on their findings, recognizing the internal disparities within the SC community.</description>

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: Why PM Modi’s Independence Day speech this year was uninspiring</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tavleen-singh-writes-musings-on-india-today-9519752/</link>
			<description>A writer reflects on Prime Minister Modi's speech from the Red Fort, acknowledging the progress made since economic liberalization began in the 1990s. However, they argue that true reform has been lacking in the past decade. While infrastructure projects have advanced and welfare programs have improved, governance has not effectively addressed issues such as corruption and the quality of education. 

The writer criticizes the lack of privatization in the government sector and points to the inefficiency of India's justice system and urban planning as further evidence of stagnation. They contrast Modi's promises of liberalization with the reality of continued socialist policies, lamenting the missed opportunity for deeper systemic change.</description>

			<description>The SEBI saga involves allegations of financial impropriety within a business group. The doubters claimed the investments were illegitimate, prompting an investigation by SEBI and a subsequent inquiry by a Committee led by Justice Sapre. The Committee found issues with SEBI's investigation, noting changes in regulations and a lack of transparency concerning the ultimate beneficial owners of foreign investors.  Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld SEBI's actions and ordered the completion of its investigation. 

The matter resurfaced with allegations against SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch,  concerning potential conflicts of interest due to past investments by her and her husband in entities under SEBI scrutiny.  Buch admits to the investments but claims they were made before her appointment at SEBI and were subsequently disposed of.  The core issue revolves around whether Buch disclosed these past connections to SEBI, the government, the Justice Sapre Committee, and the Supreme Court, and whether she recused herself from the investigations.</description>

			<title>From protests and suspensions to Noam Chomsky: The decline of South Asian University</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/south-asian-university-decline-from-protests-and-suspensions-to-noam-chomsky-9519435/</link>
			<description>The South Asian University, established with ambitious goals of regional integration and academic excellence, has faced a downward spiral culminating in a recent controversy. The university, meant to be free from political interference, has been increasingly controlled by the Indian government, stifling academic freedom and independence. 

This control is evident in unjustified student and faculty suspensions, unlawful expulsions, and attempts to suppress protests.  The latest incident involved a doctoral research proposal that cited a critical statement made by Noam Chomsky about Prime Minister Modi. The university's overreaction, leading to disciplinary action against a professor, highlights a culture of fear and self-censorship. This situation jeopardizes the university's original vision and erodes trust among SAARC member countries.</description>

			<description>A massive protest erupted in the author's hometown following the brutal rape and murder of a doctor. Thousands of women and men took to the streets, demanding justice and safety.

			<title>Kolkata doctor’s murder: The unfreedom of being a woman</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kolkata-doctors-murder-the-unfreedom-of-being-a-woman-9519043/</link>
			<description>The rape and murder of a young doctor in Kolkata highlights the brutal reality of gender-based violence.  The crime reveals the enduring power imbalances that make women vulnerable, even within institutions designed to provide safety. The incident exposes the gaps between the ideal of freedom and equality promised by democracy and its lived experience for women.  Furthermore, the efforts to conceal the crime and protect the hospital's reputation underscore the complicity of institutions in protecting perpetrators and perpetuating a culture of silence. This case serves as a stark reminder of the urgency to address the systemic issues that contribute to violence against women and ensure that democratic principles are upheld for all citizens.</description>

			<title>25 years after it was drafted, why India’s nuclear doctrine still remains relevant</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/25-years-why-indias-nuclear-doctrine-relevant-9518938/</link>
			<description>The draft nuclear doctrine, presented in 1999, outlined India's stance as a nuclear weapons state emphasizing transparent principles of credible minimum deterrence and a retaliation-only policy. These principles, while conceived in a changed strategic environment, remain largely relevant today.  

India's stance against  first use, supported by growing but carefully calibrated nuclear capabilities, helps maintain stability  despite ongoing threats from Pakistan and China. Debates around tactical nuclear weapons and  concerns about ambiguity are addressed by the doctrine's emphasis on robust second-strike capability and  clear communication of its intentions. 
 
 The draft doctrine's core tenets continue to serve as a foundation for India's nuclear posture, providing a beacon of stability amidst evolving global nuclear dynamics.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-the-necessity-of-a-secular-ucc-9518291/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech emphasized his government's commitment to "Viksit Bharat 2047," highlighting India's economic growth and societal progress. He addressed issues like women's safety and external threats to stability.  Modi strongly advocated for a uniform civil code, arguing that existing laws dividing the country along religious lines are discriminatory and outdated. 

He drew parallels to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's vision during the Constitution's drafting, emphasizing the need for a secular civil code applicable to all citizens regardless of their faith. 

Modi's call aligns with previous Supreme Court rulings recognizing the urgency of a uniform civil code for a modern, equitable India.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hansda-sowvendra-shekhar-writes-all-that-freedom-has-given-us-9518285/</link>
			<description>The author, reflecting on India's Independence, acknowledges the freedoms and opportunities enjoyed by their generation, a direct result of the sacrifices made by those who fought for independence.  

However, the author also points out a new kind of servitude that exists today, fuelled by a relentless pressure to succeed in a competitive job market. This pressure manifests in an obsession with goals, a constant striving, and anxiety. The author argues that while progress is undeniable, issues like corruption, lack of support systems, and a disregard for ground realities undermine the true meaning of freedom.  
  
Despite these challenges, the author holds onto hope for a better future, driven by gratitude for the freedoms they have and a belief that things will eventually improve.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/seven-decades-after-independence-the-unfulfilled-dreams-of-indias-women-leaders-9518290/</link>
			<description>Indian women activists, even over a century ago, campaigned for women's empowerment. They recognized the need for financial freedom for women to exercise their agency in a patriarchal society. Early organizations like the Women's Indian Association fought for better working conditions for women, including limitations on night work and maternity benefits. The All-India Women's Conference advocated for women's rights, including the recognition of unpaid household work and financial autonomy for women. While progress has been made, particularly in inheritance laws, many of these demands remain unfulfilled. The article urges continued efforts to achieve economic equality for women through financial security, recognition of unpaid labor, and overcoming persistent social barriers.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-announcement-of-jk-polls-long-overdue-9518292/</link>
			<description>The upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled for September and October, mark a significant step towards restoring democratic processes after years of political stagnation. The elections, held five years after the abrogation of Article 370, are seen as an opportunity to address the democratic deficit and the concerns of the people. While there has been progress in areas like tourism and investment, challenges persist, including cross-border terrorism, economic dependence on the Centre, and concerns over jobs and land. 

It is crucial for the government to be responsive to the concerns of the young voters set to participate for the first time and work towards inclusive governance that ensures their voices are heard and their aspirations met.</description>

			<description>A recent study by Anglia Ruskin University found that engaging in creative activities like arts and crafts can contribute to greater well-being than employment. While jobs can be a source of stress, hobbies offer the freedom to "fail" without consequence. The act of creating, regardless of the skill level, can bring joy and self-expression, benefiting mental health.  The study suggests that hobbies provide a valuable outlet for relaxation and stress relief, contributing to overall well-being.</description>

			<title>Express View on the hottest July: Bad weather report</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-the-hottest-july-bad-weather-report-9518293/</link>
			<description>The world just experienced its hottest July ever recorded, marking a significant shift in global climate patterns. While the cause is partially attributed to El Nino, the unprecedented temperature rise demands immediate action.  Scientists are now focusing on climate modeling, especially microclimate forecasting, to better understand and predict local weather variations. 

Increasing the density of meteorological stations and improving information sharing between countries are crucial steps to effectively adapt to these changing conditions. Collaborative efforts, like the UNFCCC's Lima Adaptation Knowledge Initiative, can play a vital role in mitigating the impact of extreme weather events. The urgency to adapt to a changing climate is undeniable, as illustrated by recent events like the Wayanad tragedy and the Pakistan floods of 2022.</description>

			<description>Andhra Pradesh Governor Ramlal dismissed the Telugu Desam ministry led by N T Rama Rao and appointed N Bhaskara Rao as the new Chief Minister. Rama Rao claimed to still have majority support in the Assembly. 

This action triggered strong condemnation from opposition leaders and members of Parliament, who labeled it "politically immoral" and "constitutionally invalid." The Communist Party of India blamed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for the dismissal, calling it "murder of democracy."</description>

			<title>How Britain’s anti-immigrant riots backstab UK’s flailing economy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/britain-anti-immigrant-riots-backstab-uks-flailing-economy-9517982/</link>
			<description>Recent public outrage following a tragedy in the UK was exploited by far-right groups to scapegoat immigrants and non-white people.  While economic woes fueled anger, the far-right blamed immigration for Britain's economic struggles, ignoring the impact of Brexit.  

Data shows that immigrants, particularly from outside the EU, filled the labor gaps created by Brexit. They stabilized key sectors and compensated for the loss of EU workers, contributing to the UK's economic recovery. The economic downturn is attributed to factors like reduced investment, inflation, and stagnant wages, issues that the right wing failed to address. Instead, they directed anger towards immigrants, deepening societal divisions. 

Experts argue that immigration is crucial for sectors like healthcare and housing, which are already strained. Blaming immigrants diverts attention from the government's mismanagement and further harms the working class.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/kolkata-rape-murder-rape-arm-women-doctors-stun-guns-9517943/</link>
			<description>The rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata has ignited national outrage and demand for justice. The incident, coupled with the victim's lack of safe amenities at the hospital, highlights the vulnerability of women doctors. 

This tragic event draws parallels with past cases like the brutal assault on Aruna Shanbaug in Mumbai and the 2012 Delhi gang rape, both of which sparked widespread protests.  

Doctors are demanding a central protection act to safeguard them from violence, while the authorities are facing criticism for inadequate security measures in hospitals. The incident underscores the urgent need to address violence against women, particularly in healthcare settings.</description>

			<description>The Indian government withdrew a second draft of the Broadcasting Bill that would have significantly expanded government control over online content. The initial and subsequent drafts drew criticism for seeking to subject online video creators, including those producing non-news content, to regulations similar to those governing traditional broadcasters.  

Concerns were raised that the Bill could be used to suppress dissenting voices and stifle creativity, particularly given the government's track record of utilizing IT regulations to limit free expression.  

Critics argue the Bill's intent, despite being labelled as promoting "ease of doing business and living," primarily benefits government-aligned media and curtails the reach of critical content. They also point out the futility of such efforts in the current climate of globalized content production and distribution, where creators can easily transcend geographical boundaries.</description>

			<title>How state governments have undermined right to education</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/state-governments-undermined-right-to-education-9517293/</link>
			<description>The Right to Education (RTE) Act, passed in 2010, promised universal elementary education in India.  Despite initial progress, the implementation of the Act has faced numerous challenges. A recent Bombay High Court verdict highlighted the issue of state governments attempting to circumvent the RTE's provision requiring unaided private schools to reserve seats for children from economically weaker sections.  Arguments used to justify this include concerns over resource duplication and questioning the "absolute" nature of the RTE, suggesting a lack of commitment to the law by several state governments. 

The RTE mandates mixing children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, aiming to enhance learning and bridge social divides. This provision has been met with resistance from private schools who prefer separate sections or afternoon classes for economically weaker students. Despite efforts from some teachers to implement RTE's vision, teacher training remains a significant challenge, hindering the Act's true potential. The article concludes by expressing concern over the misuse of the RTE to exclude poor children from private schools through regulations that limit EWS admissions.</description>

			<description>P. R. Sreejesh, a pioneering figure in Indian hockey, has retired after a remarkable career spanning 329 international matches. His journey, from a humble farmer's son with no prior hockey experience to becoming a national icon, is a testament to his talent and perseverance.

Preserving Sreejesh's legacy, the Indian hockey federation retired his jersey number 16.

			<title>Express View: Rumbles in Rakhine</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/myanmar-rakhine-drone-attack-9516569/</link>
			<description>A recent artillery and drone attack in Myanmar's Rakhine province killed nearly 200 civilians, mostly Rohingya. While the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine group, denies responsibility, many observers blame them for the atrocity and other attacks targeting the Rohingya in recent months.  

The Arakan Army's growing influence in the region has led to concerns, especially as it shares ties with China and controls parts of the Kaladan Road Project, a vital project for India. The latest violence has further displaced Rohingya refugees, creating challenges for neighboring Bangladesh and prompting India to monitor the situation closely.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/parliament-opposition-9516568/</link>
			<description>Since the 2024 elections, Parliament sessions have witnessed a surge in the morale and activity of opposition parties.  Several factors contribute to this heightened engagement, including a robust Leader of the Opposition for the first time in a decade, noteworthy performances by opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, and Abhishek Banerjee, and a diverse and influential opposition contingent.  The presence of Sonia Gandhi in the Rajya Sabha also serves as a unifying force for the INDIA alliance.  Despite the government's attempts to manage the house with a relatively new parliamentary team, the opposition has effectively challenged the ruling dispensation, creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere in Parliament.</description>

			<title>With worst deposit crunch in 20 years, five banking issues to address</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/with-worst-deposit-crunch-in-20-years-five-banking-issues-to-address-9516526/</link>
			<description>A shrinking deposit base in India's banking system is raising concerns due to its potential impact on loan growth and the overall economy. 

Banks Traditionally rely heavily on deposits, especially core deposits, for stable funding. 

However, with deposit growth slowing, banks face limitations in extending loans, particularly to businesses. This could stifle investment and economic activity.

The trend is driven by factors like competition, technological advancements, and high inflation eroding the attractiveness of bank deposits compared to other investment options. 

This situation calls for policy interventions like deepening bond markets and encouraging banks to offer more competitive alternatives to savers.</description>

			<title>Express View on PM Modi’s Independence Day address: Speech — and listening</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-pm-modi-independence-day-address-speech-listening-9516078/</link>
			<description>Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day speech focused on his vision for a "developed India" by 2047, emphasizing the country's potential and urging citizens, particularly the youth, to seize the opportunities.  While reiterating his government's commitment to fulfilling the aspirations of the people, Modi acknowledged the uniqueness of his third term and the need for his coalition government to listen to diverse voices.  

The speech featured significant shifts in its approach. Notably, Modi reiterated the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a constitutional goal, urging a nationwide debate and framing it as a  "secular" civil code. This marked a departure from the BJP's previous stance on the UCC.  Furthermore, Modi announced plans to induct 1 lakh young, politically unconnected individuals into politics to bring fresh ideas and inclusivity to governance.  These pronouncements signaled a potential evolution in the BJP's political discourse, emphasizing inclusivity and sensitivity.</description>

			<title>PM’s I-Day speech: Viksit Bharat, nationalism and contradictions</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pms-i-day-speech-viksit-bharat-nationalism-contradictions-9515885/</link>
			<description>This article analyzes the political implications of the Prime Minister's Independence Day speech, focusing on his vision of "Viksit Bharat" and its underlying message about national unity. The author argues that the speech frames diversity as a set of contradictions that need to be resolved for economic progress, a strategy reminiscent of colonial-era justifications for rule. 

This approach, the author contends, contradicts the spirit of anti-colonial nationalism which celebrated diversity as a source of strength.  The author further criticizes the emphasis on "reform" as a solution to national challenges, arguing that it undermines the importance of debate and dissent in shaping a just and inclusive society. Drawing from the example of a 1959 film, the author highlights a more inclusive understanding of national identity that embraces diversity rather than viewing it as a threat.  Ultimately, the article calls for a political imagination that recognizes the value of diverse perspectives in building a strong and equitable nation.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dear-icc-bcci-and-commentators-dont-trivialise-mental-health-issues-of-players-9515597/</link>
			<description>This open letter addresses a concerning broadcasting practice in cricket: describing on-field errors as "suicidal" or "committing hara-kiri." 

The author argues this trivialises suicide, a serious public health crisis, especially given cricket's history of mental health challenges among players. The letter highlights the tragic loss of several cricketers to suicide and the growing awareness of mental health issues within the sport. It also cites examples of how language can shape public perception of suicide and  urges broadcasters to adopt a more sensitive and responsible language policy. The author proposes mandatory training for broadcasters on this issue, drawing parallels with the recent shift towards gender-neutral language in cricket. This change, they argue, would demonstrate cricket's commitment to fairness, courage, and respect for all.</description>

			<description>The draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, which aimed to expand government control over online content, has drawn criticism for its potential to stifle freedom of speech. Concerns have been raised regarding provisions that would subject social media accounts and online video creators to government scrutiny, including mandatory registration and content evaluation committees. Critics argue that these measures could hinder creativity and innovation within the online space, contradicting the government's efforts to support the startup ecosystem.

			<title>Harris’ or Harris’s: In grammar war, hope for democracy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/harris-or-harriss-in-grammar-war-hope-for-democracy-9514564/</link>
			<description>Debate is raging among grammar enthusiasts about the correct use of an apostrophe in referring to the names of Democratic candidates, notably Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. The Associated Press Stylebook advocates for just an apostrophe after names ending in "s," while others argue for an additional "s," citing clarity.  

The ambiguity stems from the complex evolution of the English language, where different rules apply to singular nouns and proper nouns. Interestingly, Harris's campaign appears to embrace both forms, reflecting the fluidity of language. Ultimately, the 'apostrophe wars' highlight the ongoing evolution of language and its rules.</description>

			<description>The brutal rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata has exposed serious failures in the West Bengal state administration. The Calcutta High Court, citing a lack of progress in the case and public faith in the Kolkata Police, has handed it over to the CBI. The handling of the case, including the delay in informing the family and the questionable appointment of the hospital's principal after his resignation, has raised concerns about a larger malaise in the state. This incident has sparked broader discussions on gender violence and safety, but also on the erosion of law and order and the influence of a shadowy political network.  The incident further highlights the growing concerns around impunity and the perceived weakening of institutional structures in West Bengal.</description>

			<title>With freedom in 1947, the birth of the people’s Constitution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/freedom-independence-constitution-9514682/</link>
			<description>The Indian Constitution, despite its length, has become a symbol of national unity and a rallying point for citizens. From its inception, the public was deeply involved in shaping the document.  

Thousands of groups and individuals, inspired by the promise of a better future, sent their demands and suggestions to the Constituent Assembly. They raised issues like education, employment, disability rights, and even the rights of the disabled. The public's eagerness to participate surprised the Assembly and ultimately led to the open circulation of the draft Constitution for public comment. 

This widespread engagement transformed the Constitution from a legal document into a shared vision for India's future. Through their collective struggles, Indians made themselves the protagonists of constitutionalism even before its official enactment, demonstrating that the Constitution was more than just a set of rules; it was a living embodiment of their aspirations for freedom, equality, and justice.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dear-editor-i-disagree-caste-is-a-system-not-a-classification-9514689/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the Supreme Court's recent verdict on sub-classification within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes categories for reservation benefits.  The author argues that while the verdict is welcome, it's crucial to understand the broader context of social justice for these communities. 

They emphasize that systemic issues, such as caste-based violence and  lack of social mobility, persist despite India's constitutional framework.  The author advocates for a comprehensive caste census to accurately assess the socioeconomic realities of different communities within SCs and STs. They further argue that the under-representation of certain sub-castes within SCs is due to factors like low education and income levels, stemming from historical disadvantages and limited access to political empowerment.  The author concludes by highlighting the need to address the root causes of inequality within the caste system and to recognize the diversity within both upper and lower castes.</description>

			<title>On Pakistan’s Independence Day, hope for the future in an Olympic gold</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-pakistans-independence-day-hope-for-the-future-in-an-olympic-gold-9513982/</link>
			<description>On Pakistan's 78th Independence Day, newspapers reflect on the nation's progress and shortcomings.  Dawn criticizes the ruling elite for failing to uphold the founding fathers' vision of democracy, constitutionalism, and minority protection. The Express Tribune emphasizes both the challenges and achievements, urging a transformative rewrite of Pakistan's narrative.  News International highlights inconsistent economic policies as a key factor in the nation's current struggles, recommending a focus on education, healthcare, and technology. Dawn's Rafia Zakaria notes the strain on resources posed by Pakistan's youth bulge, while The Nation points to the divisiveness and social disorders plaguing the country, particularly in Balochistan. Despite these challenges, there's a glimmer of hope, symbolized by athlete Arshad Nadeem's Olympic gold, offering a moment of national pride.</description>

			<title>At coaching centres, education is just another product</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/coaching-centres-education-product-9514282/</link>
			<description>The coaching industry in India, despite concerns and regulations, continues to prioritize profit over student well-being. This has led to several tragedies and a system that focuses on rote learning and exam pressure rather than holistic development. 

The education system needs to shift its focus from cramming information to nurturing individual potential and fostering a love for learning. Schools should play a more central role in preparing students for competitive exams while also providing a well-rounded education that caters to diverse interests and talents.

A system that merges scholastic instruction with exploration and personalized growth is needed.  Only then can India move towards a future where education truly empowers individuals to flourish and contribute to society.</description>

			<title>On sub-classification of SC, ST, apex court should clear confusion over creamy layer</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sub-classification-sc-st-apex-court-confusion-creamy-layer-9513726/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's recent caste classification verdict has sparked debate about its effectiveness in promoting equality. While the intention to expand reservation benefits is commendable, the verdict's loopholes may hinder democratic progress. 

Critics argue that prioritizing political equality over social and economic equality has marginalized scheduled castes and tribes. The success of affirmative action hinges on addressing economic inequality and dismantling the power structures of Brahmanical hegemony.  

Furthermore, the 50% reservation cap and the absence of quotas in the private sector remain major obstacles. The judiciary's inconsistent stance on affirmative action, evident in contrasting rulings across states, further complicates the issue.  

Addressing caste-based discrimination requires a multi-pronged approach, including a caste census, scientific data-driven policymaking, and a commitment to "annihilation of caste" by ensuring equal opportunities for all marginalized groups.</description>

			<title>From Arab Spring to Bangladesh regime fall — ‘jobless growth’ is a national security issue</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/arab-spring-bangladesh-regime-fall-9513471/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh experienced an uprising fueled by widespread youth frustration due to  jobless growth. Despite a positive GDP growth rate, employment growth remained stagnant, leading to economic disparity and social unrest. This situation, exacerbated by political autocracy, triggered violent protests that ultimately forced the Prime Minister to flee the country.  

Jobless growth has become a significant security concern for many low- and middle-income nations, as it contributes to social instability and political violence. The Bangladesh example highlights the urgent need for policymakers to address this issue, focusing on inclusive growth and creating employment opportunities for the youth. Ignoring the issue can lead to dire consequences, as seen in Bangladesh's recent turmoil.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk and Donald Trump's recent two-hour interview, streamed on X, proved more predictable than entertaining.  The conversation was filled with conspiracy theories, self-promotion, and attacks on political and regulatory opponents. 

While both men are successful in their respective fields, they struggled to engage in a compelling discussion.  Their reliance on familiar tactics like demagoguery and name-calling ultimately made the interview lackluster.</description>

			<title>The post-Mandal moment is here — and it calls for a new politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-post-mandal-moment-is-here-and-it-calls-for-a-new-politics-9512649/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for reservations has sparked both political avoidance and criticism from advocates of the reservation policy.  This ruling reflects the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the post-Mandal era.

Mandal, a concept encompassing caste politics, evolved in two phases. The pre-Mandal period witnessed struggles against caste, influenced by figures like Jyotiba Phule and Periyar, culminating in the recognition of backward castes in electoral politics from 1967 onwards. 

The post-Mandal phase, marked by the judicial debate and implementation of reservations, saw a shift toward viewing numerical representation as the sole solution to social injustice. This approach, while reinforcing the reservation regime, arguably overshadowed the broader goals of dismantling caste-based hierarchies.

The ruling raises critical questions about the effectiveness and future trajectory of reservation policy. 

 It necessitates a reassessment of the social blocs on which reservations are based, considering their evolving nature and internal divisions. The challenges of addressing new power asymmetries beyond the confines of caste, class, and power require fresh approaches and political discourse.</description>

			<title>RBI employment data should be read with a caveat</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rbi-employment-data-should-be-read-with-a-caveat-strap-considering-the-methodological-limitations-of-the-9512681/</link>
			<description>The KLEMS data, often cited to support claims of robust job creation in India, relies on projected population figures and worker-population ratios (WPR) derived from employment surveys. The methodology has limitations, including potential overestimation of labor force due to high projected population growth, especially in rural areas, and the inclusion of subsidiary employment, often involving unpaid family workers. 

Concerns arise about the temporal comparability of WPR data shifting from the Employment-Unemployment Surveys (EUS) to the Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS), and the use of projected population figures from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which may be inflated.  Comparisons with data from the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) further cast doubt on the accuracy of employment figures. Given these methodological issues, claims of significant job creation based solely on KLEMS data warrant critical examination.</description>

			<title>Express View on Muhammad Yunus government: Keep the social peace</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-muhammad-yunus-government-keep-the-social-peace-9512651/</link>
			<description>Following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh now faces a period of uncertainty. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Laureate economist, has been tasked with leading the interim government. His primary challenge lies in uniting the deeply divided country and restoring peace.

The recent protests, while ostensibly against Hasina's regime, have taken on a dangerous communal turn with increased attacks on the Hindu minority.  

Addressing this violence and ensuring the safety of minorities is a top priority for Yunus. The task is further complicated by the absence of the Awami League, Hasina's party, from the interim government. Yunus must now find ways to engage all stakeholders, including the Awami League, to heal the nation's wounds.  Bangladesh needs stability and unity, and the onus is on Yunus to guide the country through this turbulent period.</description>

			<title>Kolkata doctor’s rape and murder shows how we fail women — yet again</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/kolkata-doctors-rape-and-murder-shows-how-we-fail-women-yet-again-9512652/</link>
			<description>Two recent incidents highlight the persistent issue of women's safety in India. The death of a trainee doctor in Kolkata after a sexual assault and the lifelong vegetative state of Aruna Shanbaug, assaulted decades ago, underscore the failure to adequately protect women, despite pronouncements of female empowerment. 

The death in Kolkata exposes  inadequate security measures within medical institutions, including a lack of on-call rooms and malfunctioning CCTV cameras. The widespread underutilization of the Nirbhaya Fund, established after the 2012 Delhi gangrape, further illustrates the disconnect between promises and action. While demanding justice is crucial, the focus should be on addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate violence against women, ensuring safe workplaces, and fulfilling commitments to equality.</description>

			<title>C Raja Mohan writes: Bangladesh and the ‘foreign hand’ bogey</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-student-protests-the-foreign-hand-bogey-9512007/</link>
			<description>The article critiques the theory that a US-backed coup orchestrated by Muhammad Yunus ousted Sheikh Hasina from power in Bangladesh. It argues that this conspiracy theory ignores the real reasons behind Hasina's downfall, namely her own political missteps and growing unpopularity. 

The author points out that Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies, rigged elections, and economic mismanagement created anti-regime sentiment, which  culminated in the student movement’s protests.  

The article further argues that attributing Hasina's loss solely to external forces reflects a failure of Indian strategic thinking and overlooks the complexities of Bangladeshi politics. It suggests that India should instead focus on cooperating with the new Bangladeshi government while supporting the democratic aspirations of the student movement.  


The author acknowledges Hasina's significant contributions to Bangladesh's development and her strong relationship with India. Finally, they emphasize the need for continued collaboration between India and the US in the region, especially given the current political instability in Bangladesh and Myanmar.</description>

			<title>UPSC aspirants don’t need coaching classes to succeed. Here’s my story</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/upsc-aspirants-coaching-classes-9511855/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the allure and exploitation within India's competitive Civil Services Examination (CSE) ecosystem, specifically focusing on Old Rajinder Nagar (ORN) in Delhi.  The author, an IAS officer, recounts their personal experience moving to ORN and enrolling in a costly coaching institute, realizing the exorbitant fees provided no better value compared to readily available resources. 

The article criticizes the coaching industry's overhyped promises and exploitation of aspiring candidates, particularly those from less privileged backgrounds. Social media further amplifies this, with staged mock interviews presented as authentic representations of the CSE process. The author highlights the harsh living conditions in ORN, coupled with unrealistic expectations fueled by profit-driven institutions.  

The article concludes with a call to action, urging aspirants to rely on official UPSC guidelines and resources, questioning the narratives surrounding coaching institutes and popular locations. It emphasizes the importance of individual dedication and original thinking over external pressures.</description>

			<title>In his centenary year, making sense of Guru Dutt in the classroom</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/guru-dutt-centenary-year-classroom-9511598/</link>
			<description>This article explores the use of Guru Dutt's film "Pyaasa" as a parallel to Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" in a Creative Writing classroom. The author compares Dutt's portrayal of a neglected poet, Vijay, with the prisoners in the cave who mistake shadows for reality.  Vijay's rejection by society mirrors the prisoners' inability to perceive true reality beyond the confines of their cave. The article argues that both Plato and Dutt challenge conventional thinking, prompting audiences to question the nature of truth and the influence of power structures. By showcasing Vijay's poignant song, "yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai," the author emphasizes the importance of art and introspection over material wealth and societal validation. Ultimately, the article advocates for a more philosophical approach to creative writing that encourages deep contemplation and questioning of societal norms.</description>

			<description>The recent instability in Bangladesh is a result of deep-seated fault lines within the country.  

These include a conflict between secularism, Islamic identity, and Bengali popular culture. Historical divisions stemming from the 1971 War of Liberation, particularly regarding India's role, further exacerbate tensions. Public perception of India is often negative, influenced by propaganda and a belief that India's support came at a cost. 

Bangladesh also struggles with unstable civil-military relations. The military's involvement in commercial activities and its politicization create a sense of unease. These internal divisions contribute to the current turmoil, including attacks on minorities and the government's inability to effectively manage the situation.</description>

			<description>Haniya Aslam, one half of the Pakistani folk duo, known for her first all-woman music group "Chup", passed away due to a cardiac arrest.  Aslam, along with her cousin Zebunissa Bangash, gained popularity on Coke Studio Pakistan for their modernized interpretations of traditional Dari folk songs. 

Their album "Chup" went beyond borders with its internet reach, paving the way for their unique blend of Afghan rabab and Pakistani acoustic guitar to find global resonance.  After the duo disbanded, Aslam pursued audio engineering in Canada and upon her return to Pakistan released  "Main Irada", an empowering anthem for women.</description>

			<title>Centre’s waiver for clinical trials: For the patient’s sake</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/centres-waiver-for-clinical-trials-for-the-patients-sake-9510396/</link>
			<description>The Indian government recently waived clinical trials for certain drug categories approved in developed nations, aiming to expedite access to innovative therapies like those for Alzheimer's, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. This move could benefit both patients and pharmaceutical companies by reducing costs and timelines. 

However, ensuring affordability remains crucial.  The government should consider expanding healthcare safety nets and exploring state procurement of novel drugs to minimize the financial burden on patients.  Promoting domestic research through incentives and ease of business is also essential, as India aims to move beyond its generic drug stronghold and contribute to developing new drug molecules.</description>

			<description>The recent political change in Bangladesh, leading to the establishment of an interim government, presents both challenges and opportunities for the region. India has historically maintained a policy of non-interference in Bangladesh's internal affairs. Despite disagreements over border killings and water sharing, India and Bangladesh have made significant progress in strengthening bilateral ties in recent years, encompassing areas like security, trade, and energy.

Bangladesh's remarkable socio-economic development and successes in sectors like microfinance have been commended by India. Moving forward, both nations need to address outstanding issues through cooperation and diplomacy, focusing on shared challenges like poverty, unemployment, and climate change. The hope is for a future marked by mutual trust and progress, building on the foundations laid in recent years.</description>

			<title>In Manish Sisodia case, Supreme Court shows the way</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-manish-sisodia-case-supreme-court-shows-the-way-9510394/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court ruled that the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. This decision, while not introducing new legal principles, carries significant weight as the Court acted upon its stated position and clarified its application within the context of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  

The judgement, which  freed Manish Sisodia after 17 months in jail, highlights the Court's criticism of both the state and the judiciary for delays in trials. The Court emphasized that bail is the rule and imprisonment the exception, urging lower courts to adhere to this principle and considering the length of incarceration without trial. The case underscores the importance of safeguarding individual liberty and ensuring that legal proceedings are conducted fairly and expeditiously.</description>

			<description>This year's southwest monsoon season started weakly but recovered significantly in July and August, resulting in a 6.3% surplus in cumulative rainfall. The well-distributed rains have positively impacted kharif crop sowing areas.  

With  favorable weather conditions, the upcoming rabi cropping season also appears promising. The surplus monsoon and absence of heat waves are expected to ease food inflation, which has been a concern for the past few months. This could allow the government to ease restrictions on exports and stock limits for cereals, sugar, and pulses.</description>

The article raises questions about Buch's transparency and recusal from investigations involving the group, given her personal financial ties. It emphasizes the importance of both institutional autonomy and personal integrity in a market regulator,  suggesting that Buch's disclosures should have gone beyond Sebi's board to include the Supreme Court and a  committee examining regulatory failures related to the Adani Group.</description>

			<description>The Waqf Amendment Bill, 2024 has sparked anxiety within a section of the Muslim community. However, it's important to analyze the proposal objectively as this is not the first time the waqf law is being amended.  Previous amendments in 1913, 1930, 1995, and 2013, along with recommendations from the Sachar Committee and a Joint Parliamentary Committee, highlight that reforms to waqf administration have been a long-standing concern. 

The government has received numerous grievances from Muslims regarding waqf property encroachments, mismanagement, and delays in registration.  Furthermore, the vast potential of waqf properties for socio-economic development, considering their status as public institutions and the largest landholders after Railways and Defence, necessitates improvements in their administration. International examples such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and others demonstrate the successful regulation and public engagement with waqf properties by governments. 


Therefore, the debate on waqf reforms should be based on facts, experience, and a commitment to social justice and gender equity.</description>

			<title>Antitrust deja vu: Ruling against Google is reminiscent of a similar one against Microsoft in 2001</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/google-antitrust-ruling-microsoft-9509449/</link>
			<description>The author reflects on Microsoft's historical monopolistic practices, referencing a 2001 ruling against the company for leveraging its dominance in the OS market to stifle browser competition.  Drawing parallels to the recent antitrust ruling against Google, the author argues that despite legal challenges, technology giants like Microsoft and Google have deeply ingrained themselves in our digital lives, making it difficult to dislodge them. 

The author contends that in emerging markets, access to technology is often facilitated through piracy, a factor not adequately addressed by anti-competition law.  Ultimately, the author suggests that the future threat to Google's dominance may not come from competing search engines but from the emergence of generative AI.</description>

			<title>Mani Shankar Aiyar writes: Natwar Singh, friend, patron and man of many parts</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mani-shankar-aiyar-writes-natwar-singh-friend-patron-and-man-of-many-parts-9509291/</link>
			<description>K Natwar Singh, a prominent figure in India's Foreign Service, transitioned seamlessly into politics, becoming the External Affairs Minister. Known for his strong connections with influential figures, including the Nehru-Gandhis and literary personalities, he navigated international relations with finesse.  Serving as India's representative at the UN Decolonisation Committee fostered enduring bonds with African freedom fighters.

His diplomatic career was marked by both accolades and controversies, including an "out-of-turn" posting to Warsaw and a subsequent "punishment posting" to Zambia. Despite setbacks, he remained steadfast in his principles, publicly condemning the 1980 Moradabad Eidgah police firing.  

Natwar's political journey saw him part ways with the Congress after the Volcker Committee report, choosing to leave behind the political arena. He remained a close friend and mentor, offering guidance and support to those around him. His legacy as a diplomat, politician, and friend endures.</description>

			<title>Why the real victory for Phogat’s fight against power does not lie in a medal</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-the-real-victory-for-phogats-fight-against-power-does-not-lie-in-a-medal-9508490/</link>
			<description>Vinesh Phogat's journey to the Paris Olympics mirrored Rocky's determination, with her striving to "go the distance" both in the ring and against systemic injustices. Her fight for justice extended beyond her personal experience, resonating with countless women who saw their own struggles in her battle against the Wrestling Federation of India president, who was accused of sexual assault. 

While her historic win against the defending champion was a significant victory, her subsequent disqualification sparked outrage and highlighted the cultural challenges women face in India. Her story transcends a simple quest for a medal, representing a broader struggle for dignity and recognition.  While a medal can serve as consolation, the real challenge lies in dismantling the systems that perpetuate injustice and empower women to pursue their dreams without facing undue burdens.</description>

			<description>Vinesh Phogat's journey to success is a potent symbol of overcoming adversity. Despite facing significant challenges and alleged injustice, she shines as a role model, her achievements particularly inspiring in a society grappling with inequality. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the struggles many encounter on their paths to success, the hurdles, and the often-unfair expectations placed upon them.  Her story, while inspiring, should also prompt reflection on the systemic issues that contribute to these difficulties and the need for greater support and opportunity for all.  We must celebrate triumphs while remaining aware of the broader context and addressing the root causes of inequality.</description>

			<title>On Bangladesh, Maldives and Afghanistan, why was India taken by surprise?</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-bangladesh-maldives-and-afghanistan-why-was-india-taken-by-surprise-9508433/</link>
			<description>Recent political shifts in Afghanistan and neighboring South Asian countries like Bangladesh and Maldives have dealt a blow to India's foreign policy interests. These unexpected changes raise questions about whether India's foreign policy and security establishments were adequately prepared or caught unaware. 

India's National Security structure has evolved significantly since 1998, with the establishment of bodies like the National Security Council and National Security Advisor (NSA). These institutions aim to coordinate strategic and security functions. However, concerns have been raised about potential "turf" issues between different agencies and the influence of these issues on decision-making. There's a need to scrutinize whether the failures stem from structural inadequacies, misjudgments, or both.</description>

			<title>Express View: After the Olympics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-after-the-olympics-9508478/</link>
			<description>India's Olympic performance in Paris saw a decline in the medal tally, finishing with six medals compared to seven at the previous Games.  The absence of a gold medal, particularly with defending champion Neeraj Chopra only securing silver, impacted the country's overall ranking.  

There's a call for introspection and collaborative efforts from stakeholders, including federations, the Sports Authority of India, and the Sports Ministry, to analyze weaknesses and improve strategies. 

The performance of the men's hockey team, securing back-to-back bronze medals, was highlighted as a success, attributed to a consistent core group, experienced coach, and supportive management. 


The review emphasizes the importance of identifying and supporting champions effectively, listening to their needs and providing them with the necessary resources.</description>

			<title>Express View on Hindenburg report: A cloud over SEBI</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-hindenburg-report-a-cloud-over-sebi-9508476/</link>
			<description>Hindenburg Research has accused SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch of having undisclosed financial interests in offshore funds linked to the Adani Group, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and regulatory inaction.  Hindenburg alleges Buch's husband held stakes in the same funds and that she communicated with their managers while serving on SEBI's board. Buch maintains she has fulfilled all disclosure requirements.  Critics question why these disclosures were not made public during the investigation into the Adani Group, especially considering the importance of transparency in financial regulation.  The controversy has heightened scrutiny of SEBI's independence and its handling of the Adani case.  Calls for a thorough investigation and full disclosure emphasize the need to protect the integrity of the regulator and restore public trust.</description>

			<title>Vandita Mishra writes: Ahead of Independence Day</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/independence-day-2024-india-bangladesh-9508345/</link>
			<description>This Independence Day, India faces a crucial moment for its democracy.  The recent electoral result, which significantly reduced the ruling party's majority, has underscored the importance of safeguarding democratic values.  

The government, accustomed to unchallenged authority, is now encountering a more assertive opposition, demanding greater accountability and freedom from perceived arrogance.  This new dynamic is forcing the government to adapt and engage in a less centralized and more transparent manner, as evidenced by the referral of a controversial bill to a parliamentary committee.  

However, challenges remain. Instances of partisan behavior from the ruling side, a hardening stance on religious autonomy, and the use of legal provisions to target political opponents raise concerns about backsliding on democratic norms.  Simultaneously, the judiciary's recent bail decision for a senior opposition leader offers a glimmer of hope for an independent institution acting as a check on governmental power. 
 
India continues to strive for a balance between its democratic traditions and the evolving political landscape.</description>

			<title>SC, ST sub-quotas will not break Dalit unity</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-st-sub-quotas-dalit-unity-9508089/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's decision to allow sub-classification within Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe reservations has sparked controversy.

While some sections within Scheduled Castes criticize the verdict, arguing it undermines unity, advocates for sub-classification highlight the need to address the historically marginalized communities who have been left behind. 

The debate raises questions about the true extent of inclusivity within Dalit leadership and the sincerity of claims to represent all Dalit communities. 

The Supreme Court's ruling is seen as exposing those who prioritize their own advancement over the collective upliftment of all Dalits.</description>

			<title>Kolkata doctor’s murder: National Medical Commission must step up</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kolkata-doctors-murder-national-medical-commission-9507785/</link>
			<description>The recent death of a resident doctor in Kolkata, allegedly due to sexual assault and strangulation, has brought to light the grave safety concerns and hazardous working conditions faced by resident doctors in India. This incident follows a pattern of violence and harassment against doctors, including the murder of Vandana Das in Kerala and the suicide of Payal Salim Tadvi in Mumbai due to alleged harassment. 

Resident doctors face multiple threats, from  competitive exams and high fees to abuse by seniors, violence from patients, and risks of sexual assault. The lack of adequate duty rooms, safe living spaces, and effective grievance redressal mechanisms exacerbates these challenges. Data reveals a concerning rise in suicides among resident doctors and students, highlighting the urgent need for systemic changes to ensure their safety, well-being, and dignity.</description>

			<description>The article discusses whether India's state should fund elite sports. The author argues against state involvement, highlighting the lack of public benefit and the potential for abuse and corruption within the current sporting system. They point to a lack of connection between elite sporting success and public welfare, and suggest that private investment might be more effective in driving medals, albeit for profit-oriented reasons. The author suggests that instead, public funds should be directed towards areas like education, healthcare, and housing for the most deprived,  arguing that a more realistic understanding of the state's role is needed.</description>

The article then explores the broader trend of increasing workplace efficiency through technology, raising questions about the potential downsides of reduced human interaction in offices and daily life. 
  
 It argues that  face-to-face interactions are crucial for building relationships, fostering a sense of community, and exploring life's possibilities.  The piece cites examples of technology replacing human connection in various aspects of life, drawing parallels to the themes of loneliness and isolation presented in the movie Her.</description>

			<title>Inside Track: Total segregation</title>

			<description>The new Parliament building in India has been designed with separation in mind,  dividing journalists, Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha MPs, and former MPs from current ones.  This division extends to separate cafeterias and limited access for former MPs. The Congress party views Rahul Gandhi's newfound popularity after his recent yatras as a positive sign for the 2024 elections, with some allies even suggesting he could be the "PM-in-waiting." However, not all allies are convinced.   Meanwhile, newly appointed Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav is actively working to enhance his public image and promote himself through social media and interviews, even potentially leveraging the success of his predecessor, Shivraj Singh Chouhan.</description>

			<title>Tavleen Singh writes: Lessons from Bangladesh</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/tavleen-singh-writes-lessons-from-bangladesh-9506982/</link>
			<description>The article analyzes the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to flee. It draws parallels to the suppression of dissent in India, particularly under the current government's leadership. The author argues that labeling dissent as treason, exemplified by the terms "urban Naxals" and the rhetoric against Muslim protestors, is a dangerous trend that undermines India's democratic foundations. 

The article also criticizes the historical erosion of democratic freedoms in India, starting with the first amendment to the Constitution, and highlights the risks posed by a government that prioritizes economic growth over political autonomy.  Ultimately, the author urges India to learn from Bangladesh's experience and safeguard its democratic principles to remain a beacon of democracy in a region dominated by autocratic regimes.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/100-years-ago-when-a-train-robbery-shook-the-empire-9506973/</link>
			<description>The Kakori case involved the audacious robbery of British treasury money by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) in 1925. Led by revolutionaries like Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, the action  shook the British Raj but also resulted in the death of a passenger, harming their cause.  Nineteen individuals were convicted, with  Bismil, Lahiri,  Ashfaqullah Khan, and Roshan Singh facing death sentences. Chandrashekhar Azad, another key figure associated with the HRA, evaded capture and died during a police confrontation in 1931.

The case had wider ramifications, impacting political figures and sparking debate for decades. It highlights the daring fight for independence and the complex legacy of revolution in India.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/p-chidambaram-writes-democracy-deficit-9506981/</link>
			<description>This article discusses the fragility of democracy and the consequences of its decline. It uses examples like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the United States to illustrate how economic progress does not guarantee democratic values.  The article highlights the dangers of a "democracy deficit," where citizens lose faith in fair elections and turn to street protests, which can have disastrous consequences. It argues that a healthy democracy needs strong institutions like an independent judiciary, a free press, and regular, fair elections. 

The author suggests several measures to address democracy deficits, including term limits, resignation clauses for leaders facing discontent, and a vibrant parliamentary debate.  The article concludes by expressing sadness over the loss of life in Bangladeshi protests, emphasizing the high cost of neglecting democratic principles.</description>

			<title>Half-truths and twisted facts about the RSS</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/half-truths-twisted-facts-rss-9506523/</link>
			<description>The article defends the Modi government's decision to lift the ban on government employees participating in RSS activities. It argues that this action, along with other measures, is part of decolonizing India.  

The author criticizes Pawan Khera's article, claiming it distorts history by ignoring the Nehru government's alleged persecution of the RSS and highlighting Nehru's personal animosity towards the organization. It also points to Sardar Patel's views on the RSS, asserting that he considered it a patriotic organization. 

The article further challenges Khera's accusations of undue favoritism towards the RSS, drawing attention to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation's acceptance of funds from various sources including the Chinese government. It concludes by drawing a contrast between the Congress's past and present, suggesting Rahul Gandhi's party has adopted a more leftist and adversarial stance.</description>

			<description>Pakistan celebrated a historic moment when Arshad Nadeem secured the country's first Olympic gold medal in javelin throw since 1984. Nadeem's victory, achieved despite limited resources and funding, has sparked calls for increased government support for athletes.  

The fifth anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir was marked by renewed debate. Pakistan condemned India's move, highlighting the need for a dialogue to resolve the Kashmir issue. In the UK, a stabbing incident at a dance studio, initially linked to a Muslim immigrant, fueled Islamophobia and prompted concerns about the rise of far-right sentiments.   

Protests in Bangladesh over job quotas led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing to India, raising questions about the stability of the Bangladeshi government and its implications for regional dynamics.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/paris-olympics-india-hockey-sport-consistency-9506283/</link>
			<description>The article discusses India's rise in international hockey, analyzing the factors contributing to the team's success. While acknowledging the improvement in sporting infrastructure and talent development, the author emphasizes the importance of a deeper understanding and appreciation of sports among the general public. 

Drawing from her experience watching the Olympics, the author highlights the German fans' informed and analytical approach to the game. She contrasts this with the tendency in India to either idolize or criticize athletes without a nuanced understanding of the sport itself. 

Ultimately, the author argues that for India to become a true sporting nation, citizens need to engage with sports beyond simply cheering for their teams. Experiencing and understanding the nuances of various sports will foster a deeper respect for athletes and contribute to a more informed and supportive sporting culture.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/prabhat-patnaik-writes-on-buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-a-communist-first-9506157/</link>
			<description>Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's involvement in communist politics stemmed from the vibrant intellectual and cultural environment of Bengal, combined with the party's strong organizational structure and commitment to land reforms. As part of the Left Front government, he played a crucial role in implementing policies that addressed economic disparity, strengthened participatory democracy, and boosted agricultural growth. However, his later decision to attract private industrial investment,  a departure from the party's traditional stance, led to alienation of the peasantry and ultimately contributed to the Left Front's decline. Despite this, Buddhadev Bhattacharjee's legacy remains significant for his championing of land rights, fostering grassroots politics, and promoting dialogue with internal resident groups through autonomous councils.</description>

			<title>SC/ST Sub-quota red lines and red herrings</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-st-sub-quota-red-lines-and-red-herrings-9505474/</link>
			<description>The recent Supreme Court verdict on sub-quotas within the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked debate. 

Supporters of social justice argue that the verdict, while seemingly concerning diluting reservation,  actually strengthens affirmative action by focusing on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities within these categories. Some criticisms against the ruling, focused on legal and political grounds, are deemed inaccurate and lacking evidence. 

The article highlights specific concerns regarding the potential misuse of sub-classification for political gains and the unintended consequences of applying the "creamy layer" doctrine to SCs and STs.  

It suggests focusing on addressing these flaws in the judgment rather than rejecting the notion of sub-quotas altogether.  Long-term solutions, such as enhancing reservation percentages, removing the 50% ceiling, and broadening the scope of social justice initiatives beyond public sector jobs, are also emphasized. Ultimately, the article urges a nuanced discussion that addresses the complexities of the verdict and its implications.</description>

			<title>Ram Madhav writes: In Bangladesh, it’s time for healing</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-in-bangladesh-its-time-for-healing-9505462/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's long-serving prime minister, recently faced unprecedented protests from young citizens  due to economic hardships and unrest triggered by the reinstatement of a controversial quota system for government jobs. Despite Bangladesh's significant economic growth under Hasina,  inequality widened, unemployment rose, and cost of living soared, leading to resentment among the youth. Protests, initially against the quota system, escalated into a larger movement against Hasina's government.  The government's heavy-handed response,  labels the protests as "terrorism," and deployment of the ruling party's student wing against agitating students further inflamed the situation.</description>

			<title>Menaka Guruswamy writes on Manish Sisodia’s bail: A victory for right to life, liberty</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/menaka-guruswamy-writes-on-manish-sisodias-bail-a-victory-for-right-to-life-liberty-9505473/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court granted bail to Manish Sisodia, former Delhi deputy Chief Minister, after he spent over a year and a half in jail without conviction. The court emphasized that bail is the norm and jail an exception, highlighting the importance of speedy trials to uphold the right to life and liberty.  

The judgment also states that the right to bail should be considered in cases of significant delay coupled with prolonged incarceration. The court expects trial courts and High Courts to adhere to the "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" principle while considering bail applications under both the CrPC and PMLA. This comes as the right to bail faces pressure, particularly in money laundering cases. 


The court acknowledged the state's assurance that the trial would be concluded within 6-8 months, but also recognized the impracticality of such a timeline given the volume of witnesses and documents.  The judgment underscores the importance of sharing all relevant evidence, including potentially exculpatory material, to ensure a fair trial.</description>

			<title>SC verdict on subclassification of caste-based reservation will worsen reality of the Dalit community. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-verdict-on-subclassification-of-caste-based-reservation-will-worsen-reality-of-the-dalit-community-heres-why-9505463/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court's verdict allowing sub-classification within Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and introducing a creamy layer concept is highly problematic.  The judgment ignores the severe social realities faced by a vast majority of Dalits who struggle for basic survival and are unable to benefit from reservation. The court overlooks the fact that government posts reserved for SCs/STs remain vacant due to a lack of eligible candidates, often cited as a consequence of  systemic disadvantages.  

Equating the OBC creamy layer with Dalit exclusion from reservation is illogical given the distinct social and economic positions of the two groups. Sub-classifying Dalits will only exacerbate existing inequalities and create further division.   

The judgment disregards the persistent social stigma and "camouflaged untouchability" faced by Dalits, regardless of their economic status, which remains a primary justification for reservation. The court's decision also violates constitutional provisions that clearly define the process for identifying Scheduled Castes and prohibits any subsequent modifications.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-delhi-must-reach-out-to-dhaka-9505461/</link>
			<description>The author believes that India's continued support for the new leadership in Bangladesh is crucial to prevent further instability. While highlighting the importance of protecting minority rights, particularly the Hindu community, the author urges India to avoid focusing solely on this issue, which could complicate relations. 

The author suggests that India should understand the student-led revolution in Bangladesh, engage with its leaders, and review its own policies that failed to anticipate the political turmoil.  They emphasize that Bangladesh is not "India's to lose" but "India's to win" through constructive engagement, emphasizing the need for India to shed any illusions of regional hegemony and build genuine support through diplomacy and economic cooperation.  Despite the current crisis, the author expresses optimism about the resilience of India-Bangladesh relations, with strategic patience and empathy playing key roles in navigating the situation.</description>

			<description>Despite a season-best throw, Neeraj Chopra won silver in Paris, falling short of defending his Tokyo gold. This achievement, nonetheless, cements his place as one of India's greatest track and field athletes, joining an exclusive club of only two others who have won Olympic medals in consecutive Games.  Chopra's performance was remarkable considering recurring groin pain from a previous injury. At 26, Chopra is approaching peak performance and has his sights set on breaking the 90-meter mark. His primary competitor? Arshad Nadeem, a fellow javelin thrower from Pakistan. Their rivalry, born out of mutual respect and competition, promises to be a highlight in the years to come.</description>

			<title>With Vinesh Phogat’s disqualification, questions for the government</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/vinesh-phogat-disqualification-questions-government-9504661/</link>
			<description>Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the gold-medal wrestling bout at the Paris Olympics has sparked widespread outrage in India. The incident is viewed as more than just a lost medal, as Phogat represents the struggle of Indian sportswomen against sexual abuse within the Wrestling Federation of India.  

Phogat and other wrestlers bravely exposed allegations against the then-WFI president, Brij Bhushan Singh, leading to a prolonged battle for justice. Despite facing backlash and hostility, Phogat persevered and achieved remarkable success in the Olympics. 

Her disqualification, however, has raised serious questions about the fairness of the system and the government's handling of the situation. The public is demanding answers and accountability, highlighting a larger issue of systemic injustice faced by athletes, especially women.</description>

			<title>How uncertainty of food inflation affects RBI’s policy going forward</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/food-inflation-rbi-policy-9503587/</link>
			<description>The RBI Monetary Policy Committee has kept policy rates unchanged, acknowledging market expectations but noting uncertainty about future actions. Food inflation, a significant component of the CPI basket, remains elevated due to climatic factors. While core inflation is subdued, high food prices impact household expectations, complicating the RBI's policy stance.

The RBI aims for a 4% CPI inflation target, but food inflation volatility poses a challenge. A strong monsoon may moderate food prices, but achieving the target remains a challenge. The RBI projects average FY25 inflation at 4.5%, with growth anticipated at 7.2%.

Global economic conditions are uncertain, with geo-political tensions and monetary policy divergence among countries.  The RBI is monitoring bank deposit growth and credit risk, noting the diversion of household savings towards other asset classes.  The RBI is likely to assess food inflation trends and could consider a shallow rate cut later in the year if food inflation moderates.</description>

			<title>25 years of ‘The Blair Witch Project’: All that is lost — and found — online</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/blair-witch-project-9503560/</link>
			<description>The Blair Witch Project, released in 1999, ingeniously blurred the lines between fact and fiction, capitalizing on the early internet's naivety. The film's "found footage" style, supported by a persuasive online campaign featuring fabricated evidence, created an unsettling ambiguity for viewers. 

Nowadays, the internet's evolution, marked by the prevalence of "found footage" tropes and the proliferation of deepfakes, has made such deception less effective.  What was once a simple affirmation of trust in online information has become a cautionary reminder of the dangers of believing everything encountered online.</description>

			<title>RBI’s interest rates remain unchanged. But food inflation will guide policy path</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/rbi-interest-rate-food-inflation-9503559/</link>
			<description>The RBI maintained its interest rates and focus on withdrawing accommodation in its August meeting. While headline inflation rose to 5.08% in June due to food price surges, the RBI anticipates moderation in the second quarter, projecting full year inflation at 4.5%. 

Growth prospects remain strong, enabling the MPC to prioritize inflation control. High food inflation, particularly in cereals, pulses, and vegetables, poses a risk of fueling household inflation expectations and potentially spilling over to core inflation.  

Despite this, core inflation remains subdued, encouraging the RBI's continued disinflationary stance. Global trends suggest that central banks are considering interest rate cuts, but the RBI awaits further clarity on food inflation's trajectory before making policy adjustments at its October meeting.</description>

			<description>Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, the last Left chief minister of West Bengal,  championed a blend of communist ideology and economic liberalization. He sought to modernize the state's infrastructure and attract investment through projects like the SEZ in Nandigram and the Nano plant in Singur.  

However, his vision was challenged by a rigid party structure resistant to change, and his attempts at reform were ultimately overshadowed by the controversial land acquisition protests in Nandigram. While he is remembered for his progressive stance and contributions to cinema and culture, his legacy is marked by the decline of the CPM in West Bengal, a decline he deeply regretted.</description>

			<title>Vinesh Phogat and athletes ‘weight cutting’ — why they do it and the health dangers</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/vinesh-phogat-athletes-weight-cutting-health-dangers-9502447/</link>
			<description>Weight management in sports, particularly wrestling, involves careful strategies to fit within weight categories. Athletes often employ extreme measures to shed weight before competitions, such as excessive workouts, fasting, and dehydration.  This practice, while effective for short-term weight loss, can be detrimental to an athlete's health, leading to muscle loss, injury, and psychological issues.  The weight-loss methods commonly employed can lead athletes into a catabolic state, where their bodies begin breaking down muscle for energy. Despite the risks,  athletes continue to engage in these practices to gain a competitive advantage. The case of Vinesh Phogat, who narrowly missed her weight limit, highlights the potential for complications and the delicate balance between training and health.</description>

			<title>India is still some way from achieving universal health coverage. Here’s why</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-is-still-some-way-from-achieving-universal-health-coverage-heres-why-9502154/</link>
			<description>The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), launched in 2018, aimed to improve healthcare coverage for India's poorest population. An analysis of recent household expenditure survey data shows that while coverage of public health insurance programs increased for the poorest population quintiles since 2018, it remains low, with less than 30% covered.  Furthermore, the utilization of public health insurance among covered individuals remains low. The data also reveals that while the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for inpatient care has decreased for the poorest populations, they still incur significant costs.  



Despite some progress, the survey indicates that India is still lagging in achieving Universal Health Coverage through targeted public health insurance. Key challenges remain in expanding coverage to the intended beneficiaries and ensuring robust financial protection, particularly for the poorest populations.</description>

			<title>Reducing the poor’s health burden</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ayushman-bharat-india-poor-9501487/</link>
			<description>This analysis examines the vulnerability of India's bottom 50% population to medical shocks, particularly hospitalisation, using data from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23. 

It reveals a positive trend: the proportion of households experiencing hospitalisation has increased, indicating improved healthcare access.  Interestingly, while overall health expenditure has risen slightly for households without hospitalisation, the share consumed by hospitalisation has declined significantly. This suggests hospitalisation is becoming more affordable. 

Furthermore, the analysis shows a decrease in the likelihood of households facing a decline in consumption status due to hospitalisation costs. This improvement is particularly pronounced in rural areas and for households with young children and elderly members.  The study attributes these positive developments to public health policies like Ayushman Bharat Yojana, aimed at mitigating the financial burden of hospitalisation for the poor.</description>

			<title>Why accusations of witchcraft persist in India</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/witchcraft-accusations-india-9501493/</link>
			<description>India is grappling with an issue of witch-hunting, despite strides in development. While global awareness of the problem is increasing, India faces a unique challenge. Though most incidents occur in rural areas, witch-hunting remains a serious concern, documented by the NCRB.  

Between 2009 and 2019, the UN recorded 20,000 cases of harmful witch-related practices across 60 countries, including India. Despite various state-specific laws aiming to combat this practice, implementation remains a challenge. 

Low prosecution rates, lenient penalties, and a lack of clarity regarding the intent of the legislation hinder effective action. The issue requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing education, awareness campaigns, and reforms within the criminal justice system.  It also demands a clear distinction between the practice of witchcraft and the accusation of witchcraft, which often leads to violence and persecution.</description>

			<title>The 25-hour day – don’t waste if on ‘productivity’</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/25-hour-day-productivity-9501469/</link>
			<description>A future study predicts that the Moon's gradual movement away from Earth will lengthen our days to 25 hours in millions of years. This extra hour could be a valuable resource for individuals overwhelmed by the demands of modern life.  The current 24-hour day often leaves little time for personal pursuits or simply being. Despite the need for work and family obligations, an extra hour could allow for moments of solitude and self-care. The article argues for a more flexible approach to productivity, allowing individuals the space to pursue their own interests and find balance in their lives.</description>

			<title>For taxpayers, a welcome easing</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/income-tax-act-budget-9501468/</link>
			<description>The Union Budget 2024-25 proposed a review of the Income Tax Act to simplify its provisions and reduce tax disputes. One significant proposal was to simplify capital gains taxation by introducing a flat tax rate of 12.5% across all asset classes, while eliminating the indexation benefit for property, gold, and unlisted assets.  This sparked criticism, leading the government to amend the proposal. Investors now have the option to choose between the lower tax rate of 12.5% without indexation or the existing 20% tax rate with indexation for properties acquired before July 23, 2024.  The government's aim is to provide clarity and reduce tax uncertainties for individuals.</description>

			<title>Proposed amendment to Waqf Act polices charity, hinders autonomy</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/waqf-act-amendment-9501430/</link>
			<description>The concept of Waqf stems from Islamic religious beliefs, involving the dedication of property for charitable purposes.  It is a form of religious charity, not an obligation, and its history is deeply rooted in legal frameworks. The proposed amendments to the Waqf Act, however, raise concerns. They grant extensive government control over Waqf properties, which are considered private and self-acquired by Muslims.  Critics argue that this  oversteps constitutional guarantees, particularly regarding the management of religious properties and the rights of Muslim citizens. 


The amendments also introduce impediments to the creation of new Waqfs and threaten existing ones through the concept of adverse possession. These measures are seen as undermining the autonomy of Waqf institutions and creating vulnerabilities for the Muslim community.</description>

			<title>Behind Sheikh Hasina government’s fall, Bangladesh’s long history of confrontational politics</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sheikh-hasina-government-fall-bangladeshs-long-history-politics-9500917/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing political turmoil following student-led protests that escalated into demands for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The protests, initially focused on job-quota concerns, reflected a deeper discontent stemming from Bangladesh’s history of cyclical political violence and party rivalry.  The situation led to Hasina’s resignation and the establishment of an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. 

The country faces significant challenges, including addressing economic concerns and fostering a democratic ethos. The effectiveness of the interim government depends on its ability to navigate political complexities and engage with diverse stakeholders, including the opposition BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami.  


 Bangladesh’s relationship with India, marked by economic interdependence and security concerns, is being closely watched as India seeks to promote stability and development in its neighbor.</description>

			<title>Lesson from coaching centre tragedy: Don’t break the dreams of students</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/lesson-coaching-centre-tragedy-break-dreams-students-9500329/</link>
			<description>The coaching industry in India has grown into a dominant force, pressuring students to achieve success through standardized tests and narrow career paths. This has led to a focus on rote learning and competition, neglecting the joy of learning and the development of well-rounded individuals. 

The author argues that this system is detrimental, leading to mental exhaustion, anxiety, and a decline in creativity and critical thinking. They propose three steps to address this issue:  redefine the purpose of education to prioritize life skills and compassion, encourage critical thinking and activism against the decline of public education, and restore the meaning of studentship as a lifelong journey of learning and exploration.</description>

			<title>How a wildlife sanctuary in the Great Nicobar Island was made to vanish</title>

			<description>This article discusses a controversial port project in Great Nicobar Island. The project site, Galathea Bay, was previously designated as a wildlife sanctuary due to its significant ecological value, including nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles and coral reefs. 

Despite this, the sanctuary was de-notified, and the project received environmental clearance, raising concerns about environmental damage. The article highlights inconsistencies and questionable decisions made by government agencies, ultimately concluding that the project proceeds despite the area's clear designation as a protected zone.  The author argues that environmental considerations were disregarded in favor of development, setting a concerning precedent.</description>

			<description>While India's constitutional changes regarding Kashmir have diminished its international salience, the issue remains significant in the bilateral relationship with Pakistan. 

The international focus on Kashmir has lessened due to India's economic growth, stronger partnerships with the West and the Islamic world, and Pakistan's internal political divisions. However,  Pakistan continues to back cross-border terrorism and opposes the constitutional changes, hindering formal engagement between the two nations. Although civilian leaders in Pakistan have shown interest in dialogue, the military's influence remains strong.  India must remain vigilant, addressing internal reconciliation in Kashmir, counterterrorism efforts, and engaging with diverse segments of Pakistani society to ensure lasting peace.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the history of sex testing in sport, focusing on the case of Spanish athlete Maria Jose Martinez-Patino who was subjected to traumatic testing due to androgen insensitivity.  Sex testing evolved from "nude parades" to chromosome testing before ending in 1999. The debate shifted to testosterone levels, leading to the case of Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, who successfully challenged regulations based on high testosterone. The article argues that the binary insistence on male and female categories in sport is flawed, given the spectrum of biological sex variations. It highlights the case of Martinez-Patino, who later participated in arguments against Chand despite her own experience with problematic testing, demonstrating the complex and often contradictory nature of this issue.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-uttarakhand-to-wayanad-balancing-realpolitik-with-green-transition-9499417/</link>
			<description>India's transition to green energy is characterized by diverse state-led initiatives, reflecting a lack of uniform progress. While the central government has made notable strides in setting targets and promoting collaboration between ministries, challenges persist in areas like transmission infrastructure, energy storage, and securing long-term green finance.  

State governments exhibit varying levels of commitment and progress, influenced by factors like policy environment, demographics, and financial resources.  

The green energy transition presents a complex policy dilemma, balancing national security concerns regarding dependence on China with the imperative of accelerating the shift to clean energy.  

Furthermore, the article highlights the ethical imperative of addressing global warming, urging a shift from nationalistic realpolitik towards a cooperative, global governance framework that prioritizes human well-being and environmental sustainability.</description>

			<description>Isaac Asimov's Foundation series depicts a futuristic society facing inevitable collapse, with a scientist establishing a repository of knowledge to preserve humanity.  Similarly, modern scientists propose a "lunar biorepository" to safeguard endangered species' DNA against potential extinction from various threats.  While this reflects a sci-fi fantasy becoming reality, it risks overshadowing the crucial point that for many, Earth remains their only home. Asimov himself would likely emphasize ethical considerations, urging science to prioritize the well-being of all, not just a privileged few.</description>

			<description>The 2024 IOC guidelines promote inclusivity in sports, emphasizing the right of all individuals to participate regardless of gender identity. However, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese athlete Lin Yu-ting have faced discrimination at the Paris Olympics, highlighting the persisting challenges related to gender identity in sports.  Historical gender tests have often been influenced by cultural biases rather than scientific objectivity.  Critics of including transgender athletes argue that it undermines the achievements of cisgender women, while athletes like Khelif and Dutee Chand have battled for recognition and acceptance in the face of such prejudice.  It is crucial to balance the need for fair competition with respect for the dignity and rights of all athletes.</description>

			<title>From Bangladesh’s students, a message: A fighting chance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-protests-students-message-fighting-chance-9498611/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing a significant political shift following the end of Sheikh Hasina's rule. This moment presents both opportunities and risks, requiring India to approach the situation with caution and respect for Bangladeshi agency.

While India has legitimate interests in Bangladesh's stability and security, its past support for authoritarianism should be re-evaluated. Simplifying the complex political dynamics by framing events solely through an Islamist lens risks alienating the Bangladeshi people.

Bangladesh faces two main challenges: reconciling its religious and secular identities, and establishing a truly democratic party system. Student movements, with their history of challenging authoritarianism, hold a crucial role in shaping the country's future. India should avoid interfering in Bangladesh's internal processes and instead encourage the country's path towards greater freedom and institutionalization.</description>

			<title>In riot-hit Britain, first real test for Keir Starmer’s government</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-riot-hit-britain-first-real-test-for-keir-starmers-government-9497835/</link>
			<description>Recent riots across several British towns, sparked by rumors and misinformation surrounding the stabbing of three girls in Southport, have highlighted the growing influence of far-right ideologies and online hate speech. The violence, which targeted mosques, asylum seeker housing, and other symbols of diversity, has raised serious concerns about the state of civil society and the government's ability to address the root causes of this unrest. While public figures and communities have condemned the violence and expressed solidarity with the victims, the incident has exposed deep-seated anxieties about immigration and the potential for online falsehoods to incite real-world harm. The Labour government faces the urgent challenge of tackling far-right extremism, ensuring swift justice for those responsible, and engaging in honest and constructive dialogue about immigration to counter the divisive rhetoric that fueled these events.</description>

			<title>Big Brother is binge-watching: How proposed law may censor online content</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/big-brother-binge-watching-proposed-law-censor-online-content-9497704/</link>
			<description>The draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024 seeks to extend regulations from traditional television to the internet, potentially impacting online speech and creative independence.  

The bill defines "digital news broadcasters" broadly, encompassing platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and podcasts discussing current affairs. It mandates registration, adherence to a Programme Code, and pre-certification for non-news content. 

Concerns arise from the bill's potential for censorship, particularly concerning political commentators. The broad powers granted to the government, coupled with extra-territorial application, raise questions about its practicality and potential impact on global content creators.  The bill also imposes new obligations on social media intermediaries, adding to existing regulatory burdens on free speech.  Critics argue that the bill's approach is ill-suited to the decentralized nature of the internet and propose alternative mechanisms like the IT Act 2000 for addressing concerns about harmful content.  The authors advocate for thorough deliberation and stakeholder engagement before the bill is enacted, emphasizing its significant implications for the future of online expression in India.</description>

			<title>With Bangladesh in turmoil, why India should exercise caution</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/with-bangladesh-in-turmoil-why-india-should-exercise-caution-9496925/</link>
			<description>The political landscape in Bangladesh has shifted dramatically with the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and the rise of army control. Protests triggered by economic hardship and government corruption have led to this change. 

India should acknowledge the Bangladeshi people's right to self-determination and support their expression of will. While acknowledging the positive developments in India-Bangladesh relations under Hasina's rule, it's important to allow the situation to stabilize and avoid taking sides. India should prioritize economic engagement with a future government while also maintaining a cautious and discreet approach. 

Pakistan and China might try to exploit the situation to challenge India's influence, but Delhi should focus on strengthening its ties with the Bangladeshi people based on shared interests and cultural affinities.</description>

			<title>On the stock market slump: Fall and correct</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/on-the-stock-market-slump-fall-and-correct-9496936/</link>
			<description>The US Federal Reserve's recent comments, hinting at a potential interest rate cut, had initially buoyed markets. However, weaker-than-expected US jobs data raised concerns about the economy, triggering a global sell-off.  The Indian market was heavily impacted, with the Sensex plunging over 2 percent. The fall was exacerbated by worries about valuations in certain segments of the Indian stock market.  Global factors, including the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike and Middle East tensions, also contributed to the market turmoil.   The upcoming RBI monetary policy meeting and domestic economic data releases are expected to influence the market's future movement.</description>

			<title>UK riots: A deliberate challenge to new Labour government</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uk-riots-a-deliberate-challenge-to-new-labour-government-9496966/</link>
			<description>Violence erupted in numerous UK cities following the stabbing of three young girls by a 17-year-old man. Though the arrested individual was not a Muslim, far-right groups quickly spread false information, fueling anti-Muslim sentiment and leading to attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses. This unrest reflects a pattern of growing violence against women and a rise in Islamophobia in the UK, fueled by political rhetoric and economic anxieties.  Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his government have condemned the violence and vowed to hold the perpetrators accountable, while civil society organizations and communities are working to counter the spread of hate and support victims.</description>

			<title>Yamini Krishnamurthy: Born to dance</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/yamini-krishnamurthy-born-to-dance-9496937/</link>
			<description>Yamini Krishnamurthy, a celebrated classical dancer who mastered Bharatnatyam, Kuchupudi, and Odissi, passed away on August 3. Born into a scholarly family, her passion for dance was ignited by the artistry of temple sculptures. 

She honed her skills at Kalakshetra under Rukmini Devi Arundale, but it was under the guidance of nattuvanars like Elappa Pillai and Kitappa Pillai that she found the expression and style that defined her artistry. Krishnamurthy's captivating performances, known for their precision, intricate footwork, and glamour, captivated audiences across India and the world. She received numerous accolades, including the Padma Shri in 1968, and held the esteemed title of Asthana Narthaki at the Tirupati Tirumala temple.  Krishnamurthy's legacy as a trailblazer in classical dance endures.</description>

			<description>India has rejected Sri Lanka's proposal for a joint inquiry into the bomb blast at Madras airport, stating that the question doesn't arise.  The statement came amidst  unclear claims regarding responsibility for the attack. Indian authorities are  preparing to prosecute several Akali leaders under the National Security Act for charges related to waging war against the country and sedition connected to the fighting at the Golden Temple complex.  The investigation in this case is ongoing.  Separately, India finalized a deal with the Soviet Union to purchase MiG-29 fighter jets, perceived as having capabilities comparable to F-16 Falcons and F-18 Hornet aircraft.</description>

			<title>Express View: The fall of Sheikh Hasina</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-the-fall-of-sheikh-hasina-9496926/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina's recent resignation and fleeing from Bangladesh follows a period of growing unrest and challenges to her authority. Despite her party's electoral victory, the election was marred by allegations of rigging and a boycott by opposition parties. Protests against job quotas escalated into nationwide demonstrations, met with a harsh response from the government that resulted in significant casualties. The recent turmoil highlights the limitations of Hasina's development narrative and her increasingly authoritarian methods.  Her unyielding stance on historical narratives and the suppression of dissent alienated segments of the populace, potentially paving the way for the resurgence of Islamist and pro-Pakistan sentiments. Hasina's downfall presents a challenge for India, which must now navigate the complexities of maintaining its relationship with Bangladesh while safeguarding its interests in the face of rising internal instability.</description>

			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-sheikh-hasina-had-to-flee-bangladesh-and-the-lesson-from-her-ouster-9496746/</link>
			<description>Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's longtime Prime Minister, resigned after 15 years in power.  Her rule, characterized by notable economic progress, was marred by alleged authoritarianism, suppression of dissent, and widespread corruption. Protests, initially sparked by student demands for quota reforms, escalated into a broader movement against her government's policies. 

The public's anger was fueled by the government's response to the protests, which included the deployment of force and the labelling of demonstrators as traitors. Hasina's departure signifies a turning point in Bangladesh's political landscape, highlighting the delicate balance between economic development and democratic values.</description>

			<title>How to deal with terrorism in Jammu</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-deal-with-terrorism-in-jammu-9496490/</link>
			<description>Recent events in Jammu have demonstrated a resurgence of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, with militants exploiting voids created by a shift in focus to other conflicts. 

This situation echoes past patterns of infiltration and tactical strategies employed by terrorists over the years. To address this,  a unified command, leveraging intelligence and engaging the local population, is crucial.  Synergy between the Army and CAPFs is essential, alongside re-equipping and training Village Defence Guards. 

The experience of previous counter-terrorism operations, including the successful strategy of  clearing jungle areas and denying terrorists refuge,  should be revisited.  Ultimately, sustained operations and effective logistics management are key to outmaneuvering and neutralizing the threat.</description>

			<title>Behind the UK race riots: Anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia and economic distress</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uk-race-riots-anti-immigrant-sentiment-islamophobia-economic-distress-9496621/</link>
			<description>The UK is experiencing riots following a knife attack in Southport that killed three children. The unrest, concentrated in England,  is fueled by discontent towards immigrants, perceived to be competing for resources like housing and jobs. Economic stagnation since 2008 has exacerbated these feelings. Previous riots in the 1970s, spurred by socio-economic disparities and racial tensions, resulted in police reforms. The UK's exit from Europe, driven by anxieties over immigration, further heightened these concerns. Islamophobia, amplified by the tragic incident's false associations to Muslims, fueled the recent unrest. While authorities promise swift action against rioters, the underlying economic issues require urgent addressing to prevent further social unrest.</description>

			<title>The irrational bull run: When stock market is driven by FOMO</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/stock-market-fall-irrational-bull-run-fomo-9496401/</link>
			<description>The Indian stock market significantly declined, triggered by growing concerns about the US economy. While domestic flows have driven the market lately,  high valuations  in India, defying logic,  raise concerns about a deeper correction.  

Though bulls have attempted to justify the continuous upward movement, the current cycle seems driven by fear of missing out and greed rather than fundamentals.  A price-to-earnings ratio similar to levels seen before the 2007 bull market peak  is a warning sign. Even companies with mediocre growth and challenging operating environments are experiencing soaring valuations. Market segments like small and midcaps and public sector companies exhibit extreme exuberance.  


Some CEO comments highlight this disconnect, with companies stating concerns about GDP correlation and challenging demand conditions while their stocks trade at inflated PE ratios. The question is whether the market will eventually adopt a more realistic view of valuations and growth prospects or if the bull run will continue.</description>

			<description>Five years after the abrogation of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir has seen improvements in economic development, governance, and tourism.  While security remains a concern with increasing infiltration in the Jammu sector and Pakistan's continued involvement in sponsoring terrorism, the region has experienced a record voter turnout in the recent elections.  Despite these advancements, restoring statehood remains a crucial step. 

A calibrated approach with clear timelines and active people's involvement in governance is essential.  The government must address the concerns of the people,  as their participation is key to building trust and alleviating alienation.</description>

			<description>The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the potential of telemedicine in managing chronic diseases like diabetes. Recognizing this, a software developed by AIIMS, Delhi, aims to extend specialized diabetes consultation to primary healthcare centers in rural India.  The software assists local healthcare professionals by processing patient data on risk factors and suggesting treatment, thus addressing the challenge of undiagnosed diabetes and limited specialist access in rural areas. 

However, this technology's effectiveness relies on the expertise of healthcare providers who adapt the software's advice to individual patient needs. Data confidentiality and seamless integration with the National Health Programme for Non-Communicable Diseases are crucial for the software's wider impact.</description>

			<description>The 2024-25 budget focuses on merging skill and scale to empower India's young workforce.

The article argues that the abrogation of Article 370  has contributed to a decline in violence, but emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to address the root causes of terrorism, including strengthening the J&amp;K Police,  enhancing political inclusivity, and isolating Pakistan geopolitically.</description>

			<title>Five years since abrogation of Article 370: How Kashmir can help build a national counter-narrative</title>

			<description>The Jammu and Kashmir Budget 2024-25 reveals a concerning economic picture five years after the abrogation of Article 370. Despite increased borrowing, public investment has declined sharply. Tax incidence and efficiency have also decreased, while the unemployment rate remains high. The abrogation, while ending the previous political discourse on Kashmir, has failed to deliver on promises of peace and prosperity.  Social media celebration of its revocation masks the underlying anxiety and disillusionment in Kashmir. Valley-centric political parties find themselves struggling to articulate a meaningful alternative, as the reality of a redefined role for the government sets in.


While restoring statehood enjoys national support, it is insufficient to address the complex socio-economic challenges facing Kashmir. The political leadership needs to engage in a transformative process, re-evaluating their ideology and re-positioning themselves to represent the plural, progressive aspirations of the people. This is the time for Kashmir to play a crucial role in shaping a more inclusive national narrative.</description>

			<title>Vandita Mishra writes: The court and social justice</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-reservation-social-justice-9494924/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court recently permitted the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation purposes. This decision allows states to differentiate within these categories to fine-tune affirmative action policies. The court emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and a clear rationale for sub-classification, subject to judicial review. 

While the ruling aims to address disparities within SC/ST communities, concerns have been raised about potential constitutional violations, political manipulation, and increased competition among marginalized groups. To ensure fair implementation, a comprehensive caste census is crucial. 



The verdict highlights the complex interplay of social justice, politics, and legal interpretations in India.</description>

			<title>Would Kamala Harris have succeeded in India? It’s unlikely</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kamala-harris-us-elections-india-9494399/</link>
			<description>This article explores the contrasting journeys of Kamala Harris and Usha Vance, two prominent Indian women in the US political landscape. Both exemplify the immigrant experience, leveraging their traditional Indian values and educational achievements to attain success. The author contrasts their rise in a society that encourages individuality and opportunity with the perceived limitations and societal pressures faced by similarly qualified Indians in their home country.  

The article argues that cultural norms and systemic issues in India stifle innovation and ambition, leading to a culture of mediocrity. It laments that while women like Harris and Vance thrive in a welcoming environment that values diversity, Indian society often discourages risk-taking and personal fulfillment.  Ultimately, the author suggests that India needs to foster a more inclusive and empowering environment to encourage its citizens to reach their full potential.</description>

			<title>What is a ‘privileged Dalit’? Creamy Layer definition cannot just be economic</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dalit-privileged-sc-st-quota-creamy-layer-economic-reservation-9494228/</link>
			<description>A recent Supreme Court judgement on sub-classification within SC and ST groups for reservation raises questions about its necessity and implementation. 

The author shares a personal experience of caste-based discrimination despite financial security, highlighting the persistence of social inequalities. While acknowledging the need to revisit reservations in light of changing social dynamics, the author questions how to objectively define who is most marginalised and fears that the reform could be exploited for political gain. The author emphasizes that economic progress alone does not eradicate the social disadvantages faced by Dalits, and a comprehensive caste survey is necessary to effectively address this issue.  Ultimately, the author argues that reservation, envisioned as a tool for achieving social equity and dismantling caste-based discrimination, must be preserved to ensure the continued upliftment of marginalized communities.</description>

			<title>International Conference of Agricultural Economists: A chance to cement India-Africa partnership in food security</title>
			<link>https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/international-conference-agricultural-economists-india-africa-partnership-food-security-9494053/</link>
			<description>The 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) is being held in Delhi, India, marking the country's second time hosting this global event. ICAE, with roots tracing back to Rabindranath Tagore and Lord L K Elmhirst's vision in 1921, focuses on global food and nutritional security.  

A unique study presented at ICAE compares the agricultural practices and outcomes of 20 Indian states with 15 African countries, highlighting key areas for improvement.  Both regions face challenges such as underfunding of agricultural research and development, and low agricultural spending relative to social protection. 

The study recommends prioritizing investments in agricultural R&amp;D and extension, reforming subsidies, and allocating resources to infrastructure development to boost agricultural growth and enhance child nutrition. 

The conference emphasizes the need for South-South collaboration, particularly between India and Africa, to address pressing food and nutritional security challenges, learning from each other's experiences and working together to build resilient food systems.</description>
