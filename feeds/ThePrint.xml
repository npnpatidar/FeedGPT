			<title>Global economic jitters: Fitch Ratings predicts 2024 impact from soaring oil price</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/global-economic-jitters-fitch-ratings-predicts-2024-impact-from-soaring-oil-price/1841217/</link>
			<description>Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has issued a warning about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic growth. The agency's Global Economic Outlook predicts that potential disruptions in the Middle East's oil supply due to conflicts could cause oil prices to surge, leading to a significant decrease in global GDP growth and a rise in inflation. Fitch's simulations show that if oil prices reach USD 120 per barrel in 2024 and USD 100 per barrel in 2025, there could be a 0.4 percentage point reduction in world GDP growth in 2024, with a lingering 0.1 percentage point lower growth in 2025. The impact is expected to be felt across the board, with most countries experiencing longer-lasting effects on GDP levels. Inflation rates would also be elevated in 2024, with India, Turkey, and Poland being particularly affected. Fitch highlights the potential ripple effects of an oil price shock, such as tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets. The report emphasizes the intricate web of global economic interdependencies and the vulnerabilities arising from geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions.</description>

			<description>South Africa's Rassie Van der Dussen believes that Australia has a good reference for winning knockout matches, but South Africa will maintain their must-win mindset in the upcoming semifinal match. Van der Dussen acknowledges that Australia has more experience in these situations, having won the World Cup and played in the semifinals before. However, he emphasizes that the outcome will depend on the performance of the teams on the day. South Africa has approached the tournament with a must-win mentality from the start, and they will continue to do so. Van der Dussen also mentions that South Africa wanted to test themselves by chasing down a total before the semifinal, as their chasing record in the tournament has been poor. They were successful in their recent match against Afghanistan, where Van der Dussen played a crucial unbeaten innings. South Africa's captain, Temba Bavuma, is a doubtful starter for the semifinal due to a hamstring injury. If he is unable to play, Reeza Hendricks is likely to open the batting.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.WeWork's announcement of its intent to terminate 65 leases as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing has had a significant impact on the real estate industry.

Some notable affected properties include 222 Kearny Street in San Francisco, 57 East 11th Street in Greenwich Village, and 315 West 36th Street in Hudson Yards.

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/on-cm-chouhans-home-turf-budhni-congress-hanuman-seeks-to-pull-off-a-miracle/1841203/</link>
			<description>The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh appears lukewarm to the upcoming assembly polls, despite BJP's longest-serving chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing competition from Congress candidate Vikram Mastal and Samajwadi Party's Vairagyanand Giri. Chouhan, who has won four times from Budhni since 2006, has not visited his assembly constituency after filing nomination papers. BJP flags dominate the constituency, while Congress emblems are rare. The BJP has focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi rather than projecting Chouhan as its CM face. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains confident, banking on people's anger towards Chouhan. However, supporters of Chouhan believe he will win with a record margin and cite his contributions to the constituency.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/hamas-terror-organization-behind-failed-missile-launch-that-hit-al-shifa-hospital-idf/1841194/</link>
			<description>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the Hamas terror group misfired a projectile at IDF troops near Shifa Hospital in Gaza. However, Hamas-run media immediately stated that the strike was carried out by the IDF. The IDF Arab Spokesman Avichay Adraee confirmed that a rocket-propelled grenade hit the hospital, and Hamas was responsible for the failed missile. The IDF also reported that they controlled the Hamas Beach Brigade's Badr site and eliminated approximately 150 Hamas terrorists. The 401st Armored Brigade destroyed the military command headquarters, rocket launch sites, and manufacturing sites for weapons and rocket launchers. About 30 Hamas saboteurs were found inside the Blue Beach hotel, using it as a safe haven and to plan attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is trying to avoid harming Gazan civilians, while Hamas is preventing civilians from moving to safe zones and using them as human shields. Netanyahu also accused Hamas of using schools, mosques, and hospitals as terror command centers. The Israeli Foreign Ministry revised the death toll of last month's Hamas attacks to nearly 1200.</description>

			<title>This is how London tackled air pollution. Delhi can learn</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/this-is-how-london-tackled-air-pollution-delhi-can-learn/1841039/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the issue of air pollution in London and Delhi, highlighting the steps taken by London to improve air quality and suggesting similar actions should be taken in India. In 1952, London experienced a severe fog that led to thousands of deaths and prompted the implementation of the Clean Air Act. Over time, coal was replaced with gas, power plants were cleaned up, and emission standards were introduced. London has also implemented low emission zones and restrictions on polluting vehicles. Despite not meeting WHO guidelines, London's air quality is better than Delhi's. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action in India, where an estimated 1.6 million people die from air pollution each year. Road dust and vehicular pollution are major contributors, and collective action is required to address the issue. Improving public transport and reducing vehicle emissions are key solutions. Short-term emergency measures are not enough; sustained action is necessary to clean up the air.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/possession-of-school-run-by-azam-khans-trust-handed-over-to-up-education-department/1841037/</link>
			<description>The possession of Rampur Public School, a property owned by Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's trust, along with an office of the SP leader and another building used for party activities, was handed over to the Secondary Education Department according to a state cabinet decision. Locks were placed on both buildings in the presence of heavy police force, sealing them. The decision to take back ownership of the land leased to the Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Trust, which operates the school, was made due to alleged violations of the lease deed. The old Murtaza School building, previously used as the office of the District Inspector of Schools (DIOS), was also allocated to the trust. The administration has taken possession of both buildings and transferred them to the DIOS. However, SP members protested, claiming that the office was separate from the school's land. The government canceled the 30-year lease and the education department assumed control of the property. Azam Khan and his family are currently in jail after being convicted in a fake birth certificate case.</description>

			<title>Clinical trial in pregnant women aims to detect foetal cardiac defects</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/clinical-trial-in-pregnant-women-aims-to-detect-foetal-cardiac-defects/1841011/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in the journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology has found a link between high levels of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in pregnant women and foetal atrioventricular block (AVB). Foetal AVB occurs when inflammation and scarring prevent electric signals from reaching the heart's ventricles, leading to lifelong pacing and potential fatality. The incidence of AVB increased with higher levels of these antibodies, particularly in women who had a previous child with AVB. The study also showed that home-based foetal heart rate monitoring can accurately diagnose conduction problems, reducing the need for repeated echocardiograms. The researchers emphasize the importance of monitoring antibody levels in pregnant women to determine the risk and need for surveillance.</description>

			<title>Obinutuzumab trial yields promising outcomes in patients with lupus nephritis</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/obinutuzumab-trial-yields-promising-outcomes-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/1841009/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Researchers have found that obinutuzumab, an antibody that targets immune cells, is effective in preserving kidney function and preventing flares in patients with lupus nephritis. The study, published in Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology, showed that adding obinutuzumab to lupus nephritis treatment reduced the risk of mortality, decline in kidney function, or treatment failure by 60% compared to standard care. It also lowered the incidence of lupus nephritis relapses by 57% and improved kidney function. Additionally, a higher percentage of obinutuzumab-treated patients achieved complete remission of lupus nephritis without the need for as many glucocorticoids. The findings suggest that obinutuzumab may help preserve kidney survival and improve outcomes for patients with lupus nephritis.</description>

Additionally, efforts have been intensified to accelerate the repatriation process, with over 180 "illegal" Afghans sent to the Chaman border for repatriation.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court heard several important cases on Friday, November 10. Here are the key highlights: 

1. The court emphasized that the decision on implementing the odd-even car rationing scheme in Delhi should be made by the city government, not the court.

2. The court warned that burning crop residue in Punjab and neighboring states must stop, and a "carrot and stick" policy is needed to address this issue. Failure to take action will have negative consequences for everyone, especially children.

4. The court criticized the Punjab governor for casting doubt on the validity of an assembly session and withholding his decision indefinitely on bills passed by the House.

5. The court reprimanded the Uttar Pradesh government for not complying with its order to provide counseling to a Muslim boy and his classmates who were instructed by their teacher to slap him for not completing his homework.

6. The court granted protection from arrest to two journalists who challenged summons issued by Gujarat Police related to an article they allegedly wrote about Adani Group.

7. The court refused to stay proceedings before the Allahabad High Court regarding suits related to the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah dispute, stating that it would not be fair to interfere without hearing both sides.

8. The Nagaland government informed the court that a bill reserving 33% of seats in urban local bodies for women has been passed by the state assembly, and elections will be completed by April 30 next year.

9. The court declined to entertain a plea seeking guidelines from the central government for protecting Hinduism in India.

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has criticized the governors of Punjab and Tamil Nadu for delaying approval of bills passed by their respective state legislatures. The court warned Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit against "playing with fire" and expressed concern over his Chennai counterpart, who was accused of withholding assent to 12 bills. The court emphasized that as the titular head of the state, the governor cannot question the validity of an assembly session or indefinitely delay decisions on bills. It cited Article 200 of the Constitution, which outlines the governor's options when presented with a bill. The court also questioned the Punjab government for repeatedly adjourning the budget session instead of proroguing it. In a similar case, the court deemed the delay by Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi in granting assent to bills a "matter of serious concern" and sought a response from the central government.</description>

			<title>South Korea: President Yoon’s war against “fake news” raises concerns over free speech</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/south-korea-president-yoons-war-against-fake-news-raises-concerns-over-free-speech/1840994/</link>
			<description>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.</description>
