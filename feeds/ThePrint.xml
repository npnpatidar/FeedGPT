			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. South Korea has announced plans to provide 38 trillion won ($29 billion) in financing over the next five years to strengthen its battery industry. South Korean battery firms, such as LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On, currently hold a 49% share of the global battery market excluding China. However, their dependence on foreign countries for key materials necessitates diversification. The government plans to offer tax incentives, loan support, and financial assistance to battery industry firms investing overseas. These measures aim to enhance the competitiveness of South Korea's secondary battery industry in the long term. Please note that this summary is generated by GPT-3.5 and may not include all the details from the original article.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved the first review of Sri Lanka's $3 billion bailout, providing approximately $337 million in funds to address the country's severe financial crisis. Sri Lanka experienced its worst financial crisis since gaining independence in 1948, leading to a plummeting economy, high inflation, currency depreciation, and low foreign reserves. The IMF has now sent a total of around $670 million to Sri Lanka. The approval of Memoranda of Understanding with official creditors and timely implementation of agreements, along with resolving issues with external private creditors, are crucial for restoring Sri Lanka's debt sustainability. Sri Lanka's economy began stabilizing after securing the IMF bailout, and the country's parliament recently approved an increase in value-added tax (VAT) to meet revenue targets set under the IMF program.

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article reports that NCP MLA Rohit Pawar and several others were detained by the police during a protest in Nagpur. The protest march, called the 'Yuva Sangharsh Morcha,' culminated in a public meeting on Tekdi Road. The participants of the march wanted to hand over memorandums of demands to the Maharashtra government, but no representative was present to accept them. As a result, angry NCP workers shouted slogans and attempted to head towards the legislature complex. Subsequently, the police detained Rohit Pawar, Salil Deshmukh, Sangram Deshmukh, and other NCP workers. The march had started from Pune and covered a distance of around 800 km before reaching Nagpur, where the winter session of the Maharashtra legislature is taking place.

This move aims to make it easier for people to travel to Kenya without the burden of visa requirements. The tourism industry in Kenya, which offers beach holidays and wildlife safaris, plays a vital role in the country's economy. President Ruto expressed a welcoming message to humanity, emphasizing that Kenya is open to visitors.

			<description>Puma will end its sponsorship of Israel's national football team next year. The decision was made before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Puma's spokesperson stated that the contracts of some federations, including Serbia and Israel, will expire in 2024. This decision was part of Puma's new "fewer-bigger-better strategy" and aligned with the timelines for designing and developing team jerseys. The Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement had called for a boycott of Puma due to its sponsorship of the Israeli team. Boycott calls have grown stronger following Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.

			<title>US expects to make multi-billion chips awards within the next year</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/us-expects-to-make-multi-billion-chips-awards-within-the-next-year/1882384/</link>
			<description>U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has announced plans to make approximately a dozen semiconductor chips funding awards within the next year, with multi-billion dollar announcements expected to significantly impact U.S. chip production. The first award of $35 million was granted to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire for producing chips for fighter planes as part of the "Chips for America" semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program. Raimondo aims to increase the percentage of semiconductors produced in the United States from about 12% to closer to 20% and establish at least two "leading-edge" U.S. manufacturing clusters. The program has received significant interest from companies like Intel, Micron, and GlobalFoundries. Congress has allocated $39 billion for manufacturing incentives. Funding awards are expected to range between 5%-15% of project capital expenditures, with total award amounts generally not exceeding 35% of project capital expenditures.</description>

			<title>Children are the best investment for China says Beijing think tank</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/children-are-the-best-investment-for-china-says-beijing-think-tank/1882378/</link>
			<description>The Beijing policy institute has suggested that investing in children would be beneficial for China's economy, as the country experienced its first population decline in over six decades in 2022. The report emphasizes that infrastructure investment and manufacturing capacity are reaching saturation, making children the best investment for stimulating consumption and expanding domestic demand. Additionally, the report recommends the urgent reversal of the decline in newborn numbers and the implementation of national-level maternity subsidies to reduce the high cost of childbearing and rearing. It also highlights the current insufficiency of subsidies compared to European countries and the challenges women face in balancing family and work, contributing to the low fertility willingness among Chinese people. These factors, combined with a drop of roughly 850,000 people in China's population, mark the first decline since 1961.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/japan-court-to-rule-on-ex-soldiers-long-battle-in-sexual-assault-case/1882376/</link>
			<description>The article discusses a court ruling in a sexual assault case involving a former female soldier, Rina Gonoi, in Japan. The case, which has garnered international attention, centers around an incident in 2021 when Gonoi alleges she was assaulted by three male colleagues while serving in the army. Despite complaining to her superiors, she decided to leave the army when no action was taken. The defendants have denied the allegations. Gonoi's decision to go public with her accusations has drawn attention in a traditionally male-dominated society and coincided with Japan's efforts to recruit more women soldiers. It has also led to international recognition for Gonoi. Additionally, she has lodged a civil case seeking damages for the alleged assault and inaction despite her complaints.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/indian-shares-set-to-rise-ahead-of-inflation-data-fed-policy/1882307/</link>
			<description>The Nifty 50 index in India is expected to open higher, tracking the rise in Asian markets. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is due, and it is anticipated to show a moderation in inflation while still being above the Fed's target. The inflation data, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve's commentary, could influence the near-term rate outlook. Additionally, India's retail inflation likely picked up in November due to higher food prices. The Nifty 50 has recently achieved new all-time highs, supported by strong macroeconomic data, a decline in crude oil prices, favorable global interest rate outlook, the resurgence of foreign inflows, and sustained inflows from domestic mutual fund investors.

Some key stocks to watch include Dixon Technologies, which secured a manufacturing contract from Lenovo, and Rail Vikas Nigam, whose joint venture emerged as the lowest bidder for a project worth 5.43 billion rupees. SpiceJet has adjourned a meeting to consider quarterly results and raise fresh capital, while Mankind Pharma is likely to see a stake sale via block deals worth at least $590 million.</description>

			<description>Epic Games has prevailed in its antitrust trial against Google's Play app store, with the California jury finding against the alleged monopoly on all counts. This ruling could potentially impact the app store economy by giving developers more control over app distribution and profits. Google plans to appeal, maintaining its commitment to the Android business model and users. Additionally, Epic Games has also filed a similar antitrust case against Apple, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, while Apple is fighting a ruling that would require changes to its App Store rules.</description>

			<description>Epic Games has won an antitrust trial against Google's Play app marketplace, with the California jury ruling against Google's monopoly on all counts. This trial was in response to Epic's lawsuit filed in 2020, which challenged the dominance of the Google Play store and Google's 30% fee on in-app sales. The court will now work on remedies starting in January. Epic's lawsuit also accused Google of blocking alternative app stores on the Play store. Meanwhile, Google has denied wrongdoing and settled related claims with other companies and antitrust claims by U.S. states and consumers. Epic has also lodged a similar antitrust case against Apple, with ongoing legal battles between the two companies.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who is President Vladimir Putin's top oil and gas representative, will lead a delegation of up to 20 officials to China. The purpose of the visit is to participate in an intergovernmental commission on energy. The delegation will be in China from December 12 to 16. China has become one of Russia's main trade partners, along with India, and they purchase a significant amount of Russian oil exports. This shift in trade occurred after Russia faced sanctions following the conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, Russia aims to increase its natural gas supplies to China, with plans to reach around 100 billion cubic meters per year by 2030. Moscow has been engaged in discussions with China regarding the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which would transport Russian natural gas from northern Siberia to China via Mongolia.

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/argentina-president-javier-milei-asks-nation-to-brace-for-painful-economic-shock/1881982/</link>
			<description>Argentina's newly elected President, Javier Milei, has warned the country to prepare for "painful austerity measures" in response to the country's economic crisis. Milei, known for hard-right libertarian views, plans to implement radical measures to fix the economy, including spending cuts and switching the Argentinian peso for the US dollar. His abrasive style has drawn comparisons with former US President Donald Trump, and his anti-establishment message has resonated with many Argentinians. Although he faces challenges in governing effectively due to his coalition's lack of majority in the legislature, signs indicate that he may soften his more radical positions in office.</description>

			<description>The article reports that on a particular day, U.S. stocks were muted, gold prices dropped to a near three-week low, and the dollar firmed against other currencies as investors awaited crucial inflation data and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting.

The three major U.S. stock indexes were mixed, with the Dow Jones edging higher, the Nasdaq nominally lower, and the S&amp;P 500 essentially unchanged. Gold dropped to a near three-week low as the dollar firmed and Treasury yields moved higher.

European shares were slightly higher as market participants awaited critical U.S. economic data and interest rate decisions from the Fed and other major central banks. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained slightly, while emerging market stocks lost 0.24%. U.S. Treasury yields extended last week’s rise as investors prepped for two auctions as well as the Fed’s policy meeting, which could determine whether a monetary policy shift is on the horizon. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell to yield 4.2698%, from 4.245% late on Friday, and the 30-year bond last fell to yield 4.3526%, from 4.326% late on Friday.

The dollar edged higher against a basket of world currencies, the Japanese yen weakened, and Sterling was last trading slightly higher on the day. Oil prices were slightly higher, with U.S. crude falling to $71.15 per barrel and Brent last at $75.82. Gold slid to a near three-week low as the dollar firmed, dropping by 1.0% to $1,982.49 an ounce.

			<description>The new draft of the Global Stocktake (GST) agreement focuses on reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels in a just, orderly, and equitable manner to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050, in line with scientific recommendations. The draft acknowledges the need to triple renewable energy capacity globally and double the energy efficiency rate by 2030. It also emphasizes principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in combatting climate change. The text has been criticized for being a "watered down menu of compromises" and for dropping explicit language on phasing out fossil fuels, potentially favoring prolonged fossil fuel use. There is also concern about the lack of obligation for developed countries to provide finance for adaptation and mitigation efforts.</description>

			<title>Training algorithm breaks barriers to deep physical neural networks: Research</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/training-algorithm-breaks-barriers-to-deep-physical-neural-networks-research/1881846/</link>
			<description>Researchers at EPFL have developed an algorithm that can train analog neural networks as accurately as digital ones, enabling the creation of more efficient alternatives to power-hungry deep learning hardware. The algorithm allows for training physical systems using sound waves, light waves, and microwaves to carry information, rather than electrons. The approach, known as the physical local learning algorithm (PhyLL), replaces the backward pass (BP) step with a second forward pass through the physical system to update each network layer locally. This method decreases power use, eliminates the need for a digital twin, and better reflects human learning. The research team aims to decrease digital computation and increase network scalability, with the goal of eventually implementing their algorithm on a small-scale optical system. While the approach is the first BP-free training of deep physical neural networks, some digital updates of the parameters are still required, making it a hybrid training approach. The ultimate goal is to overcome technical limitations of physical systems and increase network scalability.</description>

			<description>The Australian government plans to reduce the annual migrant intake by 50% within two years by imposing tougher tests on overseas students and by turning away workers with low skills. This may impact Indian students planning to study in Australia. The new migration strategy includes a stronger English language test for students and measures to ensure they are genuine students. The government also aims to make it harder for students to stay in the country if they do not find jobs that help fill the nation’s skills shortages. Additionally, a new “skills in demand” visa will be established to prioritize skilled foreign workers with commitments to work in regional Australia.</description>

The article also highlights the severity of air pollution in Lahore and the need for comprehensive measures to combat it, including proper monitoring, real-time air pollution data, and addressing key sources of pollution such as construction and transport emissions.</description>

			<description>Researchers from Linkoping University in Sweden conducted a study analyzing the brains of 16 people who had been hospitalized for Covid-19 and still had symptoms. They used a new type of MRI called advanced diffusion MRI to examine the brain's white matter, which consists of nerve axons and is crucial for brain function. Their findings, published in the journal Brain Communications, suggest changes in brain tissue structure in patients with persistent Covid-19 symptoms. The researchers hope to use this technology to understand the long-term effects of Covid-19 on the brain. They also aim to investigate how changes detected with diffusion MRI are connected to brain activity and whether these changes are permanent or temporary.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/yen-slides-as-hopes-of-december-boj-pivot-fade-chinas-yuan-falls/1881665/</link>
			<description>The article discusses several key points related to the foreign exchange market and economic indicators. Here are the main highlights:

1. The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen after a report suggested the Bank of Japan may not end negative interest rates in December.

2. China's yuan fell to a three-week low due to worsening deflation in November.

3. Investors are focused on U.S. inflation figures for November, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, and the upcoming rate decisions by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.

4. Economists expect U.S. inflation to slow to 3.1% in November year-on-year and anticipate the Fed to hold interest rates at the current level for a third meeting in a row.

5. U.S. job growth accelerated in November, challenging expectations of imminent rate cuts from the Fed beginning early next year.

6. Data over the weekend revealed that China's consumer prices fell at the fastest pace in three years in November, and factory-gate deflation deepened, indicating increasing deflationary pressure as weak domestic demand casts doubt over the country's economic recovery.

7. The yuan weakened to a three-week low, and the lack of a strong economic revival suggests that weak inflation will persist, requiring more policy support.

			<description>The Delhi High Court has expunged certain remarks made against a lawyer by a single judge who had dismissed his plea seeking direction to the Centre to prohibit the display of anti-tobacco health spots with graphic images during film screenings and on television and OTT platforms. The lawyer filed an appeal challenging the dismissal of his petition, but later tendered an unconditional apology and expressed regret, leading the court to accept the apology and expunge the remarks made by the single judge. The court observed that the government is taking measures to spread awareness about the harmful impact of tobacco consumption through the issuance of anti-tobacco health spots and disclaimers under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) rules. The petitioner's grievance was against the incorporation and prevalence of graphic anti-tobacco imagery in the health spots played during the screening of movies and television programs.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/ani-press-releases/dwarka-expressway-live-in-a-skyscraper-city-get-stellar-returns-on-investment/1881562/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the remarkable development along the Dwarka Expressway in Delhi-NCR, India. This development is fueled by its strategic proximity to the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and the Haryana Government’s ambitious Global City Project, which has given rise to unprecedented growth and investment opportunities. The region has been transformed into a promising real estate hotspot, reshaping the National Capital Region (NCR) landscape.

The Dwarka Expressway promises a congestion-free living experience with upcoming urban developments such as the "Skyscraper City" under the Global City Project. This initiative envisions residential, commercial, institutional, and recreational spaces to cater to the evolving needs of residents and multinational corporations, further elevating the appeal of Dwarka Expressway.

The article also emphasizes the rapid growth of Gurugram as India’s real estate leader, boasting a remarkable 28.9% quarter-on-quarter growth in 2023, far exceeding the national average. Luxury housing has particularly attracted buyers from the national capital, and the Haryana government’s 1000-acre Global City project in Sector 36 and 37D is expected to contribute to tremendous growth in the region’s real estate market.

The region is witnessing the development of business parks, IT parks, hotels, retail arenas, golf courses, diplomatic enclaves, eco-parks, and more. The growth and development of Shop-Cum-Office (SCO) spaces are also providing compelling propositions for small and medium enterprises seeking integrated office and retail solutions.

Overall, Dwarka Expressway is poised to emerge as a prominent realty hotspot in the NCR, offering a unique blend of urban sophistication and contemporary living, making it an attractive choice for discerning homebuyers and investors.</description>

Traders anticipate gold prices to remain bearish, with macro events such as the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the US Federal Reserve policy meeting expected to impact prices.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen after a report suggested that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to end negative interest rates in December. This contradicted the expectations of some investors. Additionally, China's yuan declined to a three-week low due to worsening deflation in the country. The dollar's rise against the yen contributed to a slight increase in the dollar index. The article also mentions upcoming events such as U.S. inflation figures, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, and rate-setting meetings by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. It is important to note that this summary is generated based on the information provided and may not capture all the details of the article.</description>

			<title>Slash Costs With These 5 Must-Know Car Insurance Renewal Hacks</title>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses five hacks to save money on car insurance renewal. Here are the key points:

1. Compare Insurance Online: By comparing quotes from different companies online, you can find the best rate and maximum coverage that fits your budget.

2. Install Genuine Anti-Theft Devices: Adding approved anti-theft devices can qualify you for theft-prevention discounts from insurers. These devices enhance security and aid in recovery.

3. Know Your Car's Worth: Research the current market price of your car to negotiate better on premiums. Use online pricing guides to determine its depreciated value and provide this information to insurers.

4. Get No Claim Bonus: Safe driving habits can earn you a no-claim bonus, which reduces your premium costs. Make sure to apply the full savings you're entitled to when renewing.

5. Understand the Policy Details: Thoroughly examine the fine print of your insurance contract to avoid surprises. Pay attention to clauses that may affect rates or coverage, and seek clarity on any terms you don't understand.

Remember, these are just a summary of the hacks mentioned in the article. If you need more detailed information, I recommend reading the full article.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a brief summary of the article you shared. The dollar started the week strong, influenced by U.S. inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. The Bank of Japan's potential shift in interest rates also impacted the dollar's performance against the yen. Meanwhile, the pound dipped, and the euro remained near a three-week low. The focus now turns to U.S. inflation data and the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy decision. In China, deflationary pressure increased as consumer prices fell, indicating challenges in the country's economic recovery. The yuan weakened as a result. The Australian and New Zealand dollars also experienced slight declines. Please note that this summary is generated based on the information provided and may not capture all the nuances of the original article.</description>

			<description>Novak Djokovic, the world number one tennis player, is turning 37 next year. Despite his age, Djokovic's hunger for success continues to grow, especially with the emergence of young challengers. In 2023, Djokovic had an exceptional year, winning three out of the four Grand Slam tournaments and bringing his total Grand Slam titles to 24, surpassing his rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. However, he faced tough competition from 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, who denied him a fifth-straight Wimbledon crown, and 22-year-old Jannik Sinner, who dashed his hopes of Davis Cup glory. Djokovic sees these young players as additional motivation and believes they awaken a competitive drive within him. Despite his defeats, Djokovic acknowledges the talent and threat posed by these young rivals. He used his loss in the Wimbledon final as motivation to reinvent himself and push harder, resulting in victories at the Cincinnati and Flushing Meadows tournaments. Djokovic's determination and drive remain strong as he continues to strive for success.</description>

			<description>AI has the potential to enhance medical tasks such as diagnosis and surgery, making them more efficient and reducing treatment time. However, according to Prof Andrew Elder, President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, it may take a couple of decades for AI to play a significant role in disease diagnosis. He emphasizes that the application of human judgment will continue to be important even with the advancement of AI. Doctors who embrace AI technology will have an advantage over those who do not. While AI can contribute to drug manufacturing and vaccine development, its role in diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. It is crucial for AI development in healthcare to involve individuals with medical training and understanding of patient care.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/gold-prices-slip-as-dollar-firms-cenbank-meetings-us-data-in-focus/1880864/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices experienced a slight decline due to the strength of the dollar. Investors are eagerly awaiting central bank meetings and the release of U.S. inflation data to gain more clarity on the future of interest rates. Spot gold was down 0.3% at $1,997.16 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures eased 0.1% at $2,013.20. The recent strong jobs report has shifted expectations for the Federal Reserve's actions next year, providing some relief to the dollar and bond yields, which in turn puts downward pressure on gold. The upcoming U.S. consumer price report and the comments of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be closely watched for further rate clues. The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, is expected to leave rates unchanged this week. Goldman Sachs predicts that the Fed may deliver its first rate cut in the third quarter of next year. Lower interest rates typically support non-interest-bearing assets like gold. That's the summary of the article you shared.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/gold-slips-ahead-of-central-bank-meetings-key-us-data-this-week/1880728/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices have declined due to the strength of the dollar, and investors are awaiting central bank meetings and U.S. inflation data for further clarity on interest rate trends. Spot gold dropped 0.2% to $1,998.89 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures remained flat at $2,014.80. The stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report has led to a reevaluation of expectations for the Federal Reserve's actions next year, which has put downward pressure on gold. The upcoming U.S. consumer price report and central bank meetings will provide more insights into the future of interest rates. Lower interest rates typically support gold prices. The outcome of these events will determine whether gold can stay above the $2,000 level. Spot silver rose slightly to $23.98 per ounce, while platinum remained steady at $915.31 and palladium fell to $941.11 per ounce.</description>

			<description>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is considering changing its name to the 'Indian Air and Space Force'. This proposal has been sent to the Union government and is expected to be implemented soon. The move is in line with the Defense Minister's call for the IAF to become an aerospace force and be prepared for future challenges. The IAF is also taking measures to strengthen its capabilities in space, including the use of space-based sensors and intelligence gathering. Additionally, the IAF is looking to enhance its navigation coverage through the NavIC system and is exploring the procurement of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) for accessing space. The name change and other initiatives aim to enhance the IAF's focus on space and its ability to detect and neutralize threats originating from space.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Australia has announced plans to tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers in an effort to overhaul its migration system, which the government considers to be "broken." This move is expected to reduce Australia's migrant intake by half over the next two years. The decision comes after net immigration was projected to reach a record high in 2022-23 but is now forecasted to decline to pre-COVID levels. The increase in net overseas migration in recent years has been largely driven by international students. The government's targeted reforms aim to put downward pressure on net overseas migration. The new policies include higher English test requirements for international students and the elimination of settings that allowed students to extend their stay in Australia. Additionally, a new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be introduced with a shorter processing time of one week. These measures are intended to ensure a more sustainable level of migration for Australia.</description>

			<description>The almost 200 nations at the U.N. climate summit, led by COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber, are grappling with the issue of whether to call for a reduction in the world's use of oil and gas. A new draft text of the hoped-for final deal is expected to be released by the COP28 presidency. The negotiations intensify as countries advocating for a phase-out of fossil fuels clash with those who see them as crucial for their economies. Some countries argue that the focus should be on reducing climate pollution rather than specifically targeting fossil fuels. Time is running out, as the summit is scheduled to end on Tuesday, and discussions are likely to continue late into Monday night. If fossil fuels are mentioned in the final deal, it would be the first time they are directly addressed in 30 years of U.N. climate talks, which the summit host, the United Arab Emirates, would consider a success. However, opponents such as OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iraq find it challenging to support such a move domestically.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/egyptians-vote-in-presidential-election-overshadowed-by-gaza-war/1880576/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Egyptians have started voting in a presidential election that is expected to give Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a third term in power. The country is facing economic challenges and a conflict on its border with Gaza. If Sisi wins, his immediate priorities would be addressing inflation, managing the foreign currency shortage, and preventing spillover from the Israel-Gaza conflict. Voting will take place over three days, and results will be announced on December 18. Critics view the election as a sham due to a crackdown on dissent. Sisi led the ousting of Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013 and has since overseen a crackdown on activists. Despite economic pressures, some voters support Sisi for providing security and stability. The election campaign has been low-key, and some analysts believe it was brought forward to implement economic changes. The International Monetary Fund is in talks with Egypt for additional financing.</description>

			<description>Johan Floderus, a Swedish national employed by the European Union, is facing charges in Iran for allegedly spying for Israel and being involved in 'corruption on earth'. These charges are considered capital offenses under Iran's Islamic laws. Floderus was detained in April 2022 while on vacation in Iran, and his trial has recently begun. His family has claimed that he was detained without any valid reason or proper legal process. Human rights groups and Western governments have criticized Iran for using arrests on security charges to extract political concessions, while Tehran maintains that such arrests are made in accordance with its criminal code and denies any political motives. Tensions between Sweden and Iran have been high since Sweden arrested a former Iranian official in 2019 for his role in the mass execution and torture of political prisoners during the 1980s.</description>

			<title>Carbon tax turns into climate fight at COP28</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/carbon-tax-turns-into-climate-fight-at-cop28/1880130/</link>
			<description>The European Union's plan to impose a tax on carbon pollution emitted during the production of goods imported from countries like India and China has sparked a debate at the United Nations climate conference in Dubai. The tax, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aims to set a price on carbon emissions associated with energy-intensive products. The EU argues that this creates a level playing field for domestically-manufactured goods and reduces emissions from imports. However, developing countries are concerned that the tax will harm their economies and make trading with the EU too expensive. The EU sees CBAM as crucial for funding and achieving its climate goal of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. A recent study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development found that a carbon tax of $44 per tonne could cut pollution from the supply chain in half. However, it also estimated that poorer countries could lose up to $5.9 billion, while rich countries could make $2.5 billion from the tax. India's government strongly opposes the idea of a carbon tax, although some experts believe that it could have a positive impact in the long run by reducing emissions.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/how-the-christmas-pudding-with-ingredients-taken-from-the-colonies-became-an-iconic-british-food/1880125/</link>
			<description>The Christmas pudding has a rich global history, influenced by the British Empire and enjoyed in various parts of the world. It originated from two older dishes, "plum pottage" and "figgy pudding," which were made with a mixture of meats, dried fruits, and spices. Over time, these dishes evolved into the more familiar plum pudding, incorporating ingredients from the British Empire such as French brandy, raisins from the Mediterranean, and citrus from the Caribbean. The Victorians further popularized it as the "Christmas pudding," and it became a centerpiece of the holiday season. The socioeconomic accessibility of the pudding, with affordable ingredients like candied citrus peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and raisins, contributed to its lasting appeal. Versions of Christmas pudding also spread across the British Empire, including in Australia and India. Even after decolonization, the tradition of Christmas pudding continues in various forms and adaptations.</description>

			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, I can tell you that the study mentioned in the article focuses on identifying diets that are effective in lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. It highlights that plant-based diets like the Mediterranean diet and traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Indian cuisines have shown to reduce the risk compared to the Western diet. The study also mentions that certain foods, such as saturated fats, red meat, processed meats, and ultra-processed foods high in sugar and refined grains, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, foods like green leafy vegetables, colorful fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, omega-3 fatty acids, and whole grains are considered protective against Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the study suggests that poverty and the consumption of meat and ultra-processed foods contribute to the rising trend of obesity, which is believed to be a driving force behind dementia.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. The State Samarkand Medical University in Uzbekistan has seen a significant increase in the number of Indian students due to the war in Ukraine closing its doors for MBBS aspirants from India. The university used to receive around 100 to 150 Indian students, but in 2023, the number has risen to 3,000. The university has also accommodated over 1,000 Indian students who had to leave their courses in Ukraine. To ensure the comfort of Indian students, the university has hired over 40 teachers from India. The reasons that attract students to Uzbekistan include teaching and learning in English, a peaceful atmosphere, affordable fees, and practical exposure. The rise in the number of Indian students is expected to continue in the coming years.</description>

			<description>The Road Transport and Highways Ministry in India has issued a notification mandating that all new trucks manufactured after October 1, 2025, must be equipped with air-conditioned (AC) cabins for drivers. The ministry stated that vehicles falling under the N2 and N3 category should be fitted with an air-conditioning system, with testing to be conducted as per IS14618:2022 standards. The move comes as Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari emphasizes the importance of addressing the working conditions and well-being of truck drivers in India's transport sector. Despite objections from some individuals citing increased costs, Gadkari has long advocated for air-conditioned cabins for truck drivers to alleviate the challenges of extreme heat conditions.

			<description>The Prambanan temple in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is a testament to the deep-rooted cultural and historical ties between India and Southeast Asia. It is a large compound consisting of 240 Hindu temples and is considered Indonesia's largest Hindu temple. The temple complex has been restored with the assistance of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in various ASEAN nations. The restoration work is challenging due to the complex structure and the limitations imposed by UNESCO heritage site rules. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deities Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The Prambanan temple, along with the nearby Borobudur Temple, attracts a significant number of tourists, although Yogyakarta remains relatively unexplored by Indian tourists. India's contribution is expected to boost the number of visitors to these historical sites in the future.</description>

			<title>Researchers find a tyrannosaur’s last meal perfectly preserved inside its stomach cavity</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/researchers-find-a-tyrannosaurs-last-meal-perfectly-preserved-inside-its-stomach-cavity/1879872/</link>
			<description>GPT-3.5: This fascinating article discusses the recent discovery of a tyrannosaur's last meal, which was found preserved inside its stomach cavity. The researchers found the hind legs of two baby dinosaurs in the tyrannosaur's stomach, marking the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered. The tyrannosaur in question was a young Gorgosaurus libratus, weighing about 772 pounds and measuring 13 feet in length at the time of its death. It appears that the tyrannosaur had a preference for the hind limbs of its prey, as only the hind legs of the baby dinosaurs were found in its stomach. The baby dinosaurs belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and were younger than 1-year-old. This discovery provides valuable insights into the feeding behavior of tyrannosaurs during the late Cretaceous period.</description>

			<description>Mata ni pachedi is a form of traditional cloth-painting associated with the Vaghri community in western India. It originated around three hundred years ago as a way for the non-dominant caste members to create their own shrines for worship since they were not allowed to enter temples. These paintings depict Hindu goddesses and are narrative in style, showcasing events from mythological texts, epics, religious processions, and historical themes. The paintings are made on rectangular fabric divided into columns, creating a grid for the narrative. Natural colors such as red and black were traditionally used, but now artificial colors are also used. Mata ni pachedi has expanded beyond its ritual aspect and is now used to create decorative consumer goods.</description>

Egyptians are currently participating in a presidential election, with Abdel Fattah al-Sisi expected to win a third term in power. The country is facing economic challenges and a conflict on its border with Gaza. If reelected, Sisi's immediate priorities would include managing inflation, addressing the foreign currency shortage, and preventing spillover from the Israel-Gaza conflict. The voting period spans three days, and the results will be announced on December 18. Critics view the election as lacking genuine political pluralism due to a crackdown on dissent. While some Egyptians are encouraged to vote, others feel indifferent, believing that the election will not bring about significant change. Sisi came to power in 2013 after leading the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Murs</description>

			<description>I'm sorry to hear about the tragic incident involving Sahar Baruch. According to the information provided, Sahar Baruch, a 25-year-old Israeli, was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and unfortunately, he has passed away while in captivity. The Kibbutz Be'eri, where Sahar was a former resident, expressed their deep sadness and condolences to his family. It is a heartbreaking situation, and efforts will be made to seek the return of his body as part of any hostage return deal. The Israel Defense Forces have denied Hamas's claim that Sahar was killed during a rescue attempt and stated that he was murdered by the terror group. The situation remains tense, with several individuals still held captive by Hamas in Gaza.</description>

			<description>Manchester United suffered a humiliating 3-0 defeat at home against Bournemouth in the Premier League. The pressure continues to mount on manager Erik Ten Hag as his team was thoroughly outplayed by an in-form Bournemouth side. Dominic Solanke scored the first goal for Bournemouth, and later, Philip Billing and Marcos Senesi added two more goals with powerful headers. Bournemouth could have scored a fourth goal, but it was disallowed due to handball after a VAR check. This victory further solidifies Bournemouth's recent good form, winning four out of their last five league matches and securing 13th place in the table. For Manchester United, it is a setback after their impressive victory over Chelsea earlier in the week.</description>

			<description>Nottingham Forest secured a 1-1 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a match where their fans showed support for manager Steve Cooper.

Forest had opportunities to snatch a win, with Cheikhou Kouyate being denied by Wolves' goalkeeper and Anthony Elanga striking the crossbar. Despite the draw, Forest's loyal fans continued to show their support for Cooper throughout the match.

			<title>Figure skating-Malinin becomes first skater to land all six quads</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/figure-skating-malinin-becomes-first-skater-to-land-all-six-quads/1879579/</link>
			<description>American teenager Ilia Malinin made history at the Grand Prix Final in Beijing by becoming the first skater to successfully land all six types of quad jumps in competition. Despite falling during his quad Axel in the free program, Malinin still scored 314.66 points and clinched his first Grand Prix Final title. Japan's Shoma Uno finished in second place with a score of 297.34. In addition to his achievement, Malinin also landed a quad loop for the first time in competition. No skater has previously accomplished all six quad jumps – the quad toe loop, Salchow, flip, Lutz, Axel, and loop – in their career. Malinin expressed his satisfaction with being able to execute the quad loop under pressure after struggling with it just a couple of weeks earlier. In other events, Kaori Sakamoto of Japan won the women's singles title, Madison Chock and Evan Bates from the US secured the ice dance gold, and Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodon emerged victorious in the pairs event.</description>

			<description>Justice Hima Kohli, a Supreme Court judge, expressed concern about the increasing trend of sexual harassment through social media. She also highlighted the emergence of deepfake technology, which raises concerns about privacy invasion, security risks, and the spread of misinformation. Deepfakes, which can create highly realistic content, pose a challenge to the authenticity of information and personal identity. Justice Kohli emphasized that deepfakes can spread false information that appears to come from trusted sources. She mentioned that the digital era has blurred the boundaries between professional and personal spaces, allowing harassment to seep into virtual arenas. Justice Kohli called for a holistic approach involving collaboration between policymakers, social media entities, employers, and users to create safe online environments and provide support for victims of online harassment. She also stressed the need to enhance legal frameworks to effectively address harassment in the digital and online spaces.</description>

			<description>Hmm, visiting a museum can indeed have positive effects on your health. The Association des Médecins francophones du Canada launched a program where patients could receive a doctor's prescription to visit a museum, aiming to promote recovery and well-being for those with chronic illnesses, neurological conditions, cognitive disorders, or mental health problems. While the specific effects of art exposure on health are still being studied, research suggests that regular visits to cultural venues like museums can lower the risk of dementia, depression, and age-related decline in health. Contact with artwork has been shown to potentially lower blood pressure, heart rate, and stress levels. However, it's important to note that the effects may vary depending on the individual and the specific museum experience. So, going to a museum can be a great way to have a pleasant day and potentially contribute to your overall well-being.</description>

			<description>Regenerative agriculture is gaining attention at COP 28, with the Sustainable Markets Initiative's Agribusiness Task Force launching a blended finance framework to support it. This framework aims to make regenerative farming financially viable and scalable. The task force includes companies like Mars, McCain Foods, McDonald's, Mondelez International, PepsiCo, and Waitrose. They are exploring implementation projects in India, the UK, and the US, and are calling for policy changes to support regenerative farming. The global food system currently contributes to GHG emissions and nature loss, so embracing regenerative farming could help address these issues. The task force proposes a four-lever framework, including new funding and sourcing models, common metrics, government policy changes, and creating new revenue streams for farmers. They are also exploring farming projects in different countries to prove the concept. The full plan can be viewed on the Agribusiness Task Force webpage.</description>

			<description>The keffiyeh is a distinctive checkered scarf that has deep roots in the Middle East. It was traditionally worn by nomadic Bedouin tribes as protection against the desert sun and sand. Over time, it became a symbol of class struggle and later emerged as a national symbol for Palestinians. The keffiyeh gained prominence when Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, adopted and popularized it. Today, the keffiyeh is worn by Palestinians and supporters worldwide as a gesture of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It has also been incorporated into fashion, although there are debates about respecting its political and historical context.</description>

			<description>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank implemented a comprehensive strategy in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) region. They allocated funds for emergency operations, trained medical staff, and strengthened national public health systems. The approach involved reallocating project resources, activating emergency components, and utilizing Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options (CAT DDOs) tailored to each country's situation. The World Bank committed USD 1.9 billion to 18 COVID-19 health response projects in the EAP region. Notable achievements include vaccine distribution in the Philippines and Mongolia, high vaccination rates in Laos, and timely COVID-19 testing. The pandemic had significant economic impacts, pushing more people into poverty and affecting sales, employment, and productivity, particularly for small and medium enterprises. The World Bank responded by deploying over USD 157 billion globally, with a focus on addressing economic, social, and poverty impacts in the EAP region. Collaborations with partners such as COVAX, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), and World Health Organization (WHO) facilitated project preparation and vaccine financing.

The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) elections, which have been delayed multiple times, are now scheduled to take place on December 21. The results will be announced on the same day. However, it's important to note that the outcome of the elections is subject to the decision of a writ petition pending before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The elections were initially stayed by the court on August 11, 2023, but the Supreme Court has now lifted the stay orders. The WFI elections have faced postponements and legal challenges, leading to the suspension of the federation by the international body, United World Wrestling. Currently, an ad-hoc panel is managing the WFI's activities.</description>

			<title>ADB launches pioneering climate action catalyst fund to drive decarbonisation in Asia-Pacific</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/adb-launches-pioneering-climate-action-catalyst-fund-to-drive-decarbonisation-in-asia-pacific/1879103/</link>
			<description>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is set to launch its Climate Action Catalyst Fund (CACF) on January 1, 2024. The CACF aims to mobilize innovative carbon finance by acquiring carbon credits to encourage investments in transformative mitigation actions in ADB's developing member countries. Unlike traditional carbon market practices, the CACF will provide upfront finance for high-impact climate mitigation actions, ensuring future delivery of carbon credits through long-term transactions. This approach accelerates the decarbonization of economies in Asia and the Pacific. The CACF enables cooperative approaches among nations under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, allowing the transfer of carbon emissions reductions achieved through climate mitigation measures from one country to count towards the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of another. The Swedish Energy Agency has committed to contributing 300 million Swedish krona to the fund, aiming to mobilize over USD 100 million in commitments from various entities. The CACF prioritizes high-quality climate mitigation actions, advanced low-carbon technologies, and sustainable development impacts for local communities in Asia and the Pacific. The launch of the CACF solidifies ADB's role in operationalizing international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</description>

			<description>Hmm, it seems like you're looking for a summary of the article about the World Bank's program to address air pollution in India. The program aims to tackle the impact of ambient particulate matter (PM)2.5 pollution, which poses severe health risks to the population. The World Bank's efforts include introducing airshed management tools, developing State-wide Air Quality Action Plans, and creating a Regional Airshed Action Plan for the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The article highlights the alarming levels of PM2.5 pollution in India and its detrimental effects on public health and the economy. The World Bank emphasizes the need for coordinated efforts at the sub-national level and regional cooperation to effectively address air pollution. India has already taken steps to combat air pollution, such as revising air quality standards and promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) sets goals to improve air quality, particularly in cities where pollution standards are not met. The World Bank's involvement in India's Air Quality Management (AQM) is part of a phased strategy, leveraging insights from similar projects in Mexico and China. The focus is on the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain, where pollution intensity is high. The article also mentions the importance of integrating air quality management into government capabilities, business practices, and individual behavior. The World Bank's goal is to reduce air pollution within a generation by implementing successful strategies from other countries. Overall, the World Bank's comprehensive approach aligns with India's commitment to cleaner air and sustainable development.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/does-exercise-really-do-nothing-for-longevity-as-a-finnish-twins-study-suggests/1878998/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, I can summarize the article for you. The Finnish Twins Cohort Study found that while people who exercise more tend to live longer on average, the direct effect of "leisure time physical activity" on lifespan is not significant. Factors such as genetics, diet, disabilities, education, and wealth may also influence lifespan. The study analyzed data from 11,000 pairs of adult same-sex twins and found that the most active group had a 24% lower death rate compared to the least active group. However, when considering other factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index, the link between exercise and longevity was reduced. The study suggests that exercise may have a smaller role in lifespan than previously thought, but it still has benefits in preventing illness, improving mood, and enhancing overall quality of life.</description>

			<description>Real Madrid players Vinicius Jr. and Eduardo Camavinga are expected to return to training after LaLiga's winter break in January, according to manager Carlo Ancelotti. Vinicius has been recovering from a hamstring and tendon injury, while Camavinga has been out due to a torn ligament in his right knee. Ancelotti stated that both players should be ready to train with the team by the end of the break. Additionally, Ancelotti provided an update on midfielder Jude Bellingham, who has been playing with a shoulder injury. Although the shoulder issue requires specific care, it is not severe enough to prevent Bellingham from playing. However, if continuous problems arise, surgery may be needed.</description>

			<title>Biden mocks Trump during California fundraising trip</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/entertainment/biden-mocks-trump-during-california-fundraising-trip/1878898/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. President Joe Biden began a fundraising trip in California, where he mocked Donald Trump for claiming he would be a dictator on his first day in office if he were to become president again. Biden referred to Trump as a threat to democracy and did not mention his son's recent criminal charges during the fundraiser. California has traditionally been a significant source of funding for Democrats, and the end of labor strikes in the entertainment industry has unlocked pent-up dollars for fundraising. Biden is expected to participate in fundraisers with notable figures such as Steven Spielberg, Rob Reiner, Barbra Streisand, and Lenny Kravitz. The fundraisers in California and Boston are projected to raise at least $15 million, with a total fourth-quarter haul of around $67 million. Biden also made an announcement in Las Vegas regarding funding for new passenger rail projects. These projects, funded by the infrastructure law, include the nation's first high-speed rail line in California and a high-speed rail corridor between Las Vegas and Southern California. Biden has been traveling across the country to announce new funding tied to his legislative initiatives, aiming to boost his poll ratings and demonstrate his ability to lead the U.S. economy. However, recent public opinion polls suggest limited success in these efforts.</description>

			<description>GPT-3.5: The world-famous Jaipur Foot Artificial Limb Fitment has announced a special camp in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, where they will provide free prosthetics to the differently-abled. This initiative, led by the chairman of Jaipur Foot US, Prem Bhandari, aims to benefit not only Ahmedabad but also smaller towns and villages nearby. The camp will be organized in collaboration with Bruhud Seniors, a New York-based non-profit organization. The Jaipur Foot camp offers not only rubber-based prosthetic legs but also other equipment like hearing aids, wheelchairs, and other medical aids. This is not the first camp organized by Jaipur Foot US, as they have previously provided free prostheses to hundreds of differently-abled people in the North East. The parent non-profit organization, Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS), has actively participated in the "India for Humanity" initiative of the Ministry of External Affairs, helping over 2 million differently-abled people globally through international camps. The artificial limbs, known as Jaipur Foot, are provided at a minimal cost to the organization, and the beneficiaries are not charged.</description>

			<description>The Louvre art museum in Paris will increase its entrance fee by 29% starting in January next year. The price hike aims to cover higher energy costs and fund free entry for specific groups such as individuals under 18, teachers, and journalists. Although the Louvre did not directly reference the Olympics, the timing of the increased fee coincides with rising costs in Paris as the city prepares to host the Games. Additionally, visitors to Paris during the Olympics will also encounter nearly doubled metro ticket prices and significantly higher hotel rates, which are expected to rise by over 300% between the 2023 and 2024 summer seasons.</description>

			<description>The United States expressed its eagerness to resume military-to-military talks with China, according to White House spokesperson John Kirby. The lack of communication may be attributed to the absence of a Chinese counterpart for U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to restart these talks during a recent summit in California. The aim of the talks is to prevent conflicts and address differences in areas such as the South China Sea and Taiwan. Over the past year, there have been numerous tense exchanges and close encounters between the U.S. and Chinese militaries.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/six-teenagers-convicted-in-connection-with-2020-beheading-of-teacher-paty/1878673/</link>
			<description>A French court has convicted six teenagers in connection with the beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty in 2020. Paty had shown caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, which caused controversy among some Muslim parents. One of the teenagers falsely accused Paty of asking Muslim students to leave the room before showing the caricatures, but it was proved that she was not present during the class. The other adolescents were found guilty of being part of a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping prepare the attack. Paty was killed by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was subsequently shot dead by the police. The court also found the convicted teenagers guilty of pointing out Paty to the murderer. The heaviest sentence given was six months in prison for one of the adolescents.</description>

			<description>India has ranked 7th in this year's Climate Change Performance Index, according to the report released during the global climate talks COP28. The country has received high rankings in greenhouse gas emissions and energy use categories, but a medium ranking in climate policy and renewable energy. India's per capita emissions are relatively low, and it is on track to meet the benchmark of well below 2 degrees Celsius. However, the report highlights that the transition to renewable energy is progressing slowly, and India still heavily relies on coal, oil, and gas for its energy needs. The experts suggest a faster phase-out of coal, reduced reliance on gas, and expanded renewable energy to fulfill India's potential in climate action.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag praised Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay as examples for other players to follow. Maguire, who faced criticism earlier in the season, fought for his place in the team and helped United keep three clean sheets. McTominay, the club's top scorer, has shown a good sense of positioning and finishing ability. Ten Hag believes that internal competition is important for a successful season and that players need to earn their place in the starting lineup. While Marcus Rashford has not been in top form, Ten Hag is confident that he will regain his form soon.</description>

			<description>DTE Energy, a utility firm based in Detroit, Michigan, predicts a higher operating profit for 2024 due to strong revenue expected from its electric, gas, renewable energy, and energy trading business segments. The company forecasts its operating earnings per share (EPS) for 2024 to be between $6.54 and $6.83. However, the 2023 operating EPS outlook was reduced to $5.65 to $5.85 from a previous estimate of $6.09 to $6.40 due to storm-related expenses and operating and maintenance charges in the previous quarter. DTE Energy also plans to increase its utility capital spend investment by $2 billion, bringing the total to around $25 billion over five years. The company aims to retire its coal plants by 2032 and invest $11 billion in transitioning to clean energy. DTE Energy exceeded profit estimates in the first two quarters but experienced challenges in the third quarter due to thunderstorms and weak electricity demand in Michigan.</description>

The Anjuman Auqaf, a religious organization, has called this action unjustified. The committee received instructions from the police to keep the doors of the mosque closed for the day's prayers. They also expressed dissatisfaction with the continuous house detention of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, which prevents him from leading the prayers. The committee believes that these restrictions are not only unwarranted but also interfere with religious affairs and hurt the sentiments of the people.</description>

			<description>In the second women's T20I match between India and England, England secured a comprehensive 38-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. This win marked England's 21st victory in 28 T20Is against India and their eighth win in 10 matches in India. India struggled in the first game, making errors in both bowling and fielding. The Indian spinners were unable to contain England's batsmen, and the fielding support was lacking. Despite a strong performance from seamer Renuka Singh Thakur, India couldn't stage a comeback. England's spin pair of Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn troubled India's batters with their line and lengths. India's batters, including Shafali Verma and Harmanpreet Kaur, couldn't chase down the target of 198. India will need to make significant improvements in the upcoming matches to challenge England.</description>

			<description>According to an article from Reuters, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh stated that the Palestinian Authority is collaborating with U.S. officials on a plan to govern Gaza after the war. Shtayyeh expressed the desired outcome of the conflict to be Hamas, the militant group that currently controls Gaza, becoming a junior partner under the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). This partnership would contribute to the establishment of a new independent state encompassing the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Shtayyeh emphasized the importance of Palestinian unity and stated that Israel's goal of completely defeating Hamas is unrealistic. Israel, in response to attacks by Iran-backed Hamas militants, has vowed to eradicate the group. The conflict has resulted in a significant number of casualties on both sides.</description>

			<description>The Reserve Bank of India has decided to maintain the policy rate at 6.5 percent, marking the fifth consecutive time it has remained unchanged. This decision comes as the central bank continues to closely monitor inflation. The rate increase cycle was halted in April after six consecutive rate hikes, totaling to 250 basis points since May 2022. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously agreed to keep the repo rate at 6.5 percent and will remain focused on actively reducing inflation. The growth projection for the current financial year has been raised from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. The central bank projects consumer price-based inflation to be at 5.4 percent for this fiscal year. The MPC meeting was held with inflation declining to 4.87 percent in October, and the November figures are expected to be released soon. The government has mandated the RBI to maintain CPI inflation at 4 percent with a margin of 2 percent on either side.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/more-than-10-million-people-have-signed-up-for-x-in-december-ceo-says/1877178/</link>
			<description>According to a post by X CEO Linda Yaccarino on a social media platform, over 10 million people have signed up for X in December. However, the company, previously known as Twitter, is facing a potential loss of up to $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as several major brands have paused their marketing campaigns on the platform. The New York Times reported on this risk. X, which does not regularly disclose user data, has not commented on how the December sign-ups compare to the average or why Yaccarino shared this figure. In July, X's billionaire owner Elon Musk stated that the site had 540 million monthly users.

In November, various companies such as Apple, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Comcast, Lions Gate Entertainment, Paramount Global, and IBM announced that they were halting their advertisements on X. This decision came after Musk faced controversy for agreeing with a user who made false claims about Jewish people inciting hatred against white people. Additionally, a watchdog group called Media Matters discovered ads from major companies appearing next to X posts supporting Nazism. X subsequently filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing them of defamation.

			<description>The Taiwanese defense ministry has reported that a Chinese balloon crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, just ahead of the upcoming presidential election in Taiwan. Taiwan has long accused China of trying to influence its elections through military and economic pressure. China has been increasing its military activities around Taiwan in recent years, including conducting war games. The balloon was detected southwest of Keelung and traveled eastward before disappearing. Earlier this year, a similar balloon landed on a Taiwanese-held islet near China's coast, which was claimed by China to be for weather monitoring purposes.</description>

			<description>According to two polls released in December, the approval rating of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government remained relatively stable. In a survey conducted by Datafolha, Lula had an approval rate of 38%, unchanged from the previous release in September. The disapproval rate dropped slightly to 30% from 31%, but it was still higher than the 27% registered in June. Another 30% of respondents remained neutral. A separate poll by Ipec also showed a 38% approval rating for Lula's government, down from 40% in the previous poll. The disapproval rate in this poll was 30%, compared to 25% in September. Additionally, 39% of the people interviewed by Ipec believed that Brazil's economy is better than expected, while 36% believed it is worse. The Datafolha survey interviewed 2,004 people in 135 Brazilian cities on December 5, while Ipec polled 2,000 people in 128 cities from December 1 to 5. Both surveys have a margin of error of two percentage points.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/snooker-murphy-hits-first-147-in-shoot-out-history/1877135/</link>
			<description>Shaun Murphy, an Englishman, achieved the first-ever 147 break in the history of the Snooker Shoot-Out tournament. He accomplished this feat during his first-round match against Bulcsu Revesz, a Hungarian teenager. Murphy cleared the table with two minutes and 26 seconds remaining on the shot clock, which allows only 15 seconds per shot initially and reduces to 10 seconds in the final five minutes. This break surpassed the previous record of 142, set by Mark Allen in 2011. Murphy expressed his excitement and joy, stating that he loves the event and wanted to make a century break. He will receive a prize of £5,000 ($6,293.50) for achieving the highest break unless it is equaled in subsequent rounds.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/yen-surges-on-possible-bank-of-japan-shift-stocks-climb/1877073/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Japanese yen experienced a significant surge against the US dollar after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda hinted at a possible shift away from the ultra-low interest rate plan. This speculation arose as Ueda mentioned that policy management would become more challenging in the coming year. The Bank of Japan is the only central bank that has not started tightening its policy, while other central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are either nearing or at the end of their rate hike cycles. In the US, stocks climbed, led by communication services stocks, and the labor market data showed a slight increase in weekly jobless claims. The focus now turns to the upcoming government payrolls report. European shares closed lower, and global stocks experienced their first advance after three consecutive declines. US Treasury yields remained relatively unchanged, and expectations for a US rate cut in March have increased. Oil prices settled at a six-month low due to concerns about sluggish energy demand in the US and China.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Japanese yen experienced a significant surge against the US dollar, reaching its highest one-day jump since January 12. This surge was prompted by speculation that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may move away from its ultra-low interest rate plan. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda hinted at the possibility of policy changes, stating that policy management would become more challenging in the coming year. The dollar index fell, while the euro saw a slight increase. U.S. stocks climbed, led by communication services stocks, and European shares fell after a recent rally. The global stock market saw its first advance after three consecutive declines. U.S. Treasury yields edged up, and there are expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut rates in March. Oil prices experienced a modest rebound after a previous sharp drop. Please note that this summary is based on the provided article and may not include all the details.</description>

			<description>The Karnataka State Contractors' Association president, D Kempanna, has submitted a set of evidence to a panel investigating the "40 per cent commission" charge against the previous BJP government in Karnataka. The panel, headed by retired High Court judge H N Nagamohan Das, was set up by the Congress government after coming to power in May. Kempanna has requested more time to provide additional documents to the panel, as more contractors are willing to come forward. The allegation of collecting a 40 per cent commission from contractors by ministers in the previous BJP-led government was a key issue raised by the Congress party during their opposition. The saffron party has refuted these claims.</description>

He also claimed that the BJP would form the government in the state after the assembly elections next year. Marandi cited the BJP's success in tribal-dominated areas in the recent assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan as proof that tribals support the BJP. He highlighted the Modi government's initiatives such as providing houses, gas connections, and free treatment to the poor. Marandi criticized Chief Minister Hemant Soren for allegedly neglecting areas where children from the Pahadia tribe had died due to an unknown disease. In response to Soren's claims about owed funds from coal mining, Marandi demanded complete details and accused him of seeking money through illicit means.</description>

The issue was raised by BJP's Pravin Darekar, who mentioned that the newly released Marathi film "Ekda Yeun Tar Bagha" was struggling to find cinema halls. Fadnavis assured that necessary legal measures will be taken if Marathi films are unable to secure screenings in Maharashtra. In addition, the Leader of Opposition, Ambadas Danve, raised concerns about shade-nets used by farmers, which often get damaged without compensation. Fadnavis mentioned that Chief Minister Eknath Shinde had already given instructions to address this issue. The legislative council adjourned after passing condolence motions.

			<description>Doctors in prominent hospitals across India have expressed concerns about the inadequate number of drug addiction treatment centers to address the increasing cases of drug abuse. Coimbatore-based Abhasa, a private and luxurious rehabilitation center, has launched a new exclusive facility for women, which has seen great success since its establishment. Over 1500 patients have been treated at the three Abhasa centers for various addictions including substance abuse, alcoholism, gaming, mobile phone addiction, depression, and neurological disorders. The founder of Abhasa, Gayathri Arvind, highlighted the growing demand for de-addiction centers, not only among the young and old but also among women. Despite the presence of 364 government-owned de-addiction centers in India, there is still a need for more psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and counselors involved in addiction treatment. Abhasa remains committed to curbing drug abuse in India and believes their efforts will yield positive results.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/robust-nov-foreign-inflows-in-asian-equities-signal-positive-outlook-for-2024/1875855/</link>
			<description>Asian equities attracted significant foreign investment in November, indicating the potential for continued inflows in the coming year. The decrease in U.S. Treasury yields and growing optimism for Federal Reserve rate cuts contributed to this trend. Data from stock exchanges across several Asian countries showed that foreign investors purchased a net $11.16 billion worth of stocks last month, the highest since May. Cooler U.S. inflation and dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials led to notable declines in U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar. This has sparked interest among foreign investors who may have a greater appetite for emerging market assets with lower USD interest rates and a weaker USD. Asian equities have experienced a significant turnaround, receiving a net inflow of $14.03 billion this year, compared to net selling of approximately $57.52 billion in 2022. Taiwanese stocks saw the highest foreign inflows since at least 2008, while South Korean and Indian equities also attracted substantial investments. However, Philippine stocks witnessed only slight inflows after three months of outflows, while Thai and Vietnamese shares experienced outflows. Analysts predict that Asia may demonstrate resilience in the coming year, outperforming other regions due to strong fundamentals and growth prospects, particularly in industries such as AI and semiconductors.</description>

			<description>The denizens of Kolkata and neighboring districts in south Bengal experienced intermittent rain and chilly wind on Thursday morning, causing inconvenience in their daily lives. The Meteorological Department predicts a generally cloudy sky with light to moderate rain in eastern India until Friday morning, as cyclonic storm Michaung weakens into a less marked low-pressure area over Chhattisgarh. This was the first sign of winter for the region. Some areas in the city and Salt Lake faced traffic snarls, making it difficult for people to reach their workplaces. The minimum temperature in Kolkata was above normal at 19.9 degrees Celsius due to the cloudy conditions, but the maximum temperature is expected to be well below normal due to the weather conditions.</description>

Secondly, Netanyahu expressed the need to get the Red Cross to visit Israeli hostages held in Gaza. He suggested that the Red Cross should reach out to Qatar, as they have influence over Hamas, and request visits and provisions of medicine for the hostages.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/entertainment/oppenheimer-to-screen-in-japan-next-year-after-nuclear-controversy/1875556/</link>
			<description>Universal Pictures' film "Oppenheimer," directed by Christopher Nolan, is set to debut in Japan in 2024, according to local distributor Bitters End. The release had faced uncertainty due to criticism that the movie downplays the devastation caused by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Despite the controversy, the biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the pioneer of atomic bombs, has achieved tremendous global success with over $950 million in box office earnings since its July premiere. The film is also expected to be a strong contender for various film awards. In addition to the controversy surrounding its content, the movie faced backlash for its marketing campaign, which unintentionally linked it to the blockbuster film "Barbie." Fan-produced images featuring the stars of both films alongside nuclear blasts caused offense among many Japanese viewers. Warner Bros., the distributor of "Barbie," issued an apology in response to the backlash. The atomic bombings, which occurred toward the end of World War Two, led to over 200,000 deaths.</description>

			<description>Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag expressed his satisfaction with the team's performance and result following their 2-1 victory over Chelsea. This win came in the wake of a disappointing loss to Newcastle, which had sparked reports of unrest within the dressing room. Ten Hag stated that the team wanted to send a message to the fans and believed that they deserved the win. He emphasized the importance of being at their best in every game and having the right attitude. The club had banned four journalists from the pre-game press conference due to negative reporting without giving United a chance to respond. However, Ten Hag dismissed concerns about the noise surrounding the team. After the victory, fans chanted in support of the manager, and midfielder Sofyan Amrabat praised Ten Hag as one of the best coaches in the world. Ten Hag also highlighted Scott McTominay's excellent performance, scoring twice and being praised for his dynamic play.</description>

Villa dominated the game and deserved their victory, moving up to third place in the table. Bailey's shot deflected off Ruben Dias' foot to beat City's goalkeeper Ederson. Villa had several other chances to score, hitting the post and forcing saves from Ederson. The result leaves City in fourth place, six points behind the league leaders Arsenal. This was Villa's 14th consecutive home Premier League win. City struggled throughout the game and only managed two shots on target, their fewest ever under manager Pep Guardiola. Villa's impressive performance showcased their progress under manager Unai Emery.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/gamestop-misses-revenue-estimates-on-slow-videogame-demand-competition/1875445/</link>
			<description>GameStop, the video game retailer, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter as competition increased and consumer spending decreased. The company's shift towards an online-focused model was hindered by economic uncertainty and inflation. GameStop's shares fell by nearly 3% in extended trading following the announcement. The results mark the first quarter since Ryan Cohen became GameStop's CEO and chairman. Despite the sales decline, the company managed to achieve breakeven earnings per share and reduced expenses by almost 24%. Analysts believe that GameStop will continue to face challenges and market share losses from mass merchants and e-commerce giants like Amazon.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/greece-turkey-seek-to-restart-relations-with-meetings-in-athens/1875442/</link>
			<description>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is visiting Athens with a delegation of ministers for meetings with Greek counterparts in the hopes of improving relations between the two countries. Greece and Turkey have been at odds for years over various issues, including territorial boundaries, energy resources, Cyprus, and defence matters. Although tensions have eased recently, little progress is expected on these longstanding bilateral issues. The leaders will focus on areas of mutual benefit such as the economy, health, education, agriculture, migration, and tourism. Greece is also planning to allow Turkish citizens to apply for a seven-day tourist visa for certain islands close to the Turkish coast as a gesture of goodwill. Both countries want to demonstrate their willingness to mend ties, with Turkey seeking EU membership and Greece aiming to regain stability in the changing geopolitical landscape. Despite the positive rhetoric, some officials believe that little progress will be made on the thorny issues between the two nations.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/hiding-in-plain-sight-hamas-leader-sinwar-plotted-destruction-2/1875438/</link>
			<description>Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, made a speech to supporters last year, vowing to strike Israel with fighters and rockets. His words turned out to be more than mere rhetoric when Hamas fighters breached Gaza's fence, resulting in the death of around 1,200 people and the taking of over 200 hostages. The attack, known as the "flood of Al-Aqsa," targeted the mosque in Jerusalem and was planned by Sinwar and Hamas' military leader, Mohammed Deif. Sinwar, who spent 23 years imprisoned by Israel before rising to a leadership role in Hamas, is now leading negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps and directing military operations. He has a personal motivation to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Israel considers him and other Hamas leaders to be "living on borrowed time" and is unlikely to end the conflict until Sinwar is captured or killed. Sinwar is described as devoted to Hamas and willing to endure great suffering for his cause.</description>

			<description>Britain's Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, has resigned from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Cabinet due to disagreements over the government's policy of deporting illegal migrants to Rwanda. Jenrick expressed his belief that the emergency legislation presented by Home Secretary James Cleverly did not go far enough to address the issue. He argued for a clear piece of legislation that would limit legal challenges to the government's immigration policy. Sunak responded by stating that the proposed bill would be the toughest ever introduced by the UK government. The move is seen as a setback for Sunak as he prepares for the 2024 general election. The opposition Labour Party criticized the Conservatives for presiding over a "chaotic" government. The Safety of Rwanda Bill will be tabled in the House of Commons, aiming to control the borders and deter dangerous journeys across the English Channel.</description>

			<description>Israeli troops have intensified their offensive into southern Gaza, leading to tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians seeking refuge in the city of Rafah near the Egyptian border. However, fears remain as options for refuge dwindle and the Israeli bombardment continues. At least nine people were killed in an Israeli shelling incident in Rafah. This latest exodus adds to the already large number of displaced Palestinians who have fled from northern Gaza to the south during the two-month-long conflict between Israel and Hamas. The displaced Palestinians are now trapped near the fortified Egyptian border, despite Israel's claims of safety in the area. Israeli forces have entered Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, for the first time, targeting Hamas' military and administrative rule. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that they are encircling the house of Hamas leader Yahya Al-Sinwar. Fierce combat has been reported, with Israeli bombings intensifying overnight and tanks battling Palestinian militants in various areas. The humanitarian crisis worsens as hundreds of thousands of homeless people desperately seek shelter in the diminishing safe areas designated by Israel. The situation has caused a lack of tents, hindering aid distribution. Amid the conflict, Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with dead and wounded, and supplies are running out. Both sides are accused of committing serious rights violations, prompting calls for immediate humanitarian ceasefires from world leaders and a resolution at the United Nations Security Council.</description>

			<title>Dr BR Ambedkar was a progressive thinker; says head of UK group Pankaj Shamkunwar</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/dr-br-ambedkar-was-a-progressive-thinker-says-head-of-uk-group-pankaj-shamkunwar/1875417/</link>
			<description>The general secretary of the Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisation (FABO) UK, Pankaj Shamkunwar, praised Dr BR Ambedkar as a progressive thinker and emphasized his contributions to Indian democracy. He highlighted that the Constitution, which forms the foundation of Indian democracy, guarantees fundamental rights and principles based on equality, fraternity, and freedom. According to Shamkunwar, Dr Ambedkar's major contribution lies in women's empowerment and education, noting that Dalit women are now competing on par with other women in the country. These remarks were made during a memorial event organized by the Indian High Commission in the UK to commemorate Babasaheb Dr BR Ambedkar's 68th Parinirvan Divas.

Acting High Commissioner to India in the UK, Sujit Ghosh, acknowledged Ambedkar's commitment to liberty, equality, and fraternity, which laid the foundation for democratic India. He stated that Dr Ambedkar played a crucial role as a visionary leader, social reformer, and principal architect of the Indian Constitution. Ghosh mentioned that Ambedkar's focus on justice and dedication to these principles guided the framing of the Constitution, aiming to dismantle social hierarchies. He also commended Ambedkar's recognition of education as a powerful equalizer, breaking caste barriers and fostering self-worth among marginalized communities.

Dr BR Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, and was an Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer. He fought against social discrimination towards Dalits and advocated for women's and workers' rights. Considered the architect of the Indian constitution, Ambedkar passed away on December 6, 1956. In addition to his legal and political pursuits, he earned doctorates in economics from Columbia University and the University of London. Ambedkar led a satyagraha in Mahad in 1956, advocating for the rights of the untouchable community to access the main water tank of the town. The 'Poona Pact' agreement, signed on September 25, 1932, between Ambedkar and Madan Mohan Malaviya, secured increased legislative representation for the depressed class.

Ambedkar was one of the seven members on the committee responsible for drafting the Indian Constitution after independence. In 1990, he posthumously received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor.</description>

			<description>GameStop, a videogame retailer, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter due to reduced consumer spending in an uncertain economy. The company's shift towards an online-focused business model was hampered by sticky inflation and high borrowing costs, which resulted in uneven spending in the gaming industry. Despite the revenue miss, GameStop managed to post adjusted breakeven earnings per share, surpassing analysts' estimates of a loss. Ryan Cohen, the top investor who joined as CEO and chairman in September, has adjusted the company's strategy, relying more on physical stores for customers to pick up online orders. GameStop's revenue for the quarter was $1.08 billion, falling short of the estimated $1.18 billion. The company's stock price dropped nearly 1% in after-hours trading.</description>

			<description>Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has granted loading windows this month to two vessels destined for India, under spot deals for crude oil with Italy's ENI and U.S.-based Chevron. This follows a temporary relief of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. Indian refiners such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corp, and HPCL-Mittal Energy (HMEL) have been actively seeking Venezuelan crude cargoes since the sanctions were eased in October. Some refiners have made purchase agreements with trading houses that have access to Venezuelan oil, while others are planning to buy directly from PDVSA's partners.</description>

			<description>Ukraine's Defense Minister, Rustem Umerov, met with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon to discuss Ukraine's strategic goals and long-term vision for its military. The Biden administration has been warning Congress that it is running out of time and money to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. In October, the administration requested nearly $106 billion from Congress, but the package was rejected by Republican lawmakers who control the House. Despite this setback, Austin announced an additional aid package for Ukraine, including air defense munitions. The US has been meeting with industry leaders to find ways to support Ukraine's military, which has depleted its artillery fighting Russian forces faster than its Western allies can provide assistance. President Biden warned that a victory for Russia over Ukraine would leave Moscow in a position to attack NATO allies. While Congress has approved over $110 billion for Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022, no additional funds have been approved since Republicans took over the House in January. The postponement of US assistance being debated in Congress was described by Ukraine's chief of staff as a "big risk" that could lead to Ukraine losing the war.</description>

			<title>Yemen’s Houthis fire ballistic missiles at Israeli city of Eilat</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/yemens-houthis-fire-ballistic-missiles-at-israeli-city-of-eilat/1875384/</link>
			<description>The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched ballistic missiles over the Red Sea, which were intercepted and shot down by Israel's Arrow air defense system. The missiles did not enter Israeli airspace or pose a threat to civilians. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they targeted military sites in the Eilat area. This is not the first time the Houthis have fired missiles at Eilat during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israel has successfully intercepted four ballistic missiles and used fighter jets to neutralize cruise missiles and drones launched by the Houthis. The Houthis, supported by Iran, are part of the "axis of resistance" against Israel, together with Hamas. They have expressed support for the Palestinians and issued threats against Israel. Iran has warned that Israel could face broader threats if it continues its war against Gaza. In a separate incident, Houthi-fired ballistic missiles struck three commercial ships in the Red Sea, and US warships shot down three drones in self-defense during the attack.</description>

			<description>The U.S. Coast Guard discovered a light sheen in the Gulf of Mexico, but could not confirm if it was related to the ongoing million-gallon oil spill in the area. The spill, first observed on November 16, resulted in the closure of underwater pipelines and a temporary halt to around 3% of the Gulf's daily crude oil output. The Coast Guard continues to investigate the sheen and has not identified any damage or leaks after surveying the pipelines. Additionally, surrounding pipelines belonging to other operators are also closed. The volume of the initial leak is estimated at 1.1 million gallons (4.2 million liters).</description>

			<title>US declares warring parties in Sudan committed war crimes</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-declares-warring-parties-in-sudan-committed-war-crimes/1875379/</link>
			<description>The United States has determined that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing have been committed by warring parties in Sudan, specifically the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict, which began in April, has resulted in the displacement of over 6.5 million people, over 10,000 deaths, and severe economic devastation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for an end to the conflict and for those responsible for atrocities to be held accountable. The RSF has been accused of leading ethnic massacres, looting, rape, and imprisonment of civilians, while the army has conducted intense air and artillery strikes on residential areas. The determination made by the United States does not automatically lead to punitive actions, but it emphasizes the need to address the ongoing crisis. The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions related to the conflict but has not directly targeted the army and RSF. However, Blinken stated that future determinations are possible as more information becomes available.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/soccer-swedes-turn-to-kallstrom-to-revive-footballing-fortunes/1875373/</link>
			<description>Former midfielder Kim Kallstrom has been appointed as the head of football for the Swedish Football Association (SvFF) in response to the decline in performance by the national teams. The men's team failed to qualify for the Euro 2024 finals, while the women's team will miss the upcoming Olympic tournament for the first time in their history. Kallstrom, who had a successful playing career representing clubs such as Rennes, Arsenal, and Spartak Moscow, retired in 2017 before taking on his new role. He expressed his enthusiasm for positive change and his eagerness to apply his skills and ideas in his new position. His primary task is to hire a new coach for the men's national team. Kallstrom mentioned the importance of analyzing the current situation, setting goals, and finding the right people to implement the necessary changes. He also highlighted his valuable contacts in the football industry, including former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whom he may seek advice from. Kallstrom emphasized the importance of sharing responsibilities and seeking guidance from those with experience.</description>

			<description>Formula One teams have denied making complaints to the governing body about Mercedes principal Toto Wolff and his wife Susie, who manages the sport's all-female F1 Academy series. The FIA had announced that its compliance department was investigating potential conflicts of interest following media speculation. However, nine out of ten teams issued statements refuting the allegations, stating that they had not made any complaints. The F1 Academy aims to support women in motorsport and will be sponsoring an entrant in each team's livery next season. Susie Wolff expressed her dismay at having her integrity questioned and highlighted misogynistic behavior. Both Mercedes and Liberty Media-owned Formula One expressed confidence that the allegations were unfounded. Red Bull boss Christian Horner also confirmed that his team had not filed any complaint.</description>

			<description>Paris 2024 organizers are confident that a solution will be found soon for the construction of a judging tower at the Teahupo'o site in Tahiti for next year's Olympic surfing competition. The International Surfing Association (ISA) welcomed a pause in preparations after a video showed a barge stuck on the reef, damaging coral near the site. The French Polynesian government has paused further testing and preparations to address the issue. Paris 2024 and the government are working on reducing the size and weight of the tower to minimize its impact on the environment. Despite the challenges, the organizers remain committed to working transparently with associations to ensure the success of the Paris 2024 Games in French Polynesia.</description>

			<title>Meta to introduce watermarking feature for some AI products</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/meta-to-introduce-watermarking-feature-for-some-ai-products/1875326/</link>
			<description>Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, announced that it will be adding invisible watermarking to its text-to-image generation product, imagine with Meta AI chatbot, in order to enhance transparency. The company aims to bring this feature to many of its products that use AI-generated images and claims that the watermarking is resilient to common image manipulations. Meta has been leveraging large language models, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT, to create AI-powered products that attract investors, drive innovation, and engage customers. They have developed Meta AI using their own custom model based on the Llama 2 large language model. The company is currently testing over 20 new ways in which generative AI can improve user experiences across various social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. Additionally, they are expanding access to imagine outside of chats and working on improving search capabilities across multiple products.</description>

			<description>An Israeli bombardment in Gaza resulted in the deaths of 22 relatives of Al Jazeera correspondent Moamen Al-Sharafi, according to Al Jazeera Media Network. The victims included his parents, siblings, and children, as well as 17 other extended family members. The network condemned the operation and stated that it would take legal action against those responsible for the incident.

			<title>G7 to phase in direct, indirect bans of Russian diamonds from Jan. 1</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/g7-to-phase-in-direct-indirect-bans-of-russian-diamonds-from-jan-1/1875295/</link>
			<description>The Group of Seven (G7) countries have announced a direct ban on Russian diamonds starting from January 1, with phased-in restrictions on indirect imports from around March 1. The G7 plans to implement a traceability-based verification and certification mechanism for rough diamonds within the group by September 1, 2024. However, the ban excludes diamonds for industrial use, and there is no mention of tracing polished stones or specifying carat size. Belgium, which houses the world's main diamond hub in Antwerp, has expressed satisfaction with the G7's adoption of the central principles of its proposal. The announcement is seen as an opportunity for Antwerp's diamond sector to further develop into a center for "clean" diamonds.</description>

			<description>U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries held a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where they expressed solidarity and agreed on a new ban on Russian diamonds. The ban will prohibit non-industrial diamonds from Russia by January and Russian diamonds sold by third countries from March. Additionally, the leaders discussed tightening controls on Russia's use of the international financial system and imposing more sanctions to enforce a price cap on Russian oil. In the meeting, Zelenskiy called for continued support for Ukraine, stressing the importance of maintaining consolidation, interaction, and support for those whose freedom is under attack. The G7 members had previously pledged in May to restrict exports to Russia that could fund its war effort in Ukraine. The impact of the $60 price cap on Russian crude oil implemented by Western nations has diminished, prompting them to explore ways to strengthen implementation.</description>

			<title>CIABC applauds Manipur’s move to end liquor ban, urges Bihar to follow suit</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/ciabc-applauds-manipurs-move-to-end-liquor-ban-urges-bihar-to-follow-suit/1875276/</link>
			<description>The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has commended the Manipur government's decision to lift the long-standing ban on liquor, citing positive effects on tax revenues and the fight against illegal alcohol and drug-related issues. CIABC's Director General, Vinod Giri, urged Bihar to follow a similar path, emphasizing potential economic growth, prevention of hooch tragedies, and generation of substantial revenues amounting to Rs 10,000 crore per year. Giri highlighted that lifting the prohibition in Manipur would boost state revenues, curb the illegal liquor trade, and address social challenges. He called on the Bihar government to reconsider its prohibition policy, which has negatively impacted development, led to hooch-related deaths, and fostered the growth of illicit liquor. Giri suggested responsible lifting of prohibition, such as employing women in liquor factories for economic empowerment and implementing a special cess on liquor sales to fund de-addiction and rehabilitation centers. He dismissed proposed door-to-door surveys on prohibition and pointed out that other states like Haryana, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh have experienced unsuccessful bans. Giri advocated for a pragmatic approach like Gujarat's, which permits alcohol sales to non-domiciles and exempts Special Economic Zones from the ban. The CIABC represents the interests of the Indian Alcoholic Beverage Industry, promoting responsible practices and advocating for a balanced approach to liquor regulations.</description>

			<title>Explainer-What are the EU’s landmark AI rules?</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/explainer-what-are-the-eus-landmark-ai-rules/1875270/</link>
			<description>Negotiations on the European Union's first-ever regulations for artificial intelligence (AI) are reaching a critical stage. The outcome of these discussions could serve as a model for other governments crafting their own AI rules. The main challenge lies in accommodating technologies like ChatGPT, which was not considered when the initial draft of the law was created. ChatGPT's versatility and generative capabilities have sparked debates on how it should be regulated. Proposals include documenting the training data and capabilities of AI systems, mitigating potential risks, and allowing external audits. France, Germany, and Italy argue for self-regulation to compete with dominant U.S. companies. Additionally, there is disagreement about the use of AI by law enforcement agencies, with EU lawmakers seeking to protect citizens' rights while member states want flexibility for national security purposes. A final agreement on the legislation could be reached soon or lead to provisional agreements pending further technical meetings.</description>

			<description>Israeli troops engaged in intense battles with Hamas in the city of Khan Younis, causing Palestinian civilians who were already displaced from the north to search for refuge elsewhere. Israeli warplanes also conducted heavy bombardments across Gaza in an effort to eliminate Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that they were encircling the house of Yahya Al-Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, and it was only a matter of time before they capture him. As the ground offensive expanded into southern Gaza, hospitals became overwhelmed with dead and wounded, and supplies were running low. The article mentions the killing of Palestinians in Rafah and the increasing difficulty for the displaced population to find safe areas. Both sides are accused of committing serious rights violations. Israel claims it tries to avoid civilian casualties, while Hamas denies using civilian buildings for cover. The article also notes the use of improvised explosive devices by Hamas fighters. The death toll in Gaza since the start of the conflict is disputed, and Israel reported 85 soldiers killed. Israel has been informing civilians in advance to evacuate areas where it plans to operate. The United States urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and minimize harm to civilians.</description>

He made this remark during a debate on the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill. Shah also mentioned that after the delimitation exercise in Jammu and Kashmir, there will be an increase in the number of assembly seats in both the Jammu region and the Kashmir Valley. Additionally, he highlighted what he referred to as two major "Nehruvian blunders" that had negatively affected Kashmir, namely declaring a ceasefire without winning the entire region and taking the matter to the United Nations. Shah emphasized that if the ceasefire had been declared three days later, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir would have been a part of India.</description>

The breach occurred in Bangkok and other locations where BLS International operates. As a result, Estonia's Ministry of the Interior terminated its contract with BLS International. The company claims that the unlawful conduct was carried out by certain errant employees, and disciplinary action has been taken against them.

			<title>Italy officially exits China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Report</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/italy-officially-exits-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-report/1875120/</link>
			<description>Italy has officially withdrawn from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) after four years of participation. The decision was communicated to Beijing three days before it was reported by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. Italy became the first major Western country to join the BRI in 2019, despite concerns from the US about China's influence over critical infrastructure and technology. The withdrawal was carried out through the cancellation of the agreement by the Italian government, which was accompanied by promises of strategic friendship. Both countries chose not to make public statements about the cancellation. Financial difficulties faced by the BRI project may have contributed to Italy's decision. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had previously expressed her intention to leave the BRI, citing a lack of significant benefits for Italy. This decision does not compromise relations with China, according to Meloni.</description>

			<description>Anatoly Legkodymov, the co-founder of Bitzlato, a virtual currency exchange based in Hong Kong, is expected to plead guilty in a U.S. court for processing approximately $700 million in illicit funds. Legkodymov, a Russian national, was arrested in Miami and has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since then. He allegedly operated Bitzlato as an unlicensed money exchange business, engaging in cryptocurrency swaps with Hydra Market, described as a marketplace for drugs, stolen financial information, and money laundering services. Bitzlato's website has been seized by French authorities as part of an international law enforcement action. This development reflects the ongoing efforts by U.S. law enforcement to crack down on fraud and illicit finance in the cryptocurrency markets. The article also mentions other recent cases involving FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pleading guilty or facing charges related to fraudulent activities.</description>

The FIR states that Khan, as chairman of the Delhi Waqf Board, unlawfully recruited 32 individuals in violation of norms and government guidelines.</description>

			<title>India announces USD 1 million immediate relief assistance to Papua New Guinea after volcanic eruption hits region</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/india-announces-usd-1-million-immediate-relief-assistance-to-papua-new-guinea-after-volcanic-eruption-hits-region/1875015/</link>
			<description>India has pledged USD 1 million in immediate relief assistance to Papua New Guinea following a volcanic eruption that occurred on November 20. The eruption led to the evacuation of over 26,000 people and created urgent humanitarian needs. In an official statement, India expressed sympathy for the damage caused and extended solidarity to the people of Papua New Guinea. As a close friend and development partner, India provided relief assistance to support the country's efforts in relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. This is not the first time India has supported Papua New Guinea during natural disasters, having previously assisted during a 2018 earthquake and a volcanic eruption in 2019. The volcanic activity in Papua New Guinea is attributed to its location on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," known for seismic and volcanic activities. Ulawun, the country's most active volcano, has experienced multiple eruptions since the 1700s, with the last significant eruption occurring in 2019. The article also mentions that disaster risk reduction and management are important aspects of India's Indo-Pacific Ocean's Initiative (IPOI), announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2019.</description>

			<description>A report presented in the Karnataka Assembly reveals that several communities in the state, including dominant ones, have been using fake caste certificates to avail reservation and other benefits under the SC and ST categories. The practice of untouchability still persists in some parts of the state. The increase in fake caste certificates is attributed to reports submitted by revenue officials and staff without proper surveys. The report highlights 12 communities, including Brahmins, Veerashaiva-Lingayats, and Kurubas, who possess fake caste certificates. It also mentions that FIRs are now filed against both those availing fake certificates and the issuing authorities. So far, 175 tahsildars have faced FIRs for issuing such certificates. The report concludes by stating that untouchability continues to exist in various parts of the state.</description>

			<description>The British government has promised to prevent a recurrence of the injustices suffered by the families of the 97 victims of the Hillsborough crush in 1989, but has rejected calls for new legislation. The tragedy occurred when Liverpool fans were overcrowded in a fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough soccer ground during an FA Cup semi-final. Initially, the police blamed the supporters themselves, but an inquest in 2016 concluded that the fans were unlawfully killed and that the police were to blame. A government-commissioned report called for a charter for bereaved families, and the government has now signed the "Hillsborough Charter" to provide better support to such families in the event of disasters. However, campaigners for a "Hillsborough Law" argue that the measures do not go far enough and lack the families' support.</description>

			<description>Union Home Minister Amit Shah criticized India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the ongoing dispute in Kashmir, claiming that two of Nehru's decisions were "historic blunders." Shah mentioned a letter from Nehru to Sheikh Abdullah where he admitted that he felt the decisions to escalate the issue to the United Nations and agree to a ceasefire with Pakistan in 1948 were mistakes. The Bills discussed in the Lok Sabha were later passed, but the Opposition briefly walked out after Shah's remarks. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill aims to increase the number of seats in the legislative assembly and provide representation for various groups. The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill provides quotas for jobs and education. Shah also argued that Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was at the "root of terrorism" and presented statistics indicating a decline in terror incidents after its abrogation. He further criticized Nehru, suggesting that delaying the 1948 ceasefire by three days could have resulted in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir being part of India.</description>

			<title>Sugar output may remain subdued this year; mills keen to produce sugar more than ethanol: Official</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/sugar-output-may-remain-subdued-this-year-mills-keen-to-produce-sugar-more-than-ethanol-official/1874790/</link>
			<description>The sugar output in Maharashtra is expected to be low due to below-average rainfall in sugarcane-growing areas this year. Despite this, the mills are focused on producing sugar rather than diverting the crop for ethanol production. The decision was made during a meeting with stakeholders, as sugar prices are currently high. The sugar commissionerate had previously estimated that 1,022 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane would be available for crushing in the next season, with 103.58 lakh metric tonnes of sugar to be produced. It also suggested that 15 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane could be diverted for ethanol production. The reduced sugarcane production may result in a shorter sugar production season.</description>

			<description>The Health Minister of Kerala, Veena George, has ordered an investigation into the suicide of a young woman doctor in Thiruvananthapuram. The 26-year-old postgraduate doctor was found unconscious and later declared dead at the hospital. The probe was initiated following allegations of dowry-related issues as a possible cause of the suicide. The Women and Child Development Department has been directed to conduct the investigation and submit a report. The police have started their own investigation and have recorded statements from the deceased doctor's relatives. Apparently, a suicide note was found in which the victim mentioned that "everybody wants money only." It is alleged that the doctor was depressed after her friend, who was also a doctor, backed out of their marriage due to dowry demands. The groom's family had asked for a higher dowry amount than what Shahana's family could provide.</description>

			<description>The UK's Information Commissioner, John Edwards, has urged companies to prioritize people's privacy rights when using artificial intelligence (AI). Failure to do so may result in not only fines but also a loss of public trust in the technology. Edwards emphasized that organizations must protect customer data while utilizing AI, stating that non-compliance with data protection regulations will not be profitable. Risks associated with the rapid development of AI have become a key concern for policymakers worldwide. Although there is a general consensus on the need for AI regulation, a global plan for oversight is still in progress. Edwards cautioned that firms should use AI carefully to avoid alienating the public, as a lack of trust in AI could hinder its adoption and limit societal benefits and innovation.</description>

			<description>The Delhi PWD Minister, Atishi, has inspected an under-construction flyover in Anand Vihar and instructed officials to complete the work by April 2024. The six-lane flyover aims to reduce traffic congestion from Apsara Border to Anand Vihar, making east Delhi traffic jam-free. Atishi emphasized that delays in construction will not be tolerated and urged officials to speed up the work by increasing manpower and machinery. She also demanded weekly progress reports. If the construction is not completed on time, action will be taken against the officials. Once finished, the flyover is expected to benefit around 1.48 lakh daily commuters, saving them over 11 minutes per trip and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.50 lakh tonnes. Additionally, the project is estimated to save 16.57 lakh litres of fuel annually, resulting in a cost savings of Rs 144.78 crore for the people.</description>

			<description>The Punjabi music industry is explored in the OTT series "Chamak," according to writer-director Rohit Jugraj. The series follows Kaala, an aspiring rapper who returns to Punjab from Canada to uncover the murder of Taara Singh, a renowned singer. Jugraj believes that fame and crime are interconnected in the music industry, with the reach and popularity of Punjabi music attracting both money and criminal activities. He highlights the competitive spirit and insecurity among artists, citing incidents such as rappers claiming superiority and one rapper buying a Rolls Royce after another rapper's statement. While "Chamak" draws inspiration from true events, it incorporates fictional characters and a father-son storyline. The show features cameo appearances by various Punjabi artists. Jugraj had approached Sidhu Moosewala for a guest appearance, and although he couldn't participate due to his untimely demise, his name remains on the script as a mark of respect.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/punjab-governor-reserves-three-bills-for-consideration-of-president/1874419/</link>
			<description>Punjab Governor Bhawarlal Purohit has reserved three bills, including the Sikh Gurdwaras (Amendment) Bill, 2023, for the consideration of the President. The other two bills are the Punjab Universities Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2023, and the Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill, 2023. The Sikh Gurdwaras (Amendment) Bill aims to broadcast 'Gurbani' from the Golden Temple in Amritsar for free. The Punjab Universities Laws (Amendment) Bill intends to replace the governor with the chief minister as the chancellor of state-run universities. The Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill aims to establish an independent mechanism for selecting and appointing suitable candidates for the director general of police position. The move follows the Supreme Court's validation of the June 19-20 session, which the governor had previously called illegal. The court criticized the governor for delaying the approval of bills and questioned the state government for repeatedly adjourning the Budget session without proroguing it.</description>

			<description>India's market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has raised concerns about alternate investment funds (AIFs) being used to hide bad loans in the financial system. SEBI has observed numerous cases of regulatory violations by AIFs, including avoiding recognition of non-performing assets. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shares these concerns. SEBI is currently investigating cases involving AIF misuse amounting to 150 billion to 200 billion rupees ($1.8 billion to $2.4 billion) and plans to enforce a code of conduct to prevent such practices. They have also proposed that all AIF liabilities and assets be held in dematerialized form for increased transparency.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/india-swap-market-signals-cenbank-will-differ-from-feds-rate-cut-path/1874414/</link>
			<description>India's overnight index swap (OIS) market is indicating that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will not rush to cut interest rates, even if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts lowering rates early next year. The odds of the Fed's first rate cut in March have increased to 63%, while the RBI is expected to keep rates unchanged until mid-2024. This is reflected in India's OIS rates, which have only dropped modestly over the past six weeks. Market participants anticipate shallow rate cuts by the RBI due to strong economic growth and the need to control inflation. Inflation concerns are resurfacing in India, with retail inflation expected to exceed the RBI's tolerance limit. As a result, there is no room for the RBI to suggest any dovishness, and swap markets have not altered their rate cut expectations.</description>

			<description>Markets in Jaipur and several other districts of Rajasthan were closed due to a bandh called by the Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena to protest the killing of its chief, Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi. The Director General of Police formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the killing, with a cash reward announced for information leading to the arrest of the two accused. The Rajasthan Police conducted searches for the suspects, who allegedly killed Gogamedi for supporting the enemies of gangster Rohit Godara. A mass rally was held in Udaipur, while demonstrations took place in Jodhpur and Udaipur as well. The bandh had an impact on public transport and people's movement in various districts. The Governor summoned officials to review the situation and emphasized the importance of arresting those responsible for the killing. The accused have been identified, and efforts are being made to trace them. The situation is being monitored by district collectors, and there are demands for the removal of the state police chief. The Rajput community expressed resentment and threatened protests if the accused were not apprehended soon. Gogamedi's supporters demanded compensation for his family, and there were calls for action against the negligent police officials involved.</description>

			<title>Exclusive-China EV maker Nio to spin off its battery production unit -sources</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/exclusive-china-ev-maker-nio-to-spin-off-its-battery-production-unit-sources/1874177/</link>
			<description>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio is planning to spin off its battery manufacturing unit in a bid to reduce costs and improve efficiency, according to anonymous sources. Led by experienced engineers from Apple and Panasonic, the nascent battery unit will seek external investors and could be spun off by the end of the year. Nio intends to continue in-house research and development on batteries but plans to outsource all manufacturing. The company currently purchases batteries from CATL and CALB Group. The spin-off aligns with Nio's strategy to turn profitable sooner, as it aims to develop and manufacture some batteries internally while outsourcing production to other suppliers. This move will involve the transfer of top engineers to the new firm and the merging of some staff into other departments. Nio hired these engineers to facilitate mass production of large cylindrical cells similar to Tesla's 4680 at a planned plant in China's Anhui province. The assets to be spun off may include the planned plant, testing equipment, and intellectual property. Nio reported a loss of $637.06 million in Q3 and aims to improve profitability over the next three years by deferring its plan to bring battery production in-house. The company has also undertaken measures to reduce costs, including trimming its workforce and deferring long-term investments. Nio is expanding abroad and considering building a dealer network in Europe to accelerate sales growth.</description>

			<description>Australia's weather bureau reported that rainfall in November was 37.8% above the average from 1961-1990, providing relief to farmers after a dry period. However, the overall rainfall during the southern hemisphere spring was 20.1% below average, the lowest since 2019. Soil moisture levels remain below average in parts of southern Australia, Western Australia, and along the eastern and northern coasts. This year's wheat crop is expected to be 37% less than last year, with rain impacting the harvest's quality. On a positive note, the rain has benefited summer crops and increased livestock prices. The weather bureau predicts a hotter than usual summer with below median rainfall in certain regions.</description>

			<description>The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has reported an increase in violence against the Shia and Hazara communities in Kabul, Balkh, and Herat provinces. The recent attack on Shia Muslims in Herat has sparked strong reactions, leading to calls for support for individuals at risk. In the attack, six people, including four men and two women, were killed by unidentified armed individuals while riding in a rickshaw in the Hazara-populated area of Jibril. Prior to this incident, two Shia clerics were killed in an armed attack in Herat on November 23. Over the past month, numerous people, including women, have been killed and injured in separate attacks on a bus and a sports hall in the Hazara-populated area of Dasht-e Barchi in Kabul. The Human Rights Defenders Assembly and Richard Bennett, the Special Rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, have condemned these attacks. Hazaras and Shia Muslims in Afghanistan have faced assassinations, bombings, and targeted attacks, with no responsible party claiming responsibility for these acts of violence.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/venezuelas-maduro-pledges-to-permit-oil-mines-development-in-disputed-territory/1873953/</link>
			<description>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced his authorization for oil exploration in a disputed area with Guyana, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) barring Venezuela from changing the status quo in the region. Maduro's decision follows a referendum where voters rejected the ICJ's jurisdiction over the dispute and supported creating a new state in the territory. State oil company PDVSA and state iron and steel maker CVG will establish divisions for the contested region. In response, Guyana plans to report Maduro's actions to the United Nations and the ICJ, calling Venezuela an "outlaw nation." The maritime border between the two countries is also under dispute. Exxon Mobil has been producing oil off Guyana's coast since 2019, and Guyana recently received bids for new exploration licenses. Despite the tensions, Guyana's president reassured investors that their investments are secure, with support from international partners and the community. Analysts suggest that Maduro's move may be aimed at gauging his government's support ahead of the 2024 presidential election.</description>

			<description>Afghanistan ranks as the world's sixth most vulnerable and least-ready country to address the impacts of climate change, according to the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan, Daniel Peter Endres. In a video released by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Afghanistan, Endres highlighted rising temperatures, declining rainfall, and unprecedented deforestation in Afghanistan over the past 70 years. Mullah Jan Saiq, the Taliban-appointed spokesman of the State Ministry for Disaster Management, expressed concerns about the potential damage caused by climate change if not addressed in Afghanistan. The Taliban ruled government objected to not being invited to the COP28 Climate summit in Dubai despite the country's vulnerability to climate change. Farmers in Afghanistan also voiced their concerns about the severe drought and how it affects their harvests. The article concludes by mentioning that Afghanistan was not represented at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) hosted by the UAE.</description>

			<description>Santiago Bausili, an Argentine economist and ally of the incoming Economy Minister Luis Caputo, is expected to become the governor of Argentina's central bank under President-elect Javier Milei. Bausili previously held roles in the finance sector under Mauricio Macri's administration and worked for Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan. His appointment could help moderate Milei's libertarian proposals. Milei had initially favored Emilio Ocampo as his dollarization adviser, but has since shifted towards a more pragmatic approach focused on reducing the fiscal deficit. Milei's team did not respond to a request for comment on Bausili.</description>

			<title>Rupee to gauge dollar’s recovery even as economic data drives US yields lower</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/rupee-to-gauge-dollars-recovery-even-as-economic-data-drives-us-yields-lower/1873909/</link>
			<description>The Indian rupee is expected to open unchanged amid a rebound in the US dollar, despite a decline in US Treasury yields due to lower-than-expected job openings in October. Non-deliverable forwards suggest the rupee will open around 83.36-83.37. The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped to 4.16% after data showed job openings at their lowest level in over two and a half years. Weakness in the data led to speculation that the US Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as March. The rupee's movement is currently influenced by speculation about the Reserve Bank of India's response rather than economic fundamentals. The RBI likely sold US dollars on Tuesday to limit the rupee's decline. Despite increased equity inflows, the rupee has been unable to strengthen. The dollar index has ticked up to 103.97, recovering after a recent sharp fall, driven by dovish comments from a European Central Bank official and safe-haven demand amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. Investors are awaiting further information on the US labor market from jobless claims data and the non-farm payrolls report.</description>

			<description>India is taking the lead in shaping global regulations on privacy and data protection, according to BJP's national vice-president Baijayant Panda. Speaking at the Global Technology Summit, Panda highlighted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act), 2023, which has gained attention from countries like South Africa and Norway. The act focuses on children's rights and addresses consent in the digital era. Panda emphasized the need for new approaches to deal with consent and the importance of a designated authority for large organizations handling data. He also discussed India's unique challenges and the domestic focus of the DPDP Act. Additionally, Panda mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Social Impact Fund, aimed at implementing digital public infrastructure in emerging economies.</description>

			<title>In southern Gaza, Israel mounts fiercest attacks so far in war against Hamas</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/in-southern-gaza-israel-mounts-fiercest-attacks-so-far-in-war-against-hamas/1873866/</link>
			<description>Israel's military launched a fierce assault on the main city in southern Gaza, marking the most intense combat since its ground invasion began to eliminate Hamas five weeks ago. The US urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties. Israeli forces, supported by warplanes, reached the heart of Khan Younis and surrounded the city, engaging in violent clashes with Hamas fighters. The battles were the most intense since the collapse of the truce between Israel and Hamas. Hamas claimed to have killed or wounded eight Israeli troops and destroyed 24 military vehicles, while the Israeli military reported two troop deaths and 83 since the start of the ground operation. Gaza health officials said many civilians were killed in an Israeli strike, but the exact toll could not be confirmed. Israel initiated its campaign in response to an attack by Hamas fighters on Israeli towns, resulting in numerous casualties and hostages. The US continued to pressure Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and reduce harm to civilians. President Joe Biden accused Hamas of rape and mutilation during their assault on Israel, which Hamas denounced as false accusations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mentioned claims of sexual assault in a meeting with families of returned hostages. Hostage releases have stalled, with Hamas refusing further releases until Israel's aggression stops. Additionally, the US imposed visa bans on individuals involved in violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant condemned settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.</description>

			<title>UK government underprepared for extreme weather events – watchdog</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/entertainment/uk-government-underprepared-for-extreme-weather-events-watchdog/1873859/</link>
			<description>According to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), the British government is ill-prepared for extreme weather events that could cause significant disruption. The NAO assessed the country's resilience against four extreme weather risks - droughts, surface water flooding, storms, and high temperatures - and found that more needs to be done to prepare for and develop resilience to such events. The report urges the government to increase its focus on reducing these risks and making the system more resilient. It also calls for accelerated investment in climate and wider resilience, with implementation by 2028 instead of the current target of 2030. The absence of an effective strategy and targets makes it difficult for the government to make informed decisions on investment.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/former-pm-boris-johnson-to-defend-record-and-conduct-at-uk-covid-inquiry/1873855/</link>
			<description>Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to appear before an inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The inquiry has already heard damaging testimonies about Johnson's management of the crisis, including allegations of government incompetence and misogyny. Johnson will face two days of questioning, with families of COVID-19 victims planning to confront him over claims that he preferred to see people die rather than order a second lockdown. The inquiry is also expected to shed light on the role of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who reportedly shared similar views. The pandemic claimed over 230,000 lives in Britain. Johnson resigned after reports of alcohol-fueled gatherings in Downing Street during lockdowns. The inquiry aims to examine the government's response to the virus and its impact on the economy. Johnson's decision-making and alleged comments will be scrutinized during his appearance.</description>

			<description>Top EU officials, including Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang in Beijing to discuss various concerns. The European Union's focus will be on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as they want China to use its influence to help stop the war. The EU will also stress the importance of respecting sanctions on Russia and raise concerns about arms supply from North Korea to Russia. Additionally, the EU is worried about its "imbalanced" economic relations with China, citing a significant trade deficit. On the other hand, China is expected to inquire about an EU anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles and the EU's efforts to reduce reliance on Chinese imports. Areas of potential cooperation include climate change, biodiversity, and macroeconomics and trade dialogues. While no concrete outcomes are expected from this summit, mutual interests could lead to technical and practical collaboration between the EU and China.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/new-zealands-new-government-to-trim-spending-pledges-relief-on-costs/1873849/</link>
			<description>New Zealand's new right-of-centre coalition government, led by Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, has announced its plans to trim government spending, provide income tax relief for families, and amend the central bank's monetary policy framework. The government aims to focus solely on price stability, amending the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's dual mandate on inflation and employment within 100 days. The governor-general's speech also confirmed coalition agreements to cut red tape, enhance productivity and economic growth, and strengthen foreign, defense, and trade policies. However, some of the government's policies have faced criticism, particularly regarding their treatment of the Maori language and interpretation of the country's founding treaty document.</description>

The exact number of passengers remains unverified. The Philippines has a reputation for lax regulation on public transportation and poorly maintained roads.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/motor-racing-fia-compliance-probe-kicks-up-a-storm-in-f1/1873836/</link>
			<description>Formula One's governing body, the FIA, has launched a compliance probe following reports that a team boss received confidential information from an employee of the commercial rights holder. While the principal was not named, media outlets identified him as Mercedes' Toto Wolff, whose wife Susie leads the all-female F1 Academy. The FIA stated that its compliance department is investigating the matter, which drew a strong response from Mercedes and Susie Wolff. They rejected the allegations and expressed surprise that they learned about the investigation through a media statement rather than direct communication from the FIA. Formula One's owners, Liberty Media, also expressed confidence in their team and claimed that no unauthorized disclosure had been made to a team principal. Reports suggest that conflict of interest concerns were raised by some team bosses last year when Shaila Ann-Rao, who had previously worked as an adviser to Wolff, was appointed as the FIA's interim head of Formula One.</description>

However, this victory was not enough to secure a spot for Team GB in the Paris Olympics as the Netherlands claimed the top position in their Nations League group. In a dramatic turn of events, Lucy Bronze scored a last-minute goal for England, momentarily giving them hope of winning Group A1 and advancing to the Nations League semi-finals. But the Netherlands secured the top spot with a 4-0 victory over Belgium, edging out England on goal difference. Despite their disappointment, England's players recognized their hard work and expressed admiration for their performance.

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/soccer-arsenal-go-five-clear-as-rice-seals-seven-goal-thriller-at-luton/1873817/</link>
			<description>Arsenal secured a thrilling 4-3 victory over Luton Town thanks to Declan Rice's header in stoppage time. The win propelled Arsenal five points clear at the top of the Premier League standings. The game started slow, but Gabriel Martinelli's scuffed shot, assisted by Bukayo Saka, gave Arsenal the lead. Luton quickly responded with a header from Gabriel Osho, and then Arsenal regained the lead just before halftime with a goal from Gabriel Jesus. Luton fought back with goals from Elijah Adebayo and Ross Barkley, but Kai Havertz equalized for Arsenal in the 60th minute. Ultimately, Rice's header secured the win for Arsenal, leaving Luton in disappointment.</description>

			<description>A senior US administration official, Julieta Valls Noyes, has visited Pakistan to discuss Afghan refugees and their resettlement. Noyes met with Pakistan's special representative for Afghanistan, Ambassador Asif Durrani, and other senior officials during her four-day trip. The US is working with Pakistan to find a solution for eligible Afghans who worked for the US during its military campaign but are now stranded in Pakistan. Pakistan has started cracking down on illegal Afghan immigrants, but the US aims to spare those eligible for immigration. Concerns exist about vulnerable individuals like musicians, artists, and journalists facing eviction. Another US official, Tom West, is scheduled to arrive in Islamabad later to discuss the overall Afghan situation and the relationship between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/sexual-assaults-in-canadian-military-have-risen-significantly-data/1873802/</link>
			<description>Sexual assaults in the Canadian military have seen a significant increase in 2022 compared to 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Around 1,960 members of the military, or 3.5% of the total, reported being sexually assaulted by fellow armed forces personnel, up from 1.6% in 2018. The majority of complaints (75%) were made by women. The military has faced longstanding pressure regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by senior officers. A survey conducted by Statscan revealed that 64% of victims did not report the incidents they experienced due to a belief that it would not make a difference. General Wayne Eyre, chief of the defense staff, expressed disappointment at the prevalence of sexual misconduct and acknowledged the need for substantial efforts to address the issue. An official investigation in the previous year recommended external civilian authorities to handle sex crime investigations due to the unsatisfactory handling of offenses by military courts over the past two decades.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/motor-racing-mercedes-and-f1-angered-by-fia-compliance-probe/1873798/</link>
			<description>Mercedes and Formula One are displeased with the FIA's investigation into allegations that a team boss received confidential information from an employee of the commercial rights holder. The team principal was not identified, but reports mentioned Mercedes' Toto Wolff and his wife Susie, who works for Formula One as head of the all-female F1 Academy. The FIA compliance department is currently looking into the matter. Both Mercedes and Formula One expressed confidence in the integrity of their teams and denied any unauthorised disclosure of information. The website reported that some team principals had raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest to FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, leading him to request an investigation by the compliance department. The FIA spokesman refrained from commenting on the issue. Conflict of interest concerns were previously raised when Shaila Ann-Rao, a former special advisor to Wolff, served as the FIA's interim head of Formula One but left shortly afterward.</description>

			<description>Wolverhampton Wanderers secured a 1-0 victory over Burnley in their Premier League match at Molineux. The winning goal came from Hwang Hee-chan, who capitalized on a defensive mistake by Burnley. Wolves goalkeeper Daniel Bentley made an impressive double-save to deny Jay Rodriguez and Josh Brownhill. This win moves Wolves up to 12th place in the table, while Burnley remains in 19th place. Burnley has yet to earn a point after conceding the first goal this season. Wolves controlled most of the game and secured their first clean sheet in 12 matches. Despite a few opportunities, Burnley did not create enough chances to deserve a draw.</description>

			<description>The United States is urging Israel to allow more aid, including fuel, into Gaza as the Israeli offensive against Hamas intensifies. The U.S. State Department spokesperson stated that the current level of assistance is insufficient and needs to increase. On Monday, 100 humanitarian aid trucks and 69,000 litres of fuel were delivered to Gaza from Egypt, which is below the daily average during a previous humanitarian pause. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also called on Israel to increase aid flow and minimize civilian harm. Israeli forces have stormed the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties. The situation in Gaza is reported to be deteriorating rapidly.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-says-hamas-raped-mutilated-women-during-israel-assault/1873773/</link>
			<description>U.S. President Joe Biden recently spoke at a political fundraiser in Boston, where he mentioned reports of unimaginable cruelty perpetrated by Hamas during its assault on southern Israel on October 7. Biden referred to accounts of women being repeatedly raped, their bodies mutilated while still alive, and corpses being desecrated. He called for international condemnation of sexual violence without exception. Israeli police are investigating possible sexual crimes committed by some of the individuals arrested after the attack. Hamas denies these allegations. Israel held an event at the United Nations focused on sexual violence against women during the attack, with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemning rape as a weapon of war. Biden blamed Hamas for the collapse of a truce last week, stating that their refusal to release remaining hostages broke the deal. The article also mentions the number of casualties reported by both sides and emphasizes Biden's call for the immediate return of all hostages held by Hamas.</description>

			<description>Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny's voice went viral recently, but the songs circulating were not his. Chilean artist Maurico Bustos, known as FlowGPT, used artificial intelligence to modify Bad Bunny's vocals in a song called NostalgIA, which became a viral hit on TikTok. Bad Bunny expressed his dislike for the song, while Bustos defended his work, stating that he was a fan of Bad Bunny and that his success was partly due to learning from other artists. Bustos aims to create a fictional virtual character using AI, similar to the concept of the British band Gorillaz. Due to a legal void, this type of generative AI may be difficult to regulate. Bad Bunny's management did not provide any immediate comment on the matter.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-says-russia-rejected-proposal-for-release-of-paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/1873762/</link>
			<description>The United States recently made a new proposal to secure the release of Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, two Americans who are currently detained in Russia on charges of espionage. The US considers their detention to be wrongful. However, Russia rejected the proposal, although specific details about the proposal were not disclosed. The US State Department spokesperson emphasized that the rejection will not deter the US from continuing efforts to bring both individuals home. Paul Whelan was arrested in 2018 and convicted of espionage in 2020, while Evan Gershkovich was arrested in March 2023. Both deny the charges against them.

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/despite-gaza-death-toll-soaring-u-s-unlikely-to-rethink-weapons-supplies-to-israel/1873733/</link>
			<description>The Biden administration is urging Israel to minimize civilian deaths in its offensive in southern Gaza. U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have publicly called for a more surgical approach to avoid heavy casualties. However, the U.S. is not willing to take stronger measures such as restricting military aid or harshly criticizing Israel. The U.S. believes that private negotiations are effective in influencing Israeli actions. Israel has faced international pressure, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems unmoved. The United States provides significant military aid to Israel, giving it leverage over the conduct of the war against Hamas. However, the Biden administration is cautious about reducing aid due to potential risks and political implications. While some progressive Democrats push for setting conditions on military aid and an immediate ceasefire, Biden is also concerned about pro-Israel voters and the upcoming presidential election. The fighting between Israel and Hamas resumed after a seven-day pause, resulting in a soaring death toll. Israel accuses Hamas of using human shields, while critics point out civilian casualties caused by intense airstrikes.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-announces-visa-bans-after-warning-israel-over-west-bank-violence/1873725/</link>
			<description>The U.S. State Department has announced that it will impose visa bans on individuals who undermine peace, security, or stability in the occupied West Bank. The restrictions will target those who commit acts of violence or restrict civilians' access to essential services. Family members of these individuals may also be affected. President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials have urged Israel to take action against violence by Israeli settlers towards Palestinians in the West Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the U.S. is ready to use its own authorities to address the issue. The first visa bans will be implemented immediately, with more to follow in the coming days. Israelis with existing U.S. visas who are targeted will be notified of their revoked status. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, building Jewish settlements that are considered illegal by most countries. Daily settler attacks have increased significantly, while the U.S. aims for Israel to hold accountable those responsible for the violence. Washington will also engage with the Palestinian Authority to address Palestinian attacks against Israelis.</description>

			<description>Barcelona and Germany goalkeeper Marc Andre ter Stegen will undergo surgery for a lower back injury, which has caused him to miss recent games. The injury was sustained during training with the German national team last month. Ter Stegen announced the decision to have surgery on his Instagram account, stating that it is the right and safe choice to ensure a full recovery. The timeframe for his return has not been specified, but local media reports suggest he could be out for several weeks, potentially causing him to miss the Champions League knockout stages in February. Ter Stegen has been a key player for Barcelona this season, making 17 appearances and keeping eight clean sheets. He was also awarded the Zamora Trophy last season as LaLiga's best goalkeeper.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/soccer-greek-referees-refuse-to-officiate-super-league-matches-over-safety-concerns/1873721/</link>
			<description>Greek referees and match officials have announced that they will not officiate any Super League matches starting from the upcoming weekend. They are protesting against what they deem to be dangerous working conditions. Greek football has been plagued by crowd trouble, corruption allegations, and match-fixing, leading to dwindling attendances. Referees often face violent attacks from fans, with some having their homes and vehicles set on fire. Recently, referee Andreas Gamaris had his shop firebombed, while another referee, Tasos Papapetrou, allegedly received death threats. The referees state that they have been targeted and made scapegoats for shifting responsibilities, enduring bullying, threats, and physical attacks. Club presidents also openly criticize specific referees, sometimes even before matches. In previous seasons, foreign referees were brought in to ensure top division matches could proceed. The referees have decided to abstain until conditions are safe and have requested a meeting with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to discuss the matter. The Greek Super League was not immediately available for comment.</description>

			<description>Himachal Pradesh Minister Vikramaditya Singh criticized BJP leader Jai Ram Thakur for making baseless allegations that money from Chhattisgarh was used to fund the Congress' poll campaign in Himachal Pradesh last year. Singh stated that it is inappropriate for a senior leader like Thakur to make such statements and suggested that if there is any truth to the allegations, the BJP can investigate through the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which are under the central government. Singh also advised Thakur to reflect on why his party lost power in Himachal Pradesh one year ago. Thakur had targeted Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel regarding the Mahadev app scam case after the Congress' defeat in Chhattisgarh elections. The Mahadev app is currently being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering.</description>

			<description>The National Green Tribunal has requested a response from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, NTPC, and others regarding a petition that claims there is a scarcity of water in the Yamuna and Ganga rivers in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj.

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/nepal-court-convicts-2-for-their-involvement-in-planting-bomb-on-indian-train/1873696/</link>
			<description>A Nepal court has convicted two individuals, including a suspected ISI agent, for their involvement in a plot to carry out a terror attack by planting a bomb on an Indian train seven years ago. The court verdict was given in response to a case filed by the Money Laundering Department against the two Nepali nationals, Samsul Hoda and Brij Kishor Giri. Details of the incident and the verdict have not been made public yet. According to a local news portal, Hoda, who was residing in Dubai at the time, collaborated with a Pakistani national to plan the attack and recruited Pakistani and Nepalese youths to plant the bomb in Bihar state, India. However, due to a technical fault, the bomb did not explode. It is reported that Hoda received money from Pakistan's spy agency, ISI, and after his plan failed, he murdered two Indian nationals and disposed of their bodies in a nearby forest. The article mentions that a special task force in India also conducted a separate investigation into the matter, leading to the arrest of three individuals.</description>

			<description>The Madhya Pradesh High Court has issued an interim order instructing popular social media platforms, including Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and YouTube, to remove posts that tarnish the image of religious leader Aacharya Dhirendra Krishna Shastri. The court has also directed that no such posts should be published without verifying their veracity. The order states that publishers should adhere to journalistic norms and confirm with concerned individuals whether the news is defamatory or not before publishing it. The court has also ordered the deletion of existing electronic media posts that have harmed Shastri's reputation. The petitioner, Ranjit Singh Patel, objected to objectionable posts and news reports about Shastri, claiming to be his disciple. The court has served notices to the respondents, including the Indian government, YouTube, X, Facebook, and others, and requested responses within six weeks.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/cop28-pledge-to-curb-cooling-emissions-backed-by-63-countries/1873541/</link>
			<description>The United States, Canada, Kenya, and 60 other countries have made a pledge to significantly reduce cooling-related emissions at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai. This commitment, known as the Global Cooling Pledge, focuses on cutting emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning, with a goal of reducing these emissions by at least 68% compared to 2022 levels by 2050. The pledge also includes targets such as establishing minimum energy performance standards by 2030. The increase in demand for cooling due to rising temperatures, growing populations, and higher incomes has led to a surge in cooling emissions, which are expected to reach between 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050. The pledge aims to address this issue and increase access to sustainable cooling solutions. However, some challenges remain, with India, a country that is likely to experience significant growth in cooling demand, not yet joining the pledge. The progress on meeting the goals of the pledge will be monitored annually until 2030.</description>

Israel's governmental organization COGAT denied this claim and criticized Ghebreyesus for his lack of accuracy. COGAT stated that they did not ask the WHO to evacuate the warehouses and had communicated this in writing to the relevant UN representatives. Despite the ongoing fighting, 180 humanitarian aid trucks carrying food, water, shelter equipment, and medical supplies were sent through the Rafah crossing from Egypt to international aid organizations operating in Gaza. Additionally, two diesel fuel tankers, coordinated and supervised by Israel, were admitted to facilitate the operation of vital infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.</description>

			<description>Union Home Minister Amit Shah stated that the government has ensured that India has only one flag and Constitution, referring to the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. He emphasized that the concept of "one flag, one prime minister, one Constitution" is not a political slogan but a principle the BJP firmly believes in. Shah questioned how a country can have two prime ministers, two constitutions, and two flags in response to a remark made by TMC's Saugata Roy. He asserted that the remarks were objectionable and stated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had corrected the situation, regardless of approval or disagreement from others. Shah further mentioned that the idea of "one symbol, one head, one Constitution" was not an election slogan but something they had advocated for since 1950 and have now implemented.</description>

			<description>The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted raids at several locations in Jammu and Kashmir related to a terror conspiracy carried out by offshoots of banned Pakistan-backed terrorist organizations. The raids led to the seizure of digital devices containing incriminating data and documents. The NIA targeted residential premises of hybrid terrorists and Overground Workers (OGWs) associated with newly-formed affiliates and offshoots of the banned outfits. The search also included premises of cadres and sympathizers of these organizations. The NIA's investigation focuses on the conspiracy of these newly launched outfits to destabilize Jammu and Kashmir through violent terrorist attacks and activities. The agency has found evidence of Pak-based operatives using social media platforms and drones to promote terror and deliver arms, ammunition, explosives, and narcotics to their operatives in the Kashmir valley. These activities are part of a broader conspiracy involving radicalization of local youth and mobilization of OGWs.</description>

			<description>Greek olive growers, including Panagiotis Tsafaras, are facing an increase in thefts as olive prices rise during a poor harvest. Tsafaras has been robbed twice, losing over a tonne of olives in one incident. Other producers in Greece have resorted to installing cameras, GPS trackers, and considering private security measures. The thieves strike at night, using rods or silent electric chainsaws to steal the olives. The decline in olive production, due to unfavorable weather conditions, has caused wholesale prices to double to 8-9 euros per liter. Retail prices have reached up to 14 euros, making the crop an attractive target for thieves. Greek police have confirmed a spike in olive and olive oil thefts across the country this year.</description>

The police are conducting an investigation to expose the terrorist network and consider Singh's arrest as a major blow to the group attempting to disrupt peace in the region. In related news, Lakhbir Rode, one of India's most wanted men, died in Pakistan.

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/indonesia-softens-internet-law-after-critics-complain-of-misuse/1872629/</link>
			<description>Indonesia's parliament has passed a revision to its internet law, aiming to address concerns that certain articles were being used to suppress government opposition. The amendment introduces stricter requirements for the defamation article of the electronic information and transaction law (ITE), including a higher burden of proof in prosecutions, and reduces the maximum penalty for defamation from four years to two. However, critics argue that the revision does not go far enough in safeguarding freedom of speech, as it fails to prevent misuse of the law by offended officials seeking extra protection. Human rights activists have long called for changes to the 2008 law, citing its vague and potentially misused articles. This development follows the sentencing of singer and opposition figure Ahmad Dhani under the ITE law in 2019 for insulting political rivals online.</description>

However, they will not disclose the amount of money they plan to spend until two reviews are completed. An external safety review will guide their future actions and is expected to be finished by early 2024. Barra did not comment on whether regulators treated Cruise more harshly than Tesla Autopilot and did not reveal funding details until assessments are complete. Last month, Cruise suspended all driverless and supervised car trips in the US and expanded a safety review following an accident. The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Cruise to attend a hearing for misleading the commission regarding the accident.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israel-considers-flooding-gaza-tunnels-with-seawater-wsj/1872251/</link>
			<description>Israel has reportedly assembled a system of pumps to potentially flood tunnels used by Hamas in the Gaza strip, according to U.S. officials cited by the Wall Street Journal. The pumps, located near the Al-Shati refugee camp, are capable of moving thousands of cubic meters of water per hour and could render the tunnels inoperable within weeks. It remains unclear whether Israel would use the pumps before the release of all hostages held by Hamas. While Reuters cannot verify the details of the report, a U.S. official stated that it made sense for Israel to neutralize the tunnels. The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the flooding plan but acknowledged its efforts to dismantle Hamas's capabilities using various tools. Israel had informed the United States about this option, though it is unknown how close they are to carrying out the plan. No final decision has been made yet.</description>

			<description>Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) made commitments at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai to take ambitious climate action and unlock over US$180 billion in climate finance. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) announced that it will triple its climate lending to US$150 billion over the next decade. The World Bank pledged to increase its climate finance target to 45 percent by 2025, amounting to US$40 billion annually, with an additional US$9 billion per year for the next two years. Furthermore, the World Bank announced a US$5 billion initiative to provide clean energy access to 100 million people in Africa within seven years. Other MDBs also made significant commitments, including the Islamic Development Bank's US$1 billion climate finance commitment for adaptation in conflict-affected countries and the African Development Bank's launch of facilities for green infrastructure and climate impact insurance. The UAE pledged US$200 million for climate resilience in low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, and the COP28 UAE Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework was endorsed by various countries.</description>

			<title>‘Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce’ tops box office</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/entertainment/renaissance-a-film-by-beyonce-tops-box-office/1872235/</link>
			<description>The film "Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce" premiered at the top of the U.S. box office, earning $21.8 million during the typically slow first weekend of December. This marks the first time a movie has crossed the $20 million mark on this particular weekend since 2003. The release date was strategically chosen as it is historically a dead zone for the box office. The film gives fans of Beyonce, known as the Beyhive, a chance to experience her concert tour even if they couldn't get tickets to the sold-out shows. The film received praise for its behind-the-scenes look at Beyonce's world tour and her candid discussions about fame, motherhood, and being a Black woman in the music industry. Although the box office results fell short of Taylor Swift's opening weekend earnings, experts believe it will still boost music downloads and provide a more affordable alternative to attending live concerts.</description>

			<description>Five9, a call center software firm, is reportedly considering a sale after a failed buyout by Zoom Video Communications two years ago. The news caused Five9's shares to increase by over 7%, bringing its market capitalization to $6.2 billion. Five9 is said to be working with advisors to assess interest from potential buyers, including Zoom, which has had discussions about reviving the deal. However, there is no certainty that a sale will occur as deliberations are ongoing. In October 2021, Zoom's proposed acquisition of Five9, valued at $14.7 billion, was terminated due to concerns raised by proxy advisory firms about Five9's growth prospects. Five9 declined to comment on the recent developments, while Zoom has not responded to requests for comment.</description>

			<description>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of his war cabinet at the Defence Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv.

Israel has been increasing its aerial bombardment of southern Gaza, and the IDF spokesperson announced the expansion of ground operations to the entire Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the Israeli military ordered them to remove medical supplies from their two warehouses in southern Gaza due to ground operations, urging Israel to protect civilians and infrastructure.</description>

The U.S. previously imposed visa restrictions on Ugandan officials following the passage of the country's anti-LGBTQ law and the flawed 2021 elections. Blinken also announced a new visa restriction policy for officials in Zimbabwe who undermine democracy, particularly in relation to the upcoming August 2023 elections.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/att-chooses-ericsson-for-new-us-telecom-network-will-drop-nokia/1872207/</link>
			<description>AT&amp;T has announced that it has chosen Ericsson to build a telecom network in the United States using ORAN (open radio access network) technology. This new network will cover 70% of AT&amp;T's wireless traffic by late 2026. ORAN technology promises to reduce costs for telecom operators by using cloud-based software and equipment from multiple suppliers, rather than relying on proprietary equipment from companies like Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei. While some telecom providers have tested ORAN technology, mass adoption has been slow. However, new networks by Dish and Japan's Rakuten are already using Open RAN. AT&amp;T has spent six months analyzing Open RAN and has looked at multiple vendors before choosing Ericsson. The company plans to invest around $14 billion over the next five years for this project. Winning the Open RAN deal will make Ericsson the largest supplier to AT&amp;T, potentially overshadowing Nokia. Nokia shares fell on speculation that they might lose the AT&amp;T contract. Ericsson has agreed to open up its interfaces, which were previously proprietary, across its footprint. AT&amp;T expects fully integrated Open RAN sites operating with Ericsson and Fujitsu by 2024, and by 2025, their network will have equipment from multiple suppliers. AT&amp;T views this move as a game-changer for the industry.</description>

			<description>Thousands of protesters gathered in various locations in New Zealand to demonstrate against the new government's policies that they believe are racist. The protest, organized by the political party Te Pati Maori, took place on the same day as the opening of New Zealand's 54th parliament. The coalition agreement between the National Party, New Zealand First, and ACT New Zealand, which formed the new centre-right government, includes plans to reduce the use of the Maori language, review affirmative action policies, and examine the interpretation of the country's founding treaty in legislation. The protests were peaceful, causing traffic disruptions but no arrests were made. Some protesters expressed concerns about the government's agenda, while others dismissed the demonstrations as theatrical and urged the government to focus on addressing more pressing issues in the country.</description>

			<description>Thailand is currently celebrating the Loy Krathong festival, also known as Thailand's festival of lights on the river. This festival, which takes place in Sukhumvit, Thailand, is believed to have originated from an old Brahmin festival honoring water spirits before being adapted to pay respects to Buddha. During Loy Krathong, people gather at lakes, rivers, and other water bodies to float flower-decorated cardboard vessels called 'Krathongs' with candles and incense sticks after offering prayers to the Moon. The festival is seen as a time for celebration, prayer, and wishing for well-being. Thai people light diyas in ponds and engage in rituals to rid themselves of evils and eliminate bad effects. They hold deep respect for gods like Shiva, Parvati, Ganesha, and Indra and worship them along with Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Ganesha, and Buddha.</description>

			<title>Delhi’s air quality improves slightly after rainfall</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/delhis-air-quality-improves-slightly-after-rainfall/1861439/</link>
			<description>The air quality in Delhi and its surrounding areas slightly improved on Monday due to rain and favorable wind speed caused by a western disturbance affecting northwest India. The rainfall of 7.2 mm and wind speed of 20 kilometers per hour helped disperse pollutants, resulting in an improvement in the air quality index (AQI). At 10 pm, the AQI stood at 387, better than the readings earlier in the day. However, the city has experienced 10 severe air quality days in November so far, compared to three in the same month last year. Biomass burning has been identified as the top contributor to Delhi's air pollution, accounting for 31 to 51 percent of the city's pollution levels. Authorities have been directed to enforce restrictions on polluting vehicles and curb biomass burning.</description>

The court has set a deadline of January 17, 2024, for the consultation process with multiple stakeholders and state governments. The Attorney General requested an indefinite adjournment, but the court refused and scheduled the next hearing for January 17. The court clarified that the judgment in the Mukund Dewangan case will remain in effect during the proceedings. The court emphasized that this issue impacts the livelihoods of many people and should be addressed at the policy level. The legal question arose from disputes over insurance claims in accidents involving transport vehicles driven by individuals with licenses for light motor vehicles. The Motor Vehicle Act provides different regimes for granting driving licenses for various vehicle categories. The matter was referred to a larger bench for reconsideration.</description>

			<description>Researchers have developed a new method called UNLOC that distinguishes between multiple users accessing a single application using keystroke dynamics.

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/nitish-gets-his-cabinet-to-pass-resolution-in-favour-of-special-status/1854661/</link>
			<description>The Bihar government led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has passed a resolution requesting special category status for the state. This demand was prompted by the findings of a caste survey conducted by the government, which highlighted the increase in the population of deprived castes. As a result, quotas for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) have been raised from 50 to 65 percent. Additionally, the government plans to implement various welfare measures, including providing financial assistance for economic activities, constructing pucca houses, and increasing support for landless families. These initiatives are estimated to cost around Rs 2.50 lakh crore and are expected to be completed within five years. Nitish Kumar has been advocating for special status since 2010 and has renewed his demand with greater emphasis recently. He had threatened to launch a state-wide agitation if the demand was not met.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/parliamentary-panel-gives-stamp-of-approval-to-hindi-names-for-proposed-criminal-laws/1853001/</link>
			<description>A parliamentary panel has determined that the Hindi names given to the proposed criminal laws are not unconstitutional. The panel, headed by BJP MP Brijlal, referred to Article 348 of the Constitution, which states that English should be used in the Supreme Court, high courts, Acts, Bills, and legal documents. The committee concluded that since the text of the legislation is in English, it does not violate Article 348. The proposed laws aim to replace the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Act, and Indian Evidence Act. Some political parties and leaders, including P Chidambaram and the DMK, have criticized the use of Hindi names for the bills. However, the panel and Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla argued that there is no violation as the bills are written in English.</description>

			<title>Exclusive-France, US to propose ban on private finance to coal-fired plants at COP28 – sources</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/exclusive-france-us-to-propose-ban-on-private-finance-to-coal-fired-plants-at-cop28-sources/1852985/</link>
			<description>France, with support from the United States, plans to propose a halt to private financing for coal-based power plants at the upcoming U.N. climate conference. This plan, called the "New Coal Exclusion Policy," was communicated to India earlier this month. However, India and China are opposed to any efforts to block the construction of coal-fired power stations due to their energy needs. The proposal aims to dry up private funding for coal power by setting coal-exit standards for finance firms, tracked by regulators and rating agencies. The U.S., European Union, and Canada have expressed concerns about private international financing supporting new coal capacity in developing nations. About 490 gigawatts of new coal capacity is planned or under construction, mainly in India and China. India, where 73% of electricity is produced using coal, intends to resist committing to a fossil fuel phase-out or phase-down at the conference. Instead, it may focus on reducing emissions from other sources and urge developed nations to become carbon negative by 2050.</description>

All five political parties in Bhutan have aligned their manifestos with this goal. The 13th Plan aims to achieve a USD 5 billion economy by 2029 and double it to USD 10 billion by 2034. However, this requires significant investments of over Nu 1 trillion. The article also mentions the different growth rate targets set by the political parties, ranging from 8% to 12% annually. Bhutan's GDP growth rate has slowed down in recent years due to various factors, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. To revitalize the economy, the parties have proposed economic stimulus plans and plans to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). They also aim to reduce the trade deficit, create high-end jobs in the digital economy, and increase the share of the manufacturing sector in GDP. The parties have set targets for tourism, inflation, and national debt reduction as well.</description>

			<description>The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has highlighted the challenges faced by Afghan children, who are often involved in dangerous work to support their families. Many children in Afghanistan, such as Asif, Mustafa, and Sohrab, work in hazardous jobs and struggle to provide bread and support for their families. The situation is exacerbated by the high levels of poverty and malnutrition in the country, with approximately three million Afghans suffering from malnutrition. The Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan has further worsened the living conditions, especially for children and women, whose fundamental rights and freedoms are severely restricted. Women are banned from most jobs and public spaces, while girls are prohibited from continuing their education beyond sixth grade. The difficult circumstances faced by Afghan children and the urgent need for support are emphasized in the report.</description>

Snap's CEO Evan Spiegel has agreed to testify, while X has communicated their availability to participate. The committee aims to address the issue of online child sexual exploitation and press social media CEOs on their failures to protect children.

			<title>Exclusive-Germany, France and Italy reach agreement on future AI regulation</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/exclusive-germany-france-and-italy-reach-agreement-on-future-ai-regulation-2/1852708/</link>
			<description>France, Germany, and Italy have agreed on how artificial intelligence (AI) should be regulated, according to a joint paper seen by Reuters. The three governments support mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct for foundation models of AI, while opposing untested norms. They emphasize that the regulation should focus on the application of AI systems rather than the technology itself. The developers of foundation models would have to define model cards containing relevant information about the model's functioning, capabilities, and limits. An AI governance body could be established to develop guidelines and ensure compliance. Initially, no sanctions would be imposed, but a system of sanctions could be implemented in case of violations. Germany's economy ministry emphasizes that AI applications, not the technology itself, should be regulated. The German and Italian governments will further discuss AI-related issues in upcoming meetings.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-falls-to-2-1-2-month-low-on-fed-expectations-yen-strengthens/1852705/</link>
			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The dollar index, which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of other major currencies, has reached its lowest level in over two months. Investors believe that the US Federal Reserve has finished its cycle of interest rate hikes and are now looking towards potential rate cuts. Recent data has shown a slowdown in the economy and inflation pressures, but not enough to cause concerns about a recession. The market is now speculating on when the Fed may begin cutting rates, with a greater than 50% chance of at least a 25 basis points cut by May. Some Fed officials have not ruled out the possibility of more rate hikes if economic data calls for it. The euro and yen have strengthened against the weaker dollar, and the euro has been supported by expectations that the European Central Bank will keep its rate hike cycle intact after the Fed has finished. Moody's has unexpectedly upgraded Italy's sovereign rating outlook and upgraded Portugal's rating. The pound has also strengthened to a two-month high.</description>

			<description>Several medical professionals in Kabul have discussed the transmission of infectious diseases among recently deported refugees from Pakistan. They have found that a large number of these patients suffer from contagious skin conditions that were uncommon in Afghanistan. The refugees are demanding careful consideration of their health issues from the Afghan caretaker government. The World Health Organisation has warned about the spread of infectious diseases among returning refugees and has highlighted the need for prompt assistance and health services. Pakistan's decision to expel over a million undocumented Afghan migrants has resulted in a significant number of them returning to Afghanistan.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Oil prices rose over 2% on Monday as the OPEC+ group is expected to announce further supply cuts at an upcoming meeting. Brent crude futures settled at $82.32 a barrel, up 2.1%, while West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) gained 2.3% to $77.60, and January futures rose 1.8% to $77.83. The rebound follows four straight weeks of decline and speculation that OPEC+ may consider additional supply cuts. Some analysts believe deeper cuts may be necessary due to falling speculative positioning, declining timespreads, and higher-than-expected inventories. Oil prices have dropped nearly 20% since September, driven by record-high crude output in the US and concerns over demand growth, particularly from China. Additionally, traders are monitoring signs of a possible US recession in 2024 and evaluating the impact of the ongoing conflict in Israel on oil supply.</description>

			<title>Property registration stalled by sub-registrars, says BJP citing NCT of Delhi RERA order</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/property-registration-stalled-by-sub-registrars-says-bjp-citing-nct-of-delhi-rera-order/1852665/</link>
			<description>According to the Delhi BJP, property registration has been halted by sub-registrars in Delhi following a NCT of Delhi RERA order. However, a senior revenue department officer has stated that no directions to stop property registrations have been issued. Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva criticized the AAP government and asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to clarify if the RERA order applies to properties constructed before or after November 20. Sources in the Delhi government said that RERA falls under the central government's jurisdiction and accused the BJP of misleading the public. The Delhi BJP claimed that the RERA order limits the number of dwelling units allowed in certain plot sizes, which contradicts the large number of properties in Delhi with additional units. The RERA had directed that building plans indicate the total number of dwelling units that can be constructed on the plot. The report mentions the presence of unauthorised colonies in Delhi and raises concerns about their future legality under the RERA order.</description>

The penalty was based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and does not question the validity of any bank transactions. An inspection conducted by the RBI revealed that the bank had renewed a loan given to a relative of one of its directors. After considering the bank's reply, the RBI concluded that the charge of non-compliance with the directions was substantiated and warranted a penalty.

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/russia-calls-for-extra-efforts-to-overcome-payment-hurdles/1852639/</link>
			<description>Russia's ambassador to India, Denis Alipov, has called for "extra efforts" from banks and exporters to overcome payment problems that hinder trade between the two countries. He highlighted that the vostro trade settlement mechanism (rupee payment) is not working effectively and urged Indian banks and exporters to make additional efforts to resolve this issue. While Alipov did not provide specific details on what these extra efforts entailed, he emphasized the need for cooperation between banks.

			<description>Paris is facing major accommodation problems ahead of the 2024 Olympics, with hotel prices set to rise by 314%. The report by the Paris tourism office criticized hotels for not opening their booking platforms for the games, with only 34% currently available for booking. The report also highlighted that hotel prices in July 2023 were 169 euros, expected to rise to 699 euros in July 2024. As a result, visitors may opt for cheaper accommodation options outside of Paris and commute. Concerns have also been raised about the increasing popularity of Airbnb rentals, with the French parliament expected to pass a law cracking down on illegal rentals. Owners who illegally rent their homes currently face fines totaling 6.5 million euros between 2021 and 2023.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/explainer-argentina-presidential-election-key-takeaways-from-mileis-win/1852147/</link>
			<description>Javier Milei, a radical libertarian, has been elected as the president of Argentina, receiving a wide margin of votes in a run-off election. This outcome reflects a desire for change and a rejection of the peronist government, which has overseen soaring inflation and increasing poverty. Despite Milei's significant voter support, he will face challenges due to his limited presence in regional governments and congress, and he may have to moderate his plans for economic reforms such as dollarization. Milei's election comes at a time of economic crisis for Argentina, and his proposed reforms could help address the country's fiscal issues. However, he will need the support of more moderate conservatives to implement his plans. Milei, a 53-year-old economist, has been compared to Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro due to his abrasive style and desire to slash government spending.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistans-caretaker-pm-kakar-rejects-concerns-about-bias-against-some-political-parties-ahead-of-elections/1851578/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's caretaker Prime Minister, Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar, has dismissed allegations of bias against political parties and stated that holding general elections and transferring power to the elected government is his top priority. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and Pakistan People's Party (PPP) have complained about the lack of a level playing field in the upcoming election, accusing the caretaker government of favoring the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. Kakar denied these allegations and emphasized the importance of conducting fair and transparent elections. He also addressed concerns about the arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan, stating that the arrest occurred before the formation of the caretaker setup. Kakar urged caution before making accusations and asserted that the safety of incarcerated individuals, including Khan, is their responsibility. Additionally, Kakar called on the Afghan Taliban to take action against terrorists using their soil to attack Pakistan. He criticized the interim Taliban government for its inaction and underscored the need for the Afghan government to address the presence of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) hideouts in Afghanistan. Kakar also discussed the government's crackdown on illegal foreigners, clarifying that registered Afghan refugees would not be repatriated, only undocumented individuals would be deported.</description>

			<description>The Great Barrier Reef is facing pressure due to climate change, and the main solution is to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and shift away from fossil fuels. Researchers have found that talking about the reef in a way that inspires action is important. Messages focusing on the reef and emphasizing collective potential to protect it were found to be more effective in motivating climate action. It is also important to include specific calls to action and highlight the tangible ways people can help. So, when talking about the reef this summer, it is recommended to highlight its iconic nature, use motivational language, state the problem without focusing too much on explaining the threat, and provide specific calls to action. Remember, people can make a difference in demanding and supporting climate action from anywhere.</description>

Despite efforts to moderate content, TikTok's focus seems to be on user engagement rather than creating a safe environment. The automated moderation system is not always accurate, leading to the removal of beneficial LGBTQ+ and sex education content while explicit content slips through. Users also employ tactics like "algospeak" to avoid filters. Harmful content on TikTok promotes unhealthy attitudes towards sex, perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes, and can influence vulnerable young boys with misogynistic views. The platform's promotion of idealistic and sexualized content also negatively affects the self-perception of young women and queer youth. However, TikTok offers an opportunity for informative and inclusive sex education content. Social media platforms face challenges in effectively moderating harmful content, and regulatory bodies like Australia's eSafety Commissioner play a role in pressuring platforms to remove such content. It is important for parents to equip young users with media literacy skills and actively monitor their online activities. Rather than solely restricting app usage, open discussions, building trust, and educating oneself and children about online risks are more effective approaches.</description>

			<title>The future of transport is electric</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/the-future-of-transport-is-electric/1851557/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the need for countries to implement effective policies to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. Currently, transport emissions have been increasing at a rate of 1.7 percent per year since 1990, making it the sector with the highest emissions growth. Road vehicles contribute the most to these emissions, accounting for 74.5 percent.

While the global EV market has experienced significant growth in recent years, adoption rates vary across different regions. The article highlights successful government policies in China, Europe, and the US that have incentivized consumers to switch to EVs through subsidies, rebates, and tax discounts. For example, Norway has achieved a 79 percent market share for EVs by providing financial incentives and other benefits such as lower tolls and access to bus lanes.

The article suggests that alongside EV incentives, higher taxes on polluting vehicles can further encourage the transition to electric transport. Many European Union countries already levy car taxes based on carbon dioxide emissions. Feebate systems, which impose levies on high-emission vehicles and provide rebates for low-emission vehicles, are also effective in discouraging the purchase of polluting vehicles.

In addition to incentives and taxes, the phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles and the implementation of fuel efficiency standards are recommended. Over 35 countries have announced plans to electrify or phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. Fuel efficiency standards set limits on vehicle emissions and encourage the production of low or zero-emission vehicles.

To support the widespread adoption of EVs, the report suggests the need for robust charging infrastructure. Currently, only 13 percent of the estimated 100 million chargers needed by 2030 are in place. Accessible chargers can alleviate range anxiety concerns and make EVs more affordable by reducing the need for larger batteries.

The article concludes by emphasizing that a comprehensive set of consistent policies is crucial for achieving emissions reduction goals and transitioning to cleaner transport. It highlights the importance of not solely relying on EVs but also implementing strategies to change travel behavior, such as reducing car usage, promoting e-bikes and e-scooters, and improving walkability and public transport access.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of getting the policy mix right to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles and achieve global commitments for net zero emissions by 2050.</description>

			<description>The indigenous ZThe prototype of the Zorawar light tank, designed for mountain warfare, will be unveiled in December 2023. Following this, it will undergo development trials and then user trials, likely in March next year. The Indian Army has chosen Cummins, an American company, for the engines of these tanks due to clearance issues faced with German companies. The Zorawar tank is specifically designed for high-altitude operations and aims to counter Chinese armoured deployments in such terrains. Weighing 25 tonnes, the tank will have greater mobility and accuracy compared to Chinese Type 15 tanks deployed along the Ladakh border. The need for a light tank arose as the existing T72s and T90s are more suitable for plains and deserts and lack maneuverability. The tank will feature a 105 mm gun made by a Belgium-based firm, active protection against incoming attacks, integrated UAVs, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and situational awareness technology. The Defense Acquisition Council approved the project worth Rs 16,000 crore in December 2022, and the DRDO will manufacture 59 of the 354 light tanks being procured.</description>

			<description>Australian stock exchange operator ASX has partnered with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to develop a new trading, clearing, and settlement system. The move comes after ASX abandoned a blockchain-based overhaul of its system last year. The new platform will be implemented in two main releases, with the clearing service delivered first and settlement and sub-register services in a second release. The estimated cost for the first release is between AUD 105 million ($68.33 million) and AUD 125 million. ASX's initial attempt to overhaul its system using blockchain technology drew criticism from regulators, prompting the exchange to seek an alternative solution. The estimated timeframe for implementation is 2026 for the first release and 2028 or 2029 for the second release.</description>

			<description>The article tells the story of a Sderot resident named Danny Eisenman who was helping tourists change a flat tire when he witnessed a terrorist attack. Shortly after he left, the terrorists shot at the tourists he had just helped, killing everyone except Eisenman and his dog. He and his family hid in a safe room for eight hours, armed only with a kitchen knife. Eisenman expresses disbelief at the international protests against Israel and warns that the danger will spread to Europe. He also describes the horrifying scenes he witnessed during the attack. The article mentions that 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. The exact number of casualties is still being determined.</description>

			<title>Asia off to slow start, lot of easing already priced in</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/asia-off-to-slow-start-lot-of-easing-already-priced-in/1851348/</link>
			<description>Asian shares started the week slowly as market valuations appear stretched due to anticipated global policy easing. The Black Friday sales will test the US consumer-driven economy, while the Thanksgiving holiday is expected to result in thin markets. Reports suggest a potential agreement between Israel, the US, and Hamas to release hostages in Gaza. MSCI's Asia-Pacific index rose slightly, Japan's Nikkei remained unchanged, and S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures dipped. Goldman Sachs analysts highlight the significant outperformance of mega-cap tech stocks but indicate that the risk/reward profile may not be compelling. Tech major Nvidia's quarterly results are highly anticipated for insight into AI product demand. The Federal Reserve's minutes from their previous meeting could shed light on policymakers' thinking. Markets have priced out the possibility of further rate hikes but imply a 30% chance of easing in March. Bond yields dropped, and the US dollar weakened against currencies, including the euro and yen. European manufacturing surveys and Sweden's central bank meeting will be closely watched. Oil prices rebounded amid speculation of extended OPEC+ production cuts, and gold prices dipped slightly.</description>

			<title>Oil extends gains as OPEC+ to mull deeper cuts</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/oil-extends-gains-as-opec-to-mull-deeper-cuts/1851346/</link>
			<description>Oil futures rose slightly on Monday as expectations grew that OPEC+ would deepen supply cuts to stabilize prices. Brent crude futures increased by 0.1% to $80.72 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 8 cents to $75.97 a barrel. The gains come after OPEC+ sources indicated that the group will consider additional supply cuts at its meeting on November 26. Oil prices have fallen nearly 20% since September, and prompt prices for Brent and WTI slipped into contango last week, indicating sufficient supply. Analysts suggest that deeper cuts should not be ruled out given the fall in speculative positioning and higher inventories.</description>

			<title>Taylor Swift fans gather for cooler Rio show after fan’s death</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/taylor-swift-fans-gather-for-cooler-rio-show-after-fans-death/1851342/</link>
			<description>Taylor Swift fans in Rio de Janeiro were disappointed when her Saturday performance was postponed due to record-breaking heat after a fan died from the sweltering conditions. However, the temperatures were lower on Sunday, and fans were hopeful that the show would go on as planned. The federal government ordered event organizer T4F to ensure water access at all of Swift's concerts in Brazil and to allow water bottles to be brought into all concerts. T4F announced an enhanced action plan for the event, including providing free water at queues and all stadium entrances and exits. The Saturday postponement angered many fans who had already made the journey to the stadium, but they were met with a positive response from Minalba Brasil, which distributed free water bottles in the stadium area on Sunday. Swift's Monday performance in Rio will replace the postponed show, and she is still scheduled to perform in Sao Paulo from November 24 to 26.</description>

			<title>Israel says soldier executed, foreign hostages held at Gaza’s Shifa hospital</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israel-says-soldier-executed-foreign-hostages-held-at-gazas-shifa-hospital/1851340/</link>
			<description>Israel has accused Hamas of committing abuses at the al Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip. They claim that a captive soldier was executed and that two foreign hostages are being held at the hospital. Al Shifa hospital has been evacuating patients and staff since Israeli troops entered last week. Israel is also searching for 240 people that Hamas kidnapped to Gaza. The Israeli military stated that a forensic examination found that a 19-year-old Israeli conscript, Noa Marciano, had sustained non-life-threatening injuries from an Israeli airstrike, contradicting Hamas' claim that she died in an Israeli airstrike. Israel alleges that Noa was taken by Hamas terrorists and murdered at the Shifa hospital. The Israeli military also published a video of a tunnel that Hamas allegedly dug underneath the Shifa compound. Hamas has denied that tunnels are located in civilian infrastructure. The Gaza health ministry director dismissed the Israeli statement on the tunnel as a lie.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/brazils-lula-wishes-luck-and-success-to-new-argentine-president/1851338/</link>
			<description>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva sent his well wishes to the newly elected government in Argentina, without mentioning President-elect Javier Milei, who has previously criticized Lula and called him an "angry communist." Lula expressed his hope for success and good luck to the new government, stating that Argentina is a great country deserving of respect. He emphasized the importance of democracy and congratulated the institutions and people of Argentina for their orderly and peaceful electoral process. Earlier, Lula had stated that Argentina should elect a president who supports democracy and the Mercosur trading bloc. Milei, a far-right economist and Lula's rival, has questioned the future of Argentina's relations with Brazil and criticized Lula and Mercosur, pledging that Argentina would forge its own path. Economy Minister Sergio Massa, who is competing against Milei, had better relations with the Lula government. Despite Argentina's economic crisis, it remains Brazil's primary market for manufactured goods.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/bayer-cancels-asundexian-phase-iii-study-program/1851334/</link>
			<description>German pharmaceutical company Bayer has announced the cancellation of a phase III study program evaluating the effectiveness and safety of asundexian, an oral Factor XIa inhibitor. The decision to stop the study was made following the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), which found that asundexian demonstrated inferior efficacy compared to the control arm of the study. Specifically, the phase III study investigating asundexian in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke will be halted prematurely. Bayer initiated this study in August 2022 and plans to analyze the data further to gain a better understanding of the findings and determine appropriate measures. In addition, Bayer had recently mentioned considering the separation of its non-prescription medicines or agriculture business from the rest of the group, which includes the pharmaceutical division.</description>

The meeting was seen as an important step in maintaining peace and keeping sea lanes and airways open over the South China Sea. Marcos expressed concern over incidents between Chinese and Philippine vessels and requested a return to the previous situation where both Chinese and Filipino fishermen could fish together in the waters. Filipino fishermen have complained about Chinese ships preventing them from fishing in parts of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. Marcos emphasized that geopolitical problems should not define the relationship between China and the Philippines. Since taking office in 2022, Marcos has pursued warmer ties with the United States, which drew criticism from Beijing. Tensions in the region have increased, particularly due to China's construction of man-made islands with military installations. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, disregarding a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. There has been no immediate response from China's embassy in Manila.</description>

			<description>The third round of United Nations negotiations for a treaty to control plastic pollution has received over 500 proposals from participants. Some see this as progress, while Greenpeace calls it "chaos". Negotiators have until the end of next year to reach a deal addressing the 400 million tonnes of plastic waste produced annually. The plastics industry and oil exporters advocate for promoting recycling and reusing, while environmental campaigners and certain governments believe in reducing production. Greenpeace emphasizes that the United States and the European Union should show greater leadership. The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) believes that the proposals reflect the robustness of the talks. Canada, Kenya, and the European Union support limiting plastic production, while a coalition of Russia and Saudi Arabia emphasizes recycling. Only less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled, and at least 14 million tonnes end up in the ocean each year. Two more rounds of negotiations will occur next year to finalize the deal.</description>

			<description>Hamas militants in Gaza engaged in a battle with Israeli forces attempting to enter the largest refugee camp on Sunday. Israeli air strikes in the south of Gaza resulted in the deaths of many Palestinians. Reports suggest that there may be a potential deal between Israel and Hamas to release women and children held hostage in exchange for a temporary ceasefire. The hostage talks coincide with Israel's plans to expand its offensive against Hamas in southern Gaza. Hamas resistance remains strong in parts of the heavily populated north, including Jabalia refugee camp. The death toll from the ongoing conflict continues to rise, with both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians losing their lives. International calls for humanitarian pauses have been made, but the conflict shows no signs of abating. The World Health Organization described Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, as a "death zone" and preparations are being made to evacuate patients and staff.</description>

			<description>Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of being a caged parrot and practicing double standards in favor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Raut criticized the BJP for resorting to religious propaganda to bribe voters after losing ground in five states where assembly polls were being held. He referred to Union Home Minister Amit Shah's promise to organize government-organized tours to the Ram temple in Ayodhya if the BJP retains power as campaigning on religious lines. Raut argued that if a similar statement was made by a Congress leader, the ECI would have taken action. He criticized the ECI for not addressing this issue, stating that garnering votes by bribing the electorate is detrimental to democracy.

			<description>A pro-Palestine fan managed to breach security and enter the field during the World Cup final cricket match between India and Australia in Ahmedabad. The man, identified as Wayne Johnson, an Australian of Chinese-Filipino origin, attempted to hug Indian cricketer Virat Kohli before being apprehended by security personnel. Johnson was taken to the police station, but it is unclear what action will be taken against him. He was wearing a face mask with a design of the Palestine flag and a t-shirt with slogans advocating to stop bombing and save Palestine. The ICC and India do not permit political slogans at cricket events. The incident comes amid ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.</description>

The petitioner claims that SEBI failed to comply with the court's direction to submit the final conclusion/report. The application also refers to a report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) regarding the Adani Group's alleged investments through "opaque" Mauritius funds. The focus of the plea is on strengthening the regulatory system to protect investors and their investments in the share market. The petitioner argues that SEBI's objection to a necessary timeline for the investigation goes against the need for an efficient regulatory mechanism. Delays in investigations can lead to the disappearance of evidence and reduce investor confidence. The expert committee appointed by the court is still working on the matter, and the application calls for an independent body to investigate the new disclosures. The court had granted time until August 14 for SEBI's probe and emphasized the need for expeditious completion. SEBI has completed its investigation in most matters but is awaiting information from tax havens. The regulator will take appropriate action based on the investigation's outcome. An interim report by the expert committee found no evident pattern of manipulation but highlighted regulatory constraints. The Adani Group stocks faced allegations of fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, which the group denies.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, along with two union ministers and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, expressed their praise for India reportedly crossing the USD 4 trillion mark in GDP. However, there has been no official confirmation of this milestone achievement. The finance ministry and national statistical office have not commented on the viral social media post. Sources close to the matter claim that the news is incorrect and India has not yet reached this landmark. The viral news originated from an unverified screengrab based on IMF data, which is challenging to track in real-time for all countries. Despite the lack of official confirmation, several political leaders, including Fadnavis, hailed the achievement and attributed it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the implementation of reforms. In the April-June quarter of 2023-24, India recorded GDP growth of 7.8%, making it the world's fastest-growing major economy.</description>

			<description>The High Court of Karnataka has ordered the Deputy Commissioner of Mandya to take action against unauthorized constructions around the Saumyakeshava temple in Nagamangala. The court directed the Deputy Commissioner to issue a show-cause notice in newspapers within two weeks and remove the illegal encroachments within four weeks. A total of 1,566 constructions were found near the archaeological site, and it will now be determined which ones are illegal. A public interest litigation was filed in 2015, alleging that a Jama Masjid was built within 120 meters of the protected temple, in violation of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act. Despite previous notices from the Archaeological Survey of India, the construction continued without proper approvals.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in India plans to expand the scope of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM) to include more occupational groups among the urban poor. Targeted groups may include domestic workers, rickshaw drivers, waste pickers, gardeners, and construction workers. The DAY-NULM, launched in 2013, aims to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting self-help groups, skill development, self-employment training, and homeless shelters. The ministry is considering a shift towards entrepreneurship development, market linkages, standardizing norms for identifying the urban poor, and providing social benefits to all NULM beneficiaries. This move follows the success of the PM Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme, which provided loans to street vendors affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although nearly 8.7 lakh self-help groups have been formed under DAY-NULM, experts suggest targeting a wider range of occupational groups and adopting income-generating schemes to address the challenges faced by the urban poor. Creating self-help groups in urban areas is more challenging due to the transient nature of migrant workers. The ministry is planning to focus on entrepreneurship development in the next phase of the mission, aiming to empower individuals with business knowledge and assistance.</description>

			<description>The air quality in Delhi has shown improvement in the past two days, according to Environment Minister Gopal Rai. However, he urges people to remain vigilant and adhere to pollution control measures. The progress made before Diwali was compromised by people bursting firecrackers. The improvement in air quality is attributed to favorable atmospheric conditions. The city's Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 290, indicating a 'poor' level of air quality. The Centre has lifted certain restrictions due to the decline in air pollution levels. However, other restrictions, including a ban on non-essential construction and certain vehicles, will continue. The air quality predictions for the upcoming days suggest no significant deterioration.</description>

The government is considering offering customs duty reductions for electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its efforts to attract Tesla. Previously, India had high import duties on cars, but now it aims to adopt a model similar to Apple's. However, some manufacturers are concerned about the government's plans, arguing that any duty reduction should be limited to components and for a specific time frame. Despite the potential benefits for EV adoption in India, there are doubts about whether Tesla's dealership-free model will resonate with Indian consumers. Other carmakers are also catching up with Tesla, and a duty reduction on electric cars would benefit not only Tesla but also BMW and other German carmakers.</description>

			<description>The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) chief, Vikas Kumar, has urged people to avoid engaging in objectionable activities after several controversial videos went viral on social media. These videos depict individuals dancing and couples being intimate inside metro trains and stations. Kumar stated that surprise checks are being conducted by designated squads to curb such incidents. He emphasized the need for citizens to report any such activities to authorities since security personnel cannot be present everywhere. While the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) guards the metro premises, DMRC squad members also monitor for violations such as men entering women's coaches. Kumar reassured that the DMRC is actively working to prevent such incidents, although the circulation of these videos has occasionally brought unwarranted criticism to the otherwise reputable Delhi Metro brand. The DMRC has been raising awareness about this issue through social media campaigns and posters displayed at metro stations.</description>

			<title>Driven out of Pakistan, Afghans to lose their homes, and businesses yet again</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/driven-out-of-pakistan-afghans-to-lose-their-homes-and-businesses-yet-again/1850635/</link>
			<description>Thousands of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being forced to leave the country, facing the loss of their businesses, assets, and savings. The Pakistani government claims it needs to protect its state and accuses many Afghans of involvement in criminal and terrorist activities. Despite possessing valid papers, even those with documentation are planned to be sent back after December 31. The situation has led to uncertainty and despair among the Afghan community in Pakistan. The returnees face challenges in transferring their assets as the Pakistani government has imposed restrictions on cash and property transfers to Afghanistan. Many Afghans are selling their possessions and properties at reduced rates, while some attempt to bribe officials or use illegal channels to send money to their homeland or relatives abroad. The issue has sparked discussions between Afghan and Pakistani officials. Both documented and undocumented refugees are struggling to recover their debts and assets. The Pakistani government maintains that all illegal immigrants must leave, with no legal cover for their businesses, assets, or properties.</description>

			<description>The inaugural "Khadijah Al-Kubra" national and international exhibition for women in Kabul, Afghanistan, aimed at empowering entrepreneurial women, is facing obstacles and low turnout due to economic hardships. Limited attendance by women only hinders sales, with some participants considering closing booths due to the lack of visitors. The exhibition, organized by the Taliban administration's Ministry of Industry and Commerce in collaboration with the Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industries, aims to support children and mothers in Kabul. However, economic difficulties and Taliban-imposed restrictions limit women's participation. The World Bank has previously reported a decline in women's role in trade in Afghanistan due to changes in systems and restrictions on women's work and education.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-stands-firm-against-ceasefire-condemns-west-bank-violence-in-op-ed/1850559/</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden has dismissed calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, stating that it will not bring about peace. In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, Biden argued that as long as Hamas continues its destructive ideology, a ceasefire is not a solution. He called for Israel to respect humanitarian law and minimize civilian casualties, advising against being misled by hurt and rage. Biden reiterated his support for a two-state solution and suggested governance under the Palestinian Authority while working towards that goal. He also condemned extremist violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and warned that the US is prepared to issue visa bans against the perpetrators. The article also mentions concerns about Israel violating the visa waiver program, and the Biden administration's proposed package for security assistance for conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. Biden ended by denouncing increasing antisemitism and islamophobia related to the conflict between Israel and Hamas.</description>

			<description>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing pressure to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. Families and supporters of the hostages marched from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, demanding action from the government. Public opinion is turning against Netanyahu, with polls indicating a decline in support for him and his coalition. Opposition leader Yair Lapid has called for Netanyahu's resignation due to a loss of public trust. Negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release face challenges due to contentious issues, and the Israeli government's attempts to ease conditions in Gaza have drawn criticism from within Netanyahu's coalition. Families blame Netanyahu for failing to anticipate an attack by Hamas and prioritize judicial reform over security preparations. Criticism of Netanyahu's lack of empathy and failure to take responsibility for security lapses has also grown. Many hope for a new government once the war concludes and the hostages are returned.</description>

They warn that these restrictions can lead to sexual harassment and crimes against humanity. The recent detention of Parisa Azadeh, a women's rights activist, has raised deep concern, with several activists claiming that the Taliban administration is marginalizing women in the country. The human rights organization emphasizes that the persistent restrictions and unlawful suppression of Afghan girls and women could result in crimes against humanity and sexual harassment. Afghanistan's representative at the United Nations, Nasir Ahmad Faiq, believes that the detention of Parisa Azadeh goes against Islamic and international laws. Women's rights activists argue that the Taliban administration has been suppressing women's protests to instill fear and marginalize them. Several women's rights activists, including Nida Parwani, Julia Parsi, and Manizha Seddiqi, have been detained under the Taliban government's control for over a month. Over the past two years, the Taliban has issued more than 50 restrictive orders on the lives of Afghan women and girls, leading human rights activists to see it as a form of gender apartheid.</description>

			<description>Max Verstappen, the triple Formula One world champion, expressed his disappointment with the lack of passionate and knowledgeable motor racing fans in Las Vegas. Verstappen believes that the fans in Las Vegas are more interested in partying and entertainment rather than understanding the sport. He emphasized the importance of making fans understand the sport and what is at stake for the drivers. Verstappen prefers traditional tracks like Spa and Monza, where there is more emotion and passion among the fans. He expressed his love for Las Vegas as a city but feels that the emotion and passion for racing are lacking there compared to old-school tracks. Verstappen's comments highlight the difference between a serious sport like Formula One and the entertainment-focused atmosphere of Las Vegas.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/favouritism-allegations-mischievous-ploy-sections-attempting-to-delay-dharavi-project-drp/1850112/</link>
			<description>The Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), led by the Adani Group, has denied allegations of favoritism. The project, which involves the Maharashtra government as a stakeholder, claims that "vested interests" are attempting to derail or delay it. The Opposition Congress has accused the BJP government of benefiting the Adani Group by relaxing norms for the project. The DRP statement refutes these allegations and states that the changes made in the project's rules were in accordance with government resolutions. It also clarifies that the policy changes do not solely benefit a single entity and highlights the government's efforts to regulate the pricing and usage of Transferable Development Rights (TDR). The DRP dismisses the allegations of favoritism as baseless and malicious, emphasizing its commitment to urban management transformation.</description>

			<title>Analysis-In Mexico, gender balance push puts political parties in unfamiliar bind</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-in-mexico-gender-balance-push-puts-political-parties-in-unfamiliar-bind/1850111/</link>
			<description>Mexico's gender parity rules are starting to reshape the country's political landscape. The National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) recently selected Clara Brugada as its Mexico City mayoral candidate, bypassing the male frontrunner Omar Garcia Harfuch to meet new gender parity requirements. The move highlights the challenges faced in implementing equal candidacies for women in top political positions in Mexico. Efforts to circumvent the rules have led to controversies such as disqualifying men who falsely claimed to be transgender women. However, gender quotas have resulted in significant advancements for women, including a 50-50 split in Congress and an increase in women governors. Mexico's push for gender parity is likely to lead to its first woman president next year. While parity is crucial, critics argue that having capable leaders is equally important for effective governance.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The Cepernic family, descendants of a sheep-farm owner in Patagonia, Argentina, have been longtime supporters of the Peronist political movement. However, their support for the movement has waned over time, highlighting a potential warning sign for the upcoming presidential election. While some members of the family still plan to vote for the Peronists, others will cast blank votes. The Peronist movement, which has ruled Argentina for a significant portion of its history, is facing strong competition from a radical libertarian candidate, Javier Milei. The country is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis, with high inflation, poverty, and an impending recession. Many blame the Peronists for these issues, leading even traditional supporters to become apathetic. The Cepernic family's declining political fervor reflects a broader trend of resignation and disillusionment among the Argentine population. Despite their historical ties to Peronism, they feel that the movement no longer represents their aspirations.</description>

			<title>India-made loitering munitions to swarm drones, Army showcases new hi-tech offensive capability</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/india-made-loitering-munitions-to-swarm-drones-army-showcases-new-hi-tech-offensive-capability/1849845/</link>
			<description>The Indian Army has introduced several new weapons into its arsenal, including indigenously-made loitering munitions, swarm drones, and armoured personnel carriers. These weapons were showcased during a validation exercise of the army strike corps in the desert and were reviewed by Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Pande. The army has been focusing on the induction of drones as part of its force modernization efforts, and it has recently received its first swarm unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. These drones, supplied by a Bengaluru-based start-up, have the capability to hit targets at least 50 kms away in enemy territory. The army has also acquired indigenously-made loitering munitions, which are aerial weapon systems that loiter around a target area until the actual target is located. These new inductions are part of emergency procurements made by the army and amount to a total of Rs 18 crore. The army showcased the Nagastra-1 loitering munitions during the 37th Infantry Commanders' Conference, and it recently signed a contract to purchase over 450 completely indigenous Nagastra-1 loitering munitions. The Nagastra-i is a man-portable autonomous loitering munition or drone that can hover, locate, acquire, and strike with high precision. It carries a high explosive warhead for soft-skin targets or an anti-armour warhead for combat vehicles. The army also displayed the Kalyani M4 vehicles, which are mine-protected, high-mobility, armoured personnel carriers.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！According to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in Diabetes Care, chronic sleep deprivation can increase insulin resistance in otherwise healthy women, with postmenopausal women experiencing more severe effects. The study highlights the importance of getting enough sleep in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that sleep restriction can elevate the risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and disordered glucose metabolism. The current study focused on women and found that a prolonged, mild restriction of sleep increased women's blood glucose and insulin levels. Insulin resistance rose by 14.8% among both pre- and postmenopausal women, with more severe effects for postmenopausal women. The researchers also found that changes in body weight did not explain the changes in insulin and glucose levels. Further studies are planned to understand how sleep deficiency affects metabolism in both men and women and explore sleep interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention efforts.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！According to an article by Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), the Global Listed Infrastructure (GLI) sector remains resilient in the face of short-term challenges and shows a promising long-term outlook. Although GLI experienced underperformance in 2023 compared to global equity markets, it still demonstrates solid fundamentals across various infrastructure sectors. The four major industry categories within GLI—Utilities, Energy Infrastructure, Communications, and Transportation—show positive trends in terms of revenue and profitability. The Communications sector, specifically the US wireless tower subsector, faces some challenges with stagnant cash flow growth in 2023. However, European tower operators and global data center companies enjoy strong fundamental trends. Despite current valuations being at odds with the fundamental backdrop, GLI companies are well-positioned to maintain margins. The defensive sectors of Utilities and Communications offer attractive valuations, and regulatory constructs help infrastructure companies navigate higher interest costs effectively. GLI has historically outperformed global equities during economic downturns, and certain sectors within GLI, such as freight rail and energy infrastructure, are poised for a positive recovery in the event of a modest economic downturn. As the global economy potentially re-accelerates in 2024, GLI is expected to benefit. Growth areas in infrastructure, such as the energy transition and renewables, have not been fully rewarded in 2023, but a more stable economic and financing environment is likely to create opportunities and potentially lead to a re-rating of companies involved in these themes. In the long term, GLI demonstrates its strength with low earnings volatility, stable cash flows, a higher relative income component compared to global equities, and attractive returns. Overall, the MSIM Global Listed Infrastructure Team highlights the resilience of GLI and its potential as a lucrative investment option in the evolving financial landscape.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/silkyara-tunnel-collapse-rescue-operation-on-hold-after-machine-snag/1849813/</link>
			<description>The operation to rescue 40 labourers trapped in the partially-collapsed Silkyara tunnel in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand has been suspended due to a technical issue with the drilling machine. Another drilling machine has been airlifted from Indore and is being transported to the site for assembly and deployment. The current machine had drilled 24 meters through the rubble before the operation was halted. A loud cracking sound was heard during the positioning of the fifth pipe, causing panic and leading to the suspension of the rescue operation. An expert warned of the possibility of further collapse. PMO Deputy Secretary Mangesh Ghildiyal will visit the site for a review. The tunnel is a central government project under the National Highways &amp; Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited.</description>

			<title>Plants are likely to absorb more CO₂ in a changing climate than we thought – here’s why</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/plants-are-likely-to-absorb-more-co%e2%82%82-in-a-changing-climate-than-we-thought-heres-why/1849811/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that the study published in Science Advances suggests that plants might take up more carbon dioxide (CO₂) than previously thought under advanced climate change. The climate modeling used in the study predicted that plants could potentially take up up to 20% more CO₂ than simpler models. This highlights the resilience of plants and emphasizes the importance of planting trees and preserving existing vegetation to mitigate climate change. However, it's important to note that while plants can absorb CO₂, it is still crucial for us humans to reduce fossil fuel emissions to effectively combat climate change.</description>

			<description>The recent airstrike by the Myanmar army in the bordering areas of Myanmar has caused tension along the Indo-Myanmar border. However, there have been no reports of fresh violent incidents. Around 5,000 Myanmar nationals crossed over to the Zokhawthar area in Mizoram's Champhai district for shelter, but many have now returned to their country. Local residents describe the current situation as peaceful but unpredictable. Indian security personnel are monitoring the movements of citizens from both countries on the Tiau River bridge. The refugees in the Zokhawthar area are receiving support and assistance from the Mizoram government and local NGOs. They have access to healthcare, ration, and other amenities. The government has provided tents and shelter in community halls and schools. Among the refugees, there are women and children living in makeshift tents in the camps.</description>

The court expressed concern over the selective appointment of judges by the government and the pending transfer of judges between high courts. The court emphasized that once judges are appointed, their place of duty should not be a concern for the government. The court noted that several recommendations were pending with the government without any response. The appointment of judges through the collegium system has been a contentious issue between the Supreme Court and the Centre. The court is also hearing a petition seeking contempt action against the Union Ministry of Law and Justice for not adhering to the court's timeline for the appointment of judges.</description>

Ashoka, a seven-time legislator and former deputy chief minister of Karnataka, has been announced as the new leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the state. This comes six months after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost power in the assembly elections. Ashoka, a 66-year-old legislator from Bengaluru, was unanimously elected as LoP, marking the return of B.S. Yediyurappa to party leadership. There were other contenders for the position, but they made way for Ashoka. Ashoka belongs to the Vokkaliga caste group, whose support the BJP is actively seeking ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. However, the elevation of Ashoka comes amidst dissent within the BJP, with Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, a BJP legislator, criticizing the party for neglecting northern Karnataka. Yatnal, who was also in the race for LoP, voiced his opposition to Yediyurappa and his family. Despite the internal divisions, Yediyurappa stated that there was no dissent within the party. Another party leader, Arvind Bellad, accepted the decision, acknowledging the pain felt in North Karnataka. The BJP aims to secure votes from specific communities in the deeply caste-based society of Karnataka, including Lingayats and Vokkaligas, as it looks ahead to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.</description>

			<description>Hmm, Lahore in Pakistan has topped the global pollution ranking with an unhealthy air quality level throughout the day. The city is facing a smog crisis caused by vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, and crop burning. The air quality index (AQI) in Lahore was recorded as "hazardous" at 470, making it the worst in the world. Delhi and Karachi followed with AQI levels of 302 and 204, respectively. The smog has led to respiratory problems, eye infections, and skin diseases among the residents. Flight operations have also been disrupted, and visibility has decreased. The Punjab caretaker government has taken measures to mitigate the smog, including the closure of educational institutions and offices. Lahore and Pakistan, in general, have been facing pollution issues, with Pakistan being the third-most polluted country in the world.</description>

			<description>Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), has warned political leaders against joining the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), stating that they will lose their political influence if they do. Speaking at a workers convention in Mardan, Bhutto-Zardari criticized the PML-N, referring to them as the "mehngai league." He emphasized that people no longer tolerate "selected rule" and urged political parties to focus on the needs of the people. Bhutto-Zardari highlighted the poor economic condition of Pakistan, including price hikes, poverty, and unemployment, and stated that the PPP is the only solution to these issues. He vowed to end the politics of hatred and division and put an emphasis on trusting the people and their politics. Bhutto-Zardari also mentioned the upcoming general election and expressed his belief that the electoral alliance between the PML-N and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) would benefit the PPP. The report also mentioned the ongoing tensions between the PPP and the PML-N since the completion of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)-led coalition government's term in August.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Japan is increasing surveillance of unlicensed taxis at Narita airport due to a rise in arrivals and demand for transportation. Transport ministry officials distributed fliers in English and Chinese to international visitors, warning them about the illegality and safety risks of unlicensed taxis. They advised passengers to check the color of vehicle license plates, as licensed taxis have green plates or plates with green frames, while unlicensed taxis have white plates. The fliers also highlighted that insurance coverage may not apply if passengers are injured while riding in an unauthorized taxi. Japan generally prohibits ride-hailing services like Uber, although apps can be used to call licensed cabs. There have been discussions within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party about opening up the market to address the shortage of taxi drivers, but the transport ministry remains cautious due to safety concerns.</description>

			<description>您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Israel has warned Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to move closer to humanitarian aid and out of harm's way, indicating a potential attack on Hamas in south Gaza. The relocation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Khan Younis and those who fled from Gaza City would exacerbate the already dire humanitarian crisis. Israel aims to annihilate Hamas after its incursion into Israel and subsequent assault on Gaza City, resulting in the death of over 12,000 people, including 5,000 children. Israel dropped leaflets urging evacuation from Khan Younis, suggesting an imminent military operation. However, moving westward could provide faster access to humanitarian aid near the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The war in Gaza shows no signs of abating despite international calls for ceasefires or humanitarian pauses. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks and increase aid in response to mounting pressure. Meanwhile, violence escalated in the West Bank, with at least five Palestinians killed in an Israeli strike. The article also mentions the discovery of a vehicle with weapons and a supposed Hamas tunnel shaft at Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, which has been repeatedly targeted by Israeli forces.</description>

			<description>Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin has moved a resolution in the state Assembly to reconsider 10 bills that were previously passed by the House and returned by State Governor R N Ravi. The Governor had not provided any reasons for returning the bills, simply stating "I withhold Assent" to them. The resolution states that if the bills are passed again and presented to the Governor, he cannot withhold assent under the proviso to Article 200 of the Constitution of India. The Chief Minister criticized the Governor, accusing him of blocking the government's initiatives and acting undemocratically. The Chief Minister also alleged that non-BJP ruled states were being targeted through Governors, possibly by the central government.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/apple-disney-ibm-announce-halting-ads-on-x-after-elon-musks-comments/1849771/</link>
			<description>Several major advertisers, including Disney, Lionsgate, Paramount Global, and Apple, have announced that they are cutting off their spending on microblogging site X. This decision comes after Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on social media. Musk agreed with a post that made derogatory remarks about Jewish people and supported the immigration of minorities. The White House condemned Musk's actions, calling it "unacceptable." X's CEO, Linda Yaccarino, stated that the company has been clear about its efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. Musk later clarified that accounts promoting extreme violence would be suspended. Advertisers have become concerned about X since Musk purchased the platform and expressed intentions to loosen content moderation rules. Many companies have been hesitant to have their ads appear alongside offensive or hateful speech. In April, Musk announced that most advertisers had returned to the platform, but ad revenue had decreased by 50%.</description>

			<description>Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stated that Japan will continue to urge China to lift its import ban on Japanese seafood in response to the release of treated radioactive water from a nuclear power plant. Kishida emphasized the need for a science-based judgment on the issue and called for a constructive approach based on scientific analysis and facts. He also mentioned that Japan and China have agreed to have expert consultations on the issue from a scientific standpoint. The water being released from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex is diluted to reduce tritium levels and has been deemed to have a negligible impact on people and the environment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The import ban remains an obstacle to improving relations between Japan and China.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The ongoing Gaza war is causing a crisis in agriculture in Israel, with farmers unable to plant crops due to the conflict. This has led to a shortage of produce, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and carrots. Many farms near the Gaza Strip and the Lebanese border have been devastated by Hamas terrorists, and the situation is further exacerbated by the return of Thai agricultural workers to their home country. To address the shortage of workers, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Employment Service have launched an initiative to pair unemployed Israelis with farms in need of extra hands. Salaries will be doubled in areas near the conflict zones.</description>

			<description>The United States has imposed new sanctions on the militia group Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS) and its secretary-general, Hashim Finyan Rahim al-Saraji, designating them as "specially designated global terrorists." The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned six individuals affiliated with the Iran-aligned militia group Kata'ib Hizballah (KH). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the KSS's terrorist activities have threatened the lives of US and global coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria. Blinken also noted that Iran has supported KSS, KH, and other Iran-aligned militia groups with training, funding, and sophisticated weapons. The investigation into the Hamas massacre at the Re'im music festival on October 7 has revised the death toll to 364, with 40 festival attendees being taken hostage in Gaza. The investigation suggests that Hamas was allegedly unaware of the music festival prior to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the IDF does not plan to keep soldiers inside Gaza after the war, and stressed the need for a civilian administration in Gaza committed to ending funding for terrorism. Israel will maintain overall military responsibility for Gaza but seeks a cultural change and rejects anyone who shares Hamas' goals.</description>

			<description>England secured a 2-0 home victory against Malta in a lacklustre performance that disappointed the Wembley Stadium crowd. The only goal until the 75th minute came from an own goal by Enrico Pepe. Captain Harry Kane later doubled England's lead. Despite the win, several fringe players failed to impress. The victory ensured England's top spot in Group C and moved them closer to a top seeding at Euro 2024. However, their performance was underwhelming, with Malta posing more attacking threats in the first half. England will face tougher tests in upcoming friendlies against Belgium and Brazil.</description>

			<title>Analysis-Indo-Pacific trade deal prospects dim as 2024 US election year politics loom</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-indo-pacific-trade-deal-prospects-dim-as-2024-us-election-year-politics-loom/1849643/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Biden administration's efforts to negotiate an ambitious Asia trade deal are facing challenges, according to trade experts and business groups. The administration aimed to complete key chapters of its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative trade "pillar" but encountered resistance from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, who were unwilling to commit to strong labor and environmental standards with binding enforcement provisions. Despite completing non-binding pillars on clean energy cooperation and anti-corruption measures, the lack of trade outcomes overshadowed these achievements. Some experts believe that election-year pressures make a deal unlikely, similar to the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2016. The administration had hoped to limit the scope of the IPEF trade pillar to avoid political blowback but faced skepticism from stakeholders due to its lack of ambition. Trade deals typically take a long time to negotiate, and the tight deadline ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit was seen as a constraint. Meanwhile, China expressed interest in aligning with Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) standards, signaling its desire to expand high-standard free trade areas.</description>

			<title>Israel renews call for Gazans to flee key southern city</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israel-renews-call-for-gazans-to-flee-key-southern-city/1849639/</link>
			<description>Israel has warned Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to relocate westward away from the line of fire and closer to humanitarian aid, indicating a potential attack on Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north. The Israeli government aims to protect civilians from being caught in the crossfire but such a move could worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the area. Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militant group controlling Gaza since their attack into Israel on October 7th that resulted in many deaths and hostages taken. The Israeli assault on Gaza City has left two-thirds of its population homeless, leading to fears of permanent displacement. Gaza health authorities report over 12,000 deaths, including 5,000 children, although these figures are not frequently updated due to data collection challenges. Despite international calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pauses, the conflict shows no signs of abating. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and increase aid as per the United Nations' requests amid concerns of starvation and disease. The Al Shifa hospital, a primary target in Israel's ground assault, is under scrutiny for alleged use by Hamas as a command headquarters, although hospital staff deny these claims. A premature baby and an elderly captive from Israel have died recently, further deepening the humanitarian crisis.</description>

			<title>Liberia President George Weah concedes election defeat to Joseph Boakai</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/liberia-president-george-weah-concedes-election-defeat-to-joseph-boakai/1849637/</link>
			<description>Liberia President George Weah has conceded defeat in the country's election to opposition leader Joseph Boakai. Boakai, a former vice president, secured 50.9% of the vote, while Weah received 49.1%. This marks a turnaround from the previous election in 2017, where Weah won by a large margin. Weah's concession ensures a smooth transition of power and Liberia's second democratic transfer in over seven decades. The country has been grappling with poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, and inadequate electricity supply. Many people have become disillusioned with Weah's lack of progress in addressing these issues. Boakai's supporters celebrated the victory in the capital, Monrovia, with dancing and honking car horns. Boakai emphasized a message of peace and reconciliation and his commitment to bring about positive changes in the country. Liberia is still recovering from two civil wars and a devastating Ebola epidemic.</description>

			<title>Israeli govt approves regular fuel deliveries to Gaza amid humanitarian concerns</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israeli-govt-approves-regular-fuel-deliveries-to-gaza-amid-humanitarian-concerns/1849635/</link>
			<description>Two fuel tankers carrying 60,000 liters of diesel fuel entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing after approval from Israel's war cabinet. The fuel is authorized for use by international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It will support desalination facilities providing water to the southern strip, with oversight led by the United States and Egypt. This decision allows two fuel tankers per day to enter Gaza, providing crucial support to the water and sewage systems that are on the verge of collapse due to a lack of electricity. Additionally, the fuel will be used for UN relief agency trucks, waste disposal, bakeries, hospitals in southern Gaza, and generators for cell phones and internet services. The decision was made in consultation with the Israel Defence Forces and Israel's International Security Academy to ensure it aligns with operational objectives and does not support Hamas. The rationale behind the decision is to prevent the spread of pandemics and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, there has been criticism within the Israeli government, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling for a reversal of the policy. Fuel shortages have worsened water and sewage issues in Gaza, affecting approximately 70% of the population. This move to allow fuel deliveries comes after pressure from the US.</description>

			<description>Five countries, South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros, and Djibouti, have jointly submitted a referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC), calling for an investigation into potential crimes in Palestinian territories. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan stated that a State Party can refer a situation to the ICC if crimes within its jurisdiction appear to have been committed. The ICC is already conducting an investigation into the situation in Palestinian territories, focusing on potential crimes since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. Israeli troops are prepared to advance wherever Hamas is found, and tensions continue to rise on the ground. Israeli leaders have asserted control over the northern part of Gaza, and there are indications of a possible ground offensive in the southern part. Israel's Defence Minister has declared that the ground operations will last for months and include both the north and south of Gaza.</description>

			<title>European Parliament reach provisional agreement on environmental crime law</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/european-parliament-reach-provisional-agreement-on-environmental-crime-law/1849625/</link>
			<description>The Council presidency and European Parliament negotiators have reached a provisional agreement on a proposed EU law that aims to enhance the investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes. This new directive replaces the outdated 2008 directive and establishes minimum rules for defining criminal offenses and sanctions in order to protect the environment more effectively. The directive provides a precise definition of environmental crime and introduces new types of offenses, while also harmonizing penalties for individuals and legal entities across all EU member states. The number of offenses under EU criminal law will be increased from nine to 18, including timber trafficking, illegal recycling of polluting ship components, and serious breaches of chemical legislation. Additionally, the agreement includes a provision for "qualified offenses" that cause significant and irreversible damage to ecosystems, natural habitats, or air, soil, and water quality. The agreement still requires confirmation by both institutions before proceeding with the formal adoption procedure.</description>

			<title>Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ousted by company board</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/sam-altman-ceo-of-chatgpt-maker-openai-ousted-by-company-board/1849623/</link>
			<description>Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of OpenAI, has unexpectedly left the company and resigned from its board. OpenAI revealed that the board no longer had confidence in Altman's leadership abilities due to his lack of candor in communications. Mira Murati, the chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO while a search is conducted for a permanent successor. Altman's departure is surprising given his role as a prominent figure in the AI industry. OpenAI, originally a nonprofit, transitioned to a for-profit structure after receiving a significant investment from Microsoft in 2019. The company has expanded and attracted executives from tech giants like Apple and Amazon. This shift suggests a departure from OpenAI's original nonprofit mission.</description>

			<description>Rescue workers in Uttarakhand have made progress in their efforts to free 40 workers trapped inside a collapsed tunnel. They have bored through 24 meters of rubble, less than half the distance needed to reach the trapped workers. A backup machine is being flown in from Indore to assist in the rescue operation. The machine currently in use, an American auger machine, has been working at a slower pace than expected. The trapped workers are being sent supplies through pipes and constant communication is maintained with them. The rescue operation involves inserting six-meter sections of steel pipes as the machine drills through the debris. The operation has been periodically paused to address technical issues and fumes created by the machine. While vertical drilling is being considered, the current method of horizontal drilling is considered the best option. Families of the trapped workers have been allowed to speak to them through a pipe. The operation involves 165 personnel from multiple agencies.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/who-warns-of-disease-outbreak-risk-among-returnees-from-pakistan/1849526/</link>
			<description>The World Health Organization (WHO) is requesting $10 million to provide essential healthcare services to 700,000 migrants and refugees who have entered Afghanistan from Pakistan. The sudden increase in the number of people has raised concerns about the spread of diseases, especially polio. The WHO has identified unfavorable health conditions in temporary camps for displaced migrants and refugees, including malnutrition, physical and mental stress, and inadequate access to clean water. Without timely assistance, there is a risk of increased mortality and the need for essential services among these individuals. The WHO plans to establish temporary quarantine centers and deploy healthcare teams at the main entry points in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan is determined to deport 1.7 million undocumented migrants.</description>

			<description>The NCP has accused the Maharashtra government of delaying the commissioning of the Navi Mumbai metro rail line for publicity purposes. The line, which runs between Belapur and Pendhar, was opened to the public without an official program on the direction of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. The NCP claims that the metro was ready for public use six months ago but was not inaugurated due to the government's inability to secure an appointment with the Prime Minister. The party criticized the government for prioritizing publicity over the convenience of the common people. The metro service will operate with a frequency of 15 minutes, and fares will range from Rs. 10 to Rs. 40 depending on the distance traveled. The route has 11 stations and a depot located at Taloja Panchanand.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/feature/danish-siddiquis-family-has-asked-reuters-this-for-2-years-who-sent-him-to-afghanistan/1849017/</link>
			<description>The family of photojournalist Danish Siddiqui, who was killed while covering the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in July 2021, is seeking answers from Reuters about the circumstances surrounding his death. They are questioning what kind of risk assessment was conducted by the news agency before sending him to cover the war. Despite reaching out to Reuters' offices in New York and the UK, the family claims that their efforts to obtain answers were stonewalled. Reuters has stated that it is conducting internal and external reviews of the events leading to Danish's death. The family has also filed a case against Reuters in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in London. Independent evidence suggests that Danish was detained and tortured before being killed, with his body later run over by a vehicle. Danish's family has moved the International Criminal Court (ICC) against the Taliban for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The family's hope now lies in the UK court case against Reuters.</description>

			<title>Australian telco Optus tells lawmakers it had no plan to address total outage</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/australian-telco-optus-tells-lawmakers-it-had-no-plan-to-address-total-outage/1848369/</link>
			<description>Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, did not have a crisis plan in place when a nationwide network outage occurred, leaving half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours. The company's executive admitted that their defences had failed and they were not prepared for an outage of that scale. Optus had recently conducted scenario simulations, but they did not anticipate a nationwide shutdown because they had alternate connections built into their network. The outage highlighted concerns about the resilience of Australia's telecommunications networks, following a data breach at Optus last year. The government plans to introduce stricter cyber security reporting standards and mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks across all sectors. The outage was caused by a failure of the company's defensive filters, which led to data overload and the inability to send data on alternate routes. The outage lasted for 12 hours as Optus had to physically reboot their routers and core network devices. The CEO of Optus stated that the company followed up on all incidents, but 228 calls to the emergency hotline failed to connect during the outage. The company also discussed their reliance on third-party contractors and the need to evaluate the appropriate level of outsourcing. Singtel, the parent company of Optus, stated that the software upgrade was not the direct cause of the outage.</description>

The Washington Post highlighted the importance of dialogue and regular communication between the two countries, emphasizing that robust engagement is preferable to disengagement or confrontation. President Biden emphasized the importance of a stable relationship between the world's two largest economies, stating that the US is diversifying its economic relationship with China rather than decoupling.</description>

			<title>Asia stocks sit on weekly gains as yields, oil fall</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/asia-stocks-sit-on-weekly-gains-as-yields-oil-fall/1848366/</link>
			<description>Asian shares took a pause on Friday, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan easing from a two-month high but still up for the week. The slump in oil prices and softer U.S. economic data weighed on Wall Street, while boosting bonds and impacting the inflation outlook. The sell-off in oil was likely driven by algorithmic and trend-following funds, causing prices to slide to four-month lows. Walmart's announcement of planned price cuts for the holiday season also added to disinflationary concerns. In Japan, the Nikkei added 0.1%, supported by the Bank of Japan's commitment to its loose policy. Chinese blue chips were lower, as Alibaba Group's Hong Kong shares slumped after it abandoned its cloud business spin-off plans. Bond markets reacted positively to the U.S. inflation report, with future expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve increasing. Treasury yields fell, resulting in a weaker dollar and boosting gold prices.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-iran-enriches-more-uranium-as-gaza-war-rages-us-vote-looms/1848363/</link>
			<description>Efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear program are facing significant challenges, leaving the United States and its allies with limited options. Talks to revive a nuclear deal have stalled, and tougher actions against Iran risk escalating tensions in an already volatile region. Despite Iran's consistent denial of seeking nuclear weapons, confidential reports indicate that the country now possesses enough uranium enriched up to 60% purity to make three bombs. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election further restricting Washington's flexibility, President Joe Biden cannot currently consider a more informal "understanding" with Iran. Iran's stonewalling of the International Atomic Energy Agency has hindered monitoring efforts, and an accommodation with Iran on the nuclear issue is politically unfeasible at this time. Western powers are now likely to focus on a non-binding statement rather than a resolution to avoid pushing Iran to further nuclear escalation. In the coming months, efforts will be made to strengthen oversight of Iran's nuclear program, although it remains uncertain whether Iran will ultimately become a nuclear state.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/as-gaza-weeps-kolkata-sleeps-what-happened-to-the-city-of-protests/1847724/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the decline of protests and civil society action in Kolkata, India. The author reminisces about the city's history of vibrant protests and processions that brought about significant change, but laments that the current protests are often driven by self-interest rather than noble causes. The author questions why there has been little agitation from students, intellectuals, and the general public in Kolkata regarding recent events such as the Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza. The article highlights the contrast between the current state of Kolkata and its past as a city known for rebellion and activism. It also mentions specific incidents, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi having to be airlifted during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests and the cancellation of a political play called Barricade. The author expresses concern that Kolkata may have lost its conscience and calls for a revival of protest culture in the city.</description>

			<title>India among 10 countries with most infants who missed 1st measles shot — report by WHO &amp; US CDC</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/india-among-10-countries-with-most-infants-who-missed-1st-measles-shot-report-by-who-us-cdc/1847731/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that approximately 11 lakh children in India did not receive the first measles vaccination in 2022, placing the country among the top 10 countries with the highest number of infants missing this crucial shot. This comes after several districts in five Indian states reported measles outbreaks last year. Measles is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects young children, and it can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and brain inflammation. The mortality rate for measles is typically 1-3%, but it can be higher during outbreaks. The report also highlights an increase in reported measles cases and deaths globally in 2022 compared to the previous year. The vaccination coverage for measles in low-income countries remains below the recommended 95% coverage with two doses. India had initially set 2015 as the target for eliminating measles and rubella, but the target has been pushed to the end of this year.</description>

			<description>The International Campaign for Tibet has expressed concern that the issue of Tibet was not discussed during the meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. They have urged President Biden to press Beijing to engage in direct dialogue with representatives of the Tibetan people. The organization believes that Tibetans, Uyghurs, and other groups have been denied the freedom to voice their grievances and seek redress from the Chinese government. The Biden administration has an opportunity to push for their voices to be heard. The White House, however, stated that Biden did raise concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong during the meeting. Biden also emphasized the importance of peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences and expressed concerns about China's unfair trade policies.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, criticized Israel's invasion of Gaza, stating that it has destroyed decades of work towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has set the region on fire. Safadi believes Israel's actions do not provide security and instead kill innocent Palestinians. He stated that Israel's war against Hamas has pushed regional relations back by more than 30 years. The discussions between Jordan and Israel regarding exchanging solar power for energy have halted due to the ongoing ground offensive in Gaza. Safadi dismissed Israel's claim that Hamas had a command node under the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City as "ridiculous" and an "insult to intelligence." He also disputed Israel's self-defense claim, describing their actions as raw vengeance. The US expressed concern for Jordanian medics who were injured in shelling near their field hospital in Gaza.</description>

			<title>The Democracy Forum holds webinar on ‘Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh – the subcontinental Brotherhood?’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/the-democracy-forum-holds-webinar-on-jamaat-e-islami-bangladesh-the-subcontinental-brotherhood/1848070/</link>
			<description>The Democracy Forum (TDF) recently organized a webinar titled 'Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh - the subcontinental Brotherhood?' to discuss the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and its potential impact on the country's democratic process. The webinar examined the circumstances surrounding the re-emergence of Jamaat-e-Islami as a democratic movement after a decade of political isolation.

Lord Bruce, the TDF President, highlighted the history of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was established in 1941 with the aim of incorporating Islamic ideology into all aspects of state governance. Although Jamaat-e-Islami is considered Bangladesh's most populous and well-organized political movement, it has not been close to exercising power since 2006 due to evidence of violence and intimidation linked to the party. For the past 15 years, Jamaat has been proscribed as a political actor.

During the webinar, various speakers shared their perspectives on Jamaat-e-Islami. Professor Shafi Mostofa discussed Jamaat's history, agenda, and its controversial role in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. Mohammed Sinan Siyech examined Jamaat's transnational connections and organizational structure, while Maidul Islam assessed the party's influence in contemporary Bangladeshi politics and the challenges it faces.

There appears to be a tactical shift within Jamaat's leadership as they consider changing their position from the time of the Bangladesh Liberation War. However, some argue that fundamental positions have not changed despite a softer rhetoric. Dr. Md Nazrul Islam explored the theme of Jamaat and democracy, suggesting that political Islam and democracy are not necessarily incompatible and that Jamaat has shown support for constitutionalism and electoral politics.

Overall, the webinar provided a platform for discussing Jamaat-e-Islami's role in Bangladesh's political landscape and its potential impact on democracy.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-pledges-strong-partnership-with-india-says-us-committed-to-strengthen-semiconductor-supply-chain/1848065/</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden has reiterated the country's commitment to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain, with a focus on collaborative efforts with key nations including India. Biden emphasized the importance of working together with India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore to strengthen the critical semiconductor industry. The launch of new initiatives aimed at shaping technologies and standards in the semiconductor sector reflects a shared commitment to addressing the challenges of the evolving technological landscape and fostering innovation in a collaborative manner. India, specifically mentioned by President Biden, is set to play a pivotal role in this global initiative. The strengthened partnership between the US and India in the semiconductor domain signifies both countries' commitment to technological advancement and underscores the strategic importance of India as a key player in the global technology landscape. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the semiconductor supply chain and innovation partnership was signed between India and the US in March of this year, aiming to establish a collaborative mechanism between the two governments. The MOU seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of both countries, facilitate commercial opportunities, and develop semiconductor innovation ecosystems. The bilateral trade relationship between India and the US has seen robust growth, and the US is one of the top sources of foreign direct investment for India. The APEC leadership summit meeting, hosted by the US and chaired by President Biden, is taking place in San Francisco. India, while being a major economy, is not a part of APEC.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Rory McIlroy, the former world number one golfer, encountered an unusual situation during the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. His tee shot on the 13th hole landed on a woman's lap, leading to a light-hearted moment on the course. McIlroy pretended to take his next shot from her lap before calling for a referee. The referee jokingly told the woman to pass the ball back to McIlroy, and she did so before moving aside. McIlroy was then able to continue playing, ultimately making a bogey. In another unusual occurrence, McIlroy and another player both hit the wooden bridge on the 18th hole. Nicolai Hojgaard, Julien Guerrier, and Matthieu Pavon tied for the lead with a score of five-under par.</description>

			<title>Researchers develop ultrasound patch to measure how full bladder is</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/researchers-develop-ultrasound-patch-to-measure-how-full-bladder-is/1847975/</link>
			<description>Researchers at MIT have developed a wearable patch that uses ultrasound technology to monitor organs within the body. The patch, made of silicone rubber and embedded with ultrasound arrays, can accurately photograph and assess bladder fullness without the need for an operator or gel application. This innovation could greatly benefit individuals with bladder or kidney diseases by enabling easier monitoring of organ functionality. The researchers believe this technology has the potential to be used for other deep tissue organs, aiding in the early detection of conditions like ovarian cancer. The patch is easy to attach and detach from the skin and produces images comparable to traditional ultrasound probes. The team aims to create a portable device for viewing the images, potentially bridging the gap between clinicians and patients. Further developments are expected to expand the use of ultrasound devices for imaging various organs in the body.</description>

			<title>Pancreatic cancer discovery opens door for new clinical trial: Research</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/pancreatic-cancer-discovery-opens-door-for-new-clinical-trial-research/1847968/</link>
			<description>Researchers at the University of Rochester's Wilmot Cancer Institute have made a significant advance in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. They have discovered the genetic changes that occur during tumor migration and identified a medication, known as np137, that may block the process. The next step is a clinical trial planned for early 2024 at the University of Rochester to test the drug's safety and effectiveness on pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to the liver. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and has a low survival rate, with the number of cases predicted to rise. The researchers focused on understanding the biology of metastatic pancreatic cancer since the cancer spreads early during its development and the cells become genetically reprogrammed as they migrate to the liver, making them resistant to standard treatment. The trial will likely involve eligible patients taking np137 before surgery, undergoing surgery to remove the cancer, and then continuing with the medication and chemotherapy afterwards. The study was funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.</description>

			<title>Researchers find how hunger hormones impact decision-making brain area to drive behavior</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/researchers-find-how-hunger-hormones-impact-decision-making-brain-area-to-drive-behavior/1847958/</link>
			<description>A recent study conducted by researchers at UCL (University College London) has found that a hunger hormone produced in the gut can directly influence the decision-making area of the brain, known as the hippocampus. The study, which was conducted on mice, is the first to demonstrate how hunger hormones can impact brain activity when an animal is thinking about food. The researchers discovered that the ventral hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in decision-making, is sensitive to the levels of hunger hormones in the gut. When the mice were hungry, there was less neural activity in this area, allowing them to eat. Conversely, when the mice were full, activating the ventral hippocampal neurons stopped them from eating. The researchers hope that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of eating disorders and other health outcomes related to diet. They also plan to investigate whether hunger can affect learning and memory.</description>

The attack on the US arm of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China disrupted trades and had an impact on the US treasuries market. Fitch does not expect the incident to immediately impact the viability rating of the parent bank or its issuer default rating, as it anticipates support from the Chinese sovereign. The US unit primarily offers global clearing, execution, and financing services to institutional clients.</description>

			<description>In an anti-infiltration operation in the Uri sector, security forces have killed key launch commander Bashir Ahmed Malik, dealing a major blow to terror infrastructure and sympathizers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Malik, who had been active for 30 years, was responsible for enabling the infiltration of terrorists and causing the deaths of Indian citizens. This joint operation, codenamed Op Kali, by the army and Jammu and Kashmir police has strengthened the line of control security grid. Two terrorists were neutralized, along with the recovery of weapons and other items. The operation was launched based on specific intelligence, and it was the second infiltration bid in the area within the last few days.

			<title>Dollar rises as data suggests more Fed patience on rate cuts</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-rises-as-data-suggests-more-fed-patience-on-rate-cuts/1847477/</link>
			<description>The US dollar gained some ground after a volatile two days of trading. The dollar index rose by 0.2% to 104.53 after a 1.51% drop on Wednesday, the largest in a year. The euro remained flat, while sterling dipped 0.2%. The dollar also weakened slightly against the yen. The currency was supported by better-than-expected retail sales and signs of cooling inflation, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts. Traders believe that rates will not rise, but the odds of a rate cut by March have fallen from 1-in-3 to less than 1-in-4. Analysts caution that market expectations of rate cuts in the past have often been reversed. Other currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, also weakened. Despite a strong rebound in Australian employment, traders focused on the increase in part-time jobs and a higher jobless rate.</description>

			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Dutch voters will be going to the polls on November 22 to choose a new government in a parliamentary election. The three major groupings competing for the next prime minister are the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the newly formed "New Social Contract" (NSC) Party, and the Labour and Green Left (PvdA/GL) parties running on a single ticket. The three candidates most likely to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte are Dilan Yesilgoz, leader of the conservative VVD party; Pieter Omtzigt, leader of the centre-right NSC party; and Frans Timmermans, leader of the combined Labour and Green Left ticket. Each candidate brings their own unique background and policy positions to the election.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/smog-towers-not-practical-solution-to-air-pollution-problem-delhi-pollution-control-body/1847472/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has reported to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that two experimental smog towers in the city have not been effective in reducing air pollution. The DPCC stated that the operation of these costly air purifiers lacks merit and suggested that the structures be repurposed as a museum for the dissemination of technical information on air pollution control. The report highlighted that the smog tower at Connaught Place, which has been operational for two years at a cost of Rs 25 crore, can only mitigate air pollution by up to 17% within a 100-meter radius. The DPCC argued that considering Delhi's large area, the city would require more than 47,000 such towers, making the cost and maintenance unjustified. The central government also expressed that smog towers are not a solution to the air pollution problem in Delhi-NCR and is against installing more of these air purifiers. The two smog towers were installed in 2021 following directions from the Supreme Court.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/without-rutte-dutch-election-centres-on-cost-of-living-climate-and-immigration/1847471/</link>
			<description>The upcoming Dutch election will not feature Prime Minister Mark Rutte's name on the ballot for the first time in a decade. Voters are primarily concerned with the economy, climate change, and reducing immigration. The election is seen as a test of whether voters are willing to continue funding expensive policies such as offshore wind farms. Despite positive statistics on unemployment, inflation, and national debt, there are underlying concerns about the economy and resentment towards Rutte. Prominent candidates include Rutte's protege, a reformist, and a traditional opponent on the left. Other important issues include plans to cut the number of livestock farms and the country's high electricity bills. The election outcome is expected to result in a new center-right coalition with no major policy shift.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Spain's lower house of parliament has voted to make Pedro Sanchez prime minister for another term, breaking the deadlock following the inconclusive general election in July. Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) reached separate deals with various regional parties to secure their support, including a controversial bill on amnesty for Catalan separatists, which has sparked protests across the country. The amnesty bill would exonerate politicians and activists involved in the Catalonia separation attempt in 2017. The vote saw 179 in favor and 171 against, with Sanchez's bid receiving support from various parties including leftist allies and pro-independence parties. However, the Conservative People's Party, far-right Vox, and People's Union of Navarre voted against Sanchez. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the People's Party, accused Sanchez of undermining the rule of law due to the amnesty bill and called for mass protests. The European Parliament has also approved a debate on whether the amnesty threatens judicial independence in Spain.</description>

			<description>Finland will close four of its nine border crossing points with Russia in an attempt to reduce the flow of asylum seekers to the country. The move comes after Finland's president suggested that the increase in asylum applicants arriving from Russia was in retaliation for the country's defense cooperation with the United States. The four crossings that will be closed are in the southeast of Finland, which are normally the busiest points of travel between the two countries. Asylum seekers will now only be allowed to hand in their applications at two northern border crossings. If the asylum arrivals end, Finland has said it will reverse the closures.</description>

			<description>India has called on Canada to respect the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations after reports of disturbances caused by Khalistani elements at an Indian High Commission consular camp in Canada. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, clarified that there were inaccurate social media reports regarding the incidents. Bagchi emphasized that consular camps are regularly organized by the Indian High Commission and consulates in Canada, and despite attempts by radical elements to cause trouble, the recent camp near Vancouver was held successfully. He also mentioned that no complaint had been received regarding alleged attacks on the Indian community during Diwali celebrations in Canada. The MEA spokesperson further addressed the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada, which began when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged the involvement of "agents of the Indian government" in the killing of a Khalistani terrorist. India rejected these allegations, expelled a Canadian diplomat, and emphasized that Canada has not presented any evidence to support its claims. The article concludes by mentioning that Canada pulled out 41 diplomats from India and halted visa and consular services in certain consulates, while India suspended visa services to Canada but later resumed them for four categories after a security review.</description>

			<title>Philippines rejects China’s call for prior notice on resupply missions</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/philippines-rejects-chinas-call-for-prior-notice-on-resupply-missions/1846738/</link>
			<description>The Philippines stated that it is not obligated to inform China about its resupply missions in the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs called on China to remove its illegal structures within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone and be accountable for the damage caused. China has accused the Philippines of illegally entering its waters during resupply missions, while the Philippines asserts that these missions are legitimate. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that China's claim over the South China Sea had no legal basis, a ruling supported by the US Defense Secretary during a meeting with his Manila counterpart. Since 1999, when the Philippines grounded the Sierra Madre ship at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, China has requested its removal based on an alleged agreement that the Philippines denies. The shoal lies well within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.</description>

			<title>India’s record merchandise trade deficit in Oct likely to be a one-off – analysts</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/indias-record-merchandise-trade-deficit-in-oct-likely-to-be-a-one-off-analysts/1846731/</link>
			<description>India's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in October to a record level of $31.46 billion. This increase was driven by a rise in imports, particularly in oil, gold, and silver imports ahead of the Diwali festive season. However, analysts believe that this spike in imports is likely to be a temporary outlier, and they expect the trade deficit to moderate considerably in November and December. The easing of oil prices also provides some relief. Despite the high trade deficit in October, economists retain their current account deficit (CAD) estimates, expecting it to normalize from November onwards.</description>

			<title>Pakistan: Air pollution crisis intensifies in Lahore</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-air-pollution-crisis-intensifies-in-lahore/1846439/</link>
			<description>Lahore, Pakistan is facing a severe air pollution crisis as the air quality index (AQI) has reached alarming levels. After a brief period of relatively normal air quality, the city saw a sudden spike with a maximum AQI of 401, marking it as extremely unsafe for breathing. Although there was a slight improvement in the afternoon with the AQI dropping to 188, the air quality deteriorated again in the evening, reaching an AQI of 236. As a result, Lahore now ranks third on the list of the most polluted cities globally. The current readings indicate a severe threat to public health.

Different areas of Lahore showed varying levels of air pollution, with Fida Hussain House reporting an AQI of 364 and WWF Pakistan at 231. The decline in air quality during winter months, from October to February, is a common occurrence in Lahore. Crop burning by farmers in the Punjab province contributes to smog, while weather changes trap pollutants in the air for longer periods.

The main contributors to air pollution in Lahore are vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and waste, dust from construction sites, and deforestation. Temperature inversion worsens winter air pollution by preventing the upward movement of pollutants and causing their accumulation.

Experts recommend providing real-time air quality data to the public with greater detail to help individuals protect themselves and contribute to efforts against air pollution. Reducing industrial and vehicular emissions is crucial for improving air quality. Urgent and coordinated efforts are needed to address the root causes of air pollution and protect the health and well-being of Lahore's residents.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Nations Security Council has approved a resolution urging humanitarian pauses in Gaza. The resolution received support from twelve states, while the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom abstained from the vote. The resolution highlights the need for extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza to ensure safe and unhindered access for UN humanitarian agencies. Human Rights Watch praised the resolution as a strong message to Israel, Hamas, and other armed groups to comply with international humanitarian law. Previously, the US vetoed a similar draft resolution proposed by Brazil. The recent vote reflects the US's desire for more time for diplomatic efforts. The situation in Gaza remains complex, with ongoing scrutiny and international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis.</description>

The delay in constructing the monument was due to funding issues and disagreements within the community regarding its design. The provincial KwaZulu-Natal Department of Sport, Arts, and Culture has awarded the tender for the four-million-rand monument, and it will be constructed at Ushaka Beach in Durban. The monument will include an arch with a bell tower, symbolizing the bell used to call workers to work during times of slavery and indenture. The design will also incorporate the names of the two ships that brought the indentured laborers engraved on metal sheets. While some members of the community have expressed satisfaction with the announcement, others believe that their original proposal, depicting a sugar cane cutter and his wife in a field, was ignored. Despite the differing opinions, there is a call for the monument to be completed as soon as possible, emphasizing the importance of unity in diversity.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Scientists at the Gene Centre Munich have discovered a new mechanism by which cells detect and repair crosslinking damage to single-stranded RNA. Previous research had focused on repairing crosslinking damage to DNA, but this study reveals the harmful effects of such damage on protein synthesis. The researchers used a novel approach to induce and study RNA damage in the absence of DNA damage, leading to the identification of the ribosome as a sensor for crosslinking damage. The findings have implications for the mechanisms of action of commonly used anti-cancer drugs. Aldehydes, which are produced in the body through metabolic processes, are toxic because they bind to macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins and crosslink them.</description>

Kirby stated that the hospital is an active legitimate hospital, and they want to protect its patients. The US did not provide prior approval to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for their raid on the hospital because they do not expect Israel to give advance notice of its military operations. Kirby further mentioned that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al Shifa, to conceal and support their military operations. The IDF has confirmed that they are conducting operations in the hospital based on intelligence information and operational necessity, with the goal of defeating Hamas and rescuing hostages. The IDF has repeatedly warned Hamas about the misuse of the hospital, and despite evacuation efforts, military activities within the hospital did not cease.

Kohli is also the first player to score 700 runs in a single World Cup edition. Yuvraj Singh, the 2011 World Cup-winning hero, hailed Kohli as the greatest of this generation. Former batter VVS Laxman praised Kohli's sense of occasion and incredible knock, stating that he is now in a league of his own. Many other players and cricket personalities expressed their admiration for Kohli's achievement, including Akash Chopra, Irfan Pathan, Robin Uthappa, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Wasim Akram, Shoaib Malik, Kevin Pietersen, Michael Vaughan, Brad Hogg, Ian Bishop, and Rashid Khan.

			<title>Shut up, stop taking potshots at India: Gavaskar on pitch controversy</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/shut-up-stop-taking-potshots-at-india-gavaskar-on-pitch-controversy/1846374/</link>
			<description>Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has dismissed conspiracy theories surrounding the pitch for the World Cup semifinal between India and New Zealand, calling those spreading such rumors "morons." Reports had emerged before the match that the Indian cricket team management had requested a "slow pitch" to assist the home team's spinners. However, India went on to win the semifinal by 70 runs, with pacer Mohammed Shami taking seven wickets. Gavaskar emphasized that the pitch alteration was for the benefit of both teams and criticized people for talking about potential pitch changes in future matches. The International Cricket Council (ICC) clarified that the independent pitch consultant was consulted before the change of surface. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan expressed his opinion that a fresh pitch should have been used for the semifinal.</description>

			<title>Stranded 4-ton whale calf pushed back into sea after 40 hours in Ratnagiri district</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/stranded-4-ton-whale-calf-pushed-back-into-sea-after-40-hours-in-ratnagiri-district/1846373/</link>
			<description>A whale calf stranded on the coast of Ganpatipule in Maharashtra, India, was successfully pushed back into the sea after 40 hours of rescue efforts. The calf, weighing nearly 4 tons, got stuck in the sand near the beach during low tide. Authorities were alerted by locals and tourists, and a rescue operation involving the police, coast guard, and marine experts was initiated. Initial attempts to push the whale calf back into the sea failed, but rescuers kept it hydrated and covered it with cotton. Veterinary doctors provided fluids to keep it alive. After various attempts, including tying the calf with a belt and dragging it, a tugboat was used to drag the whale calf 7 to 8 nautical miles into the sea. Once back in its natural habitat, the calf swam on its own and disappeared in the sea. The operation involved various stakeholders and was considered rare. Precautionary measures have been put in place in case the calf returns to the coast, including the deployment of forest department, police, and district administration personnel.</description>

			<description>BJP General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has accused the Congress party of using a video allegedly showing Union Minister Narendra Tomar's son discussing financial transactions as a ploy. Tomar is considered a potential Chief Minister candidate if the BJP wins the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh. Vijayvargiya stated that these tactics would not impact Tomar's electoral prospects and that he would comfortably win from the Dimni seat. The Congress has requested a probe into the video, while the BJP and Tomar claim it is fake. Vijayvargiya believes the video was released from Canada in an attempt to defame the BJP during the elections.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached a staff-level agreement for the release of a $700 million second tranche of a $3 billion bailout package. This agreement comes as a relief to Pakistan, which has been battling an acute balance of payments crisis and falling foreign exchange reserves. The IMF had previously approved a $3 billion loan in July, with the first tranche of $1.2 billion already released. The agreement is subject to approval from the IMF's executive board, and upon approval, the total disbursements under the program would amount to almost $1.9 billion. The IMF advised Pakistan to continue fiscal consolidation, reduce public debt, and implement reforms in the energy sector. The conclusion of these talks is expected to help stabilize Pakistan's economy ahead of the upcoming general elections.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/indias-trade-deficit-hits-record-high-in-october-largest-share-of-imports-from-china/1845743/</link>
			<description>India's trade deficit reached a record high of $31.46 billion in October due to increased imports, particularly gold during the festive season. China remains India's largest import source, followed by Russia, which has climbed in rank due to petroleum and oil product imports. Chinese imports are double that of Russia's. In October, Indian imports amounted to $65.03 billion and exports were $33.57 billion. Gold imports witnessed significant growth with a 95.4% increase month-on-month, reaching $7.23 billion. From April to October, gold imports rose from $23.97 billion to $29.48 billion. On the export side, gems and jewellery exports decreased from $23.95 billion to $18.61 billion due to low demand, including conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza impacting US market interest rates and inflation. The industry suggests focusing more on jewellery exports and expects potential benefits from an amended Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act. Other declining exports include petroleum products and organic and inorganic chemicals, affected by global oil price changes.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/euro-zone-banks-lose-millions-of-euros-to-poor-it-outsourcing/1845841/</link>
			<description>Euro zone banks are facing significant financial losses as a result of tech contractors failing to meet their obligations, according to the European Central Bank (ECB). In a recent survey conducted by the ECB, it was found that banks lost €148 million ($160.59 million) in 2022 due to the "unavailability or poor quality of outsourced services," marking a 360% increase from the previous year. The ECB also identified shortcomings in banks' approaches to cyber risks, including hacks, outdated systems, and inadequate outsourcing arrangements. The report highlights the need for banks to properly manage risks arising from reliance on service providers and ensure their IT and cybersecurity risk management aligns with supervisory expectations. The ECB emphasized the importance of addressing these issues to prevent further financial losses and protect against cyber threats.</description>

			<title>Can a Balanced Advantage Fund Help you Withstand Market Volatility?</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/ani-press-releases/can-a-balanced-advantage-fund-help-you-withstand-market-volatility/1845834/</link>
			<description>Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs) are hybrid mutual fund schemes that dynamically manage their portfolio between equity and debt based on market conditions. These funds aim to optimize returns by shifting between asset classes. BAFs have the flexibility to invest in equity, debt, or have a balanced exposure to both. This allows them to generate returns in different market conditions, making them suitable for investment through all economic cycles.

BAFs can help in volatile markets by adapting to changing conditions. Unlike traditional approaches with fixed allocation percentages, BAFs can capitalize on opportunities and manage risks effectively. They deliver returns in both bull and bear phases, capturing the upside during market booms and cushioning losses during downturns. BAFs also provide downside mitigation by increasing debt exposure during volatile phases, balancing the risk of equities. Additionally, professional fund managers continuously monitor market trends and adjust allocations for optimal risk-adjusted returns.

BAFs overcome the limitations of other hybrid schemes by offering more flexible equity-debt rebalancing parameters. Traditional hybrid funds may fail to adapt to extreme market movements due to allocation constraints. Aggressive hybrid funds with high equity allocation limits may decline sharply during steep corrections, while conservative hybrid funds with lower equity caps may miss out on maximizing upside potential. BAFs, on the other hand, have a dynamic and unconstrained approach, optimizing returns in all market environments.

When choosing a suitable BAF, it is important to track the fund manager's record in navigating different markets, evaluate the extent of allocation shifts between equity and debt over the past 5-10 years, consider the consistency and success of returns across bull and bear phases, and assess factors such as portfolio churn, expense ratios, and the experience of the fund management team.

BAFs provide flexibility and can serve as all-season funds across economic cycles. They are a robust long-term investment choice suitable for various financial needs. It is advisable to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative parameters before selecting a BAF as an investment vehicle.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The first truck carrying a United Nations fuel shipment entered Gaza from Egypt, marking a small step in alleviating the fuel shortages that have been affecting relief efforts in the region. Israel allowed 24,000 liters of diesel fuel to be delivered for UN aid distribution, but not for use at hospitals. The limited delivery of fuel is just 9% of what is needed daily to sustain life-saving activities in Gaza. The lack of fuel has caused the closure of hospitals, bakeries, and sewage pumping stations, as well as threatening to shut down telecoms data centers and connection points. The UN had warned that it may have to halt humanitarian operations if its fuel stocks became fully depleted. However, aid workers say the initial delivery of fuel is not enough to meet the needs of hospitals or aid deliveries. Despite the delivery of food and supplies, the aid distribution has been significantly affected due to the lack of fuel. Israel had previously refused to allow fuel in, fearing it would be used by Hamas. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas began in response to Hamas fighters crossing into southern Israel. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hungary is challenging the European Union's policy towards Ukraine, disagreeing with other EU countries that support bringing Ukraine closer to the bloc and providing more aid amid the Russian invasion. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties with Moscow, believes the EU's strategy of sending aid has failed and opposes starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. Hungary's opposition is the main obstacle to a decision by EU leaders to begin formal membership talks with Ukraine and allocate €50 billion in aid. Hungary argues for a period of reflection and strategic discussion on the EU's policy towards Ukraine before supporting any decisions on Ukraine's accession process or further aid. This dispute highlights Hungary's concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine and its disagreement with the EU over democratic issues and access to funds. EU officials are exploring ways to bypass a Hungarian veto on aid to Ukraine but recognize the significance of supporting Ukraine's security and credibility. The outcome of the December EU summit and the decision on Ukraine's membership talks remain uncertain due to the need for consensus among member states.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Climate activist Greta Thunberg pleaded not guilty to a public order offense charge in a British court. She was arrested last month at an environmental protest in London where she and other demonstrators obstructed the entrances to a hotel hosting an oil and gas conference. Thunberg, who has become famous as the face of climate activism, now faces a trial on February 1. She has been charged with failing to comply with conditions imposed by the police to prevent disruption to the community, hotel, and guests. If found guilty, she could face a fine of up to £2,500 ($3,069). Thunberg has previously been detained or removed from protests in Sweden, Norway, and Germany.</description>

			<title>German court deals blow to Scholz government with budget ruling</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/german-court-deals-blow-to-scholz-government-with-budget-ruling/1845817/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Germany's constitutional court has ruled that the government's plan to use unused emergency funds from the pandemic for climate initiatives is unconstitutional, leaving a 60 billion euro ($65 billion) hole in its finances. This decision complicates budget negotiations within Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition and could set a precedent for future fiscal responses to crises. Finance Minister Christian Lindner will face increased scrutiny on spending control, and the ruling may force the government to make spending cuts. The earmarked funds were intended for energy efficiency, renewable electricity subsidies, chip production, and support for energy-intensive companies. The ruling has significant implications for Germany's fiscal policy and support for decarbonization. Germany's 2024 budget and financial plans through 2027 are being finalized this week as the country curbs spending due to COVID-19 and the Ukraine war.</description>

			<description>A Russian missile struck an apartment block in the town of Selydove in eastern Ukraine, killing one person and injuring at least three others. The attack occurred shortly after midnight, with four S-300 missiles hitting the town and damaging multiple buildings. Local officials believe that four people may still be trapped under the rubble. The targeted area was comprised of civilians, not soldiers. Witnesses described the devastation caused by the missile, with one resident expressing fear for her own safety. Russia has been conducting regular missile and drone strikes on population centers in Ukraine, though Moscow denies intentionally targeting civilians. Ukraine has consistently reported civilian casualties and infrastructure damage resulting from Russia's invasion.</description>

			<title>Russian resources minister visits North Korea amid new missile development</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/russian-resources-minister-visits-north-korea-amid-new-missile-development/1845186/</link>
			<description>A Russian delegation, led by natural resources minister Alexander Kozlov, visited Pyongyang, North Korea. The visit came as the politically isolated state announced progress in its banned ballistic missile program. The talks between Russia and North Korea focused on the economy, science, and technology. Kozlov emphasized Russia's desire for substantial cooperation with North Korea based on agreements made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, a cultural delegation from North Korea traveled to St. Petersburg for an event. South Korea's intelligence agency stated that North Korea is in the final stages of preparing for the launch of a spy satellite, potentially with technical assistance from Russia. North Korean state media reported successful static tests of new high-thrust solid-fuel engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). These tests are seen as essential for enhancing North Korea's military capabilities in a challenging security environment. Solid-fuel missiles are considered easier to operate and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons. Both North Korea's missile program and its nuclear weapons are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions, leading to imposed sanctions. The US has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in the war with Ukraine, while Moscow is alleged to provide technical military support to North Korea. However, both countries deny these claims and pledge closer military cooperation.</description>

			<title>Analysis-Advances give Sudanese paramilitary force momentum in seven-month war</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-advances-give-sudanese-paramilitary-force-momentum-in-seven-month-war/1845174/</link>
			<description>The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have made significant gains in their war with the army, breaking months of stalemate. These gains have strengthened the RSF's position and influence in talks in Jeddah. While there is speculation about the possibility of Sudan splitting, it remains unclear how the RSF could govern a breakaway territory. Instead, the RSF aims to increase its access to resources, such as gold, and secure its role in any political settlement. The RSF has been expanding its control in various regions, including Darfur and Khartoum, and has expressed its intention to reach Port Sudan. However, there is currently no immediate risk of Sudan splitting. The war between the RSF and the army began after a plan to integrate the two forces fell apart. The RSF has been gradually gaining territory and has recently used drones and longer-range artillery. The army has faced challenges with repairs to its warplanes and fatigue among soldiers. The RSF's advances have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with thousands of casualties and millions displaced. Ceasefire talks in Jeddah have been adjourned without a resolution, with the RSF seeking checkpoints and outposts to formalize its role in Khartoum. The army is under pressure from Bashir loyalists and Islamist militias. The situation remains volatile, and ethnically targeted violence is likely to persist.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-xi-meet-as-us-china-military-economic-tensions-grind-on/1845172/</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are meeting for the first time in a year to discuss military conflicts, drug-trafficking, and artificial intelligence. However, deep progress on economic issues may have to wait. The expectations for the meeting are low, as the leaders have been unable to resolve long-standing disagreements on various topics such as Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Israel-Hamas war, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea, and human rights. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco. Demonstrations for and against China's ruling communist party have taken place in the city. Biden has been cultivating a personal relationship with Xi in hopes of salvaging bilateral ties. The meeting is expected to address issues such as Iran's actions, Chinese influence operations in foreign elections, and the status of US citizens detained in China. Concrete steps are expected to be taken on issues ranging from military communications to managing the flow of fentanyl and artificial intelligence technologies. Biden is expected to assure Xi that US commitments in the Indo-Pacific region remain unchanged, particularly regarding the security of the Philippines.</description>

			<title>Central Europe’s defence companies spy African opportunity</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/central-europes-defence-companies-spy-african-opportunity/1845170/</link>
			<description>Central European defense companies are aiming to expand their sales of weapons, military equipment, and related services in Africa. Former Warsaw Pact countries, such as the Czech Republic, have a history of supplying weapons to African nations during the Communist era and are now well-positioned to upgrade these systems. The shift towards Western technology by African countries still using Soviet-era equipment provides new opportunities for Central European defense companies. These companies are negotiating deals for guns, ammunition, military equipment, and services with various African nations. Their expertise in maintaining and modernizing Eastern-origin military land systems appeals to African customers who want to reduce reliance on Russian suppliers. With concerns over the reliability of Russian arms, there is potential for Central European defense companies to fill the gap. Russia has become the leading arms seller in sub-Saharan Africa, but the expertise of Czech industry in former Soviet weapons presents a valuable advantage. Polish defense companies have also intensified their talks with African markets, and interest has increased from potential African customers in Poland. The Czech Republic recently sent a trade mission to several African countries, focusing on boosting opportunities for the defense industry. Reopening and strengthening relationships with traditional partners in Africa is a key goal. Defense industry cooperation is seen as an integral part of these efforts. The Czech arms industry's reputation has been enhanced through its efforts to supply Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion in 2022. As African countries using Soviet-style equipment start to view Russia as a problematic supplier, they are turning to Central European alternatives.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-uk-imposes-3rd-round-of-sanctions-on-hamas-affiliated-individuals-entities/1845154/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United States Department of Treasury has imposed a third round of sanctions targeting individuals affiliated with Hamas, in coordination with the United Kingdom. The action aims to disrupt Hamas's financial infrastructure and block their funding channels. The sanctions also aim to safeguard the global financial system from potential misuse by Hamas and its supporters. The US Treasury release states that Hamas has been primarily empowered through Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which provides financial assistance, weapons, and training. Key Hamas officials, including Mahmoud Khaled Zahhar, a senior member and co-founder of Hamas, and Mu'ad Ibrahim Muhammed Rashid Al-Atili, have been designated for their involvement with the organization. The sanctions block their property and interests under US control. Financial institutions and individuals engaging in transactions with sanctioned entities may face sanctions or enforcement actions. The US Treasury emphasizes that it will continue to facilitate legal humanitarian aid while preventing funds to terrorists and bad actors.</description>

			<title>Afghanistan: Refugees in Torkham region appeal for relocation to their homes</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/afghanistan-refugees-in-torkham-region-appeal-for-relocation-to-their-homes/1845145/</link>
			<description>Refugees who have returned to Afghanistan and are currently residing in the Torkham crossing region are urging the government to speed up the registration and assistance distribution processes so they can return to their homes quickly. They have also requested help from the Taliban before winter arrives. Meanwhile, the Afghan Red Crescent Society acknowledges that food assistance alone cannot solve the difficulties faced by these returnees and will focus more on helping migrants in isolated parts of the country. Since the Pakistani government set a deadline, more Afghan immigrants have been returning through the Torkham border, with approximately 500 families using this route daily. Around 55,000 people have entered the country through the Torkham border within the past month and a half, and many of these families have completed the necessary registration and biometric procedures.</description>

			<title>70% of antibiotic fixed-dose combination drugs sold in India unapproved or banned, finds study</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/70-of-antibiotic-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-sold-in-india-unapproved-or-banned-finds-study/1844410/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent analysis has revealed that government efforts to remove unapproved and banned antibiotic fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs in India have been largely ineffective. The study found that in 2020, the majority of antibiotic formulations sold in India were either unapproved or banned. FDC drugs are combinations of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients in a single drug. While the total number of antibiotic FDC formulations on the market decreased from 574 in 2008 to 395 in 2020, around 70.4% of these formulations were unapproved or banned. Antibiotic resistance is a global concern, making it crucial to address this issue. The study suggests that regular surveys of the market and strengthened enforcement are necessary. Despite regulatory initiatives taken since 2007, hundreds of unapproved antibiotic FDC formulations have remained in the Indian market. Additionally, a considerable portion of antibiotic FDCs sold in India in 2020 were not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The slow progress in removing irrational FDC drugs is attributed to weak and inefficient regulatory enforcement.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/chinese-president-xi-jinping-arrives-in-san-francisco-for-talks-with-biden/1844957/</link>
			<description>Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in San Francisco for a China-US summit and the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' meeting. US President Joe Biden is set to meet with Jinping in the San Francisco Bay area, aiming to improve relations between the two countries. The meeting is viewed as a positive sign after months of friction, although it is not expected to significantly soften the overall relationship. The leaders hope to develop a framework for managing competitive relations to avoid surprises and clear up misperceptions. Biden's top priority is to restore stability in the Washington-Beijing relationship amidst rising global tensions. They will discuss various issues, including military communication, conflicts in Israel and Ukraine, climate change, countering narcotics trafficking, human rights, and military escalation in the South China Sea and Taiwan. The talks will be expansive and spread out over multiple sessions. The US has pressured China to play a more constructive role in the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts and take a more active role on the world stage.</description>

			<title>US House passes GOP funding bill to avoid government shutdown</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-house-passes-gop-funding-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown/1844955/</link>
			<description>The House of Representatives has passed a bill to prevent a government shutdown before the holiday season, with broad bipartisan support. The bill will now move on to the Senate for consideration. Initially, the House extended government funding until November 17, but due to another impending deadline, leaders agreed on a short-term extension called a continuing resolution (CR). Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently assumed the position, achieved a win by gaining majority support from his GOP Conference for the CR. The bill sets separate deadlines for funding different sectors of the government, with January 19 and February 2 as the target dates. Some conservative members had concerns about the bill's lack of spending cuts and conservative policy riders. However, both the Senate leadership and the White House have indicated their approval, aiming to avoid a shutdown. President Joe Biden is prepared to sign the bill if it passes in the Senate.</description>

			<title>Time to tell Xi Jinping to turn back: Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi ahead of US-China talks</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/time-to-tell-xi-jinping-to-turn-back-congressman-raja-krishnamoorthi-ahead-of-us-china-talks/1844950/</link>
			<description>US lawmaker Raja Krishnamoorthi believes that China's economic decline has given the United States an advantage in negotiations. Ahead of the upcoming summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Krishnamoorthi urges Biden to tell Xi to change course. He highlights the need for China to keep its promises, compete fairly, end genocide, and halt economic and military aggression. Krishnamoorthi emphasizes the importance of being clear-eyed, confident, and strong in dealing with China. He acknowledges the possibility that Xi may not change his policies, but expresses hope that their resolve will only strengthen. Krishnamoorthi states that the competition between the US and the Chinese Communist Party is not a game, but a contest over values, economic models, and global visions. He asserts that the US can protect itself by aggressively using trade tools, such as enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and avoiding investments in companies under human rights sanctions. Krishnamoorthi accuses the CCP of engaging in a military buildup and threatening Taiwan, and dismisses their claims over the South China Sea as illegal.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/mexico-first-openly-non-binary-magistrate-and-lgbtq-activist-found-dead/1844939/</link>
			<description>Ociel Baena Saucedo, Mexico's first openly non-binary magistrate and an LGBTQ activist, was found dead in their home in Aguascalientes. The body of Baena's partner was also discovered in the same residence. While the cause of death remains unknown, authorities have indicated no immediate signs of foul play. Preliminary findings suggest that there was no third person involved and no traces of blood outside the crime scene. Baena's non-binary identity has prompted a gender perspective in the investigation, although there is no mention of the deaths potentially being linked to a hate crime. Baena served in the Electoral Tribunal of Aguascalientes and was recognized as the first non-binary magistrate in Latin America, advocating for LGBTQ rights. Despite progress in marriage equality, LGBTQ+ activists and gender minorities still face violence and discrimination in Mexico. The tragic loss of Baena adds to the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in the country.</description>

			<description>Indian Counsellor Pratik Mathur highlighted the importance of revitalizing the role of the General Assembly during a statement at the UN Summit. He expressed concern over thematic issues primarily being discussed in the Security Council, which undermines the authority of the General Assembly. Mathur emphasized the critical role of the General Assembly in setting the global agenda and restoring the centrality of the United Nations in addressing transnational issues. He also acknowledged that some blame lies with the General Assembly and its member states for allowing its relevance to be diluted. Mathur's call for revitalizing the General Assembly's role is seen as crucial in shaping the global agenda. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has also previously stated that the resistance to reforming the UN's structure may render it "anachronistic." India has consistently raised the issue of global system reforms on the global stage.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/red-diary-contains-black-deeds-of-congress-mlas-bjps-rajendra-rathore/1844924/</link>
			<description>The leader of the opposition in the Rajasthan assembly, Rajendra Rathore, criticized the Congress party over a 'red diary' that former minister Rajendra Gudha displayed in the house. The diary allegedly contains financial misdeeds of the Congress government, including illegal transactions by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Pictures of the diary's pages have circulated on social media, with the Congress claiming that they were created by the BJP IT cell. Rathore stated that the diary contains evidence of infighting within the Congress and warned that further revelations would expose the black deeds of the land mafias during the Congress rule. The Congress dismissed Rathore's allegations and said the issue of the red diary was created by the BJP ahead of the assembly elections.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is actively engaged in climate diplomacy to promote global collaboration and support for climate action. As the first country in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, as well as the first in the Middle East and North Africa to commit to climate neutrality by 2050, the UAE places great importance on international partnerships for sustainability and climate.

The Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy (AGDA) has launched a capacity building program in collaboration with the Office for the UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change. The program aims to enhance knowledge and skills related to climate change and climate action for senior government officials, corporate executives, diplomats, negotiators, and advisors. It covers topics such as regional climate priorities, climate diplomacy, energy transition, and the UAE's net-zero strategic initiative.

The AGDA, together with Mubadala and ADNOC, has also established the Centre for Climate Diplomacy. This center focuses on climate research and aims to cooperate with academic institutions and research centers in the Middle East. Its goals include establishing a regional climate research center and forming partnerships with public and private sectors to support climate neutrality efforts.

In parallel, the Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart University (HBMSU) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) have launched an Executive Diploma on Climate Change Diplomacy and Sustainability. This program equips participants with knowledge and skills necessary for addressing sustainability, climate change, and climate negotiations.

The Arab Youth Centre, in partnership with various organizations including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, AGDA, Abu Dhabi School of Government (ADSG), and UNITAR, has initiated the 'Young Arab Diplomatic Leaders' program. This program provides specialized training to prepare young Arabs for diplomatic roles in climate affairs. It includes sessions, workshops, and meetings with prominent diplomats, covering topics like future foresight, cross-cultural communication, climate change governance, negotiation techniques, and advanced climate diplomacy.

Additionally, the Arab Youth Centre, in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union to the United Arab Emirates, has launched the "Negotiation Skills Bootcamp – Cohort52" as part of the 'Young Arab Diplomatic Leaders' program. This boot camp aims to enhance the negotiation skills of youth in diplomatic and non-diplomatic sectors, enabling them to effectively engage in international discussions and represent the Arab community in climate-related forums aligned with COP28.

Overall, the UAE is actively involved in various initiatives and partnerships to promote climate diplomacy, research, capacity building, and youth engagement, in line with its commitment to global climate action.</description>

The study showed that this optical illusion also occurs in mice and identified a specific region of the brain involved in the illusion. The research suggests that the visual cortex or higher areas of the cortex downstream of it are responsible for conscious perception. This finding aligns with the belief that the cortex is the seat of conscious perception in mammals.</description>

			<title>Study finds risk of high lung cancer cases among naval veterans connected to asbestos</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/study-finds-risk-of-high-lung-cancer-cases-among-naval-veterans-connected-to-asbestos/1844890/</link>
			<description>According to a study conducted by the University of Adelaide and Oxford University, asbestos exposure led to a higher prevalence of asbestos-related lung cancers among British and Australian navy personnel compared to other armed forces. The study analyzed data from 30,085 British and Australian troops who served in the 1950s and 1960s, when asbestos-containing materials were present on naval vessels. The researchers found that the lung cancer rate was higher in naval personnel, and although smoking remains the primary cause of lung cancer, the excess cases in the navy could not be explained by a higher smoking rate. The study concluded that onboard asbestos exposure was likely the main cause of the increased lung cancer rate. Additionally, asbestosis deaths were observed among sailors, further strengthening the link. The researchers estimated that approximately 27% of lung cancers among Australian seamen and 12% among British seamen were related to onboard asbestos exposure. The study highlights the ongoing risk of asbestos exposure to workers, despite bans and regulatory controls. The researchers suggest that the effects of asbestos exposure may be underestimated unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis. They emphasize the need for strict control measures to protect workers from asbestos and other harmful airborne dusts.</description>

			<title>RINL hopes asset monetisation may garner Rs 3000-4000cr</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/rinl-hopes-asset-monetisation-may-garner-rs-3000-4000cr/1844458/</link>
			<description>Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), a steel company, has stated that if it can raise between Rs 3000-4000 crore through the monetization of its forged wheel plant and land, as well as ongoing efficiency measures, it will be able to increase production and turn around from losses. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) handles the monetization process as RINL is a divestment candidate. RINL had invested Rs 2000 crore in the wheel plant, which has the capacity to produce one lakh forged train wheels per year. RINL’s CEO, Atul Bhatt, said that if monetization occurs this fiscal year, it will help RINL come back to cash profit through increased production. RINL posted a loss of around Rs 3000 crore in 2022-23 due to factors such as a glut in the steel market, the export tax on steel, and a lack of captive raw material security. Bhatt highlighted a cost disadvantage of Rs 6000 per tonne due to buying iron ore from the open market and an unsustainable debt of around Rs 23000 crore. The monetization plan aims to reduce debt and improve the working capital situation. Bhatt also mentioned measures such as increasing oxygen capacity and switching the import of coking coal. RINL’s substantial land bank is considered attractive as it eliminates the need for prospective buyers to invest in developing new land parcels. The land parcels are currently under the direct ownership of the union government.</description>

			<title>Study emphasises necessity of addressing risk of post-net zero global warming</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/study-emphasises-necessity-of-addressing-risk-of-post-net-zero-global-warming/1844444/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new study published in Frontiers in Science raises doubts about the effectiveness of achieving "net-zero" emissions in halting global warming. Net-zero emissions refers to the point at which the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount removed from it. The study argues that there is uncertainty surrounding the estimates that global warming will stop at net-zero, suggesting that there is a chance global warming could continue and intensify after reaching this point. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address this risk. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing global temperatures and highlights the need to limit initial disturbances to the planet in order to mitigate climate risks. The research identifies several processes that could contribute to significant warming after reaching net-zero emissions. The melting of polar ice, for example, leads to increased absorption of solar energy, which further drives up temperatures. The study concludes that political obstacles, rather than technological or physical ones, are currently hindering climate action. It argues for collaborative efforts among climate experts to better understand the impact of various processes and improve warming predictions.</description>

			<title>‘Not much has changed for Pak Hindu migrants in Rajasthan five years after poll promises in 2018’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/not-much-has-changed-for-pak-hindu-migrants-in-rajasthan-five-years-after-poll-promises-in-2018/1843897/</link>
			<description>Thousands of Pakistani Hindu migrants living in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, are awaiting citizenship and better living conditions, with their hopes unfulfilled by the ruling Congress party. The migrants, who do not have Indian citizenship, rely on political parties to address their issues. Despite promises made by both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, little has changed for the migrants who face daily struggles for basic amenities. They are requesting land to live on rather than free land, and some are even willing to pay for permanent housing. Presently, 30,000 people across Rajasthan, including Jodhpur, are still waiting for Indian citizenship. The BJP government had launched a special housing project for Pakistani Hindu migrants, but so far, it only has a name and no further progress.</description>

			<title>Direct seeding, burying straw deep — how stubble burning can be managed without phasing out paddy</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/agriculture/direct-seeding-burying-straw-deep-how-stubble-burning-can-be-managed-without-phasing-out-paddy/1843380/</link>
			<description>The Haryana government is offering incentives to farmers for adopting water-saving techniques and diversifying their crops. Under the scheme 'Mera Pani, Meri Virasat', farmers who sow crops other than paddy receive a payment of Rs 7,000 per acre, while those practicing direct sowing of rice receive Rs 4,000 per acre. These initiatives aim to reduce water consumption and promote less water-intensive crops in the states of Haryana and Punjab. The Supreme Court has suggested phasing out paddy cultivation in these regions to address pollution caused by stubble burning. However, farmers argue that paddy cultivation plays a crucial role in their livelihoods and that alternatives are not as financially rewarding or reliable. Agricultural experts propose strategies such as using short-duration paddy varieties, adopting direct seeding techniques, advancing procurement dates, and burying stubble through deep ploughing to mitigate the issues associated with paddy cultivation and stubble burning.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/global-ev-sales-stay-strong-china-hits-record-despite-end-of-subsidies/1843880/</link>
			<description>China reported record monthly electric-vehicle (EV) sales in October, despite the end of subsidies. The country ended an 11-year subsidy scheme for EV purchases in 2022 but some local authorities continue to offer aid, tax rebates, and subsidies to attract investments and consumers. EV sales in China increased by 29% year-to-date in September, contributing to the global EV market's 34% growth in the same period. Rho Motion, a market research firm, predicts that 2023 will be another strong year for EV sales in China. In European markets, EV sales grew by 26%, although the cutting of subsidies has affected demand, particularly in Germany. The North American market saw a significant increase of 78% in EV sales this year, with Tesla leading the demand. However, Tesla's market share slipped to its lowest point at about 50% during the third quarter.</description>

The project highlights that 14 million people in Britain face food insecurity, and there has been a 38% increase in people using food banks for the first time in the year leading up to March 2023. Alongside his birthday celebrations, the king will also host an event to honor the work of nurses and midwives as part of the National Health Service's 75th anniversary.</description>

			<description>Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Dubinsky has been detained for 60 days by a Kyiv court after being suspected of treason and spreading misinformation about Ukraine's political leadership. Dubinsky, who is on a US sanctions list, denies the accusations. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) claims that Dubinsky is a member of a criminal organization financed by Russia's military intelligence. The organization allegedly worked to discredit Ukraine internationally in order to strain diplomatic relations with the US and hinder Ukraine's accession to the European Union and NATO. Dubinsky was expelled from the ruling party in 2021 due to alleged election meddling but continued to work in parliament. In January 2021, the US imposed sanctions on several Ukrainian individuals, including Dubinsky, for their involvement in election interference and association with a pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker linked to efforts to gather damaging information on President Joe Biden and his son.</description>

The Hazara community in Balochistan, which saw an increase in numbers after the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, is also facing a crisis as undocumented Hazaras have left for Afghanistan. This has exacerbated concerns among those who had fled oppression by the Afghan Taliban. The economic ramifications are being felt in Quetta, where some refugees played a vital role in the city's economy as laborers and consumers. Their departure has led to an economic downturn. The introduction of a passport requirement for crossing into Afghanistan has also disrupted businesses and family connections in Chaman, leading to protests. The social impact of the deportations is significant, as many Afghans had been part of the society for years, marrying and developing community ties. The deportations may strain cross-border kinships, diminish cultural and social contributions, and potentially destabilize local economies. Baloch nationalist parties, who were previously opposed to Afghan refugees, have remained silent on the issue this time. There are allegations that a large number of Afghans have been issued Pakistani identity cards, and there is speculation that these cards will be blocked and cancelled in the next phase, which could inadvertently affect Pakistani citizens in Balochistan. A careful and humane approach is necessary to prevent further disruption to the lives of both Afghan refugees and Balochistan's citizens.</description>

The campaign, which ran on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), included pictures and videos of clashes between French police and protesters, with the hashtag #boycottparis2024. The report stated that a foreign actor close to Azerbaijan was involved in the campaign, but it could not directly link it to the Azerbaijani authorities.

			<title>Syria allows UN to keep delivering aid from Turkey</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/syria-allows-un-to-keep-delivering-aid-from-turkey/1843714/</link>
			<description>Syria has granted the United Nations (UN) permission to continue delivering aid to opposition-held areas in the country's northwest for another three months. Initially, after an earthquake caused significant casualties in Turkey and Syria, the UN was allowed to provide aid through Turkish border crossings for a period of three months, which has now been extended for a third time until February 13th. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs highlighted the importance of this cross-border operation, as it reaches around 2.5 million people monthly with critical assistance and protection services. Syria's mission to the UN confirmed the extension of the UN's use of the Bab al-Salam and Al Ra'ee crossings. The UN had also been using the Bab al-Hawa crossing since 2014, but authorization from the UN Security Council expired in mid-July. However, shortly after, the Syrian government allowed the UN to continue using Bab al-Hawa for an additional six months. In total, over 4,200 trucks carrying UN aid have utilized these border crossings so far this year.</description>

			<title>Israeli tanks outside Gaza hospital, surgeon says, pleading ‘Someone should stop this’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israeli-tanks-outside-gaza-hospital-surgeon-says-pleading-someone-should-stop-this/1843712/</link>
			<description>Israeli tanks have positioned themselves at the gates of Gaza City's main hospital, Al Shifa, resulting in patients, including newborns, dying due to a lack of fuel and power. The siege of the hospital and the lack of resources have caused the death of 32 patients in the last three days. Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra stated that there are still around 650 patients in need of evacuation. Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters by Hamas fighters, an accusation denied by Hamas. President Joe Biden expressed his hope for less intrusive action at the hospital and stressed the need to protect it. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of two-thirds of Gaza's population. Fighting has also occurred at Al Quds hospital, causing it to cease functioning. Israel alleges that terrorists were shot from the hospital entrance in return fire. The conflict has raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militia targets in Syria.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/brazil-aims-to-expand-rail-system-with-funds-from-prior-contracts/1843709/</link>
			<description>The Brazilian government plans to expand its railway network with a 40 billion reais ($8 billion) fund, funded by removing discounts given to rail companies under previous government contracts. The discounts were given to iron ore miner Vale and logistics companies Rumo and MRS in 2022 under the government of former President Jair Bolsonaro. These contracts did not go through the normal public bidding process, and the companies were allowed to make an advance payment deducting unamortized assets from their owed concession payments. The government claims that the companies owe an additional 40 billion reais ($8.1 billion) in unpaid concession payments. While Rumo has agreed to pay, Vale and MRS are still disputing the matter in court. Once the court's decision is made, the government plans to arrange any payments with the companies. The funds will be used to finance the construction of new railways and extend existing ones, with the goal of increasing rail freight transportation from 17% to 40% of Brazil's total freight, including iron ore.</description>

			<description>An expert witness called by Google in the ongoing antitrust trial testified that the company's multi-billion dollar payments to Apple and other parties are normal competitive behavior and not an abuse of monopoly. Kevin Murphy, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, argued that Apple and others played Google and Microsoft off against each other to secure large payments. The government has accused Google of paying billions to ensure its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, alleging it as an abuse of monopoly. Murphy also stated that these payments often result in benefits to users, such as cheaper phones or better data plans. He added that while Microsoft had the majority of preinstalled browser defaults, its Bing search engine only received 15% of search queries. The trial is expected to conclude this week.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.China's largest lender, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), paid a ransom following a recent hack, according to a representative of the LockBit ransomware gang. ICBC's U.S. arm was targeted in a ransomware attack that disrupted trades in the U.S. Treasury market. The hack was extensive, causing the firm's corporate email system to malfunction. ICBC did not immediately comment on the incident. The attack raises concerns about the resilience of the $26 trillion Treasury market and may attract regulatory scrutiny. LockBit has emerged as the world's leading ransomware threat, targeting numerous organizations globally. Some companies opt to pay ransoms to quickly regain access to their systems and avoid reputational damage.</description>

The animals affected include cats, dogs, birds, and reptiles. Despite the Bombay High Court's directive to only burst firecrackers between 8pm and 10pm, air quality has worsened. Animal rescue teams from various organizations are on alert, expecting an increase in cases of distressed animals that may continue for weeks after the festival. So far, six birds, two snakes, and a turtle with burn injuries have been rescued. Citizens can report wildlife distress to the forest department helpline and domestic animal distress to the BMC helpline.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/rising-temperatures-longer-monsoon-drive-bangladeshs-worst-dengue-outbreak/1843678/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing its worst-ever outbreak of dengue fever, with a death toll of 1,476 and over 291,000 infected. Experts attribute the severe outbreak to rising temperatures and a longer monsoon season caused by climate change, which create ideal breeding conditions for the dengue-spreading mosquito. This year's death toll is more than five times that of 2022 and the highest since authorities began tracking the disease in 2000. The Aedes mosquito, which spreads dengue, is adapting to the changing climate patterns, leading to the disease's spread in all 64 districts of the country. Vector surveillance is now needed year-round to monitor the disease's spread. There is no specific vaccine or drug for dengue, but early detection and proper medical care can reduce deaths to less than 1% of those infected. Hospitals in Bangladesh are struggling to cope with the influx of patients and a shortage of intravenous fluids.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Oil prices increased by over 1% following the release of OPEC's monthly market report, which alleviated concerns about declining demand in the US and China. OPEC stated that oil market fundamentals remained strong and attributed the drop in prices to speculators. The organization slightly raised its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and maintained its high prediction for 2024. The report countered negative sentiment around Chinese demand and increased demand growth forecasts for this year. Last week, the US Energy Information Administration lowered its projection for crude oil production and predicted a decrease in demand. Additionally, weak economic data from China raised fears of faltering demand. However, analysts believe that oil prices may have reached a bottom and expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to continue their voluntary supply cuts into next year, limiting downside potential. The next OPEC+ meeting is scheduled for November 26.</description>

			<title>Gold gains as traders strap in for US inflation data</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/gold-gains-as-traders-strap-in-for-us-inflation-data/1843673/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices rose slightly as the dollar weakened, and investors are awaiting U.S. inflation data that could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $1,934.25 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,938.50. The upcoming release of U.S. consumer prices index (CPI) data and producer price index data will be closely watched. If the inflation data exceeds expectations, gold may face downward pressure due to the possibility of a rate hike. However, if the data aligns with expectations, gold could trade above $1,950. It's important to note that higher interest rates can reduce the appeal of gold as it doesn't generate yield. The market currently predicts an 86% chance of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in December. Last week, gold prices dipped due to reduced safe-haven demand and a hawkish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Moody's recently changed the outlook on the U.S. government's ratings to "negative" from "stable." Spot silver fell by 1% to $21.99 per ounce, while platinum gained 1.1% to $849.49 and palladium fell by 1% to $953.44, near a five-year low.</description>

The study, led by the University of Vienna, examines how a changing environment can influence brain function and calls for further research on the impact of extreme weather events on the brain. The authors also discuss the role of neuroscience in understanding and addressing climate change, suggesting that understanding neural activity can help predict behavior and improve our response to climate change. The researchers emphasize the need to protect our brains from the effects of climate change and use our brains effectively to mitigate its impact.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United States is working to achieve a strong consensus leaders' statement at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit this week. The wars in the Middle East and Ukraine have caused divisions among APEC members, making it challenging to draft a summit declaration. Despite past friction over statements, primarily due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US wants to replicate last year's successful announcement of a consensus leaders' declaration. They are collaborating with like-minded partners throughout APEC to achieve this goal. Russia, a member of APEC, will be represented by officials not subject to US sanctions, as President Putin will not attend the summit. APEC represents a significant portion of global GDP and trade, comprising economies rather than nations. India will be present at ministerial-level meetings as a guest economy.</description>

			<description>Former Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard has announced that he will remain with the ruling leftist National Regeneration Movement (Morena) and will not seek the presidency in 2024 with an opposition party. Ebrard had previously rejected the results of Morena's presidential primaries and had not ruled out the possibility of seeking the presidency with the center-left opposition Citizens' Movement (MC) party. However, he has now reached an understanding with Morena's presidential candidate, former Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum. Ebrard stated that he would continue to pursue the presidency in the future but acknowledged that it was not feasible for next year. As a former socially progressive mayor of Mexico City, Ebrard decriminalized abortion and legalized same-sex marriage in the capital. He also played a key role in negotiations with the Trump and Biden administrations on trade and immigration.</description>

			<title>Israel combining land, air, naval forces in war, operating inside Gaza: IDF spokesperson</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israel-combining-land-air-naval-forces-in-war-operating-inside-gaza-idf-spokesperson/1843655/</link>
			<description>The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, has stated that the IDF is operating in Gaza to ensure the safe release of 239 Israeli hostages. The IDF is utilizing land, air, and naval forces in their operations against Hamas in Gaza. Hecht emphasized that the conflict is with Hamas and not the people of Gaza. The IDF has repeatedly asked civilians in the Shati area to leave, using text messages, leaflets, and media messages. Hecht claimed that Hamas has built a dedicated city for terrorism under the Shati area and that the fighting will be intense in this complex urban warfare. The IDF also maintained a tactical pause to allow Gazan civilians to evacuate through the Rafah crossing. Additionally, the IDF reported that 21 members of a terror cell were killed after they opened fire at Israeli forces from Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City. The IDF stated that the cell was embedded among civilians and used the hospital as a base for their attack. The IDF returned fire, killing 21 operatives and damaging a tank. The IDF has criticized Hamas for using civilian structures, including hospitals, to carry out attacks.</description>

			<title>Researchers give more insight into development of lupus in females</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/researchers-give-more-insight-into-development-of-lupus-in-females/1843651/</link>
			<description>In lupus, an autoimmune disease, women are affected nine times more than males. The reasons behind this gender disparity have been unclear, but a recent study by Johns Hopkins Medicine has shed light on the role of the X chromosome and a specific genetic material called X-inactive specific transcript (XIST). The study found that XIST can trigger an immune response involving toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a protein in the immune system. This immune response contributes to the development and severity of lupus in women. The research suggests that XIST may play a role in promoting autoimmunity and could be a potential target for future therapies. Further studies are needed to explore XIST's involvement in other autoimmune conditions that predominantly affect women.</description>

			<title>Kenya’s president urges progress on global plastics treaty</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/kenyas-president-urges-progress-on-global-plastics-treaty/1843302/</link>
			<description>Negotiators at the third round of talks in Nairobi are urged to reach a deal on the world's first treaty to combat plastic pollution. The global plastic waste production is around 400 million metric tonnes per year, with less than 10% being recycled. Approximately 14 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean annually, alongside increasing amounts in landfills. Delegates will discuss potential measures for the treaty, focusing on the entire life cycle of plastics or prioritizing plastic waste management. Kenya advocates for a binding agreement on plastic production and usage and has implemented laws banning certain plastic uses since 2017. The plastic industry and oil and petrochemical exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, oppose curbing plastic use and argue for improved recycling and reuse. Majority of countries support advancing the negotiations, while a smaller group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are attempting to hinder progress.</description>

			<title>EU pledges ‘substantial’ contribution to COP28 climate damage fund</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/eu-pledges-substantial-contribution-to-cop28-climate-damage-fund/1843300/</link>
			<description>The European Union (EU) has announced that it will make a substantial financial contribution to a new international fund addressing the destruction caused by climate change. The fund, known as the "loss and damage" fund, will be launched during the United Nations COP28 climate summit in Dubai. The EU did not specify the size of its planned contribution. In addition to this, the EU will also commit funding to help countries meet the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030. The move by the EU could pave the way for other deals at COP28, such as phasing out fossil fuels and reducing emissions. The UAE's incoming COP28 president welcomed the EU's announcement. So far, no country has made a specific financial pledge to the fund, although the US has signaled interest in contributing "several millions of dollars". High-income countries, including the UAE, are facing pressure to contribute to UN climate funds.</description>

			<title>Indonesia presidential front-runner Prabowo criticises EU on deforestation</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/indonesia-presidential-front-runner-prabowo-criticises-eu-on-deforestation/1843298/</link>
			<description>Presidential front-runner Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia criticized the European Union (EU) over its ban on palm oil imports and claimed that Europeans were also responsible for deforestation during colonial times. The EU recently passed a law to ban imports of commodities linked to forest destruction, including palm oil, which Indonesia is the largest producer of. Prabowo argued that while Indonesia has maintained good relations with Europe, the EU's ban on palm oil has created difficulties for selling other products such as coffee, tea, and cocoa. The EU, previously the third-largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil, did not immediately respond to Prabowo's comments. Prabowo further highlighted that during colonial rule, Europeans forced Indonesians to plant other crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, and cocoa, resulting in the destruction of forests. He emphasized the need for an equal playing field and expressed concern about the impact of the EU's deforestation law on Indonesia's annual exports. A task force comprising the EU, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the second-largest palm oil producer globally, has been formed to discuss the law.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-rallies-to-fresh-one-year-high-against-a-beaten-down-yen/1843294/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The dollar reached its highest level against the Japanese yen in over a year, boosted by reduced expectations of US interest rate cuts next year. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stated that the government would monitor the currency market and respond accordingly, but this had little immediate impact on the yen. The British pound slightly increased after a reshuffle of key government posts by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Traders in global currency markets were cautious, awaiting the latest US inflation numbers to determine the likelihood of rate cuts next year. While the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen since October 2022, it was last up 0.15%. Last week, Fed policymakers indicated that the battle against inflation was not yet over, leading to a reduction in market rate cut bets and supporting the dollar. The dollar index also saw gains, remaining firm due to last week's increase. Moody's lowering the outlook for US credit had little impact on the market. Japanese data showed that wholesale inflation had slowed, suggesting diminishing pressure on the yen. However, there was still concern about potential intervention from the Japanese government to strengthen the currency. The euro and sterling both gained slightly, with sterling also rising against the euro after news of changes in the UK government.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Gold prices stabilized near a three-week low as investors awaited US inflation data this week to assess the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy. Spot gold remained unchanged at $1,936.67 per ounce, while US gold futures gained 0.2% to $1,940.60. Traders are closely watching the US consumer price index (CPI) data, with the market expecting a 0.3% rise in core CPI month-over-month for October and a 4.1% increase year-over-year. Higher interest rates tend to reduce the appeal of gold as it is a non-yielding asset. Last week, gold dropped 2.8% due to decreased safe-haven demand and hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli forces have reached the main hospital in Gaza City, targeting it as part of their mission to take control of the northern half of the Gaza Strip. Medics inside the hospital reported that patients, including newborn babies, were dying due to a lack of fuel. The Gaza health ministry stated that 32 patients had died in the past three days, and around 650 patients were still awaiting evacuation. However, Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters for Hamas fighters and accuses them of using patients as shields. The conflict has also raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militias in Syria. The ongoing conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and made more than half of the population homeless. The situation at Al Shifa hospital remains dire, with tanks stationed at the gates, Israeli fire targeting the hospital, and limited resources available. Another major hospital in northern Gaza has also stopped functioning. The United Nations observed a minute's silence for the 101 staff members killed so far. The conflict has sparked polarized reactions globally, with some countries condemning the Israeli response and the high civilian casualties. Israel maintains that it must destroy Hamas and blames fighters hiding among civilians for the harm caused. The United States supports Israel's position but urges the protection of civilians.</description>

			<description>Brazilian police have arrested another man in connection with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, bringing the total number of detainees suspected of involvement with the group to three. The man was arrested in Brazil's capital, Brasilia, and his alleged link to the Iranian-backed group was already under investigation. Last week, two people were arrested in Sao Paulo as part of an operation to dismantle a suspected Hezbollah cell planning attacks on Jewish targets in Brazil. Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to fight against Israeli forces. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and Argentina. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had planned to label Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the move never materialized.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Spain's acting Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, is seeking a new term in a parliamentary vote scheduled for Thursday. Sanchez is expected to win with an absolute majority, thanks to support from regional parties, including the pro-Catalan independence party Junts and ERC, in exchange for a controversial law granting amnesty to those involved in Catalonia's secession attempt in 2017.

			<title>Congress talks big about caste census but its Madhya Pradesh candidate list lacks OBC names</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/congress-talks-big-about-caste-census-but-its-madhya-pradesh-candidate-list-lacks-obc-names/1842710/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the Congress party's efforts in promoting social justice and its impact on the caste composition of its candidates for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly election. The party has appointed a Dalit leader as its national president and has been advocating for a caste census. However, an analysis of the party's nominated candidates reveals that substantial changes have not been made in its candidate nomination policy.

The Congress has allocated 36% of the tickets to upper castes, which comprise only around 10% of the state's population. In contrast, OBCs, representing more than half of the state's population, have been given only 27% of the tickets. This indicates that while there is a symbolic shift towards social justice, there have been no substantive changes in the candidate nomination policy.

The article also highlights the dominance of certain jatis (castes) among the Congress candidates. More than half of the nominated candidates belong to five jatis: Rajput, Brahmin, Gond, Bhil, and Jatav/Ahirwar. Rajputs and Brahmins make up a significant portion of the nominations, with Rajputs comprising around 14% and Brahmins around 13% of the total candidates.

Gonds and Bhils, as well as Jains, Baniyas, and Gurjars, also receive notable political representation. Among Scheduled Castes, the Jatav/Ahirwar castes have the highest number of nominations. However, the Congress has not been able to implement its aggressive stance on caste issues within the party, as the traditional upper-caste local elite still have influence over nominations.

The article concludes by suggesting that the Congress may face electoral consequences if it fails to address these disparities in caste representation.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/why-are-my-kids-good-around-other-people-and-then-badly-behaved-with-me/1842704/</link>
			<description>This article discusses why children often behave well at school or in other settings but exhibit worse behavior at home. It explains that children learn from an early age that their behavior produces outcomes and can be a way to control the actions of others. Sometimes, children are inadvertently rewarded for misbehavior at home through increased attention or getting what they want. In contrast, children may behave better at school because teachers have clear expectations and reward systems in place. The article suggests that parents can help improve their children's behavior at home by establishing routines, setting simple house rules, noticing good behavior, spending regular small amounts of time with their child, and having realistic expectations.</description>

			<description>China's increasing presence in the Pacific region has led to mixed perceptions among local populations, according to surveys conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands. While both governments welcome China's engagement, concerns over environmental pollution and perceived lack of benefits from Chinese projects were raised. However, those living near mining operations tended to view them more positively due to financial benefits. Chinese government scholarships improved students' views of China, with participants recommending the program and reporting a positive change in their impressions of the country. In the Solomon Islands, support for closer ties with both China and the US was high among surveyed students, although some expressed concerns about potential debt risks associated with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Non-governmental organizations in the Pacific also raised concerns about human rights violations, governance, debt risks, and environmental pollution related to China's initiatives. The complex and nuanced perceptions of local populations in the Pacific regarding China's influence should be considered by policymakers in the US and Australia as they aim to counter China's growing relationships in the region.</description>

			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that China has been increasing its presence in the Pacific region, particularly in countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands. While the governments of these countries welcome China's engagement, there are mixed perceptions among the local populations. For example, in PNG, concerns about environmental pollution related to the China-owned Ramu NiCo project were expressed by the majority of respondents. However, those living in the mining lease area had a more positive view due to the direct financial benefits they receive. In Solomon Islands, there is support for a closer bilateral relationship with China, but some individuals have concerns about debt risks and Chinese control over resources. It's important for policymakers in the US and Australia to understand these nuanced perceptions as they navigate China's growing influence in the region.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) experienced a significant cyber hack on its U.S. broker-dealer, causing disruption to its operations. The attack was so extensive that the corporate email system stopped working, forcing employees to switch to Google mail. As a result, the brokerage temporarily owed BNY Mellon $9 billion, which was much larger than its net capital. ICBC's New York-based unit received financial support from its Chinese parent to repay BNY Mellon, and manual processing of trades was conducted with the help of the custody bank. ICBC expected the process of setting up secure systems and resuming normal business to take at least until Monday. During this time, clients were asked to temporarily suspend business and clear trades elsewhere. The ransomware attack, claimed by cybercrime gang Lockbit, raises concerns about the resilience of the Treasury market and highlights the importance of cybersecurity. The hack may also influence regulatory discussions surrounding central clearing of Treasury trades. The incident is likely to be a topic of conversation at an upcoming Treasury market conference. Despite being a mid-sized broker, ICBC's systems being paralyzed caused disruptions in the market, leading some market participants to reroute their trades. BNY Mellon played a crucial role in helping sort through the situation and facilitated the clearing of trades manually. ICBC's parent injected capital into the unit to ensure payment to BNY Mellon. Once ICBC's new system is operational, others in the industry will also review its safety measures, potentially causing further delays in returning to normal operations.</description>

			<title>Payments app Zelle begins refunds for imposter scams after Washington pressure</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-for-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure/1842693/</link>
			<description>Banks on the payment app Zelle have made a significant policy change by starting to refund victims of imposter scams. This decision comes in response to concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers and the federal consumer watchdog. Zelle, which is owned by seven major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, began reversing transfers on June 30 for customers who were deceived into sending money to scammers posing as government agencies or financial service providers. The move goes beyond legal requirements, according to Ben Chance, the chief fraud risk officer at Early Warning Services (EWS), the company that owns Zelle.

Previously, banks were only required to reimburse customers for unauthorized payments made by hackers, not for transfers initiated by customers themselves. While Zelle introduced a new reimbursement benefit for specific scam types, it had not previously provided details about its imposter scam refund policy due to concerns that it could encourage false scam claims.

This policy shift represents a significant change from last year when banks argued against refunding transfers that customers were tricked into approving. Zelle has faced criticism after a New York Times report highlighted the prevalence of scams on their platform, with Senator Elizabeth Warren estimating that Zelle users lost $440 million to fraud in 2021 alone.

Impersonator fraud was the most-reported scam across all payment methods in the U.S. in 2022, resulting in $2.6 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Despite concerns that covering the cost of authorized transactions might lead to more fraud, Zelle's owner company, EWS, has implemented a mechanism that allows banks to recover funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender. Additionally, Zelle now requires lenders to implement a tool that detects transfers with risky attributes.

Zelle's changes have satisfied the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) so far, but pressure from lawmakers may lead to further rule changes to protect customers from scams. Zelle faces market pressure to improve its standards of care as it competes with other peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo, which offer purchase protection programs for eligible transactions.

While Zelle's policy change is seen as a positive step, experts emphasize that regulations mandating imposter fraud protections would be better to ensure customer well-being. Payment fraud is expected to be a topic of discussion when bank CEOs appear before the Senate in the future.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-steady-ahead-of-us-inflation-data-yen-near-one-year-low/1842689/</link>
			<description>The dollar remained strong as traders awaited U.S. inflation data to gauge the Federal Reserve's response to price pressures. The Japanese yen stayed weak, close to a one-year low, amidst speculation of possible intervention by Tokyo. The focus for traders will be on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) numbers, with more Fed speakers expected to leave room for further interest rate hikes. Moody's lowering of the U.S. credit rating outlook had little impact on the market. The yen was pressured by rising U.S. treasury yields and continued dollar strength. Wholesale inflation in Japan slowed below 1%, suggesting fading cost pressures. Sterling held firm ahead of UK economic data releases, while the euro hovered around $1.0688.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/yen-hits-fresh-one-year-low-as-focus-swings-to-us-inflation-data/1842687/</link>
			<description>The Japanese yen reached a one-year low against the dollar as traders eagerly awaited U.S. inflation data, which is expected to provide insight into whether the Federal Reserve needs to take further action to control rising prices. Market analysts believe that even if the CPI numbers are softer, the Fed will continue to resist rate cuts, considering inflation remains above target. Moody's recent announcement of lowering its outlook for the U.S. credit rating had little impact on the market. The yen remained under pressure due to increasing U.S. Treasury yields and a strong dollar. Meanwhile, data from Japan indicated that wholesale inflation had slowed below 1% for the first time in over two years, suggesting fading cost pressures that offered little support to the yen. In other news, sterling held steady ahead of UK earnings data, while the euro hovered around $1.0688.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/indonesias-prabowo-stretches-lead-in-new-survey-on-presidential-contenders/1842685/</link>
			<description>Indonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto has taken a significant lead over his rival in a recent opinion poll, despite controversy surrounding his choice of running mate, the son of the outgoing leader Joko Widodo. The survey conducted by Indikator Politik Indonesia showed that 39.7% of respondents would vote for Prabowo, while 30% would support the ruling party's Ganjar Pranowo. The inclusion of Widodo's son in the race has been seen by some analysts as a strategy to help retain political influence and boost support for Prabowo. The survey also indicated that younger voters and Jokowi loyalists are increasingly backing Prabowo.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Two major hospitals in Gaza have closed to new patients due to Israeli bombardment, fuel shortages, and lack of medicine. The hospitals in the north of the Palestinian enclave are blockaded by Israeli forces, leaving them barely able to care for those inside. As a result, more babies and patients could die as there are fewer places available for the injured. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the situation as dire and perilous, with patient fatalities increasing significantly. Hospitals are struggling to cope with constant gunfire and bombing. Israel claims that Hamas has placed command centers under and near the hospitals, but Hamas denies this. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that Al-Quds hospital is also out of service, lacking medicine, food, and water. Three U.N. agencies expressed horror at the attacks on healthcare facilities, with half of Gaza's hospitals now closed. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is worsening, with disease spreading among evacuees living in overcrowded shelters. Aid deliveries have been limited, but some aid trucks have entered Gaza from Egypt, and Jordan has air-dropped supplies into a field hospital. The conflict in Gaza has also reignited clashes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.</description>

			<description>A group of 32 Brazilians and their families, who had been trapped in Gaza for weeks, have crossed the border into Egypt. The Brazilian foreign ministry announced that they were received by the Brazilian embassy in Cairo and are expected to return to Brazil on Monday. However, two members of the group decided to stay for personal reasons. The release of the trapped Brazilians was a point of contention between Brazil and Israel, which escalated when the Israeli spy agency Mossad claimed it helped foil a Hezbollah attack in Brazil. This incident, along with an appearance by Israel's ambassador to Brazil alongside former President Jair Bolsonaro, strained relations between the two countries.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.New Zealand's Prime Minister-elect, Christopher Luxon, stated that he is unlikely to attend the upcoming APEC meeting in San Francisco due to ongoing coalition negotiations. Although Luxon's conservative National Party won the largest share of votes in last month's general election, they require the support of both the right-wing ACT New Zealand and populist New Zealand First Parties to form a majority government. While talks have intensified since the release of final election results on November 3, there is still no set timeline for reaching an agreement. Luxon believes that progress is being made and wants to focus on concluding negotiations and forming a government. However, he expressed a desire to attend APEC to showcase New Zealand as open for business and establish relationships with world leaders. If Luxon doesn't attend, New Zealand will send representatives from the caretaker government and the National Party. The process of forming a government in New Zealand typically takes about a month but can sometimes take longer under the country's mixed member proportional system.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-qatari-emir-discuss-gaza-agree-all-hostages-must-be-released/1842544/</link>
			<description>U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani regarding the situation in Gaza and efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. Biden strongly condemned the holding of hostages, including a 3-year-old American citizen whose parents were killed by Hamas. Both leaders emphasized the need for the immediate release of all hostages. Israeli officials reported that Hamas fighters crossed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking over 200 hostages. The Israeli bombardment of Gaza has resulted in the deaths of more than 11,000 Palestinians, many of them children. Qatar has been leading mediation efforts between Hamas and Israeli officials. Negotiations involving Israel, Qatar, Egypt, and the United States are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining hostages. U.S. officials are uncertain about the status of the missing individuals but are working towards their safe recovery. Biden's national security adviser will meet with the families of the American hostages. A U.S. official stated that visits are planned to Israel, Brussels, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar. Qatar called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the permanent opening of the Rafah crossing into Egypt during the call with Biden. The White House statement did not mention discussions about a ceasefire but focused on protecting civilians and increasing humanitarian assistance. Biden reaffirmed his vision for a future Palestinian state and acknowledged Hamas as an obstacle to achieving stability. Both leaders agreed to continue working towards a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-carries-out-air-strikes-in-syria-against-iran-linked-facilities/1842543/</link>
			<description>The United States carried out two airstrikes in Syria against Iran and its aligned groups in response to attacks against American forces. The strikes targeted a training facility near Albu Kamal and a safe house near Mayadeen. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that President Joe Biden ordered the strikes to protect American personnel and interests. Local sources reported that the strikes also targeted a camp run by pro-Iranian militias. These airstrikes are part of the United States' efforts to address the ongoing wave of drone and rocket attacks on its troops in Iraq and Syria. Iran and its supporters argue that the U.S. shares responsibility for Israel's conflict with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Political parties in Pakistan are struggling with digital political communication, which raises concerns about the quality of democratic discourse in the country, according to a report by the Institute for Research, Advocacy, and Development. The report highlights that many parties lack official websites, depriving citizens of essential party information. It also notes a lack of transparency, including the omission of party chiefs' names on websites and the failure to share party constitutions online. This digital deficiency allows for the spread of propaganda and hate speech in online political discourse. The report indicates a lack of digital literacy among political leaders and a trend where inflammatory rhetoric takes precedence over inclusive communication.</description>

			<description>The article discusses the diplomatic standoff between India and Canada, sparked by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations of Indian involvement in the killing of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Foreign affairs analysts criticize Trudeau for making these accusations before the investigation is complete, emphasizing that it was Canada that first expelled an Indian diplomat. They argue that reciprocity is expected in diplomacy and India will likely retaliate. The article also mentions India's support for a resolution against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which strategic experts view as a principled stance. Trudeau accuses India of violating the Vienna Convention, but former diplomats assert that the host country has the authority to determine the number of diplomats. The article concludes by mentioning previous tensions between the two countries, including Canada's withdrawal of diplomats and India seeking diplomatic parity.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/ban-on-firecrackers-flouted-in-delhi-despite-sc-order/1842480/</link>
			<description>Despite a ban on firecrackers, people in several areas of Delhi violated the rules and celebrated Diwali by bursting them. Firecrackers were seen being burst in Shahpur Jat and Hauz Khas areas, with gatherings in parks for this purpose. The intensity of firecracker usage was lower compared to last year, but environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari reported that firecrackers were also burst in her residential area, Defence Colony, despite complaints to the police. The lack of enforcement has raised questions about the effectiveness of the ban. In some areas, such as Greater Kailash and Chittaranjan Park, there was less firecracker activity until later in the evening after the puja rituals. However, violations of the ban were observed in other parts of the city, including South Delhi and East of Kailash, where shopkeepers sold small firecrackers to children. While the intensity of firecracker usage was reportedly lower than last year, it still caused concerns about air pollution.</description>

It highlights how Diwali, once a significant plot point in movies like Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and Vaastav: The Reality, has gradually disappeared from the big screen. In contrast, Holi has become Bollywood's favorite festival, often depicted with suggestive lyrics and the glorification of harassment. Karwa Chauth, a traditional festival centered around devotional love, has also gained prominence in Bollywood movies. The article suggests that it is time for Diwali to make a comeback in Bollywood and calls for more diverse and respectful portrayals of festivals in films.</description>

			<title>Researchers reveal genetics of near healthy tissue help detect lung cancer’s return</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/researchers-reveal-genetics-of-near-healthy-tissue-help-detect-lung-cancers-return/1842241/</link>
			<description>New research led by NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Centre suggests that genetic data from healthy tissue near lung tumors may be a better predictor of cancer recurrence than analyzing the tumors themselves. The study, which focused on lung adenocarcinoma, found that analyzing the transcriptome of apparently healthy tissue accurately predicted recurrence 83% of the time, compared to 63% when analyzing tumor tissue. The study also revealed that genes associated with inflammation in adjacent healthy tissue were particularly useful for making predictions. The findings suggest that immunotherapy could be used to combat tumor growth before it becomes detectable by traditional methods. The researchers plan to use their findings to assess recurrence risk in newly treated lung cancer patients.</description>

Mendis acknowledged the team's recent poor performance against India but mentioned that they had shown resilience despite being bowled out for low scores. The article also mentions the appointment of an interim committee and the efforts to address deficiencies in the team's performance.</description>

			<title>Do you know exposure to broccoli sprouts protects against colitis in bowel disease? Study reveals</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/do-you-know-exposure-to-broccoli-sprouts-protects-against-colitis-in-bowel-disease-study-reveals/1842221/</link>
			<description>A study published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mSystems found that diets high in fiber, particularly those that include broccoli sprouts or other cruciferous vegetables, could help mice with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) live longer and improve their well-being. The researchers examined the impact of a broccoli sprout diet on the immune systems of the mice and the microbes in their gut affected by Crohn's disease. They also studied the reduction of Crohn's symptoms and the anti-inflammatory compounds found in broccoli sprouts. The study involved IL-10-ko mice divided into different diet groups and used new healthy mice to trigger symptoms of colitis and Crohn's disease. The researchers examined gut tissues and microbial communities in the intestines of the mice. They found that the mice on the broccoli sprout diet had higher levels of the anti-inflammatory metabolite sulforaphane in their blood, resulting in milder disease symptoms. The study also revealed that younger mice responded better to the diet and had stronger gut bacterial communities compared to adolescent mice.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/science/researchers-find-obesity-associated-with-neurodegeneration-via-insulin-resistance/1842219/</link>
			<description>Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in the United States have discovered a link between obesity and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Using fruit flies, the study found that a high-sugar diet, which is common in obesity, causes insulin resistance in the brain. This impairs the brain's ability to eliminate neuronal debris, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. The findings could have implications for medications aimed at reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. The study provides insight into how obesity-inducing diets may contribute to the development of these disorders.</description>

Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal highlighted the large number of bail petitions filed in high courts, which inevitably leads to some delays in their disposal. The court emphasized that unless there is an exceptional urgency, fixing a time-bound schedule should be avoided. However, it assured that genuine requests for urgent matters can be entertained by the concerned bench.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia joined forces at a joint summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League in Riyadh to reject Israel's claim of self-defense. They called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Israel for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Palestine. The summit, attended by leaders from various Arab and Islamic nations, marked Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's first visit to Saudi Arabia since ties were restored earlier this year. The emergency summit was prompted by Israel's response to attacks by Hamas, resulting in numerous deaths, including many children. The joint resolution adopted at the summit condemned Israel's aggression and affirmed Palestinians' right to self-determination, an independent state, and their demand for Jerusalem as its capital. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proposed an international peace conference, while Raisi blamed the US for enabling Israel's atrocities. The OIC and the Arab League also called for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East and the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction in the region. Disagreements arose among the leaders regarding severing diplomatic ties with Israel, with some advocating for it and others emphasizing the importance of maintaining dialogue.</description>

			<title>Cement industry’s new ‘EV’ – A new low-carbon tech is here</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/feature/cement-industrys-new-ev-a-new-low-carbon-tech-is-here/1842157/</link>
			<description>The construction of cities equivalent to the size of New York City every month is being driven by population growth and urbanization. However, this rapid urban development is putting increased pressure on the planet and its natural resources because concrete and cement, which are key construction materials, contribute approximately 7% of global CO2 emissions. To address this issue, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and industry input from the Global Cement and Concrete Association, has developed a framework to reduce concrete emissions. The framework suggests three key strategies: decarbonizing the manufacturing process, using lower-carbon cement blends, and optimizing the volume of material used in projects. One potential solution for decarbonizing cement production is an electric chemical approach that replaces fossil fuel kilns with an ambient temperature process. This approach aims to achieve true zero carbon and can be a high-performance, low-carbon building material. The journey of developing sustainable cement production technology serves as a lesson that good ideas can come from anywhere.</description>

			<title>Oil price rise would hit 2024 global growth, inflation outlook: Fitch</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/oil-price-rise-would-hit-2024-global-growth-inflation-outlook-fitch/1842074/</link>
			<description>Higher oil prices resulting from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to lower economic growth and higher inflation, according to Fitch Ratings. The rating agency estimates that world GDP growth would be 0.4 percentage points lower in 2024 and 0.1 percentage points lower in 2025. Fitch's simulations assume average oil prices of $120 per barrel in 2024 and $100 per barrel in 2025. The impact of higher oil prices would dampen GDP growth in most economies, with South Africa and Turkey being the most affected. Fitch also expects higher inflation rates in 2024, followed by corrections in 2025. The potential oil price shock could result in tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/in-un-talks-for-a-global-plastic-treaty-delegates-to-face-off-over-production-limits/1842042/</link>
			<description>Negotiations are underway for the creation of a treaty to address plastic pollution, and officials are divided on whether to limit plastic production or focus on waste management. The world currently produces around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with less than 10% being recycled. The European Union and several countries advocate for binding provisions to reduce plastic production and eliminate problematic plastics, while the plastic industry and oil-exporting nations argue for a focus on recycling and reusing plastics. The United States has shifted its stance, now calling for national plans that align with global goals to reduce plastic pollution. Environmental groups hope the discussions can move past procedural matters and focus on substantive solutions.</description>

			<description>A Myanmar fighter jet crashed during clashes between the military and an insurgent group in eastern Myanmar. The jet went down over Kayah State near the border with Thailand, with both the military and the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force claiming responsibility for shooting it down. The military stated that the crash was due to a technical problem and that the pilots had ejected safely. This incident adds to the challenges faced by the ruling junta, as it battles opposition forces on multiple fronts. Ethnic minority groups and anti-junta militias are coordinating a rebellion that poses a significant threat to the military's rule. The conflict in Shan State, which borders China, has displaced thousands of people and disrupted trade routes. China has called for all sides to cease hostilities. An alliance of insurgent groups claims to have seized over 100 army posts, and attacks on towns have occurred in Sagaing Region. The fighting has left hundreds of foreign workers, including nationals from Vietnam and Thailand, trapped in the conflict zone. The Thai government has stated that it is awaiting an opportunity to evacuate its citizens. The Karenni Nationalities Defence Force stated on Facebook that it shot down the jet using heavy machine guns and is currently searching for the pilots, but this information could not be verified. Images of an abandoned helmet and parachute believed to belong to one of the pilots were posted on social media.</description>

			<title>Owning pet may not be linked with well-being, despite improving owner’s life, research finds</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/owning-pet-may-not-be-linked-with-well-being-despite-improving-owners-life-research-finds/1842035/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A study conducted by researchers from Michigan State University found that there is no reliable association between pet ownership and well-being. The study involved 767 participants who completed online surveys, and while pet owners reported that their pets improved their lives, there was no difference in the well-being of pet owners compared to non-pet owners over time. The study also found that the type of pet, the number of pets, and the quality of the human-pet relationship did not affect the association. The researchers suggested that non-pet owners may have other sources of happiness in their lives. They concluded that while pets may provide positive experiences, they may not have a transformative effect on overall well-being.</description>

			<title>Diwali car discounts make for a great deal. But don’t drive home a soon-to-be extinct SUV</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/dashboard/diwali-car-discounts-make-for-a-great-deal-but-dont-drive-home-a-soon-to-be-extinct-suv/1840907/</link>
			<description>The Indian automotive industry has experienced a swift rebound after the challenges of 2020, with consistent monthly sales growth over the past two years. It is predicted that by March 2024, the Indian passenger car market will surpass four million units, making it the world's third-largest car market behind China and the United States.

However, Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor India, Tarun Garg, raises concerns about the current situation. He points out that rival carmakers are offering massive discounts on their flagship products during the Diwali season, suggesting that there may be underlying issues despite the apparent positive growth. Garg predicts a decline in growth as 2024 approaches, marking the end of a period of intense expansion.

Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) indicates that sales of passenger cars in October 2023 grew by 15.87% compared to the previous year. While major manufacturers like Hyundai saw their sales increase by close to 15%, smaller players such as Renault, Nissan, and Citroen experienced significant declines. This could be due to a lack of suitable products, although even established carmakers like Honda have resorted to offering attractive discounts to drive sales growth.

Discounts are not limited to the mainstream market and can also be found in the luxury segment. Luxury carmakers offer attractive loan deals through their finance arms to show volumes, often at rates lower than those offered by banks. There are also instances where dealers are asked to pick up cars to demonstrate monthly volumes, which are then sold off as unregistered vehicles at significant discounts.

The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) has created confusion among Indian consumers. Currently, the EV market offers limited choices, mostly retrofitted variants of internal-combustion engine cars. However, purpose-built EVs are expected to enter the market around 2025-26, providing better options for consumers. Major automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti-Suzuki, Hyundai, and Kia are working on upcoming EV models.

Despite potential economic uncertainty after the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Hyundai remains committed to its plans for a 'Made In India' EV, similar to a C-segment SUV, by 2025. This raises the question of whether buying a new vehicle at this time might lead to owning a car that could become obsolete in a few years.

In summary, while the Indian automotive industry has shown impressive growth, concerns about underlying issues such as discounts, declining sales for some manufacturers, and the impending shift towards EVs raise questions about the future of the market.</description>

			<title>Bangladeshi Muslims are building a 300-yr-old Kali temple. Now they want Modi’s help</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/ground-reports/bangladeshi-muslims-are-building-a-300-yr-old-kali-temple-now-they-want-modis-help/1841292/</link>
			<description>The 300-year-old Sasan Kali temple in Bangladesh's Magura district was partially destroyed in the 2000 floods. Now, both Muslims and Hindus are coming together to rebuild the temple and are seeking assistance from the governments of Bangladesh and India. The village of Basurdhuljhuri, where the temple is located, serves as a symbol of secularism in a country that has been witnessing communal violence during Hindu festivities.

Every year, journalist Sahidul Hasan Khokon returns to his native village for the Kali pujo at the temple. This year, he and his friends plan to form a committee to restore the temple to its original glory. Despite its current modest appearance, the temple attracts millions of devotees who believe that their wishes will be granted by the goddess Kali.

In 2001, there was no Kali pujo due to the flood, but Muslim neighbors contributed funds and resources to help construct a temporary temple for the Hindus in the village. Now, the community wants to build a proper temple and hopes for support from both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments. They cite a similar project funded by India in Natore district as a precedent.

The Kali temple at Basurdhuljhuri holds historical significance and requires a budget of at least fifteen lakh Bangladeshi Taka for construction. Bengali Hindus in West Bengal and Bangladesh worship Goddess Kali during Diwali, and the Sasan Kali form is revered in certain temples like the one in Basurdhuljhuri.

The story of Hindus and Muslims coming together to rebuild a Kali temple is seen as an example of syncretic culture defeating fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh. Many individuals, such as actress Ashna Habib Bhabna, appreciate this display of unity and hope for the prompt construction of the temple.

For Sahidul Hasan Khokon, supporting the temple's restoration is not only about rebuilding a part of his childhood, but also about defending his belief system in the face of temple attacks. He hopes that both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments will help restore this shared heritage.</description>

			<description>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background. The study focused on English and French participants and found that when paired with someone from the same cultural background, participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs, while those paired with someone from a different cultural background engaged in deeper searches and revised their beliefs in line with evidence. The researchers believe that bringing together people from opposing sides to fact-check contentious social media posts could improve media literacy and civil discourse. However, it may be challenging to get people from opposing sides to engage in such discussions. The researchers plan to conduct future studies on more controversial topics to further explore the effects of mismatched pairs.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article highlights various topics and events. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Punjab Governor's role is seen as a positive step for order in the House, encouraging Kerala and Tamil Nadu to follow suit. Another SC order includes personal guarantors in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), emphasizing the need to resolve pending cases. Mahua Moitra's expulsion draws comparisons to the Chinese Communist Party's style of justice delivery. Claims made in Panchjanya's editorial about foreign interference in elections are criticized as alarmist. The Kaleshwaram irrigation project has been cleared by multiple central agencies, but the BJP cannot disassociate itself from it. Nitish Kumar's remark on population control and his demand for 65% reservation make minimal impact due to the lack of government jobs. The need for the SC to pass an order on seizing devices from journalists is stressed, urging action rather than preaching. J&amp;K Police's adoption of GPS-enabled ankle trackers is seen as a smart move for Indian policing. Angelo Mathews' dismissal in cricket is justified as Bangladesh embraces a more aggressive approach. Air pollution continues to be a topic of debate, with calls for a strategy to tackle dust and demonstrate commitment. The government's extension of free food is seen as a negative implication for farm laws and private sector entry. India's relationship with Canada is questioned, suggesting that G7 and Five Eyes should not have different sets of rules. The shift in power within Indian cricket is celebrated, making the upcoming 2023 World Cup exciting for fans.</description>

			<title>Top US official Brett McGurk to visit Israel: Report</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/top-us-official-brett-mcgurk-to-visit-israel-report/1842002/</link>
			<description>Brett McGurk, the White House Coordinator for West Asia, is reportedly traveling to Israel as part of a visit to countries in the region. The goal of his visit is to reach a US-brokered deal for the release of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Before visiting Israel, McGurk will hold talks with NATO and European Union officials in Brussels. In Israel, he is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and senior security and intelligence officials. After his visit to Israel, McGurk will travel to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain. The report suggests that one option under discussion is a deal that could release 80 women and children from captivity in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing female and underage terror convicts from prison. US President Joe Biden has stated that there is "no possibility" of a ceasefire in Gaza and that the US government will continue its efforts to secure the release of the hostages.</description>

			<title>Shadab backs skipper Babar, calls for change in cultural mindset</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/shadab-backs-skipper-babar-calls-for-change-in-cultural-mindset/1841998/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's vice-captain, Shadab Khan, has called for a change in the "cultural" mindset surrounding blame on the captain for the team's poor performance in the World Cup. Former Pakistan cricketers have demanded the removal of Babar Azam as captain, but Shadab believes the responsibility for the defeats should not solely rest on the captain's shoulders. Babar's captaincy has come under scrutiny, and there has been talk of making wholesale changes in the team, including removing him as skipper. Shadab also expressed disappointment in his own performance and the team's failure to adapt to modern-day cricket. Meanwhile, England leg-spinner Adil Rashid, the team's leading wicket-taker in the World Cup, hopes it's not his last outing for England's ODI cricket. Rashid dismissed Shadab with a googly, which became one of the highlights of England's win against Pakistan.</description>

			<title>People dig deeper to fact-check social media posts when paired with someone who doesn’t share their perspective – new research</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/people-dig-deeper-to-fact-check-social-media-posts-when-paired-with-someone-who-doesnt-share-their-perspective-new-research/1841997/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background. The study focused on English and French participants and found that when paired with someone from the same cultural background, participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs, while those paired with someone from a different cultural background engaged in deeper searches and revised their beliefs in line with evidence. The researchers believe that bringing together people from opposing sides to fact-check contentious social media posts could improve media literacy and civil discourse. However, it may be challenging to get people from opposing sides to engage in such discussions. The researchers plan to conduct future studies on more controversial topics to further explore the effects of mismatched pairs.</description>

			<title>Reading ‘Modi’ script, mapping family trees — how Maharashtra’s scouring old records to identify Kunbis</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/politics/reading-modi-script-mapping-family-trees-how-maharashtras-scouring-old-records-to-identify-kunbis/1840541/</link>
			<description>The Maharashtra government is working to identify all Marathas who were once part of the Kunbi caste before the January 2 deadline for their reservation quota. District officials are scrambling to complete the identification process, with more than 300-400 government officials involved in each taluka. The government has directed districts to search various documents and publish Kunbi references found. Afterward, people will be asked to submit claims for caste certificates based on their genealogy. However, there are challenges such as old and delicate records, missing last names, and discrepancies between siblings' castes. Scanning the documents has been a challenge, with smartphone cameras being used due to the issues with regular scanners. The records are in different scripts, so Modi script readers and translators have been employed to identify the word "Kunbi" in various formats. Despite the difficulties, progress is being made, with some districts having already found thousands of Kunbi records.</description>

			<description>Megan Rapinoe, a two-time World Cup winner, expressed devastation after her final professional match ended prematurely due to injury.

However, Rapinoe sustained a non-contact injury just three minutes into the game, grasping at her right calf before limping off the field. The 2019 Ballon d'Or winner believes she tore her Achilles tendon but is awaiting further testing to confirm. Despite the disappointing ending, Rapinoe remains positive and grateful for her career. Gotham FC went on to win the match 2-1 and claim their first championship title. Rapinoe's early exit from her final match shocked fans and fellow U.S. women's national team veterans.</description>

			<title>Unlike AAP’s corruption in Delhi, UP’s excise policy is transparent: UP minister Nitin Agarwal</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/unlike-aaps-corruption-in-delhi-ups-excise-policy-is-transparent-up-minister-nitin-agarwal-2/1841972/</link>
			<description>The Uttar Pradesh Excise Minister, Nitin Agarwal, has accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi of engaging in corrupt practices that benefit the "liquor mafia." He stated that unlike Delhi, where one person can have more than two liquor shops, Uttar Pradesh restricts individuals to a maximum of two liquor shops. Agarwal highlighted that no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption have occurred during the current term of the Yogi Adityanath-led government. The excise policy of the Delhi government for 2021-22 came under scrutiny, leading to a recommendation for a CBI investigation into alleged irregularities by the Lieutenant Governor. Agarwal criticized the AAP for blaming the BJP and suggested that the leaders responsible for the excise scam were involved with the liquor mafia. Both the CBI and the ED are investigating the excise policy cases.

Agarwal emphasized that the UP excise department differs from Delhi's as it provides a level-playing field and operates on a pro-industry policy. He mentioned that the previous policies were not transparent and favored the liquor mafia. The minister stated that the current government welcomes anyone interested in doing business in the state and highlighted the revenue growth of the excise department since the formation of the BJP government in 2017. The target is to reach a revenue figure of Rs 50,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs 80,000 crore by 2027.

Agarwal also mentioned that there have been no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption in Uttar Pradesh during CM Adityanath's second term. He explained that deaths occur when local-level liquor production involves mixing jaggery with urea, which becomes poisonous if methyl alcohol is added. Agarwal assured that country liquor made in distilleries in Uttar Pradesh is safe. The department targets an annual growth rate of 8-10% and sells one crore cases of country liquor per month. Country liquor contributes 44% to the department's total revenue.</description>

			<description>The festive seasons in India can take a toll on the skin, leading to a dull and tired complexion. Winter pollution and indulgence in rich foods can further worsen skin issues. To maintain a glowing complexion, dermatologists recommend taking a vitamin B supplement, drinking plenty of water, and applying moisturizer regularly. Home remedies such as using vinegar and lime juice for dandruff or shampooing with beer can also help. Seeking advice from a dermatologist, especially in areas with heavy pollution, is advised. For specific skin issues, treatments like microdermabrasion and exfoliation creams can be effective. However, it is important not to try new treatments right before important events. Hydration, proper cleansing, and moisturizing are essential steps in a skincare routine. Using a micellar water for makeup removal and a gentle cleanser is recommended. Regular exfoliation and sunscreen application are also important. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for overall skin health. Following these skincare steps can ensure that the skin reflects the joy and brightness of the festive season.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha polls: SBSP seeks to contest five seats in UP, Bihar; party chief dismisses INDIA bloc threat</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/lok-sabha-polls-sbsp-seeks-to-contest-five-seats-in-up-bihar-party-chief-dismisses-india-bloc-threat/1841960/</link>
			<description>The Chief of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Om Prakash Rajbhar, has stated that his party is prepared for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and has requested five seats from the BJP, their alliance partner, for the general elections. Rajbhar also mentioned that the opposition India bloc does not pose a challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as the constituent parties within the opposition fight among themselves. In response to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's statement on contesting in 65 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajbhar claimed that Yadav wants Narendra Modi to become the prime minister again, as the Congress becoming strong in Uttar Pradesh would weaken the Samajwadi Party. Rajbhar criticized Yadav's PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) strategy, stating that the Samajwadi Party only benefits the Yadavs and not the backward classes. SBSP won six seats in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party and later formally joined the NDA. Rajbhar dismissed the threat of the opposition India bloc, describing it as not a challenge and citing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's controversial comments in the assembly on women. SBSP, with a significant presence among the OBC Rajbhar caste, aims to contest a few parliamentary seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh and contiguous areas of Bihar. Regarding seat-sharing for the 2024 elections, Rajbhar stated that the SBSP has sought three seats in Uttar Pradesh and two in Bihar from the BJP. Although discussions on seat-sharing are yet to be held, the party is laying groundwork in Bihar. Rajbhar did not disclose the specific seats his party has requested. The SBSP was previously in an alliance with the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and won four seats, and Rajbhar served as a minister during Yogi Adityanath's first term. After formally rejoining the NDA in July, there is speculation about Rajbhar's return to the cabinet and the induction of another OBC leader, Dara Singh Chauhan.</description>

			<title>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf blames PDM government for ‘economic catastrophe’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-tehreek-e-insaf-blames-pdm-government-for-economic-catastrophe/1841953/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has released a white paper blaming the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government for the economic crisis in Pakistan, according to a report by Dawn. The PTI claims that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, their government managed to put the economy on a path of rapid growth. The white paper argues that the PDM government, which came into power through a regime change conspiracy, reversed the economic gains achieved by the PTI-led government and caused more economic damage than natural disasters and the pandemic combined. The white paper highlights that when the PTI took office in 2018, the economy was on the verge of collapse, with various economic indicators such as an overvalued Pakistani rupee and a high current account deficit. The document also criticizes the previous government's mismanagement of the energy sector, particularly in relation to the overbuilding of power supply through imported fuel plants. The white paper states that the PTI government had to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance, which came with tough conditions such as increasing taxes and tariffs. Despite facing a global commodity super cycle that led to higher prices for petroleum products, edible oil, and coal, the PTI government was able to maintain control over inflation rates. The white paper also emphasizes that the PTI government accumulated additional debt compared to the previous government, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In related news, the PTI has canceled its public gathering in Karachi after the district administration denied permission. The PTI described the attitude of the authorities towards the party as unfair and stated that they were being denied a level-playing field.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/jordan-airdrops-humanitarian-aid-to-field-hospital-in-gaza-strip/1841951/</link>
			<description>The Jordan Air Force has dropped humanitarian aid to a field hospital in the Gaza Strip, operated by Amman, to assist Gazan civilians amid the ongoing crisis. This is the second operation by Jordan in recent weeks, with packages being dropped from planes along with parachutes. Earlier this week, Jordan also airdropped medical aid into Gaza, bypassing Israel's tight embargo on aid entering the Strip. The move was coordinated with the US and Israel. However, Israel insists on inspecting all aid entering the Strip due to concerns about weapons smuggling. Gazans and rights groups have criticized the amount and pace of aid reaching the Strip as insufficient. Three babies died in a neonatal unit in northern Gaza after the hospital went "out of service" due to continuous Israeli fire in the vicinity. The hospital is currently treating 36 babies and providing shelter for around 20,000 displaced people.</description>

			<description>Israel's military is prepared to evacuate babies from Gaza's largest hospital after fuel ran out amid intense fighting in the area. Palestinian officials reported that two newborns have died and dozens more are at risk. The Rafah crossing into Egypt will reopen on Sunday for foreign passport holders after closing on Friday. Hamas claims to have destroyed over 160 Israeli military targets in Gaza, including more than 25 vehicles in the past 48 hours. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the deaths of five more Israeli soldiers in Gaza, bringing the total to 46 since ground operations began. Israel said rockets were still being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, where it claims that about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage by Hamas last month. Palestinian officials said that 11,078 Gaza residents had been killed in air and artillery strikes since October 7th, with around 40% of them being children. Israel's three major TV news channels reported progress towards a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal would involve releasing women and minor Palestinian prisoners and considering letting fuel into Gaza while reserving the right to resume fighting.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the burden of expectations and individual records carried by cricket players Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. It questions the notion that they prioritized personal milestones over the team's success, suggesting that this accusation arises only when they approach a century. The article argues that intent cannot be judged based on a player's stroke play from 80 to 100, just as a bowler shouldn't be faulted for leaking runs in search of a wicket. The obsession with records in cricket is highlighted, with numerous examples mentioned, including Tendulkar's records. It emphasizes that Kohli understands the fans' obsession but states that breaking records isn't what truly drives his cricket. The article also addresses the criticism faced by players who are deemed good enough only for quick innings and argues that match situations and team requirements take precedence over personal milestones. It concludes by suggesting that individual records can coexist with team victories and questions whether fans can accept a Kohli century in a World Cup final loss.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/chinas-singles-day-sales-festival-wraps-up-with-e-commerce-giants-reporting-sales-growth/1841908/</link>
			<description>Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce platforms, Tmall and Taobao, experienced positive growth during this year's Singles Day sales period. Competitor JD.com also reported a record high in gross merchandising volume (GMV) during the sales period. The Singles Day festival, originally a 24-hour online shopping event, has expanded into weeks of promotions across major e-commerce platforms and physical stores in China. Alibaba did not disclose the actual yuan value of its sales for the second consecutive year. The festival is seen as a measure of consumer confidence, and expectations for sales growth this year were subdued due to economic challenges. Alibaba pressured merchants to offer low prices for Singles Day to compete with rivals such as Douyin and Pinduoduo. A Bain and Company report found that consumers planned to spend less or the same compared to last year. Shoppers focused on purchasing necessities rather than discretionary items. The final sales picture and growth rates will take longer to emerge, as return rates are expected to be high this year.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Delhi experienced its best air quality on Diwali day in eight years due to a strict ban on firecrackers and favorable weather conditions. The city woke up to clear skies and an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 202, the best in at least three weeks. The AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', while 201 and 300 are considered 'poor'. The improvement in air quality can be attributed to intermittent rainfall and wind speed that helped disperse pollutants. Last year, Delhi recorded an AQI of 312 on Diwali day. However, sporadic incidents of firecracker burning were reported despite the ban, which could lead to a rise in pollution levels.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is likely to secure another term in office with the backing of regional parties, including the National Basque Party (PNV), the Canaries' coalition, and the Catalan separatist party Junts. This support would give Sanchez an absolute majority in the lower house. However, there is widespread anger over Sanchez's pledge of amnesty for Catalan separatists, with opinion polls showing the country divided on the issue. The proposed amnesty law would release civil servants involved in the illegal independence referendum in Catalonia in 2017 and allow separatist leaders, like Carles Puigdemont, to run for office again. Critics argue that the amnesty undermines the rule of law, while tensions have led to violent clashes between protesters and police.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/governance/how-centres-aaina-portal-could-help-4700-urban-local-bodies-take-long-hard-look-in-the-mirror/1841109/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in India is launching a new initiative called "Aaina" (mirror), which aims to consolidate information on over 4,700 urban local bodies (ULBs) onto a single portal. The initiative is intended to help ULBs understand their current status and improve their performance and service delivery. The portal will provide data across domains such as planning and finance, allowing ULBs to learn from each other's work. Under the initiative, ULBs will be asked to provide data on five categories: planning, municipal finance, citizen-centric services, administrative structure, and basic service delivery. The new platform will also standardize data collection, as ULBs currently have different methods of collating data. The initiative is expected to aid in planning future schemes and serve as a knowledge-sharing platform for ULBs to improve their functioning.</description>

			<title>MP: Migration for employment continues in tribal-dominated Jhabua; BJP and Congress pass the blame</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/mp-migration-for-employment-continues-in-tribal-dominated-jhabua-bjp-and-congress-pass-the-blame/1841901/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Migration for employment opportunities is a significant issue in the Jhabua assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh. Many residents, like Ran Singh, migrate to Gujarat in search of work because the rocky land in Jhabua does not yield sufficient crops. Singh himself had worked as a cotton-picker in Gujarat in the past. The upcoming state assembly elections in Jhabua, a Congress stronghold reserved for scheduled tribes, have not generated much election atmosphere. The incumbent Congress candidate is Vikrant Bhuria, while the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded Bhanu Bhuria as their candidate. Vikrant claims that the BJP government has not done enough to increase employment opportunities in the tribal-dominated region, leading to migration. Bhanu Bhuria alleges that the lack of dams in Jhabua, which could have provided water for irrigation, has contributed to the migration issue. In the 2018 assembly elections, Guman Singh Damor of the BJP defeated Vikrant Bhuria, but subsequently resigned for the Lok Sabha seat. Kantilal Bhuria, another Congress candidate, won the by-election for the Jhabua assembly seat.</description>

			<description>An emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation was held in Riyadh to discuss Israel's invasion of Gaza. However, no practical measures were adopted against Israel. Discussions focused on stopping Israeli air traffic over the Gulf, preventing the US Air Force from delivering arms to Israel through Gulf air force bases, and cutting back oil sales to the US due to its support for Israel. Some Arab countries demanded that moderate Arab states suspend their economic relations with Israel, but a resolution to adopt these measures was blocked by Israel's Abraham accords partner states. Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco voted against the measures, along with Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, and Djibouti. The meeting also rejected an Iranian demand to designate the Israel Defense Forces as a terror organization.</description>

			<title>Hamas’s human shields: ‘Terrorists left the hospital with civilians’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/hamass-human-shields-terrorists-left-the-hospital-with-civilians/1841897/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) evacuated Rantisi Hospital in the Gaza Strip to avoid harming Palestinian noncombatants. They chose not to target Hamas terrorists leaving with civilians and instead worked with the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) to later kill the terrorist who held approximately 1,000 Gaza residents hostage at the hospital. The IDF stated that Ahmed Siam, a commander of the Naser Radwan Company of Hamas, was killed while hiding in the Al Buraq School, along with other terrorists. The IDF emphasized that Hamas uses civilians as human shields for their terror activities.

The IDF's Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza clarified that there was no shooting or siege at Shifa Hospital, and they were willing to coordinate the safe evacuation of anyone who wanted to leave. However, Lt. Col. (res.) Peter Lerner stated that hospitals would have to be evacuated in order to go after Hamas.

The Givati Brigade, an IDF unit, had been asking civilians to leave Rantisi Hospital for three days, but they realized that Hamas was holding hostages there. The IDF allowed Hamas operatives to leave with civilians to avoid causing more harm. Nevertheless, terrorists still shot at those evacuating. IDF ground troops killed numerous terrorists and targeted infrastructure and weapons belonging to Hamas.

The IDF also conducted operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Furthermore, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah blamed the United States for the Israeli aggression against Gaza and called for pressure to be directed at them to stop the conflict.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have stated that they are working with hospital staff in Gaza to facilitate safe passage for Gazans from Shifa Hospital. The IDF spokesperson clarified that there is no siege of the hospital and that the east side of the hospital is open for Gazans who wish to leave. The hospital staff has requested assistance in transferring babies to a safer hospital, which the IDF has agreed to provide. However, three babies in the neonatal unit of Al-Shifa Hospital died after the hospital went "out of service" due to continuous Israeli fire. The hospital is reportedly surrounded, and doctors are now manually providing artificial respiration to 36 babies. The Hamas-run Ministry of Health estimates that there are around 400 people being treated at the hospital, with 20,000 displaced seeking shelter there. The hospital's intensive care unit, pediatric department, and oxygen devices have stopped working. In response to attacks, IDF fighter jets targeted Hezbollah infrastructure and military posts in Lebanon. The IDF also struck a Hezbollah terrorist cell and launch pad after rockets were launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel.</description>

			<title>Over 800 Sudanese reportedly killed by armed groups in West Darfur: UNHCR</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/over-800-sudanese-reportedly-killed-by-armed-groups-in-west-darfur-unhcr/1841889/</link>
			<description>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that over 800 people have been killed and more than 4.8 million people displaced in the past six months due to armed insurgency in Ardamata, Sudan's West Darfur region. The UN warns that the escalating violence in Darfur raises concerns of a repeat of the atrocities committed two decades ago. The conflict has resulted in the destruction of close to 100 shelters and extensive looting, including UNHCR relief items. In the past, thousands were killed and millions displaced during fighting between government forces and rebel groups in Darfur. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide has warned that continued fighting, including attacks based on ethnicity, could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. The UN refugee agency expresses alarm over reports of sexual violence, torture, arbitrary killings, extortion, and targeting of specific ethnic groups. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, urges an immediate end to the fighting and respect for civilians to avoid another catastrophe. Since mid-April, over 4.8 million people have been displaced within Sudan, with an additional 1.2 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Over 8,000 people have fled to Chad in the last week alone, according to UNHCR.</description>

			<title>Satisfaction level of Afghan women for their freedom, social life lowest in world: Survey</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/satisfaction-level-of-afghan-women-for-their-freedom-social-life-lowest-in-world-survey/1841881/</link>
			<description>According to a recent survey by the Gallup Institute, Afghan women have the lowest satisfaction level for their freedom and social life compared to other countries. Only 11% of Afghan women are satisfied with their social freedom in Afghanistan, while 17% said they are treated with respect. The survey highlights that women in Afghanistan continue to face suffering despite some level of freedom. The Taliban, however, dismissed the survey as invalid and claimed that the suffering of Afghan women has ended. The report also expresses concern about the deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and the pressure it puts on the lives of deported women and girls.</description>

			<description>Former US President Donald Trump has filed a legal motion supporting media requests for live television coverage of his federal trial. Trump argues that prosecutors want the trial held in darkness as part of a politically motivated effort by President Joe Biden's administration to undermine his bid for re-election in 2024. Trump is facing four criminal proceedings, including charges of attempting to defraud the federal government and obstructing Congress by spreading false claims of election fraud. The latest filing by Trump's lawyers endorses media organizations' requests for live television coverage, stating that it would allow the American public to see that the case is a "dreamt-up constitutional charade." Special prosecutor Jack Smith had previously opposed the media requests, citing a federal court rule that prohibits broadcasts of criminal proceedings.</description>

			<title>Wegovy’s heart benefits due to more than weight loss, Novo says</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/wegovys-heart-benefits-due-to-more-than-weight-loss-novo-says/1841862/</link>
			<description>Novo Nordisk has announced new data that suggests the heart protective benefits of its obesity treatment, Wegovy, are not solely due to weight loss. The drug, which has been shown to help patients lose an average of 15% of their weight, also reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from heart disease by 20%, according to early data from the company's select trial. The study found that the cardiovascular benefits of Wegovy appeared almost immediately after starting treatment, suggesting they were not solely a result of weight loss. The drug also demonstrated a reduction in non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death. The study's authors note that while the mechanisms behind Wegovy's cardiovascular protection remain speculative, it has a consistent effect on associated risk factors such as inflammation, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. However, the trial did report adverse side effects, primarily gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, in almost 1,500 patients taking Wegovy compared to 718 patients in the placebo group. Novo Nordisk expects to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits in the U.S. and EU next year.</description>

He highlighted the increase in attacks since the Taliban came to power, with suicide attacks having increased five hundred percent. Durrani questioned whether the TTP's disobedience invalidated their allegiance and called for their punishment. Political analysts emphasized the need for evidence-based discussions on the TTP's location, training, and equipment. They also stated that the TTP is an internal issue for Pakistan.</description>

			<description>Pakistan's decision to deport Afghan immigrants has been criticized by Mohammad Arsala Kharoti, the Taliban-appointed deputy of Afghanistan's Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation. Kharoti stated that the decision was rushed and violated the rights of immigrants, calling on Pakistan to allow them to return voluntarily. He highlighted that approximately 300,000 Afghan refugees had returned to Kabul from neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan, in the past two weeks.

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/london-police-arrest-dozens-as-pro-palestinian-rally-draws-counter-protests/1841819/</link>
			<description>More than 100,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched through central London, resulting in over 80 arrests as police aimed to prevent clashes with opposing groups. The march, which took place on Armistice Day, drew counter-protesters from far-right groups and faced criticism from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for being disrespectful. Skirmishes occurred between the counter-protesters and police near the Cenotaph war memorial. The pro-Palestinian rally had a large turnout, and police were determined to prevent the two groups from meeting. Some pro-Palestinian protesters used chants and banners that were viewed by many as antisemitic. Similar protests also took place in Paris, where several thousand demonstrators called for a ceasefire in Gaza. A protest against antisemitism has been scheduled for the following day in France.</description>

			<title>Pakistan play old school cricket to end World Cup with embarrassing defeat against England</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/pakistan-play-old-school-cricket-to-end-world-cup-with-embarrassing-defeat-against-england/1841795/</link>
			<description>England defeated Pakistan by 93 runs in their World Cup game, securing seventh place in the tournament. Pakistan's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals were shattered as England scored 337 runs in their innings, while Pakistan only managed 244 runs in response. Pakistan's batting performance was lackluster, with Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan struggling to make an impact. The pitch conditions at Eden Gardens made it difficult for Pakistan to chase a near 340-run target. England's star-studded batting lineup, including Ben Stokes, Joe Root, and Jonny Bairstow, contributed to their commendable total. Stokes, in particular, played a crucial role in their batting performance, scoring 84 runs. Pakistan's Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi took wickets, but England lost momentum towards the end of their innings. Stokes, who returned from retirement, had a successful World Cup with three consecutive innings of 50-plus scores. Root also performed well, forming a 132-run partnership with Stokes. Bairstow provided a strong start for England with his quick 59 runs off 61 balls.</description>

Sarabia, who was brought on as a substitute, scored the equalizer in the 91st minute and provided the assist for Lemina's winning goal in the 97th minute. This victory prevented Tottenham from regaining the top spot in the Premier League table, leaving them in second place behind Manchester City.

			<description>Icelandic authorities have evacuated 3,000 residents from a town in the southwest of the island due to concerns of a volcanic eruption. The Icelandic Meteorological Office has warned of a "considerable" risk of an eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula, citing the size and movement of the underground magma intrusion. Professor Thorvaldur Thordarson, a volcanology expert, believes an eruption could occur within hours or days. The evacuation order is not described as an emergency, but authorities believe there is an immediate risk to the town. The area has experienced previous volcanic activity, including eruptions in 2021 and 2022. The current eruption threat is in the Fagradalsfjall volcanic system, which had been inactive for over 6,000 years prior to recent eruptions.</description>

			<title>LinkedIn says spy firm targeted Hungarian activists, journalists before 2022 election</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/linkedin-says-spy-firm-targeted-hungarian-activists-journalists-before-2022-election/1841758/</link>
			<description>Private spy firm Black Cube used LinkedIn to target Hungarian activists and journalists in a hidden video campaign leading up to Hungary's 2022 election, according to the professional networking site. Black Cube, based in Israel, created a network of fake personas on LinkedIn that used bogus job postings to connect with their targets. Video conversations occurred off-platform, and clips from those conversations were used to discredit NGOs in Hungary. LinkedIn has taken down the fake accounts and removed Black Cube's company page due to violations of its terms of service. Black Cube has previously been accused of interfering in Hungary's 2018 elections by secretly recording NGO leaders and publishing the footage on right-wing news outlets. The operation attributed to Black Cube by LinkedIn began in 2020 and targeted at least 12 activists and journalists critical of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The footage was widely covered in Hungarian media ahead of the election, which resulted in a victory for Orban's party.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israels-war-on-hamas-homes-in-on-gaza-hospitals/1841754/</link>
			<description>The article reports on the dire situation in Gaza, where a baby has died and many patients are at risk due to an Israeli siege around Al Shifa hospital. Israel claims that Hamas militants have used hospitals as command centers, leading to their demand for evacuation. However, Hamas denies these allegations and argues that moving patients could result in their deaths. The hospital has suspended operations due to fuel shortages caused by Israeli shelling. Palestinian officials claim that Israeli snipers on nearby rooftops and ongoing bombardment make it dangerous for medics and people to move. Furthermore, clashes between Israeli troops and Hamas gunmen have been reported throughout Gaza City. The article also mentions that Hamas has requested international investigations into Israeli allegations of military use of hospitals. As the crisis continues, the health ministry warns that failure to bring in fuel will be a death sentence for patients, including 39 babies at risk. The World Health Organization expresses concerns about the safety of healthcare workers. Israel states that rockets are still being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, and it has implemented temporary pauses in firing to allow Gazans to evacuate. The article concludes by mentioning that Muslim and Arab countries meeting in Saudi Arabia called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza and held Israel responsible for "crimes" against Palestinians.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pak-stays-till-dec-31st-its-decision-to-deport-legal-afghan-residents-official/1841736/</link>
			<description>The Pakistan government has suspended its decision to repatriate legal Afghan refugee residents whose residency documents expired this year. The pause will be in effect until December 31. Previously, the government had planned to send back Afghans living with legal documents after their expiration. The deportation of illegal Afghan refugees has been ongoing, with as many as 250,000 voluntarily returning home and 80,000 being deported. The decision was made due to concerns that Afghan soil is being used by terrorists to target Pakistan. Pressure from international organizations and countries has urged Pakistan not to deport Afghans who fled the Taliban rule or conflict in their home country. Pakistan claims there are approximately 1.7 million illegal Afghan residents. Human rights groups have criticized Pakistan's move, warning of a potential humanitarian crisis and increased child labor in Afghanistan.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that a committee will be formed to empower the Madigas, a Scheduled Caste community, in response to their demand for categorization. Speaking at a rally organized by the Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS), Modi pledged to end the injustice faced by the Madigas and ensure their access to justice through legal processes. He also criticized the Congress party for its treatment of B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian constitution. Modi accused the Congress of preventing Ambedkar from winning elections and not displaying his portrait in parliament. He also took a swipe at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government, stating that it had failed to appoint a Dalit chief minister as promised during the statehood agitation. Modi apologized on behalf of political parties and leaders who had made promises to the Madigas in the past and betrayed them. During the rally, Modi interacted with a young woman who had climbed a structure and thanked her for expressing her concerns.</description>

			<title>Turbulent winters are coming. Blame El Niño and global warming combo</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/turbulent-winters-are-coming-blame-el-nino-and-global-warming-combo/1841694/</link>
			<description>According to a new forecast from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the climate pattern known as "El Niño" is predicted to intensify over the winter, potentially leading to a winter of extreme weather, particularly in the US. El Niño refers to a rise in sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, which results in warmer-than-average weather globally. After three years of a cooling phase called La Niña, El Niño is returning at a time when the world is already experiencing high temperatures due to climate change. As a result, NOAA predicts warmer-than-average temperatures in wide areas of the US, along with above-average rainfall in some southern states. El Niño's impact extends beyond the Americas, with potential hotter and drier weather in areas like Australia and Indonesia, and increased hurricane activity in the Pacific Ocean. Studies suggest that global warming may lead to stronger El Niño phases, and climate-related risks are a top concern for risk experts. Mitigating and adapting to climate change is seen as the most pressing issue of the next decade.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/health/can-taking-salt-off-the-table-help-prevent-diabetes-its-not-that-simple/1841665/</link>
			<description>A new study from Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that salt consumption may be linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the study is an observational study and cannot prove causation, only association. The data used to assess salt intake was based on a simple question, making it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of salt associated with an increased risk. Most salt intake comes from processed foods rather than added at the table. The study also found a weak association between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but did not provide specific recommendations for reducing salt intake. The key takeaway is that maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet are known to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.</description>

			<description>The Taliban's Embassy in Qatar has expressed concerns about the forced deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan in a memorandum addressed to diplomatic and international organizations. The memo, obtained by Khaama Press, criticizes Pakistan for its mistreatment and inadequate handling of Afghan refugees during the deportation process. It highlights that Pakistan made the decision to deport Afghan refugees without consulting the Afghan government, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The Afghan Embassy in Qatar calls for Pakistan to be held accountable for the consequences of its actions and to collaborate with Afghanistan in finding solutions to the crisis. The statement also raises concerns about the well-being and rights of Afghan nationals facing harsh conditions and mistreatment during repatriation. The mass deportation of Afghan nationals poses significant challenges for Afghanistan, which must reintegrate these individuals into society and provide essential services. The Afghan government seeks international support and attention for the issue, aiming to uphold the rights and dignity of its citizens. The report emphasizes the need for cooperation, diplomacy, and international engagement to address the deportation crisis and ensure the well-being of Afghan refugees.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-seeks-usd600-million-from-chinese-banks-amid-imf-bailout-negotiations/1841619/</link>
			<description>Pakistan has formally requested fresh loans amounting to USD 600 million from two Chinese banks, as part of its ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a USD 3 billion bailout package. The Pakistani government is in discussions with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Bank of China, seeking a combined loan of USD 600 million. China has been a crucial source of financial support for Pakistan, providing various forms of assistance. These loans are important for Pakistan's low credit ratings and fragile macroeconomic situation, which have made it challenging to secure financing. Successful completion of the negotiations is expected to have a positive impact on Pakistan's credit ratings and access to capital markets. Under the terms of the IMF bailout deal, Pakistan has committed to adopting a market-based exchange rate regime.</description>

			<description>The Delhi High Court has asked the city government and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to respond to a plea by the wife of a COVID-19 warrior seeking the release of an ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore. The petitioner's husband, who was employed with the civic body, died after contracting the disease while performing duties during the pandemic. The court has listed the matter for further hearing in January 2024. The Delhi government had previously announced an ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore for the families of frontline COVID-19 warriors who died in the line of duty. The petitioner claims that her husband, who was a permanent employee of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, is eligible for the compensation. She has received a compensation of Rs 10 lakh from the EDMC but is yet to receive the promised ex-gratia amount from the Delhi government. The plea seeks a direction to the Delhi government to release the money.</description>

			<description>A farmer in Alappuzha district, Kerala, allegedly died by suicide due to financial problems related to unpaid paddy procurement. The farmer, K G Prasad, left a suicide note blaming the state government and some banks for his extreme step. This incident has sparked a political controversy in Kerala. The opposition party leader, V D Satheesan, criticized the government for its failure in paddy procurement and delayed payments to farmers. While the police are yet to confirm the exact reason behind the farmer's suicide, friends and other farmers claim that Prasad took his own life because he didn't receive payment from the government for the paddy he had procured. The farmer's alleged suicide note accused the government and banks of being responsible for his death. A video call made by Prasad before his death was also broadcasted, where he expressed his frustration over banks denying him a loan due to a low credit score. Farmers have expressed grievances over the government's handling of the situation and lack of support for their financial struggles. Governor Arif Muhammed Khan expressed his condolences to Prasad's family and acknowledged the crisis faced by farmers in the state. The opposition parties, Congress and BJP, blamed the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government for neglecting farmers' issues.

			<title>Human rights group accuses Pakistan of using Afghan refugees as ‘political pawns’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/human-rights-group-accuses-pakistan-of-using-afghan-refugees-as-political-pawns/1841567/</link>
			<description>Amnesty International has called on the Government of Pakistan to stop the detention, deportation, and alleged harassment of Afghan refugees. The human rights group expressed concern for the safety of Afghan refugees returning to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, citing reports of harassment in holding centers and instances where legal migrants with proper documentation were targeted. Amnesty warned that continued deportations would deny at-risk Afghans, especially women and girls, access to safety, education, and livelihood. The international community has been reluctant to recognize the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan due to allegations of human rights violations. Pakistan has linked the increase in terrorist incidents to the Taliban's return to power and their failure to take action against militants using Afghan soil for attacks in Pakistan. The Doha Accord, which facilitated the US exit from Afghanistan, included assurances from the Taliban that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against any country, including Pakistan.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/to-check-air-pollution-bihar-to-name-and-shame-farmers-who-burn-crop-residue/1841561/</link>
			<description>The Bihar government plans to publicly name and shame farmers who burn crop residue, in an effort to combat rising air pollution. The names of such farmers will be displayed at block offices, and action will be taken against them under relevant laws.

The decisions were made during a meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary, with the aim of discouraging farmers from harming the environment. The government has also conducted awareness campaigns and provided subsidies for farm equipment. The issue of poor air quality, particularly during winter, has been a concern in several cities in Bihar.

			<description>Bharat Housing Network, a technology platform for co-lending in affordable housing, has raised INR 125 crores in funding.

This is the seventh investment announced by NABVENTURES Fund in 2023.

Bharat Housing Network is India's largest co-lending infrastructure for credit delivery in the affordable mortgages-priority sector. The platform provides capital, technology, and infrastructure to housing finance companies and non-banking finance companies. It operates on a hybrid capital model for growth and scale.

The demand for housing finance in India is expected to grow significantly due to the country's growing population, rising household incomes, and declining average household size. The industry is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13-14% in the long run, with home loan originations reaching INR 10.4 trillion by FY25 and INR 18.7 trillion by FY30. The co-lending platform aims to address this demand, with a focus on the &lt;INR 2.5 million ticket size category.

The platform's integrated technology stack offers a complete co-lending solution to lenders in the affordable housing finance segment. It has onboarded 23 financial institutions and leverages partner branch networks across 12 states. Since its inception in 2021, the platform has achieved significant growth while maintaining high asset quality.

Bharat Housing Network is enabling financial inclusion by providing credit to semi-urban and rural areas. It focuses on delivering housing credit to low-income and economically weaker sections of society, contributing to 13 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The investment by NABVENTURES Fund aligns with the government's initiatives, such as PM Awaas Yojana, to encourage low-cost housing and affordable loans. The CEO of NABVENTURES Fund highlighted the importance of affordable housing and their intention to invest in at least nine startups by the year-end.

The founder of Equity 360 expressed confidence in Bharat Housing Network's ability to contribute to the "Housing for All" vision of New India. The platform aims to make housing credit more accessible and affordable across income groups.

			<title>Exclusive-UAE plans to maintain ties with Israel despite Gaza outcry, sources say</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/exclusive-uae-plans-to-maintain-ties-with-israel-despite-gaza-outcry-sources-say/1841543/</link>
			<description>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) plans to maintain its diplomatic ties with Israel despite the international outcry over the war in Gaza. The UAE aims to have a moderating influence on Israel's campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. The mounting death toll in Gaza has stirred outrage in Arab capitals, but the UAE has publicly condemned Israel's actions and called for an end to the violence. The UAE is also working to moderate the public positions of other Arab states to facilitate a return to dialogue once the war ends. The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and has no plans to sever diplomatic ties. The UAE's motivation for establishing ties with Israel includes shared concerns over Iran and economic-driven realignment of foreign policy. Despite their close ties, Abu Dhabi has been concerned about Israel's right-wing government's expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and visits to the Al Aqsa mosque compound. The displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan is seen as a red line for Abu Dhabi. The UAE has distanced itself from Hamas, viewing them as a threat to regional stability. They have played a significant role in opposing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Sudan.</description>

Last week, Japan announced it would provide radar systems to the Philippines, and the two countries also started negotiations for a reciprocal military access agreement.</description>

			<description>Residents of Acapulco are facing an additional issue following Hurricane Otis: piles of garbage in the streets. The hurricane, which struck on October 25th, caused major flooding and destroyed many homes in the city. As a result, furnishings, bedding, and household appliances are being discarded outside homes along with bags of rotting organic waste, causing foul odors and concerns about disease. The government has deployed troops to help clean up the city, but the rubbish is accumulating rapidly. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has stated that clearing up Acapulco is a top priority and measures are being taken to prevent disease. However, experts warn that if waste blocks drainage and contaminates the water supply, there is a risk of mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue and yellow fever outbreaks.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Saudi Arabia hosted an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh, gathering Arab and Muslim leaders to address the conflict in Gaza. The summit is expected to strongly condemn Israel's campaign in Gaza, as well as the forced displacement of Palestinians. Leaders from various countries, including Iran, Turkey, Qatar, and Syria, are attending. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi emphasized the need for action rather than just talk, suggesting that Muslim countries ban Israel from using their airspace and prevent the US from shipping weapons to Israel. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman condemned the military assault and violations of international law by Israeli authorities. The war in Gaza has caused an escalation of violence and strained traditional Middle East alliances. This summit replaces two separate gatherings and aims to address the "extraordinary" Gaza situation. Hamas called for a decisive decision to stop Zionist aggression, while Arab foreign ministers were divided on their response to Israel, with some countries pushing for diplomatic ties to be severed and others emphasizing the need to maintain open channels of communication.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/vigilance-minister-initiates-inquiry-against-delhi-chief-secy-in-bamnoli-land-acquisition-case/1841501/</link>
			<description>Delhi Vigilance Minister Atishi has initiated an inquiry into a complaint against Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar. The complaint alleges that the chief secretary's son was employed by a relative of a landowner who received enhanced compensation for land acquired for a road project. Atishi has directed the divisional commissioner and vigilance director to provide all the files related to the land acquisition. The chief secretary claims that the complaint is an act of "mudslinging" by disgruntled individuals facing vigilance investigations. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has requested a detailed report on the matter. The complaint involves the acquisition of land in Bamnoli village for the Dwarka Expressway. The District Magistrate and the Additional District Magistrate had differing valuations for the land, resulting in a significant increase in compensation. Hemant Kumar, who awarded the increased compensation, was suspended by the Ministry of Home Affairs and a CBI probe was ordered. The involvement of the chief secretary is now being examined.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has stated that the umpires made the correct decision in declaring Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews "timed out" in their World Cup match against Bangladesh. Mathews became the first player in international cricket to be dismissed for a time ruling when he failed to be ready within the two-minute allowance to face Bangladesh captain and bowler Shakib Al Hasan. Mathews' helmet chin strap broke, and by the time a replacement arrived, he was judged to have overrun his time. Mathews called Bangladesh "disgraceful" and criticized the umpires for lacking common sense. However, the MCC said Mathews should have informed the umpires about his broken helmet and asked for time to resolve the issue. Sri Lanka has been eliminated from the tournament with two wins out of nine matches, and their membership in the International Cricket Council (ICC) has been suspended due to government interference.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/congress-seeking-mandate-on-works-done-by-its-govt-in-rajasthan-jairam-ramesh/1841464/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh stated that the party is seeking a mandate based on the accomplishments of its government in Rajasthan over the past five years. He accused the BJP of focusing on polarisation and using the ED and CBI as their main strategy. Ramesh dismissed the allegations made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi against the Rajasthan government, calling them baseless. He emphasized that the BJP cannot criticize the schemes of the Congress government as they are not in a position to do so. Ramesh expressed confidence that the people of Rajasthan will reject polarisation and the politics of the ED and CBI in the upcoming elections. He criticized the central government's policy of privatization, stating that it is not in the country's interest and has led to declining employment. Ramesh believes that the Congress will receive public support in the elections due to the absence of anti-incumbency and resentment against the state government.</description>

			<title>Study gives more insight into bacterium’s protective role in chronic rhinosinusitis</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/study-gives-more-insight-into-bacteriums-protective-role-in-chronic-rhinosinusitis/1841441/</link>
			<description>The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been increasing in Japan and around the world. CRS is an inflammatory condition that causes symptoms like nasal congestion, discharge, trouble breathing, face pain, and loss of smell. Treating CRS is challenging because it presents in various ways. There are two categories: eosinophilic (ECRS) and non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS) CRS. ECRS is associated with higher levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that releases pro-inflammatory substances, in the nasal and sinus tissues.

The rise in CRS is influenced by environmental factors, which in turn are affected by lifestyle changes. The role of the nasal microbiome in the development of ECRS has not been clear. To address this, a research team from the University of Fukui conducted a study on CRS in a Japanese population, specifically focusing on the nasal microbiome. They collected nasal swabs from 143 subjects, including those with ECRS, non-ECRS, and healthy controls.

The researchers found significant differences in the microbiome diversity between the CRS and control groups, indicating the involvement of the nasal microbiome in the disease. Additionally, they observed distinct microbiome compositions between the ECRS and non-ECRS groups. The bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum) was found to be less abundant in patients with ECRS. Metagenomic analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis was greater in patients with non-ECRS compared to ECRS.

Based on these findings, the researchers speculated that LPS produced by F nucleatum may be linked to the pathogenesis of both ECRS and non-ECRS. Further experiments demonstrated that LPS derived from F nucleatum suppressed the expression of ALOX15, an enzyme involved in nasal polyps and eosinophil-related inflammation.

The study concludes that disruptions in the nasal microbiome likely play a crucial role in ECRS. Understanding this could lead to the development of more effective strategies for treating CRS. The researchers believe that the microbiome may also have an impact on other allergic diseases and suggest future studies for probiotic development and lifestyle modifications to prevent chronic sinusitis.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/riyadh-hosts-islamic-arab-summit-to-push-for-gaza-war-end/1841434/</link>
			<description>Saudi Arabia is hosting an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh, gathering Arab and Muslim leaders to address the conflict in Gaza. The summit is expected to strongly condemn Israel's campaign in Gaza and call for an end to the forced displacement of Palestinians. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who is attending the summit, emphasized the need for action rather than words in resolving the conflict. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman condemned the military assault on Gaza and the violations of international law by Israeli authorities. The war in Gaza has strained Middle East alliances, with Saudi Arabia engaging more closely with Iran and delaying plans to normalize ties with Israel. The summit replaces two separate gatherings and aims to unify efforts and establish a collective position on the Gaza situation. Arab foreign ministers were divided on whether to cut diplomatic ties with Israel, with some countries advocating for maintaining open channels with the Israeli government.</description>

			<title>Joe Biden to meet with Xi Jinping – what a good result looks like for the US president</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/joe-biden-to-meet-with-xi-jinping-what-a-good-result-looks-like-for-the-us-president/1841433/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. US President Joe Biden is expected to meet with China's leader, Xi Jinping, during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in San Francisco. This meeting holds significance as the two leaders have not met since the G20 in 2022 and have disagreements on global conflicts, including the Ukraine war. Biden's relationship with Xi is strained, and topics such as China's position on Taiwan, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the US-China trade relationship are expected to be on the agenda. The US-China relationship may have an impact on the 2024 US presidential election, with a majority of Americans having a negative view of China. Biden aims to curb China's economic growth and limit its diplomatic influence while maintaining US geopolitical dominance. The meeting may also involve discussions on AI, military dialogue, and the possibility of China restricting the supply of chemicals used to make fentanyl. The expectations of the meeting have not been outlined by either side, but it is seen as a catalyst for further negotiations.</description>

			<title>Do you know lung cancer screening significantly improves long-term survival? Study finds</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/do-you-know-lung-cancer-screening-significantly-improves-long-term-survival-study-finds/1841425/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in Radiology found that low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening can significantly increase the cure rate for early-stage lung cancer over a 20-year period. The study revealed that individuals who received a CT screening-based diagnosis of lung cancer had an estimated 81% survival rate after 20 years. Among those diagnosed, 81% had stage I illness, and 87% of them had an 87% long-term survival rate. The study emphasized the importance of routine early screening, as only 21% of lung cancers are currently diagnosed at an early stage in the United States. Additionally, the study highlighted that symptoms mainly occur in late-stage lung cancer, making early screening crucial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for adults aged 50 to 80 with a 20-pack-year smoking history. The researchers involved in the study have been studying the effectiveness of CT screening for lung cancer detection for years, and the study builds upon their previous research.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The European Pakistani Christian Action Committee held a protest outside the European Parliament, highlighting various issues faced by religious minorities in Pakistan. They raised concerns about the abuse of blasphemy laws, a culture of impunity, discrimination, incitement of violence, coerced faith conversions, and forced child marriages of Christian and Hindu girls. The protesters called on the European Union to encourage Pakistan to adhere to human rights obligations under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Plus status. They demanded reforms in the Pakistani legal system, including amendments to blasphemy laws and the introduction of laws criminalizing coerced faith conversion. A member of the European Parliament, Charlie Weimers, attended the protest and condemned forced conversions and child marriages. The protest also emphasized Pakistan's responsibility as a beneficiary of the GSP Plus mechanism to improve freedom of expression and religion. The protesters criticized the Pakistani government for its handling of blasphemy laws, specifically mentioning the case of Anwar Kenneth, a Christian man sentenced to death under blasphemy charges. They called for his immediate acquittal and release without any conditions. Pastors at the protest expressed the need for tangible changes to make Pakistan safer for religious minorities, and they hope the EU will leverage its influence to bring about this change.</description>

			<title>COP28 aims to bolster climate action, reinforcing Paris Agreement as a global cornerstone</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/cop28-aims-to-bolster-climate-action-reinforcing-paris-agreement-as-a-global-cornerstone/1841417/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of heatwaves that occurred in July and August of the previous year, causing widespread disruptions such as forest fires, water and food shortages, and hurricanes resulting in numerous deaths. The global momentum for addressing climate change is increasing, and world leaders will discuss effective solutions at COP28, which will be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The conference marks a turning point after the Paris Agreement (COP21) in 2015, where countries committed to limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and making efforts to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Paris Agreement focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting technology transfer and adaptation to carbon-free economies. The agreement's provisions include two review processes until 2025. It entered into force in 2016 after being signed by 195 countries and ratified by 191 out of 197 countries.

COP28 will initiate the first global stocktake of progress made in implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement, measuring countries' efforts to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United Nations emphasizes the need to recalibrate the course due to the significant increase in global temperatures. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledges the challenges faced by developing countries in responding to climate change and calls for funding support.

Air pollution's detrimental impact on health, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO issued new Air Quality Guidelines, emphasizing the need to reduce suffering and save lives through improved air quality.

Fossil fuels are identified as the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions and around 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. To address the climate challenge, emissions must be reduced by nearly half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050. The UN emphasizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, accessible, and sustainable sources of energy.

Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water, waste, and geothermal energy, are highlighted as effective alternatives to fossil fuels. While cleaner energy sources are gaining ground, fossil fuels still dominate global energy production with over 80% contribution.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address climate change, particularly in light of recent extreme weather events and their devastating consequences.</description>

Spain and Abu Dhabi-based ADIA Lab are collaborating to exchange knowledge and talent in innovation. Artigas commended the UAE's strategy, which aligns with Spain's national strategy, and praised its efforts to attract researchers and innovators.

Gurjap Singh attacked the woman as she walked home, entering her house to slap her repeatedly. The woman's husband tried to intervene but was pushed aside. Singh was described as being in a "state of mania" during the attack. The victims had treated Singh like a son prior to the incident.

			<title>Urban land pattern may hold key to reduce exposure to weather extremes, study finds</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/urban-land-pattern-may-hold-key-to-reduce-exposure-to-weather-extremes-study-finds/1841368/</link>
			<description>Scientists from the universities of Delaware and Wyoming have found that the layout of cities can help in reducing population exposure to future weather extremes. The design of urban landscapes, including how buildings are spread out or clustered, seems to be more important than the size of a city. The researchers investigated how changes in urban land and population will affect future populations' exposures to weather extremes by the end of the 21st century. Well-planned urban land patterns can reduce population exposures to weather extremes, regardless of the size of a city. The findings encourage researchers and practitioners to reconsider how cities are designed and built to be more resilient to climate risks. The researchers looked at urban areas across the US and predicted their growth by 2100. They analyzed how these urban land changes might affect weather extremes and the number of people potentially exposed to these events. Carefully designed urban land patterns can reduce the increase in risks caused by climate change. The researchers suggest adjusting how cities are built and renovated to consider their natural surroundings and create an integrated human-environment system.</description>

			<title>UAE leverages oil power to push secretive oil companies on emission reductions: Report</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/uae-leverages-oil-power-to-push-secretive-oil-companies-on-emission-reductions-report/1841299/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is using its position as an oil producer and host of the upcoming United Nations climate talks to urge secretive state-run oil companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The UAE's effort, called the Global Decarbonisation Alliance, aims to have a significant impact at the COP28 negotiations in Dubai. Led by Sultan al-Jaber, head of this year's climate talks and chief of the UAE's national oil company, the initiative suggests using resources to clean up petroleum production rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels. It seeks to engage national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Colombia's Ecopetrol, which account for half of global crude production and hold 90% of the world's oil and gas reserves. While environmentalists criticize the lack of stringency and inclusion of emissions from oil and gas produced and sold, supporters hope that public and international pressure will encourage these companies to adopt eco-friendly practices. A spokesperson for COP28 confirmed that 20 companies, both national and investor-owned, have already joined the alliance. Critics also express concerns about the leadership of al-Jaber, as his role overseeing negotiations while heading Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) may lack impartiality. Nonetheless, the potential alliance of oil producers represents the first such effort to institutionalize engagement on climate emissions within the industry.</description>

			<title>Pakistan’s move to deport Afghan refugees increases mistrust between Kabul-Islamabad: Taliban spokesperson</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistans-move-to-deport-afghan-refugees-increases-mistrust-between-kabul-islamabad-taliban-spokesperson/1841293/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's forceful expulsion of Afghan refugees has led to increased mistrust among Afghans towards Pakistan, according to Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid. He also denied the presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan. The Balochistan caretaker information minister, Jan Achakzai, claimed that Pakistan would start a similar campaign against Afghan refugees with legal documents. However, Achakzai previously called on Afghan officials to hand over refugees coming from across the Durand Line. The Taliban spokesperson denied Achakzai's remarks and stated that Afghan soil is not used against anyone. Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman, president of Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Pakistan, called for the formation of a joint commission between Kabul and Islamabad to facilitate the deportation of Afghan refugees. Pakistan has been blaming Afghanistan for the surge in terror attacks in their country. Around 200,000 Afghans have returned home via the Torkham border after Pakistan ordered 1.7 million undocumented Afghans to leave or face deportation.</description>

			<title>ONGC Q2 net profit drops 20 pc on lower oil prices, output</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/ongc-q2-net-profit-drops-20-pc-on-lower-oil-prices-output/1841290/</link>
			<description>State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a 20% drop in net profit for the September quarter due to lower oil prices and decreased output. The company's net profit was Rs 10,216 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs 12,826 crore in the same period last year. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline in net profit for ONGC. The decline in profit is mainly attributed to lower oil prices and slightly lower oil and gas production. However, the company expects production to increase in the current quarter with the start of production from a new oilfield in the KG basin. ONGC also faced challenges such as a shutdown in Panna-Mukta for commissioning a new crude oil pipeline and disruptions caused by Cyclone Biparjoy. Despite the current decline in production, ONGC anticipates compensation with the commencement of additional production from new projects.</description>

			<title>5 green flags that show your employer is serious about making you find ‘purpose’ in work</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/feature/5-green-flags-that-show-your-employer-is-serious-about-making-you-find-purpose-in-work/1841273/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The concept of purpose at work is important to many individuals, with 70% of respondents in a survey stating that their personal sense of purpose is defined by their work. Organizations often use the promise of purpose to attract and retain employees, offering opportunities to contribute to social or ecological causes beyond just completing tasks. However, sometimes employers fail to deliver on this promise, engaging in "purpose-washing" where they make promises but don't follow through with consistent actions.

To determine if an employer's promise of purpose is genuine, there are five green flags to look for. Firstly, the organization should dedicate resources such as time, money, training, and staff towards purpose-driven work. Secondly, they should provide well-being support to protect employees from exploitation and burnout. Thirdly, purpose should be made relevant to all roles within the organization, encouraging collaboration beyond specific departments. Fourthly, diverse representation across gender, race, occupations, and organizational levels can facilitate purpose-driven aims. Lastly, organizations should provide opportunities for employees to see the impact of their work, whether through reports, case studies, or feedback conversations.

While purpose-driven work may be justified by its benefits to the organization and bottom line, solely relying on this justification can disconnect employees from their values over time. Instead, organizations need to redefine what counts as doing business and adapt their operations accordingly. This includes giving autonomy to purpose-driven workers, aligning performance indicators and reward systems with efforts to change, and creating career paths that value and support purpose-driven projects.

Ultimately, purpose can provide meaningful work for those interested in finding solutions to social and ecological challenges. Falling victim to purpose-washing can negatively affect one's career and well-being, so it's crucial to identify companies that demonstrate commitment, authenticity, and support for purpose-driven initiatives.</description>

			<description>The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a rush to extract cobalt, a crucial component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and low-carbon innovations. The country's Katanga region holds more cobalt reserves than the rest of the world combined. However, this exploitation of resources is reminiscent of King Leopold II's brutal reign, during which millions of Congolese lost their lives. Today, the harsh realities of cobalt mining involve hazardous conditions, including child labor and toxic exposure. Companies in the supply chain claim to uphold human rights standards but often fail to address these issues effectively. International coalitions, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), aim to ensure clean supply chains and eliminate child labor in cobalt mining. However, on-ground observations reveal extreme suffering and environmental devastation in the Congo due to cobalt extraction.</description>

			<title>Global economic jitters: Fitch Ratings predicts 2024 impact from soaring oil price</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/global-economic-jitters-fitch-ratings-predicts-2024-impact-from-soaring-oil-price/1841217/</link>
			<description>Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has issued a warning about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic growth. The agency's Global Economic Outlook predicts that potential disruptions in the Middle East's oil supply due to conflicts could cause oil prices to surge, leading to a significant decrease in global GDP growth and a rise in inflation. Fitch's simulations show that if oil prices reach USD 120 per barrel in 2024 and USD 100 per barrel in 2025, there could be a 0.4 percentage point reduction in world GDP growth in 2024, with a lingering 0.1 percentage point lower growth in 2025. The impact is expected to be felt across the board, with most countries experiencing longer-lasting effects on GDP levels. Inflation rates would also be elevated in 2024, with India, Turkey, and Poland being particularly affected. Fitch highlights the potential ripple effects of an oil price shock, such as tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets. The report emphasizes the intricate web of global economic interdependencies and the vulnerabilities arising from geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions.</description>

			<title>Australia have a good reference of playing a SF, says Van der Dussen</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/australia-have-a-good-reference-of-playing-a-sf-says-van-der-dussen/1841214/</link>
			<description>South Africa's Rassie Van der Dussen believes that Australia has a good reference for winning knockout matches, but South Africa will maintain their must-win mindset in the upcoming semifinal match. Van der Dussen acknowledges that Australia has more experience in these situations, having won the World Cup and played in the semifinals before. However, he emphasizes that the outcome will depend on the performance of the teams on the day. South Africa has approached the tournament with a must-win mentality from the start, and they will continue to do so. Van der Dussen also mentions that South Africa wanted to test themselves by chasing down a total before the semifinal, as their chasing record in the tournament has been poor. They were successful in their recent match against Afghanistan, where Van der Dussen played a crucial unbeaten innings. South Africa's captain, Temba Bavuma, is a doubtful starter for the semifinal due to a hamstring injury. If he is unable to play, Reeza Hendricks is likely to open the batting.</description>

			<title>On CM Chouhan’s home turf Budhni, Congress’ ‘Hanuman’ seeks to pull off a miracle</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/on-cm-chouhans-home-turf-budhni-congress-hanuman-seeks-to-pull-off-a-miracle-2/1841213/</link>
			<description>The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh is preparing for assembly polls, with BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing Congress candidate Vikram Mastal. Despite the entry of Samajwadi Party's Vairagyanand Giri, also known as Mirchi Baba, the contest has not gained much momentum. Chouhan, confident in his position as the longest-serving chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, has not visited his assembly constituency since filing nomination papers. The BJP dominates the constituency with their flags and posters, while the Congress' presence is scarce. Although the BJP has chosen not to project Chouhan as its CM face this time, they heavily rely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity to secure victory. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains optimistic about his chances and claims that people are angry with Chouhan for not doing enough for Budhni. However, supporters of Chouhan believe he will win due to his track record and the development he has brought to the area. Chouhan's son Kartikeya is actively campaigning on his behalf, aiming for a record victory margin. Overall, Budhni seems to have a strong support base for Chouhan, although Mastal is putting up a brave fight.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.WeWork's announcement of its intent to terminate 65 leases as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing has had a significant impact on the real estate industry.

Some notable affected properties include 222 Kearny Street in San Francisco, 57 East 11th Street in Greenwich Village, and 315 West 36th Street in Hudson Yards.

The impacts of the bankruptcy filing are substantial and complex for WeWork's relationships with these spaces.</description>

			<description>The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh appears lukewarm to the upcoming assembly polls, despite BJP's longest-serving chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing competition from Congress candidate Vikram Mastal and Samajwadi Party's Vairagyanand Giri. Chouhan, who has won four times from Budhni since 2006, has not visited his assembly constituency after filing nomination papers. BJP flags dominate the constituency, while Congress emblems are rare. The BJP has focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi rather than projecting Chouhan as its CM face. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains confident, banking on people's anger towards Chouhan. However, supporters of Chouhan believe he will win with a record margin and cite his contributions to the constituency.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/hamas-terror-organization-behind-failed-missile-launch-that-hit-al-shifa-hospital-idf/1841194/</link>
			<description>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the Hamas terror group misfired a projectile at IDF troops near Shifa Hospital in Gaza. However, Hamas-run media immediately stated that the strike was carried out by the IDF. The IDF Arab Spokesman Avichay Adraee confirmed that a rocket-propelled grenade hit the hospital, and Hamas was responsible for the failed missile. The IDF also reported that they controlled the Hamas Beach Brigade's Badr site and eliminated approximately 150 Hamas terrorists. The 401st Armored Brigade destroyed the military command headquarters, rocket launch sites, and manufacturing sites for weapons and rocket launchers. About 30 Hamas saboteurs were found inside the Blue Beach hotel, using it as a safe haven and to plan attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is trying to avoid harming Gazan civilians, while Hamas is preventing civilians from moving to safe zones and using them as human shields. Netanyahu also accused Hamas of using schools, mosques, and hospitals as terror command centers. The Israeli Foreign Ministry revised the death toll of last month's Hamas attacks to nearly 1200.</description>

			<title>This is how London tackled air pollution. Delhi can learn</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/this-is-how-london-tackled-air-pollution-delhi-can-learn/1841039/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the issue of air pollution in London and Delhi, highlighting the steps taken by London to improve air quality and suggesting similar actions should be taken in India. In 1952, London experienced a severe fog that led to thousands of deaths and prompted the implementation of the Clean Air Act. Over time, coal was replaced with gas, power plants were cleaned up, and emission standards were introduced. London has also implemented low emission zones and restrictions on polluting vehicles. Despite not meeting WHO guidelines, London's air quality is better than Delhi's. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action in India, where an estimated 1.6 million people die from air pollution each year. Road dust and vehicular pollution are major contributors, and collective action is required to address the issue. Improving public transport and reducing vehicle emissions are key solutions. Short-term emergency measures are not enough; sustained action is necessary to clean up the air.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/possession-of-school-run-by-azam-khans-trust-handed-over-to-up-education-department/1841037/</link>
			<description>The possession of Rampur Public School, a property owned by Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's trust, along with an office of the SP leader and another building used for party activities, was handed over to the Secondary Education Department according to a state cabinet decision. Locks were placed on both buildings in the presence of heavy police force, sealing them. The decision to take back ownership of the land leased to the Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Trust, which operates the school, was made due to alleged violations of the lease deed. The old Murtaza School building, previously used as the office of the District Inspector of Schools (DIOS), was also allocated to the trust. The administration has taken possession of both buildings and transferred them to the DIOS. However, SP members protested, claiming that the office was separate from the school's land. The government canceled the 30-year lease and the education department assumed control of the property. Azam Khan and his family are currently in jail after being convicted in a fake birth certificate case.</description>

			<title>Clinical trial in pregnant women aims to detect foetal cardiac defects</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/clinical-trial-in-pregnant-women-aims-to-detect-foetal-cardiac-defects/1841011/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in the journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology has found a link between high levels of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in pregnant women and foetal atrioventricular block (AVB). Foetal AVB occurs when inflammation and scarring prevent electric signals from reaching the heart's ventricles, leading to lifelong pacing and potential fatality. The incidence of AVB increased with higher levels of these antibodies, particularly in women who had a previous child with AVB. The study also showed that home-based foetal heart rate monitoring can accurately diagnose conduction problems, reducing the need for repeated echocardiograms. The researchers emphasize the importance of monitoring antibody levels in pregnant women to determine the risk and need for surveillance.</description>

			<title>Obinutuzumab trial yields promising outcomes in patients with lupus nephritis</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/obinutuzumab-trial-yields-promising-outcomes-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis/1841009/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Researchers have found that obinutuzumab, an antibody that targets immune cells, is effective in preserving kidney function and preventing flares in patients with lupus nephritis. The study, published in Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology, showed that adding obinutuzumab to lupus nephritis treatment reduced the risk of mortality, decline in kidney function, or treatment failure by 60% compared to standard care. It also lowered the incidence of lupus nephritis relapses by 57% and improved kidney function. Additionally, a higher percentage of obinutuzumab-treated patients achieved complete remission of lupus nephritis without the need for as many glucocorticoids. The findings suggest that obinutuzumab may help preserve kidney survival and improve outcomes for patients with lupus nephritis.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/over-80-per-cent-of-afghan-repatriates-possess-valid-documentation/1841007/</link>
			<description>Authorities in Pakistan are facing challenges in the repatriation process of Afghan refugees due to difficulties in verifying their identification documents. More than 80% of Afghans sent to transit centers possess some form of identification, including Afghan Citizenship Cards (ACC), Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, and computerized national identity cards (CNIC). However, there is currently no streamlined verification process in place, causing significant delays. Officials have requested assistance from the Sindh Home Department and urged collaboration with the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) to facilitate the verification process. Additionally, efforts have been intensified to accelerate the repatriation process, with over 180 "illegal" Afghans sent to the Chaman border for repatriation.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/important-cases-heard-by-the-supreme-court-on-nov-10/1841001/</link>
			<description>The Supreme Court heard several important cases on Friday, November 10. Here are the key highlights: 

1. The court emphasized that the decision on implementing the odd-even car rationing scheme in Delhi should be made by the city government, not the court.

2. The court warned that burning crop residue in Punjab and neighboring states must stop, and a "carrot and stick" policy is needed to address this issue. Failure to take action will have negative consequences for everyone, especially children.

3. The court expressed concern over the alleged delay by Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi in giving assent to bills passed by the assembly. The court sought a response from the central government regarding the state government's petition accusing the Raj Bhawan of delaying legislation.

4. The court criticized the Punjab governor for casting doubt on the validity of an assembly session and withholding his decision indefinitely on bills passed by the House.

5. The court reprimanded the Uttar Pradesh government for not complying with its order to provide counseling to a Muslim boy and his classmates who were instructed by their teacher to slap him for not completing his homework.

6. The court granted protection from arrest to two journalists who challenged summons issued by Gujarat Police related to an article they allegedly wrote about Adani Group.

7. The court refused to stay proceedings before the Allahabad High Court regarding suits related to the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah dispute, stating that it would not be fair to interfere without hearing both sides.

8. The Nagaland government informed the court that a bill reserving 33% of seats in urban local bodies for women has been passed by the state assembly, and elections will be completed by April 30 next year.

9. The court declined to entertain a plea seeking guidelines from the central government for protecting Hinduism in India.

			<title>SC talks tough on Punjab, TN governors ‘sitting over’ bills, says don’t ‘play with fire’</title>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has criticized the governors of Punjab and Tamil Nadu for delaying approval of bills passed by their respective state legislatures. The court warned Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit against "playing with fire" and expressed concern over his Chennai counterpart, who was accused of withholding assent to 12 bills. The court emphasized that as the titular head of the state, the governor cannot question the validity of an assembly session or indefinitely delay decisions on bills. It cited Article 200 of the Constitution, which outlines the governor's options when presented with a bill. The court also questioned the Punjab government for repeatedly adjourning the budget session instead of proroguing it. In a similar case, the court deemed the delay by Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi in granting assent to bills a "matter of serious concern" and sought a response from the central government.</description>

			<title>South Korea: President Yoon’s war against “fake news” raises concerns over free speech</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/south-korea-president-yoons-war-against-fake-news-raises-concerns-over-free-speech/1840994/</link>
			<description>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.</description>
