			<title>Pakistan: 2 seminary teachers accused of ‘raping students’, one arrested</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-2-seminary-teachers-accused-of-raping-students-one-arrested/1849660/</link>
			<description>Two teachers from a seminary in Chakwal, Pakistan, have been accused of sexually assaulting and torturing students, according to an FIR. The teachers, Zeeshan and Anis, allegedly threatened students and made knife marks on their bodies. One suspect, Anis, has been arrested, while Zeeshan remains on the run. This incident is similar to a previous case in 2021 where a seminary teacher in Rawalpindi was arrested for sexually assaulting and torturing a student. The victim in that case claimed to have been drugged and tortured after resisting the teacher's advances.</description>

			<title>Pak: Grenade attack on police van in Balochistan, assailants flee</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pak-grenade-attack-on-police-van-in-balochistan-assailants-flee/1849657/</link>
			<description>Unidentified assailants carried out a targeted assault by throwing a hand grenade at a police van in Balochistan's Naseerabad district in Pakistan. The attack resulted in partial damage to the vehicle, but the policemen inside were unharmed. The attackers managed to escape the scene. In response, heavy contingents of police and the Counter-Terrorism Department were deployed to secure the area. This incident follows a similar attack last month when a Deputy Superintendent Police's vehicle was targeted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Kurram district. Investigations are ongoing, and authorities are working to apprehend those responsible for these attacks on law enforcement personnel and their vehicles.</description>

			<title>Volunteers give first aid to Israeli agriculture in war time</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/volunteers-give-first-aid-to-israeli-agriculture-in-war-time/1849655/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The ongoing Gaza war is causing a crisis in agriculture in Israel, with farmers unable to plant crops due to the conflict. This has led to a shortage of produce, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and carrots. Many farms near the Gaza Strip and the Lebanese border have been devastated by Hamas terrorists, and the situation is further exacerbated by the return of Thai agricultural workers to their home country. To address the shortage of workers, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Employment Service have launched an initiative to pair unemployed Israelis with farms in need of extra hands. Salaries will be doubled in areas near the conflict zones.</description>

			<title>US announces new sanctions against Iran-backed militia groups, designates them as ‘global terrorists’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-announces-new-sanctions-against-iran-backed-militia-groups-designates-them-as-global-terrorists/1849652/</link>
			<description>The United States has imposed new sanctions on the militia group Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS) and its secretary-general, Hashim Finyan Rahim al-Saraji, designating them as "specially designated global terrorists." The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned six individuals affiliated with the Iran-aligned militia group Kata'ib Hizballah (KH). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the KSS's terrorist activities have threatened the lives of US and global coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria. Blinken also noted that Iran has supported KSS, KH, and other Iran-aligned militia groups with training, funding, and sophisticated weapons. The investigation into the Hamas massacre at the Re'im music festival on October 7 has revised the death toll to 364, with 40 festival attendees being taken hostage in Gaza. The investigation suggests that Hamas was allegedly unaware of the music festival prior to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the IDF does not plan to keep soldiers inside Gaza after the war, and stressed the need for a civilian administration in Gaza committed to ending funding for terrorism. Israel will maintain overall military responsibility for Gaza but seeks a cultural change and rejects anyone who shares Hamas' goals.</description>

			<title>Soccer-Lacklustre England seal top spot with win over Malta</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/soccer-lacklustre-england-seal-top-spot-with-win-over-malta/1849649/</link>
			<description>England secured a 2-0 home victory against Malta in a lacklustre performance that disappointed the Wembley Stadium crowd. The only goal until the 75th minute came from an own goal by Enrico Pepe. Captain Harry Kane later doubled England's lead. Despite the win, several fringe players failed to impress. The victory ensured England's top spot in Group C and moved them closer to a top seeding at Euro 2024. However, their performance was underwhelming, with Malta posing more attacking threats in the first half. England will face tougher tests in upcoming friendlies against Belgium and Brazil.</description>

			<title>Analysis-Indo-Pacific trade deal prospects dim as 2024 US election year politics loom</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-indo-pacific-trade-deal-prospects-dim-as-2024-us-election-year-politics-loom/1849643/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Biden administration's efforts to negotiate an ambitious Asia trade deal are facing challenges, according to trade experts and business groups. The administration aimed to complete key chapters of its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative trade "pillar" but encountered resistance from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, who were unwilling to commit to strong labor and environmental standards with binding enforcement provisions. Despite completing non-binding pillars on clean energy cooperation and anti-corruption measures, the lack of trade outcomes overshadowed these achievements. Some experts believe that election-year pressures make a deal unlikely, similar to the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2016. The administration had hoped to limit the scope of the IPEF trade pillar to avoid political blowback but faced skepticism from stakeholders due to its lack of ambition. Trade deals typically take a long time to negotiate, and the tight deadline ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit was seen as a constraint. Meanwhile, China expressed interest in aligning with Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) standards, signaling its desire to expand high-standard free trade areas.</description>

			<title>Israel renews call for Gazans to flee key southern city</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israel-renews-call-for-gazans-to-flee-key-southern-city/1849639/</link>
			<description>Israel has warned Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to relocate westward away from the line of fire and closer to humanitarian aid, indicating a potential attack on Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north. The Israeli government aims to protect civilians from being caught in the crossfire but such a move could worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the area. Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militant group controlling Gaza since their attack into Israel on October 7th that resulted in many deaths and hostages taken. The Israeli assault on Gaza City has left two-thirds of its population homeless, leading to fears of permanent displacement. Gaza health authorities report over 12,000 deaths, including 5,000 children, although these figures are not frequently updated due to data collection challenges. Despite international calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pauses, the conflict shows no signs of abating. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and increase aid as per the United Nations' requests amid concerns of starvation and disease. The Al Shifa hospital, a primary target in Israel's ground assault, is under scrutiny for alleged use by Hamas as a command headquarters, although hospital staff deny these claims. A premature baby and an elderly captive from Israel have died recently, further deepening the humanitarian crisis.</description>

			<title>Liberia President George Weah concedes election defeat to Joseph Boakai</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/liberia-president-george-weah-concedes-election-defeat-to-joseph-boakai/1849637/</link>
			<description>Liberia President George Weah has conceded defeat in the country's election to opposition leader Joseph Boakai. Boakai, a former vice president, secured 50.9% of the vote, while Weah received 49.1%. This marks a turnaround from the previous election in 2017, where Weah won by a large margin. Weah's concession ensures a smooth transition of power and Liberia's second democratic transfer in over seven decades. The country has been grappling with poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, and inadequate electricity supply. Many people have become disillusioned with Weah's lack of progress in addressing these issues. Boakai's supporters celebrated the victory in the capital, Monrovia, with dancing and honking car horns. Boakai emphasized a message of peace and reconciliation and his commitment to bring about positive changes in the country. Liberia is still recovering from two civil wars and a devastating Ebola epidemic.</description>

			<title>Israeli govt approves regular fuel deliveries to Gaza amid humanitarian concerns</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israeli-govt-approves-regular-fuel-deliveries-to-gaza-amid-humanitarian-concerns/1849635/</link>
			<description>Two fuel tankers carrying 60,000 liters of diesel fuel entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing after approval from Israel's war cabinet. The fuel is authorized for use by international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It will support desalination facilities providing water to the southern strip, with oversight led by the United States and Egypt. This decision allows two fuel tankers per day to enter Gaza, providing crucial support to the water and sewage systems that are on the verge of collapse due to a lack of electricity. Additionally, the fuel will be used for UN relief agency trucks, waste disposal, bakeries, hospitals in southern Gaza, and generators for cell phones and internet services. The decision was made in consultation with the Israel Defence Forces and Israel's International Security Academy to ensure it aligns with operational objectives and does not support Hamas. The rationale behind the decision is to prevent the spread of pandemics and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, there has been criticism within the Israeli government, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling for a reversal of the policy. Fuel shortages have worsened water and sewage issues in Gaza, affecting approximately 70% of the population. This move to allow fuel deliveries comes after pressure from the US.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/5-countries-seek-international-criminal-court-probe-into-potential-crimes-in-palestinian-territories/1849631/</link>
			<description>Five countries, South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros, and Djibouti, have jointly submitted a referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC), calling for an investigation into potential crimes in Palestinian territories. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan stated that a State Party can refer a situation to the ICC if crimes within its jurisdiction appear to have been committed. The ICC is already conducting an investigation into the situation in Palestinian territories, focusing on potential crimes since June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank. Israeli troops are prepared to advance wherever Hamas is found, and tensions continue to rise on the ground. Israeli leaders have asserted control over the northern part of Gaza, and there are indications of a possible ground offensive in the southern part. Israel's Defence Minister has declared that the ground operations will last for months and include both the north and south of Gaza.</description>

			<title>European Parliament reach provisional agreement on environmental crime law</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/european-parliament-reach-provisional-agreement-on-environmental-crime-law/1849625/</link>
			<description>The Council presidency and European Parliament negotiators have reached a provisional agreement on a proposed EU law that aims to enhance the investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes. This new directive replaces the outdated 2008 directive and establishes minimum rules for defining criminal offenses and sanctions in order to protect the environment more effectively. The directive provides a precise definition of environmental crime and introduces new types of offenses, while also harmonizing penalties for individuals and legal entities across all EU member states. The number of offenses under EU criminal law will be increased from nine to 18, including timber trafficking, illegal recycling of polluting ship components, and serious breaches of chemical legislation. Additionally, the agreement includes a provision for "qualified offenses" that cause significant and irreversible damage to ecosystems, natural habitats, or air, soil, and water quality. The agreement still requires confirmation by both institutions before proceeding with the formal adoption procedure.</description>

			<description>Sam Altman, CEO and co-founder of OpenAI, has unexpectedly left the company and resigned from its board. OpenAI revealed that the board no longer had confidence in Altman's leadership abilities due to his lack of candor in communications. Mira Murati, the chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO while a search is conducted for a permanent successor. Altman's departure is surprising given his role as a prominent figure in the AI industry. OpenAI, originally a nonprofit, transitioned to a for-profit structure after receiving a significant investment from Microsoft in 2019. The company has expanded and attracted executives from tech giants like Apple and Amazon. This shift suggests a departure from OpenAI's original nonprofit mission.</description>

			<title>Day 6: Giant drill bores 24 metres into rubble, backup equipment too on way</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/day-6-giant-drill-bores-24-metres-into-rubble-backup-equipment-too-on-way/1849530/</link>
			<description>Rescue workers in Uttarakhand have made progress in their efforts to free 40 workers trapped inside a collapsed tunnel. They have bored through 24 meters of rubble, less than half the distance needed to reach the trapped workers. A backup machine is being flown in from Indore to assist in the rescue operation. The machine currently in use, an American auger machine, has been working at a slower pace than expected. The trapped workers are being sent supplies through pipes and constant communication is maintained with them. The rescue operation involves inserting six-meter sections of steel pipes as the machine drills through the debris. The operation has been periodically paused to address technical issues and fumes created by the machine. While vertical drilling is being considered, the current method of horizontal drilling is considered the best option. Families of the trapped workers have been allowed to speak to them through a pipe. The operation involves 165 personnel from multiple agencies.</description>

The line, which runs between Belapur and Pendhar, was opened to the public without an official program on the direction of Chief Minister Eknath Shinde. The NCP claims that the metro was ready for public use six months ago but was not inaugurated due to the government's inability to secure an appointment with the Prime Minister. The party criticized the government for prioritizing publicity over the convenience of the common people. The metro service will operate with a frequency of 15 minutes, and fares will range from Rs. 10 to Rs. 40 depending on the distance traveled. The route has 11 stations and a depot located at Taloja Panchanand.</description>

			<description>The Delhi High Court has urged members of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) to show sensitivity and use vernacular language when dealing with cases involving children conceived from alleged sexual assault. The court made these remarks in a POCSO case, in which a child born to a woman who only knew Urdu was surrendered and then put up for adoption. The court emphasized the importance of explaining the proceedings in a language understood by the victim and her mother. The court also appointed a lawyer to assist in considering the issues surrounding the case. The court sought information on whether the CWC had procedures in place to explain the provisions related to surrendering children in vernacular language. Furthermore, the court questioned who the legal guardian of the child would be when both biological parents were alive and in a consensual relationship.</description>

			<title>Australian telco Optus tells lawmakers it had no plan to address total outage</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/australian-telco-optus-tells-lawmakers-it-had-no-plan-to-address-total-outage/1848369/</link>
			<description>Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, did not have a crisis plan in place when a nationwide network outage occurred, leaving half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours. The company's executive admitted that their defences had failed and they were not prepared for an outage of that scale. Optus had recently conducted scenario simulations, but they did not anticipate a nationwide shutdown because they had alternate connections built into their network. The outage highlighted concerns about the resilience of Australia's telecommunications networks, following a data breach at Optus last year. The government plans to introduce stricter cyber security reporting standards and mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks across all sectors. The outage was caused by a failure of the company's defensive filters, which led to data overload and the inability to send data on alternate routes. The outage lasted for 12 hours as Optus had to physically reboot their routers and core network devices. The CEO of Optus stated that the company followed up on all incidents, but 228 calls to the emergency hotline failed to connect during the outage. The company also discussed their reliance on third-party contractors and the need to evaluate the appropriate level of outsourcing. Singtel, the parent company of Optus, stated that the software upgrade was not the direct cause of the outage.</description>

The four-hour-long meeting resulted in agreements on various issues including China's action on fentanyl, the resumption of military-to-military communications, and discussions on artificial intelligence. The New York Times noted a change in China's stance, as the Chinese leader sought American financial investments and a break in technology export controls. The Washington Post highlighted the importance of dialogue and regular communication between the two countries, emphasizing that robust engagement is preferable to disengagement or confrontation. President Biden emphasized the importance of a stable relationship between the world's two largest economies, stating that the US is diversifying its economic relationship with China rather than decoupling.</description>

			<title>Asia stocks sit on weekly gains as yields, oil fall</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/asia-stocks-sit-on-weekly-gains-as-yields-oil-fall/1848366/</link>
			<description>Asian shares took a pause on Friday, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan easing from a two-month high but still up for the week. The slump in oil prices and softer U.S. economic data weighed on Wall Street, while boosting bonds and impacting the inflation outlook. The sell-off in oil was likely driven by algorithmic and trend-following funds, causing prices to slide to four-month lows. Walmart's announcement of planned price cuts for the holiday season also added to disinflationary concerns. In Japan, the Nikkei added 0.1%, supported by the Bank of Japan's commitment to its loose policy. Chinese blue chips were lower, as Alibaba Group's Hong Kong shares slumped after it abandoned its cloud business spin-off plans. Bond markets reacted positively to the U.S. inflation report, with future expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve increasing. Treasury yields fell, resulting in a weaker dollar and boosting gold prices.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-iran-enriches-more-uranium-as-gaza-war-rages-us-vote-looms/1848363/</link>
			<description>Efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear program are facing significant challenges, leaving the United States and its allies with limited options. Talks to revive a nuclear deal have stalled, and tougher actions against Iran risk escalating tensions in an already volatile region. Despite Iran's consistent denial of seeking nuclear weapons, confidential reports indicate that the country now possesses enough uranium enriched up to 60% purity to make three bombs. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election further restricting Washington's flexibility, President Joe Biden cannot currently consider a more informal "understanding" with Iran. Iran's stonewalling of the International Atomic Energy Agency has hindered monitoring efforts, and an accommodation with Iran on the nuclear issue is politically unfeasible at this time. Western powers are now likely to focus on a non-binding statement rather than a resolution to avoid pushing Iran to further nuclear escalation. In the coming months, efforts will be made to strengthen oversight of Iran's nuclear program, although it remains uncertain whether Iran will ultimately become a nuclear state.</description>

			<title>As Gaza weeps, Kolkata sleeps. What happened to the ‘city of protests’?</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/as-gaza-weeps-kolkata-sleeps-what-happened-to-the-city-of-protests/1847724/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the decline of protests and civil society action in Kolkata, India. The author reminisces about the city's history of vibrant protests and processions that brought about significant change, but laments that the current protests are often driven by self-interest rather than noble causes. The author questions why there has been little agitation from students, intellectuals, and the general public in Kolkata regarding recent events such as the Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza. The article highlights the contrast between the current state of Kolkata and its past as a city known for rebellion and activism. It also mentions specific incidents, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi having to be airlifted during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests and the cancellation of a political play called Barricade. The author expresses concern that Kolkata may have lost its conscience and calls for a revival of protest culture in the city.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/health/india-among-10-countries-with-most-infants-who-missed-1st-measles-shot-report-by-who-us-cdc/1847731/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that approximately 11 lakh children in India did not receive the first measles vaccination in 2022, placing the country among the top 10 countries with the highest number of infants missing this crucial shot. This comes after several districts in five Indian states reported measles outbreaks last year. Measles is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects young children, and it can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and brain inflammation. The mortality rate for measles is typically 1-3%, but it can be higher during outbreaks. The report also highlights an increase in reported measles cases and deaths globally in 2022 compared to the previous year. The vaccination coverage for measles in low-income countries remains below the recommended 95% coverage with two doses. India had initially set 2015 as the target for eliminating measles and rubella, but the target has been pushed to the end of this year.</description>

They have urged President Biden to press Beijing to engage in direct dialogue with representatives of the Tibetan people. The organization believes that Tibetans, Uyghurs, and other groups have been denied the freedom to voice their grievances and seek redress from the Chinese government. The Biden administration has an opportunity to push for their voices to be heard. The White House, however, stated that Biden did raise concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong during the meeting. Biden also emphasized the importance of peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences and expressed concerns about China's unfair trade policies.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, criticized Israel's invasion of Gaza, stating that it has destroyed decades of work towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has set the region on fire. Safadi believes Israel's actions do not provide security and instead kill innocent Palestinians. He stated that Israel's war against Hamas has pushed regional relations back by more than 30 years. The discussions between Jordan and Israel regarding exchanging solar power for energy have halted due to the ongoing ground offensive in Gaza. Safadi dismissed Israel's claim that Hamas had a command node under the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City as "ridiculous" and an "insult to intelligence." He also disputed Israel's self-defense claim, describing their actions as raw vengeance. The US expressed concern for Jordanian medics who were injured in shelling near their field hospital in Gaza.</description>

			<title>The Democracy Forum holds webinar on ‘Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh – the subcontinental Brotherhood?’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/the-democracy-forum-holds-webinar-on-jamaat-e-islami-bangladesh-the-subcontinental-brotherhood/1848070/</link>
			<description>The Democracy Forum (TDF) recently organized a webinar titled 'Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh - the subcontinental Brotherhood?' to discuss the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and its potential impact on the country's democratic process. The webinar examined the circumstances surrounding the re-emergence of Jamaat-e-Islami as a democratic movement after a decade of political isolation.

Lord Bruce, the TDF President, highlighted the history of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was established in 1941 with the aim of incorporating Islamic ideology into all aspects of state governance. Although Jamaat-e-Islami is considered Bangladesh's most populous and well-organized political movement, it has not been close to exercising power since 2006 due to evidence of violence and intimidation linked to the party. For the past 15 years, Jamaat has been proscribed as a political actor.

During the webinar, various speakers shared their perspectives on Jamaat-e-Islami. Professor Shafi Mostofa discussed Jamaat's history, agenda, and its controversial role in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. Mohammed Sinan Siyech examined Jamaat's transnational connections and organizational structure, while Maidul Islam assessed the party's influence in contemporary Bangladeshi politics and the challenges it faces.

There appears to be a tactical shift within Jamaat's leadership as they consider changing their position from the time of the Bangladesh Liberation War. However, some argue that fundamental positions have not changed despite a softer rhetoric. Dr. Md Nazrul Islam explored the theme of Jamaat and democracy, suggesting that political Islam and democracy are not necessarily incompatible and that Jamaat has shown support for constitutionalism and electoral politics.

Overall, the webinar provided a platform for discussing Jamaat-e-Islami's role in Bangladesh's political landscape and its potential impact on democracy.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-pledges-strong-partnership-with-india-says-us-committed-to-strengthen-semiconductor-supply-chain/1848065/</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden has reiterated the country's commitment to strengthen the semiconductor supply chain, with a focus on collaborative efforts with key nations including India. Biden emphasized the importance of working together with India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore to strengthen the critical semiconductor industry. The launch of new initiatives aimed at shaping technologies and standards in the semiconductor sector reflects a shared commitment to addressing the challenges of the evolving technological landscape and fostering innovation in a collaborative manner. India, specifically mentioned by President Biden, is set to play a pivotal role in this global initiative. The strengthened partnership between the US and India in the semiconductor domain signifies both countries' commitment to technological advancement and underscores the strategic importance of India as a key player in the global technology landscape. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the semiconductor supply chain and innovation partnership was signed between India and the US in March of this year, aiming to establish a collaborative mechanism between the two governments. The MOU seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of both countries, facilitate commercial opportunities, and develop semiconductor innovation ecosystems. The bilateral trade relationship between India and the US has seen robust growth, and the US is one of the top sources of foreign direct investment for India. The APEC leadership summit meeting, hosted by the US and chaired by President Biden, is taking place in San Francisco. India, while being a major economy, is not a part of APEC.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Rory McIlroy, the former world number one golfer, encountered an unusual situation during the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. His tee shot on the 13th hole landed on a woman's lap, leading to a light-hearted moment on the course. McIlroy pretended to take his next shot from her lap before calling for a referee. The referee jokingly told the woman to pass the ball back to McIlroy, and she did so before moving aside. McIlroy was then able to continue playing, ultimately making a bogey. In another unusual occurrence, McIlroy and another player both hit the wooden bridge on the 18th hole. Nicolai Hojgaard, Julien Guerrier, and Matthieu Pavon tied for the lead with a score of five-under par.</description>

			<title>Researchers develop ultrasound patch to measure how full bladder is</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/researchers-develop-ultrasound-patch-to-measure-how-full-bladder-is/1847975/</link>
			<description>Researchers at MIT have developed a wearable patch that uses ultrasound technology to monitor organs within the body. The patch, made of silicone rubber and embedded with ultrasound arrays, can accurately photograph and assess bladder fullness without the need for an operator or gel application. This innovation could greatly benefit individuals with bladder or kidney diseases by enabling easier monitoring of organ functionality. The researchers believe this technology has the potential to be used for other deep tissue organs, aiding in the early detection of conditions like ovarian cancer. The patch is easy to attach and detach from the skin and produces images comparable to traditional ultrasound probes. The team aims to create a portable device for viewing the images, potentially bridging the gap between clinicians and patients. Further developments are expected to expand the use of ultrasound devices for imaging various organs in the body.</description>

			<title>Pancreatic cancer discovery opens door for new clinical trial: Research</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/pancreatic-cancer-discovery-opens-door-for-new-clinical-trial-research/1847968/</link>
			<description>Researchers at the University of Rochester's Wilmot Cancer Institute have made a significant advance in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. They have discovered the genetic changes that occur during tumor migration and identified a medication, known as np137, that may block the process. The next step is a clinical trial planned for early 2024 at the University of Rochester to test the drug's safety and effectiveness on pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to the liver. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and has a low survival rate, with the number of cases predicted to rise. The researchers focused on understanding the biology of metastatic pancreatic cancer since the cancer spreads early during its development and the cells become genetically reprogrammed as they migrate to the liver, making them resistant to standard treatment. The trial will likely involve eligible patients taking np137 before surgery, undergoing surgery to remove the cancer, and then continuing with the medication and chemotherapy afterwards. The study was funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.</description>

			<title>Researchers find how hunger hormones impact decision-making brain area to drive behavior</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/researchers-find-how-hunger-hormones-impact-decision-making-brain-area-to-drive-behavior/1847958/</link>
			<description>A recent study conducted by researchers at UCL (University College London) has found that a hunger hormone produced in the gut can directly influence the decision-making area of the brain, known as the hippocampus. The study, which was conducted on mice, is the first to demonstrate how hunger hormones can impact brain activity when an animal is thinking about food. The researchers discovered that the ventral hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in decision-making, is sensitive to the levels of hunger hormones in the gut. When the mice were hungry, there was less neural activity in this area, allowing them to eat. Conversely, when the mice were full, activating the ventral hippocampal neurons stopped them from eating.

Alibaba's second-quarter revenue was in line with analyst expectations.

			<description>Fitch, a ratings agency, stated that the recent cyberattack on ICBC Financial Services will not significantly affect its Chinese parent. However, this incident highlights the increasing threat to global payment networks from cyberattacks. The attack on the US arm of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China disrupted trades and had an impact on the US treasuries market. Fitch does not expect the incident to immediately impact the viability rating of the parent bank or its issuer default rating, as it anticipates support from the Chinese sovereign.

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-rises-as-data-suggests-more-fed-patience-on-rate-cuts/1847477/</link>
			<description>The US dollar gained some ground after a volatile two days of trading. The dollar index rose by 0.2% to 104.53 after a 1.51% drop on Wednesday, the largest in a year. The euro remained flat, while sterling dipped 0.2%. The dollar also weakened slightly against the yen. The currency was supported by better-than-expected retail sales and signs of cooling inflation, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts. Traders believe that rates will not rise, but the odds of a rate cut by March have fallen from 1-in-3 to less than 1-in-4. Analysts caution that market expectations of rate cuts in the past have often been reversed. Other currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, also weakened. Despite a strong rebound in Australian employment, traders focused on the increase in part-time jobs and a higher jobless rate.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/smog-towers-not-practical-solution-to-air-pollution-problem-delhi-pollution-control-body/1847472/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has reported to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that two experimental smog towers in the city have not been effective in reducing air pollution. The DPCC stated that the operation of these costly air purifiers lacks merit and suggested that the structures be repurposed as a museum for the dissemination of technical information on air pollution control. The report highlighted that the smog tower at Connaught Place, which has been operational for two years at a cost of Rs 25 crore, can only mitigate air pollution by up to 17% within a 100-meter radius. The DPCC argued that considering Delhi's large area, the city would require more than 47,000 such towers, making the cost and maintenance unjustified. The central government also expressed that smog towers are not a solution to the air pollution problem in Delhi-NCR and is against installing more of these air purifiers. The two smog towers were installed in 2021 following directions from the Supreme Court.</description>

			<title>Without Rutte, Dutch election centres on cost-of-living, climate and immigration</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/without-rutte-dutch-election-centres-on-cost-of-living-climate-and-immigration/1847471/</link>
			<description>The upcoming Dutch election will not feature Prime Minister Mark Rutte's name on the ballot for the first time in a decade. Voters are primarily concerned with the economy, climate change, and reducing immigration. The election is seen as a test of whether voters are willing to continue funding expensive policies such as offshore wind farms. Despite positive statistics on unemployment, inflation, and national debt, there are underlying concerns about the economy and resentment towards Rutte. Prominent candidates include Rutte's protege, a reformist, and a traditional opponent on the left. Other important issues include plans to cut the number of livestock farms and the country's high electricity bills. The election outcome is expected to result in a new center-right coalition with no major policy shift.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Spain's lower house of parliament has voted to make Pedro Sanchez prime minister for another term, breaking the deadlock following the inconclusive general election in July. Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) reached separate deals with various regional parties to secure their support, including a controversial bill on amnesty for Catalan separatists, which has sparked protests across the country. The amnesty bill would exonerate politicians and activists involved in the Catalonia separation attempt in 2017. The vote saw 179 in favor and 171 against, with Sanchez's bid receiving support from various parties including leftist allies and pro-independence parties. However, the Conservative People's Party, far-right Vox, and People's Union of Navarre voted against Sanchez. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the People's Party, accused Sanchez of undermining the rule of law due to the amnesty bill and called for mass protests. The European Parliament has also approved a debate on whether the amnesty threatens judicial independence in Spain.</description>

			<description>Finland will close four of its nine border crossing points with Russia in an attempt to reduce the flow of asylum seekers to the country. The move comes after Finland's president suggested that the increase in asylum applicants arriving from Russia was in retaliation for the country's defense cooperation with the United States. The four crossings that will be closed are in the southeast of Finland, which are normally the busiest points of travel between the two countries. Asylum seekers will now only be allowed to hand in their applications at two northern border crossings. If the asylum arrivals end, Finland has said it will reverse the closures.</description>

			<description>India has called on Canada to respect the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations after reports of disturbances caused by Khalistani elements at an Indian High Commission consular camp in Canada. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, clarified that there were inaccurate social media reports regarding the incidents. Bagchi emphasized that consular camps are regularly organized by the Indian High Commission and consulates in Canada, and despite attempts by radical elements to cause trouble, the recent camp near Vancouver was held successfully. He also mentioned that no complaint had been received regarding alleged attacks on the Indian community during Diwali celebrations in Canada. The MEA spokesperson further addressed the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada, which began when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged the involvement of "agents of the Indian government" in the killing of a Khalistani terrorist. India rejected these allegations, expelled a Canadian diplomat, and emphasized that Canada has not presented any evidence to support its claims. The article concludes by mentioning that Canada pulled out 41 diplomats from India and halted visa and consular services in certain consulates, while India suspended visa services to Canada but later resumed them for four categories after a security review.</description>

			<title>Philippines rejects China’s call for prior notice on resupply missions</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/philippines-rejects-chinas-call-for-prior-notice-on-resupply-missions/1846738/</link>
			<description>The Philippines stated that it is not obligated to inform China about its resupply missions in the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs called on China to remove its illegal structures within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone and be accountable for the damage caused. China has accused the Philippines of illegally entering its waters during resupply missions, while the Philippines asserts that these missions are legitimate. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that China's claim over the South China Sea had no legal basis, a ruling supported by the US Defense Secretary during a meeting with his Manila counterpart. Since 1999, when the Philippines grounded the Sierra Madre ship at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, China has requested its removal based on an alleged agreement that the Philippines denies. The shoal lies well within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.</description>

			<title>India’s record merchandise trade deficit in Oct likely to be a one-off – analysts</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/indias-record-merchandise-trade-deficit-in-oct-likely-to-be-a-one-off-analysts/1846731/</link>
			<description>India's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in October to a record level of $31.46 billion. This increase was driven by a rise in imports, particularly in oil, gold, and silver imports ahead of the Diwali festive season. However, analysts believe that this spike in imports is likely to be a temporary outlier, and they expect the trade deficit to moderate considerably in November and December. The easing of oil prices also provides some relief. Despite the high trade deficit in October, economists retain their current account deficit (CAD) estimates, expecting it to normalize from November onwards.</description>

			<title>Pakistan: Air pollution crisis intensifies in Lahore</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-air-pollution-crisis-intensifies-in-lahore/1846439/</link>
			<description>Lahore, Pakistan is facing a severe air pollution crisis as the air quality index (AQI) has reached alarming levels. After a brief period of relatively normal air quality, the city saw a sudden spike with a maximum AQI of 401, marking it as extremely unsafe for breathing. Although there was a slight improvement in the afternoon with the AQI dropping to 188, the air quality deteriorated again in the evening, reaching an AQI of 236. As a result, Lahore now ranks third on the list of the most polluted cities globally. The current readings indicate a severe threat to public health.

Different areas of Lahore showed varying levels of air pollution, with Fida Hussain House reporting an AQI of 364 and WWF Pakistan at 231. The decline in air quality during winter months, from October to February, is a common occurrence in Lahore. Crop burning by farmers in the Punjab province contributes to smog, while weather changes trap pollutants in the air for longer periods.

The main contributors to air pollution in Lahore are vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and waste, dust from construction sites, and deforestation. Temperature inversion worsens winter air pollution by preventing the upward movement of pollutants and causing their accumulation.

Experts recommend providing real-time air quality data to the public with greater detail to help individuals protect themselves and contribute to efforts against air pollution. Reducing industrial and vehicular emissions is crucial for improving air quality. Urgent and coordinated efforts are needed to address the root causes of air pollution and protect the health and well-being of Lahore's residents.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Nations Security Council has approved a resolution urging humanitarian pauses in Gaza. The resolution received support from twelve states, while the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom abstained from the vote. The resolution highlights the need for extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza to ensure safe and unhindered access for UN humanitarian agencies. Human Rights Watch praised the resolution as a strong message to Israel, Hamas, and other armed groups to comply with international humanitarian law. Previously, the US vetoed a similar draft resolution proposed by Brazil. The recent vote reflects the US's desire for more time for diplomatic efforts. The situation in Gaza remains complex, with ongoing scrutiny and international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis.</description>

			<title>Work on monument to commemorate 1st Indians in South Africa to begin soon: Govt</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/work-on-monument-to-commemorate-1st-indians-in-south-africa-to-begin-soon-govt/1846436/</link>
			<description>The South African government has announced that work on a monument to honor the first Indian indentured laborers' arrival in the country will begin soon. The monument, which was supposed to be built in 2010, commemorates the arrival of the first Indians in Durban in 1860 to work on sugar cane plantations. The delay in constructing the monument was due to funding issues and disagreements within the community regarding its design. The provincial KwaZulu-Natal Department of Sport, Arts, and Culture has awarded the tender for the four-million-rand monument, and it will be constructed at Ushaka Beach in Durban. The monument will include an arch with a bell tower, symbolizing the bell used to call workers to work during times of slavery and indenture. The design will also incorporate the names of the two ships that brought the indentured laborers engraved on metal sheets. While some members of the community have expressed satisfaction with the announcement, others believe that their original proposal, depicting a sugar cane cutter and his wife in a field, was ignored. Despite the differing opinions, there is a call for the monument to be completed as soon as possible, emphasizing the importance of unity in diversity.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Scientists at the Gene Centre Munich have discovered a new mechanism by which cells detect and repair crosslinking damage to single-stranded RNA. Previous research had focused on repairing crosslinking damage to DNA, but this study reveals the harmful effects of such damage on protein synthesis. The researchers used a novel approach to induce and study RNA damage in the absence of DNA damage, leading to the identification of the ribosome as a sensor for crosslinking damage. The findings have implications for the mechanisms of action of commonly used anti-cancer drugs. Aldehydes, which are produced in the body through metabolic processes, are toxic because they bind to macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins and crosslink them.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The White House National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, has accused Hamas of violating the law of war by using Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza as their headquarters. Kirby stated that the hospital is an active legitimate hospital, and they want to protect its patients. The US did not provide prior approval to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for their raid on the hospital because they do not expect Israel to give advance notice of its military operations. Kirby further mentioned that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including Al Shifa, to conceal and support their military operations. The IDF has confirmed that they are conducting operations in the hospital based on intelligence information and operational necessity, with the goal of defeating Hamas and rescuing hostages. The IDF has repeatedly warned Hamas about the misuse of the hospital, and despite evacuation efforts, military activities within the hospital did not cease. The IDF emphasized that their war is against Hamas, not the people of Gaza, and it is doing everything possible to minimize harm to civilians and facilitate the transfer of medical supplies and food. Israeli troops have also captured several Hamas governmental buildings in Gaza City.</description>

			<description>A 27-year-old man, Ravi Rana, has been arrested in Delhi's Alipur area for his involvement in an attack on a 45-year-old woman and her 21-year-old daughter on Diwali. The victims were shot at by two men while they were on their way to perform a religious ritual. Rakesh Devi, the woman, was a witness in her husband's murder case. Rana, who is Devi's nephew, allegedly hired the men to kill her. The motive behind the attack was the property dispute between the two families, which had escalated previously with Rana's alleged involvement in the murder of Devi's husband. Efforts are being made to apprehend the attackers.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/shut-up-stop-taking-potshots-at-india-gavaskar-on-pitch-controversy/1846374/</link>
			<description>Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has dismissed conspiracy theories surrounding the pitch for the World Cup semifinal between India and New Zealand, calling those spreading such rumors "morons." Reports had emerged before the match that the Indian cricket team management had requested a "slow pitch" to assist the home team's spinners. However, India went on to win the semifinal by 70 runs, with pacer Mohammed Shami taking seven wickets. Gavaskar emphasized that the pitch alteration was for the benefit of both teams and criticized people for talking about potential pitch changes in future matches. The International Cricket Council (ICC) clarified that the independent pitch consultant was consulted before the change of surface. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan expressed his opinion that a fresh pitch should have been used for the semifinal.</description>

			<description>A whale calf stranded on the coast of Ganpatipule in Maharashtra, India, was successfully pushed back into the sea after 40 hours of rescue efforts. The calf, weighing nearly 4 tons, got stuck in the sand near the beach during low tide. Authorities were alerted by locals and tourists, and a rescue operation involving the police, coast guard, and marine experts was initiated. Initial attempts to push the whale calf back into the sea failed, but rescuers kept it hydrated and covered it with cotton. Veterinary doctors provided fluids to keep it alive. After various attempts, including tying the calf with a belt and dragging it, a tugboat was used to drag the whale calf 7 to 8 nautical miles into the sea. Once back in its natural habitat, the calf swam on its own and disappeared in the sea. The operation involved various stakeholders and was considered rare. Precautionary measures have been put in place in case the calf returns to the coast, including the deployment of forest department, police, and district administration personnel.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/indias-trade-deficit-hits-record-high-in-october-largest-share-of-imports-from-china/1845743/</link>
			<description>India's trade deficit reached a record high of $31.46 billion in October due to increased imports, particularly gold during the festive season. China remains India's largest import source, followed by Russia, which has climbed in rank due to petroleum and oil product imports. Chinese imports are double that of Russia's. In October, Indian imports amounted to $65.03 billion and exports were $33.57 billion. Gold imports witnessed significant growth with a 95.4% increase month-on-month, reaching $7.23 billion. From April to October, gold imports rose from $23.97 billion to $29.48 billion. On the export side, gems and jewellery exports decreased from $23.95 billion to $18.61 billion due to low demand, including conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza impacting US market interest rates and inflation. The industry suggests focusing more on jewellery exports and expects potential benefits from an amended Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act. Other declining exports include petroleum products and organic and inorganic chemicals, affected by global oil price changes.</description>

			<description>Euro zone banks are facing significant financial losses as a result of tech contractors failing to meet their obligations, according to the European Central Bank (ECB). In a recent survey conducted by the ECB, it was found that banks lost €148 million ($160.59 million) in 2022 due to the "unavailability or poor quality of outsourced services," marking a 360% increase from the previous year. The ECB also identified shortcomings in banks' approaches to cyber risks, including hacks, outdated systems, and inadequate outsourcing arrangements. The report highlights the need for banks to properly manage risks arising from reliance on service providers and ensure their IT and cybersecurity risk management aligns with supervisory expectations. The ECB emphasized the importance of addressing these issues to prevent further financial losses and protect against cyber threats.</description>

			<title>Can a Balanced Advantage Fund Help you Withstand Market Volatility?</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/ani-press-releases/can-a-balanced-advantage-fund-help-you-withstand-market-volatility/1845834/</link>
			<description>Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs) are hybrid mutual fund schemes that dynamically manage their portfolio between equity and debt based on market conditions. These funds aim to optimize returns by shifting between asset classes. BAFs have the flexibility to invest in equity, debt, or have a balanced exposure to both. This allows them to generate returns in different market conditions, making them suitable for investment through all economic cycles.

BAFs can help in volatile markets by adapting to changing conditions. Unlike traditional approaches with fixed allocation percentages, BAFs can capitalize on opportunities and manage risks effectively. They deliver returns in both bull and bear phases, capturing the upside during market booms and cushioning losses during downturns. BAFs also provide downside mitigation by increasing debt exposure during volatile phases, balancing the risk of equities. Additionally, professional fund managers continuously monitor market trends and adjust allocations for optimal risk-adjusted returns.

BAFs overcome the limitations of other hybrid schemes by offering more flexible equity-debt rebalancing parameters. Traditional hybrid funds may fail to adapt to extreme market movements due to allocation constraints. Aggressive hybrid funds with high equity allocation limits may decline sharply during steep corrections, while conservative hybrid funds with lower equity caps may miss out on maximizing upside potential. BAFs, on the other hand, have a dynamic and unconstrained approach, optimizing returns in all market environments.

When choosing a suitable BAF, it is important to track the fund manager's record in navigating different markets, evaluate the extent of allocation shifts between equity and debt over the past 5-10 years, consider the consistency and success of returns across bull and bear phases, and assess factors such as portfolio churn, expense ratios, and the experience of the fund management team.

BAFs provide flexibility and can serve as all-season funds across economic cycles. They are a robust long-term investment choice suitable for various financial needs. It is advisable to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative parameters before selecting a BAF as an investment vehicle.</description>

			<title>First UN fuel delivery since start of war crosses from Egypt to Gaza</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/first-un-fuel-delivery-since-start-of-war-crosses-from-egypt-to-gaza/1845824/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The first truck carrying a United Nations fuel shipment entered Gaza from Egypt, marking a small step in alleviating the fuel shortages that have been affecting relief efforts in the region. Israel allowed 24,000 liters of diesel fuel to be delivered for UN aid distribution, but not for use at hospitals. The limited delivery of fuel is just 9% of what is needed daily to sustain life-saving activities in Gaza. The lack of fuel has caused the closure of hospitals, bakeries, and sewage pumping stations, as well as threatening to shut down telecoms data centers and connection points. The UN had warned that it may have to halt humanitarian operations if its fuel stocks became fully depleted. However, aid workers say the initial delivery of fuel is not enough to meet the needs of hospitals or aid deliveries. Despite the delivery of food and supplies, the aid distribution has been significantly affected due to the lack of fuel. Israel had previously refused to allow fuel in, fearing it would be used by Hamas. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas began in response to Hamas fighters crossing into southern Israel. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides.</description>

			<title>Hungary’s call for review of EU policy on Ukraine sets stage for weeks of wrangling</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/hungarys-call-for-review-of-eu-policy-on-ukraine-sets-stage-for-weeks-of-wrangling/1845822/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hungary is challenging the European Union's policy towards Ukraine, disagreeing with other EU countries that support bringing Ukraine closer to the bloc and providing more aid amid the Russian invasion. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties with Moscow, believes the EU's strategy of sending aid has failed and opposes starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. Hungary's opposition is the main obstacle to a decision by EU leaders to begin formal membership talks with Ukraine and allocate €50 billion in aid. Hungary argues for a period of reflection and strategic discussion on the EU's policy towards Ukraine before supporting any decisions on Ukraine's accession process or further aid. This dispute highlights Hungary's concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine and its disagreement with the EU over democratic issues and access to funds. EU officials are exploring ways to bypass a Hungarian veto on aid to Ukraine but recognize the significance of supporting Ukraine's security and credibility. The outcome of the December EU summit and the decision on Ukraine's membership talks remain uncertain due to the need for consensus among member states.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Germany's constitutional court has ruled that the government's plan to use unused emergency funds from the pandemic for climate initiatives is unconstitutional, leaving a 60 billion euro ($65 billion) hole in its finances. This decision complicates budget negotiations within Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition and could set a precedent for future fiscal responses to crises. Finance Minister Christian Lindner will face increased scrutiny on spending control, and the ruling may force the government to make spending cuts. The earmarked funds were intended for energy efficiency, renewable electricity subsidies, chip production, and support for energy-intensive companies. The ruling has significant implications for Germany's fiscal policy and support for decarbonization. Germany's 2024 budget and financial plans through 2027 are being finalized this week as the country curbs spending due to COVID-19 and the Ukraine war.</description>

The targeted area was comprised of civilians, not soldiers. Witnesses described the devastation caused by the missile, with one resident expressing fear for her own safety. Russia has been conducting regular missile and drone strikes on population centers in Ukraine, though Moscow denies intentionally targeting civilians. Ukraine has consistently reported civilian casualties and infrastructure damage resulting from Russia's invasion.</description>

			<title>Russian resources minister visits North Korea amid new missile development</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/russian-resources-minister-visits-north-korea-amid-new-missile-development/1845186/</link>
			<description>A Russian delegation, led by natural resources minister Alexander Kozlov, visited Pyongyang, North Korea. The visit came as the politically isolated state announced progress in its banned ballistic missile program. The talks between Russia and North Korea focused on the economy, science, and technology. Kozlov emphasized Russia's desire for substantial cooperation with North Korea based on agreements made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, a cultural delegation from North Korea traveled to St. Petersburg for an event. South Korea's intelligence agency stated that North Korea is in the final stages of preparing for the launch of a spy satellite, potentially with technical assistance from Russia. North Korean state media reported successful static tests of new high-thrust solid-fuel engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). These tests are seen as essential for enhancing North Korea's military capabilities in a challenging security environment. Solid-fuel missiles are considered easier to operate and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons. Both North Korea's missile program and its nuclear weapons are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions, leading to imposed sanctions. The US has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in the war with Ukraine, while Moscow is alleged to provide technical military support to North Korea. However, both countries deny these claims and pledge closer military cooperation.</description>

			<title>Analysis-Advances give Sudanese paramilitary force momentum in seven-month war</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/analysis-advances-give-sudanese-paramilitary-force-momentum-in-seven-month-war/1845174/</link>
			<description>The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have made significant gains in their war with the army, breaking months of stalemate. These gains have strengthened the RSF's position and influence in talks in Jeddah. While there is speculation about the possibility of Sudan splitting, it remains unclear how the RSF could govern a breakaway territory. Instead, the RSF aims to increase its access to resources, such as gold, and secure its role in any political settlement. The RSF has been expanding its control in various regions, including Darfur and Khartoum, and has expressed its intention to reach Port Sudan. However, there is currently no immediate risk of Sudan splitting. The war between the RSF and the army began after a plan to integrate the two forces fell apart. The RSF has been gradually gaining territory and has recently used drones and longer-range artillery. The army has faced challenges with repairs to its warplanes and fatigue among soldiers. The RSF's advances have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with thousands of casualties and millions displaced. Ceasefire talks in Jeddah have been adjourned without a resolution, with the RSF seeking checkpoints and outposts to formalize its role in Khartoum. The army is under pressure from Bashir loyalists and Islamist militias. The situation remains volatile, and ethnically targeted violence is likely to persist.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-xi-meet-as-us-china-military-economic-tensions-grind-on/1845172/</link>
			<description>US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are meeting for the first time in a year to discuss military conflicts, drug-trafficking, and artificial intelligence. However, deep progress on economic issues may have to wait. The expectations for the meeting are low, as the leaders have been unable to resolve long-standing disagreements on various topics such as Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Israel-Hamas war, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea, and human rights. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco. Demonstrations for and against China's ruling communist party have taken place in the city. Biden has been cultivating a personal relationship with Xi in hopes of salvaging bilateral ties. The meeting is expected to address issues such as Iran's actions, Chinese influence operations in foreign elections, and the status of US citizens detained in China. Concrete steps are expected to be taken on issues ranging from military communications to managing the flow of fentanyl and artificial intelligence technologies. Biden is expected to assure Xi that US commitments in the Indo-Pacific region remain unchanged, particularly regarding the security of the Philippines.</description>

			<title>Central Europe’s defence companies spy African opportunity</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/central-europes-defence-companies-spy-african-opportunity/1845170/</link>
			<description>Central European defense companies are aiming to expand their sales of weapons, military equipment, and related services in Africa. Former Warsaw Pact countries, such as the Czech Republic, have a history of supplying weapons to African nations during the Communist era and are now well-positioned to upgrade these systems. The shift towards Western technology by African countries still using Soviet-era equipment provides new opportunities for Central European defense companies. These companies are negotiating deals for guns, ammunition, military equipment, and services with various African nations. Their expertise in maintaining and modernizing Eastern-origin military land systems appeals to African customers who want to reduce reliance on Russian suppliers. With concerns over the reliability of Russian arms, there is potential for Central European defense companies to fill the gap. Russia has become the leading arms seller in sub-Saharan Africa, but the expertise of Czech industry in former Soviet weapons presents a valuable advantage. Polish defense companies have also intensified their talks with African markets, and interest has increased from potential African customers in Poland. The Czech Republic recently sent a trade mission to several African countries, focusing on boosting opportunities for the defense industry. Reopening and strengthening relationships with traditional partners in Africa is a key goal. Defense industry cooperation is seen as an integral part of these efforts. The Czech arms industry's reputation has been enhanced through its efforts to supply Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion in 2022. As African countries using Soviet-style equipment start to view Russia as a problematic supplier, they are turning to Central European alternatives.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United States Department of Treasury has imposed a third round of sanctions targeting individuals affiliated with Hamas, in coordination with the United Kingdom. The action aims to disrupt Hamas's financial infrastructure and block their funding channels. The sanctions also aim to safeguard the global financial system from potential misuse by Hamas and its supporters. The US Treasury release states that Hamas has been primarily empowered through Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which provides financial assistance, weapons, and training. Key Hamas officials, including Mahmoud Khaled Zahhar, a senior member and co-founder of Hamas, and Mu'ad Ibrahim Muhammed Rashid Al-Atili, have been designated for their involvement with the organization. The sanctions block their property and interests under US control. Financial institutions and individuals engaging in transactions with sanctioned entities may face sanctions or enforcement actions. The US Treasury emphasizes that it will continue to facilitate legal humanitarian aid while preventing funds to terrorists and bad actors.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/afghanistan-refugees-in-torkham-region-appeal-for-relocation-to-their-homes/1845145/</link>
			<description>Refugees who have returned to Afghanistan and are currently residing in the Torkham crossing region are urging the government to speed up the registration and assistance distribution processes so they can return to their homes quickly. They have also requested help from the Taliban before winter arrives. Meanwhile, the Afghan Red Crescent Society acknowledges that food assistance alone cannot solve the difficulties faced by these returnees and will focus more on helping migrants in isolated parts of the country. Since the Pakistani government set a deadline, more Afghan immigrants have been returning through the Torkham border, with approximately 500 families using this route daily. Around 55,000 people have entered the country through the Torkham border within the past month and a half, and many of these families have completed the necessary registration and biometric procedures.</description>

			<title>70% of antibiotic fixed-dose combination drugs sold in India unapproved or banned, finds study</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/70-of-antibiotic-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-sold-in-india-unapproved-or-banned-finds-study/1844410/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent analysis has revealed that government efforts to remove unapproved and banned antibiotic fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs in India have been largely ineffective. The study found that in 2020, the majority of antibiotic formulations sold in India were either unapproved or banned. FDC drugs are combinations of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients in a single drug. While the total number of antibiotic FDC formulations on the market decreased from 574 in 2008 to 395 in 2020, around 70.4% of these formulations were unapproved or banned. Antibiotic resistance is a global concern, making it crucial to address this issue. The study suggests that regular surveys of the market and strengthened enforcement are necessary. Despite regulatory initiatives taken since 2007, hundreds of unapproved antibiotic FDC formulations have remained in the Indian market. Additionally, a considerable portion of antibiotic FDCs sold in India in 2020 were not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The slow progress in removing irrational FDC drugs is attributed to weak and inefficient regulatory enforcement.</description>

			<description>Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in San Francisco for a China-US summit and the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' meeting. US President Joe Biden is set to meet with Jinping in the San Francisco Bay area, aiming to improve relations between the two countries. The meeting is viewed as a positive sign after months of friction, although it is not expected to significantly soften the overall relationship. The leaders hope to develop a framework for managing competitive relations to avoid surprises and clear up misperceptions. Biden's top priority is to restore stability in the Washington-Beijing relationship amidst rising global tensions. They will discuss various issues, including military communication, conflicts in Israel and Ukraine, climate change, countering narcotics trafficking, human rights, and military escalation in the South China Sea and Taiwan. The talks will be expansive and spread out over multiple sessions. The US has pressured China to play a more constructive role in the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts and take a more active role on the world stage.</description>

			<title>US House passes GOP funding bill to avoid government shutdown</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-house-passes-gop-funding-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown/1844955/</link>
			<description>The House of Representatives has passed a bill to prevent a government shutdown before the holiday season, with broad bipartisan support. The bill will now move on to the Senate for consideration. Initially, the House extended government funding until November 17, but due to another impending deadline, leaders agreed on a short-term extension called a continuing resolution (CR). Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently assumed the position, achieved a win by gaining majority support from his GOP Conference for the CR. The bill sets separate deadlines for funding different sectors of the government, with January 19 and February 2 as the target dates. Some conservative members had concerns about the bill's lack of spending cuts and conservative policy riders. However, both the Senate leadership and the White House have indicated their approval, aiming to avoid a shutdown. President Joe Biden is prepared to sign the bill if it passes in the Senate.</description>

			<title>Time to tell Xi Jinping to turn back: Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi ahead of US-China talks</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/time-to-tell-xi-jinping-to-turn-back-congressman-raja-krishnamoorthi-ahead-of-us-china-talks/1844950/</link>
			<description>US lawmaker Raja Krishnamoorthi believes that China's economic decline has given the United States an advantage in negotiations. Ahead of the upcoming summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Krishnamoorthi urges Biden to tell Xi to change course. He highlights the need for China to keep its promises, compete fairly, end genocide, and halt economic and military aggression. Krishnamoorthi emphasizes the importance of being clear-eyed, confident, and strong in dealing with China. He acknowledges the possibility that Xi may not change his policies, but expresses hope that their resolve will only strengthen. Krishnamoorthi states that the competition between the US and the Chinese Communist Party is not a game, but a contest over values, economic models, and global visions. He asserts that the US can protect itself by aggressively using trade tools, such as enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and avoiding investments in companies under human rights sanctions. Krishnamoorthi accuses the CCP of engaging in a military buildup and threatening Taiwan, and dismisses their claims over the South China Sea as illegal.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/mexico-first-openly-non-binary-magistrate-and-lgbtq-activist-found-dead/1844939/</link>
			<description>Ociel Baena Saucedo, Mexico's first openly non-binary magistrate and an LGBTQ activist, was found dead in their home in Aguascalientes. The body of Baena's partner was also discovered in the same residence. While the cause of death remains unknown, authorities have indicated no immediate signs of foul play. Preliminary findings suggest that there was no third person involved and no traces of blood outside the crime scene. Baena's non-binary identity has prompted a gender perspective in the investigation, although there is no mention of the deaths potentially being linked to a hate crime. Baena served in the Electoral Tribunal of Aguascalientes and was recognized as the first non-binary magistrate in Latin America, advocating for LGBTQ rights. Despite progress in marriage equality, LGBTQ+ activists and gender minorities still face violence and discrimination in Mexico. The tragic loss of Baena adds to the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in the country.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/india-reiterates-call-for-revitalisation-of-general-assembly-at-un-summit/1844933/</link>
			<description>Indian Counsellor Pratik Mathur highlighted the importance of revitalizing the role of the General Assembly during a statement at the UN Summit. He expressed concern over thematic issues primarily being discussed in the Security Council, which undermines the authority of the General Assembly. Mathur emphasized the critical role of the General Assembly in setting the global agenda and restoring the centrality of the United Nations in addressing transnational issues. He also acknowledged that some blame lies with the General Assembly and its member states for allowing its relevance to be diluted. Mathur's call for revitalizing the General Assembly's role is seen as crucial in shaping the global agenda. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has also previously stated that the resistance to reforming the UN's structure may render it "anachronistic." India has consistently raised the issue of global system reforms on the global stage.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is actively engaged in climate diplomacy to promote global collaboration and support for climate action. As the first country in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, as well as the first in the Middle East and North Africa to commit to climate neutrality by 2050, the UAE places great importance on international partnerships for sustainability and climate.

The Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy (AGDA) has launched a capacity building program in collaboration with the Office for the UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change. The program aims to enhance knowledge and skills related to climate change and climate action for senior government officials, corporate executives, diplomats, negotiators, and advisors. It covers topics such as regional climate priorities, climate diplomacy, energy transition, and the UAE's net-zero strategic initiative.

The AGDA, together with Mubadala and ADNOC, has also established the Centre for Climate Diplomacy. This center focuses on climate research and aims to cooperate with academic institutions and research centers in the Middle East. Its goals include establishing a regional climate research center and forming partnerships with public and private sectors to support climate neutrality efforts.

In parallel, the Hamdan Bin Mohammed Smart University (HBMSU) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) have launched an Executive Diploma on Climate Change Diplomacy and Sustainability. This program equips participants with knowledge and skills necessary for addressing sustainability, climate change, and climate negotiations.

The Arab Youth Centre, in partnership with various organizations including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, AGDA, Abu Dhabi School of Government (ADSG), and UNITAR, has initiated the 'Young Arab Diplomatic Leaders' program. This program provides specialized training to prepare young Arabs for diplomatic roles in climate affairs. It includes sessions, workshops, and meetings with prominent diplomats, covering topics like future foresight, cross-cultural communication, climate change governance, negotiation techniques, and advanced climate diplomacy.

Additionally, the Arab Youth Centre, in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union to the United Arab Emirates, has launched the "Negotiation Skills Bootcamp – Cohort52" as part of the 'Young Arab Diplomatic Leaders' program. This boot camp aims to enhance the negotiation skills of youth in diplomatic and non-diplomatic sectors, enabling them to effectively engage in international discussions and represent the Arab community in climate-related forums aligned with COP28.

Overall, the UAE is actively involved in various initiatives and partnerships to promote climate diplomacy, research, capacity building, and youth engagement, in line with its commitment to global climate action.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new study published in Nature Neuroscience explores visual masking, a phenomenon where individuals do not consciously detect one image if another image is shown in rapid succession. The study showed that this optical illusion also occurs in mice and identified a specific region of the brain involved in the illusion. The research suggests that the visual cortex or higher areas of the cortex downstream of it are responsible for conscious perception. This finding aligns with the belief that the cortex is the seat of conscious perception in mammals.</description>

			<title>Study finds risk of high lung cancer cases among naval veterans connected to asbestos</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/study-finds-risk-of-high-lung-cancer-cases-among-naval-veterans-connected-to-asbestos/1844890/</link>
			<description>According to a study conducted by the University of Adelaide and Oxford University, asbestos exposure led to a higher prevalence of asbestos-related lung cancers among British and Australian navy personnel compared to other armed forces. The study analyzed data from 30,085 British and Australian troops who served in the 1950s and 1960s, when asbestos-containing materials were present on naval vessels. The researchers found that the lung cancer rate was higher in naval personnel, and although smoking remains the primary cause of lung cancer, the excess cases in the navy could not be explained by a higher smoking rate. The study concluded that onboard asbestos exposure was likely the main cause of the increased lung cancer rate. Additionally, asbestosis deaths were observed among sailors, further strengthening the link. The researchers estimated that approximately 27% of lung cancers among Australian seamen and 12% among British seamen were related to onboard asbestos exposure. The study highlights the ongoing risk of asbestos exposure to workers, despite bans and regulatory controls. The researchers suggest that the effects of asbestos exposure may be underestimated unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis. They emphasize the need for strict control measures to protect workers from asbestos and other harmful airborne dusts.</description>

			<title>RINL hopes asset monetisation may garner Rs 3000-4000cr</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/rinl-hopes-asset-monetisation-may-garner-rs-3000-4000cr/1844458/</link>
			<description>Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), a steel company, has stated that if it can raise between Rs 3000-4000 crore through the monetization of its forged wheel plant and land, as well as ongoing efficiency measures, it will be able to increase production and turn around from losses. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) handles the monetization process as RINL is a divestment candidate. RINL had invested Rs 2000 crore in the wheel plant, which has the capacity to produce one lakh forged train wheels per year. RINL’s CEO, Atul Bhatt, said that if monetization occurs this fiscal year, it will help RINL come back to cash profit through increased production. RINL posted a loss of around Rs 3000 crore in 2022-23 due to factors such as a glut in the steel market, the export tax on steel, and a lack of captive raw material security. Bhatt highlighted a cost disadvantage of Rs 6000 per tonne due to buying iron ore from the open market and an unsustainable debt of around Rs 23000 crore. The monetization plan aims to reduce debt and improve the working capital situation. Bhatt also mentioned measures such as increasing oxygen capacity and switching the import of coking coal. RINL’s substantial land bank is considered attractive as it eliminates the need for prospective buyers to invest in developing new land parcels. The land parcels are currently under the direct ownership of the union government.</description>

			<title>Study emphasises necessity of addressing risk of post-net zero global warming</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/study-emphasises-necessity-of-addressing-risk-of-post-net-zero-global-warming/1844444/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new study published in Frontiers in Science raises doubts about the effectiveness of achieving "net-zero" emissions in halting global warming. Net-zero emissions refers to the point at which the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount removed from it. The study argues that there is uncertainty surrounding the estimates that global warming will stop at net-zero, suggesting that there is a chance global warming could continue and intensify after reaching this point. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address this risk. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing global temperatures and highlights the need to limit initial disturbances to the planet in order to mitigate climate risks. The research identifies several processes that could contribute to significant warming after reaching net-zero emissions. The melting of polar ice, for example, leads to increased absorption of solar energy, which further drives up temperatures. The study concludes that political obstacles, rather than technological or physical ones, are currently hindering climate action. It argues for collaborative efforts among climate experts to better understand the impact of various processes and improve warming predictions.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/not-much-has-changed-for-pak-hindu-migrants-in-rajasthan-five-years-after-poll-promises-in-2018/1843897/</link>
			<description>Thousands of Pakistani Hindu migrants living in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, are awaiting citizenship and better living conditions, with their hopes unfulfilled by the ruling Congress party. The migrants, who do not have Indian citizenship, rely on political parties to address their issues. Despite promises made by both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, little has changed for the migrants who face daily struggles for basic amenities. They are requesting land to live on rather than free land, and some are even willing to pay for permanent housing. Presently, 30,000 people across Rajasthan, including Jodhpur, are still waiting for Indian citizenship. The BJP government had launched a special housing project for Pakistani Hindu migrants, but so far, it only has a name and no further progress.</description>

			<title>Direct seeding, burying straw deep — how stubble burning can be managed without phasing out paddy</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/agriculture/direct-seeding-burying-straw-deep-how-stubble-burning-can-be-managed-without-phasing-out-paddy/1843380/</link>
			<description>The Haryana government is offering incentives to farmers for adopting water-saving techniques and diversifying their crops. Under the scheme 'Mera Pani, Meri Virasat', farmers who sow crops other than paddy receive a payment of Rs 7,000 per acre, while those practicing direct sowing of rice receive Rs 4,000 per acre. These initiatives aim to reduce water consumption and promote less water-intensive crops in the states of Haryana and Punjab. The Supreme Court has suggested phasing out paddy cultivation in these regions to address pollution caused by stubble burning. However, farmers argue that paddy cultivation plays a crucial role in their livelihoods and that alternatives are not as financially rewarding or reliable. Agricultural experts propose strategies such as using short-duration paddy varieties, adopting direct seeding techniques, advancing procurement dates, and burying stubble through deep ploughing to mitigate the issues associated with paddy cultivation and stubble burning.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/global-ev-sales-stay-strong-china-hits-record-despite-end-of-subsidies/1843880/</link>
			<description>China reported record monthly electric-vehicle (EV) sales in October, despite the end of subsidies. The country ended an 11-year subsidy scheme for EV purchases in 2022 but some local authorities continue to offer aid, tax rebates, and subsidies to attract investments and consumers. EV sales in China increased by 29% year-to-date in September, contributing to the global EV market's 34% growth in the same period. Rho Motion, a market research firm, predicts that 2023 will be another strong year for EV sales in China. In European markets, EV sales grew by 26%, although the cutting of subsidies has affected demand, particularly in Germany. The North American market saw a significant increase of 78% in EV sales this year, with Tesla leading the demand. However, Tesla's market share slipped to its lowest point at about 50% during the third quarter.</description>

			<description>Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Dubinsky has been detained for 60 days by a Kyiv court after being suspected of treason and spreading misinformation about Ukraine's political leadership. Dubinsky, who is on a US sanctions list, denies the accusations. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) claims that Dubinsky is a member of a criminal organization financed by Russia's military intelligence. The organization allegedly worked to discredit Ukraine internationally in order to strain diplomatic relations with the US and hinder Ukraine's accession to the European Union and NATO. Dubinsky was expelled from the ruling party in 2021 due to alleged election meddling but continued to work in parliament. In January 2021, the US imposed sanctions on several Ukrainian individuals, including Dubinsky, for their involvement in election interference and association with a pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker linked to efforts to gather damaging information on President Joe Biden and his son.</description>

			<title>Netanyahu says Israel will pursue war against Hamas ‘to the end’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/netanyahu-says-israel-will-pursue-war-against-hamas-to-the-end/1843729/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that the conflict with Hamas is a "war to the end," emphasizing Israel's commitment to eliminating the threat posed by the militant group. Netanyahu stated that this is not just an operation or a round, but a sustained effort. He also stressed the need to unite the country to achieve victory over Hamas, delaying accountability for the October 7 attack until the conclusion of the ongoing war. Israeli forces have gained control of the Palestinian Legislative Council building in Gaza City, which has been under Hamas's control since 2007. The Israeli military reported targeting a group of Hamas fighters embedded among civilians at Gaza's Al-Quds Hospital, resulting in the deaths of approximately 21 terrorists. On the Palestinian side, the Health Ministry reported that Israeli attacks have resulted in the deaths of 11,180 Palestinians, including 4,609 children and 3,100 women, with 28,200 individuals injured. There have also been challenges in updating daily reports on the death toll due to Israeli attacks on hospitals.</description>

			<title>“The Answer is Modi”: Jaishankar credits PM’s leadership for socioeconomic revolution in India</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/the-answer-is-modi-jaishankar-credits-pms-leadership-for-socioeconomic-revolution-in-india/1843727/</link>
			<description>India has undergone a socioeconomic revolution in the past decade, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar attributes this to the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PM Modi's initiatives, such as Beti Padhao Beti Bachao, Jandhan Yojana, Awas Yojana, Digital India, Startup India, and Skill India campaigns, have had a significant impact on the country. These efforts have led to transformative changes in India, including financial inclusion, building houses, promoting education for girls, and fostering digital innovation. The government has also focused on creating new universities and colleges, contributing to the socioeconomic revolution. The evolving India-UK relationship is being reframed to unlock the unrealized potential between the two nations. EAM Jaishankar's visit to the UK aims to strengthen the growing bilateral partnership and explore new convergences. India and the UK are also in negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement.</description>

The India-UK comprehensive strategic partnership was launched in 2021, and negotiations for an FTA have been underway since January last year.</description>

			<title>Deportation of undocumented Afghans alters Balochistan’s socio-economic landscape: Report</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/deportation-of-undocumented-afghans-alters-balochistans-socio-economic-landscape-report/1843724/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The deportation of undocumented Afghan citizens from Pakistan is having a significant impact on the socio-economic dynamics in Balochistan, particularly in the city of Quetta. Many of those being deported are Pashtun, who had integrated into local Pashtun communities. The departure of these individuals has disrupted their lives and affected the communities that had embraced them. The Hazara community in Balochistan, which saw an increase in numbers after the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, is also facing a crisis as undocumented Hazaras have left for Afghanistan. This has exacerbated concerns among those who had fled oppression by the Afghan Taliban. The economic ramifications are being felt in Quetta, where some refugees played a vital role in the city's economy as laborers and consumers. Their departure has led to an economic downturn. The introduction of a passport requirement for crossing into Afghanistan has also disrupted businesses and family connections in Chaman, leading to protests. The social impact of the deportations is significant, as many Afghans had been part of the society for years, marrying and developing community ties. The deportations may strain cross-border kinships, diminish cultural and social contributions, and potentially destabilize local economies. Baloch nationalist parties, who were previously opposed to Afghan refugees, have remained silent on the issue this time. There are allegations that a large number of Afghans have been issued Pakistani identity cards, and there is speculation that these cards will be blocked and cancelled in the next phase, which could inadvertently affect Pakistani citizens in Balochistan. A careful and humane approach is necessary to prevent further disruption to the lives of both Afghan refugees and Balochistan's citizens.</description>

The report stated that a foreign actor close to Azerbaijan was involved in the campaign, but it could not directly link it to the Azerbaijani authorities.

			<title>Syria allows UN to keep delivering aid from Turkey</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/syria-allows-un-to-keep-delivering-aid-from-turkey/1843714/</link>
			<description>Syria has granted the United Nations (UN) permission to continue delivering aid to opposition-held areas in the country's northwest for another three months. Initially, after an earthquake caused significant casualties in Turkey and Syria, the UN was allowed to provide aid through Turkish border crossings for a period of three months, which has now been extended for a third time until February 13th. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs highlighted the importance of this cross-border operation, as it reaches around 2.5 million people monthly with critical assistance and protection services. Syria's mission to the UN confirmed the extension of the UN's use of the Bab al-Salam and Al Ra'ee crossings. The UN had also been using the Bab al-Hawa crossing since 2014, but authorization from the UN Security Council expired in mid-July. However, shortly after, the Syrian government allowed the UN to continue using Bab al-Hawa for an additional six months. In total, over 4,200 trucks carrying UN aid have utilized these border crossings so far this year.</description>

			<title>Israeli tanks outside Gaza hospital, surgeon says, pleading ‘Someone should stop this’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israeli-tanks-outside-gaza-hospital-surgeon-says-pleading-someone-should-stop-this/1843712/</link>
			<description>Israeli tanks have positioned themselves at the gates of Gaza City's main hospital, Al Shifa, resulting in patients, including newborns, dying due to a lack of fuel and power. The siege of the hospital and the lack of resources have caused the death of 32 patients in the last three days. Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra stated that there are still around 650 patients in need of evacuation. Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters by Hamas fighters, an accusation denied by Hamas. President Joe Biden expressed his hope for less intrusive action at the hospital and stressed the need to protect it. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of two-thirds of Gaza's population. Fighting has also occurred at Al Quds hospital, causing it to cease functioning. Israel alleges that terrorists were shot from the hospital entrance in return fire. The conflict has raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militia targets in Syria.</description>

			<title>Brazil aims to expand rail system with funds from prior contracts</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/brazil-aims-to-expand-rail-system-with-funds-from-prior-contracts/1843709/</link>
			<description>The Brazilian government plans to expand its railway network with a 40 billion reais ($8 billion) fund, funded by removing discounts given to rail companies under previous government contracts. The discounts were given to iron ore miner Vale and logistics companies Rumo and MRS in 2022 under the government of former President Jair Bolsonaro. These contracts did not go through the normal public bidding process, and the companies were allowed to make an advance payment deducting unamortized assets from their owed concession payments. The government claims that the companies owe an additional 40 billion reais ($8.1 billion) in unpaid concession payments. While Rumo has agreed to pay, Vale and MRS are still disputing the matter in court. Once the court's decision is made, the government plans to arrange any payments with the companies. The funds will be used to finance the construction of new railways and extend existing ones, with the goal of increasing rail freight transportation from 17% to 40% of Brazil's total freight, including iron ore.</description>

			<description>An expert witness called by Google in the ongoing antitrust trial testified that the company's multi-billion dollar payments to Apple and other parties are normal competitive behavior and not an abuse of monopoly. Kevin Murphy, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, argued that Apple and others played Google and Microsoft off against each other to secure large payments. The government has accused Google of paying billions to ensure its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, alleging it as an abuse of monopoly. Murphy also stated that these payments often result in benefits to users, such as cheaper phones or better data plans. He added that while Microsoft had the majority of preinstalled browser defaults, its Bing search engine only received 15% of search queries. The trial is expected to conclude this week.</description>

ICBC did not immediately comment on the incident. The attack raises concerns about the resilience of the $26 trillion Treasury market and may attract regulatory scrutiny. LockBit has emerged as the world's leading ransomware threat, targeting numerous organizations globally.

Animal rescue teams from various organizations are on alert, expecting an increase in cases of distressed animals that may continue for weeks after the festival. So far, six birds, two snakes, and a turtle with burn injuries have been rescued.

			<title>Rising temperatures, longer monsoon drive Bangladesh’s worst dengue outbreak</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/rising-temperatures-longer-monsoon-drive-bangladeshs-worst-dengue-outbreak/1843678/</link>
			<description>Bangladesh is experiencing its worst-ever outbreak of dengue fever, with a death toll of 1,476 and over 291,000 infected. Experts attribute the severe outbreak to rising temperatures and a longer monsoon season caused by climate change, which create ideal breeding conditions for the dengue-spreading mosquito. This year's death toll is more than five times that of 2022 and the highest since authorities began tracking the disease in 2000. The Aedes mosquito, which spreads dengue, is adapting to the changing climate patterns, leading to the disease's spread in all 64 districts of the country. Vector surveillance is now needed year-round to monitor the disease's spread. There is no specific vaccine or drug for dengue, but early detection and proper medical care can reduce deaths to less than 1% of those infected. Hospitals in Bangladesh are struggling to cope with the influx of patients and a shortage of intravenous fluids.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Oil prices increased by over 1% following the release of OPEC's monthly market report, which alleviated concerns about declining demand in the US and China. OPEC stated that oil market fundamentals remained strong and attributed the drop in prices to speculators. The organization slightly raised its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and maintained its high prediction for 2024. The report countered negative sentiment around Chinese demand and increased demand growth forecasts for this year. Last week, the US Energy Information Administration lowered its projection for crude oil production and predicted a decrease in demand. Additionally, weak economic data from China raised fears of faltering demand. However, analysts believe that oil prices may have reached a bottom and expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to continue their voluntary supply cuts into next year, limiting downside potential. The next OPEC+ meeting is scheduled for November 26.</description>

			<title>Gold gains as traders strap in for US inflation data</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/gold-gains-as-traders-strap-in-for-us-inflation-data/1843673/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices rose slightly as the dollar weakened, and investors are awaiting U.S. inflation data that could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $1,934.25 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,938.50. The upcoming release of U.S. consumer prices index (CPI) data and producer price index data will be closely watched. If the inflation data exceeds expectations, gold may face downward pressure due to the possibility of a rate hike. However, if the data aligns with expectations, gold could trade above $1,950. It's important to note that higher interest rates can reduce the appeal of gold as it doesn't generate yield. The market currently predicts an 86% chance of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in December. Last week, gold prices dipped due to reduced safe-haven demand and a hawkish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Moody's recently changed the outlook on the U.S. government's ratings to "negative" from "stable." Spot silver fell by 1% to $21.99 per ounce, while platinum gained 1.1% to $849.49 and palladium fell by 1% to $953.44, near a five-year low.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new report published in Nature Climate Change explores how climate change can affect the human brain. The study, led by the University of Vienna, examines how a changing environment can influence brain function and calls for further research on the impact of extreme weather events on the brain. The authors also discuss the role of neuroscience in understanding and addressing climate change, suggesting that understanding neural activity can help predict behavior and improve our response to climate change. The researchers emphasize the need to protect our brains from the effects of climate change and use our brains effectively to mitigate its impact.</description>

			<title>US says it’s working hard to have a strong consensus leaders’ declaration at APEC</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/us-says-its-working-hard-to-have-a-strong-consensus-leaders-declaration-at-apec/1843671/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United States is working to achieve a strong consensus leaders' statement at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit this week. The wars in the Middle East and Ukraine have caused divisions among APEC members, making it challenging to draft a summit declaration. Despite past friction over statements, primarily due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US wants to replicate last year's successful announcement of a consensus leaders' declaration. They are collaborating with like-minded partners throughout APEC to achieve this goal. Russia, a member of APEC, will be represented by officials not subject to US sanctions, as President Putin will not attend the summit. APEC represents a significant portion of global GDP and trade, comprising economies rather than nations. India will be present at ministerial-level meetings as a guest economy.</description>

			<title>Mexico’s Ebrard to stay in ruling party, avoiding split</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/mexicos-ebrard-to-stay-in-ruling-party-avoiding-split/1843669/</link>
			<description>Former Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard has announced that he will remain with the ruling leftist National Regeneration Movement (Morena) and will not seek the presidency in 2024 with an opposition party. Ebrard had previously rejected the results of Morena's presidential primaries and had not ruled out the possibility of seeking the presidency with the center-left opposition Citizens' Movement (MC) party. However, he has now reached an understanding with Morena's presidential candidate, former Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum. Ebrard stated that he would continue to pursue the presidency in the future but acknowledged that it was not feasible for next year. As a former socially progressive mayor of Mexico City, Ebrard decriminalized abortion and legalized same-sex marriage in the capital. He also played a key role in negotiations with the Trump and Biden administrations on trade and immigration.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israel-combining-land-air-naval-forces-in-war-operating-inside-gaza-idf-spokesperson/1843655/</link>
			<description>The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, has stated that the IDF is operating in Gaza to ensure the safe release of 239 Israeli hostages. The IDF is utilizing land, air, and naval forces in their operations against Hamas in Gaza. Hecht emphasized that the conflict is with Hamas and not the people of Gaza. The IDF has repeatedly asked civilians in the Shati area to leave, using text messages, leaflets, and media messages. Hecht claimed that Hamas has built a dedicated city for terrorism under the Shati area and that the fighting will be intense in this complex urban warfare. The IDF also maintained a tactical pause to allow Gazan civilians to evacuate through the Rafah crossing. Additionally, the IDF reported that 21 members of a terror cell were killed after they opened fire at Israeli forces from Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City. The IDF stated that the cell was embedded among civilians and used the hospital as a base for their attack. The IDF returned fire, killing 21 operatives and damaging a tank. The IDF has criticized Hamas for using civilian structures, including hospitals, to carry out attacks.</description>

			<title>Researchers give more insight into development of lupus in females</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/researchers-give-more-insight-into-development-of-lupus-in-females/1843651/</link>
			<description>In lupus, an autoimmune disease, women are affected nine times more than males. The reasons behind this gender disparity have been unclear, but a recent study by Johns Hopkins Medicine has shed light on the role of the X chromosome and a specific genetic material called X-inactive specific transcript (XIST). The study found that XIST can trigger an immune response involving toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a protein in the immune system. This immune response contributes to the development and severity of lupus in women. The research suggests that XIST may play a role in promoting autoimmunity and could be a potential target for future therapies. Further studies are needed to explore XIST's involvement in other autoimmune conditions that predominantly affect women.</description>

			<title>Kenya’s president urges progress on global plastics treaty</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/kenyas-president-urges-progress-on-global-plastics-treaty/1843302/</link>
			<description>Negotiators at the third round of talks in Nairobi are urged to reach a deal on the world's first treaty to combat plastic pollution. The global plastic waste production is around 400 million metric tonnes per year, with less than 10% being recycled. Approximately 14 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean annually, alongside increasing amounts in landfills. Delegates will discuss potential measures for the treaty, focusing on the entire life cycle of plastics or prioritizing plastic waste management. Kenya advocates for a binding agreement on plastic production and usage and has implemented laws banning certain plastic uses since 2017. The plastic industry and oil and petrochemical exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, oppose curbing plastic use and argue for improved recycling and reuse. Majority of countries support advancing the negotiations, while a smaller group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are attempting to hinder progress.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/eu-pledges-substantial-contribution-to-cop28-climate-damage-fund/1843300/</link>
			<description>The European Union (EU) has announced that it will make a substantial financial contribution to a new international fund addressing the destruction caused by climate change. The fund, known as the "loss and damage" fund, will be launched during the United Nations COP28 climate summit in Dubai. The EU did not specify the size of its planned contribution. In addition to this, the EU will also commit funding to help countries meet the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030. The move by the EU could pave the way for other deals at COP28, such as phasing out fossil fuels and reducing emissions. The UAE's incoming COP28 president welcomed the EU's announcement. So far, no country has made a specific financial pledge to the fund, although the US has signaled interest in contributing "several millions of dollars". High-income countries, including the UAE, are facing pressure to contribute to UN climate funds.</description>

			<title>Indonesia presidential front-runner Prabowo criticises EU on deforestation</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/indonesia-presidential-front-runner-prabowo-criticises-eu-on-deforestation/1843298/</link>
			<description>Presidential front-runner Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia criticized the European Union (EU) over its ban on palm oil imports and claimed that Europeans were also responsible for deforestation during colonial times. The EU recently passed a law to ban imports of commodities linked to forest destruction, including palm oil, which Indonesia is the largest producer of. Prabowo argued that while Indonesia has maintained good relations with Europe, the EU's ban on palm oil has created difficulties for selling other products such as coffee, tea, and cocoa. The EU, previously the third-largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil, did not immediately respond to Prabowo's comments. Prabowo further highlighted that during colonial rule, Europeans forced Indonesians to plant other crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, and cocoa, resulting in the destruction of forests. He emphasized the need for an equal playing field and expressed concern about the impact of the EU's deforestation law on Indonesia's annual exports. A task force comprising the EU, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the second-largest palm oil producer globally, has been formed to discuss the law.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-rallies-to-fresh-one-year-high-against-a-beaten-down-yen/1843294/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The dollar reached its highest level against the Japanese yen in over a year, boosted by reduced expectations of US interest rate cuts next year. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stated that the government would monitor the currency market and respond accordingly, but this had little immediate impact on the yen. The British pound slightly increased after a reshuffle of key government posts by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Traders in global currency markets were cautious, awaiting the latest US inflation numbers to determine the likelihood of rate cuts next year. While the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen since October 2022, it was last up 0.15%. Last week, Fed policymakers indicated that the battle against inflation was not yet over, leading to a reduction in market rate cut bets and supporting the dollar. The dollar index also saw gains, remaining firm due to last week's increase. Moody's lowering the outlook for US credit had little impact on the market. Japanese data showed that wholesale inflation had slowed, suggesting diminishing pressure on the yen. However, there was still concern about potential intervention from the Japanese government to strengthen the currency. The euro and sterling both gained slightly, with sterling also rising against the euro after news of changes in the UK government.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Gold prices stabilized near a three-week low as investors awaited US inflation data this week to assess the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy. Spot gold remained unchanged at $1,936.67 per ounce, while US gold futures gained 0.2% to $1,940.60. Traders are closely watching the US consumer price index (CPI) data, with the market expecting a 0.3% rise in core CPI month-over-month for October and a 4.1% increase year-over-year. Higher interest rates tend to reduce the appeal of gold as it is a non-yielding asset. Last week, gold dropped 2.8% due to decreased safe-haven demand and hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli forces have reached the main hospital in Gaza City, targeting it as part of their mission to take control of the northern half of the Gaza Strip. Medics inside the hospital reported that patients, including newborn babies, were dying due to a lack of fuel. The Gaza health ministry stated that 32 patients had died in the past three days, and around 650 patients were still awaiting evacuation. However, Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters for Hamas fighters and accuses them of using patients as shields. The conflict has also raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militias in Syria. The ongoing conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and made more than half of the population homeless. The situation at Al Shifa hospital remains dire, with tanks stationed at the gates, Israeli fire targeting the hospital, and limited resources available. Another major hospital in northern Gaza has also stopped functioning. The United Nations observed a minute's silence for the 101 staff members killed so far. The conflict has sparked polarized reactions globally, with some countries condemning the Israeli response and the high civilian casualties. Israel maintains that it must destroy Hamas and blames fighters hiding among civilians for the harm caused. The United States supports Israel's position but urges the protection of civilians.</description>

			<title>Brazilian police arrest third man suspected of links to Hezbollah</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/brazilian-police-arrest-third-man-suspected-of-links-to-hezbollah/1843288/</link>
			<description>Brazilian police have arrested another man in connection with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, bringing the total number of detainees suspected of involvement with the group to three. The man was arrested in Brazil's capital, Brasilia, and his alleged link to the Iranian-backed group was already under investigation. Last week, two people were arrested in Sao Paulo as part of an operation to dismantle a suspected Hezbollah cell planning attacks on Jewish targets in Brazil. Hezbollah was founded in Lebanon in 1982 by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to fight against Israeli forces. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and Argentina. Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had planned to label Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the move never materialized.</description>

			<description>Noise levels in the silence zones and commercial areas of Ranchi exceeded the permissible limits on Diwali night, according to data from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. In the silence zones of Doranda and RIMS Bariatu, noise levels increased by 56% and 64.46 dB, respectively, compared to the average limit of 45 dB.

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Spain's acting Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, is seeking a new term in a parliamentary vote scheduled for Thursday. Sanchez is expected to win with an absolute majority, thanks to support from regional parties, including the pro-Catalan independence party Junts and ERC, in exchange for a controversial law granting amnesty to those involved in Catalonia's secession attempt in 2017. The possibility of amnesty has sparked protests in the country. Sanchez's Socialist party has spent weeks negotiating with smaller parties to secure their support. With the backing of various parties, Sanchez is expected to have 179 votes in favor and 171 against, with opposition coming from the People's Party, Vox, and a small regional party.</description>

			<title>Congress talks big about caste census but its Madhya Pradesh candidate list lacks OBC names</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/congress-talks-big-about-caste-census-but-its-madhya-pradesh-candidate-list-lacks-obc-names/1842710/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the Congress party's efforts in promoting social justice and its impact on the caste composition of its candidates for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly election. The party has appointed a Dalit leader as its national president and has been advocating for a caste census. However, an analysis of the party's nominated candidates reveals that substantial changes have not been made in its candidate nomination policy.

The Congress has allocated 36% of the tickets to upper castes, which comprise only around 10% of the state's population. In contrast, OBCs, representing more than half of the state's population, have been given only 27% of the tickets. This indicates that while there is a symbolic shift towards social justice, there have been no substantive changes in the candidate nomination policy.

The article also highlights the dominance of certain jatis (castes) among the Congress candidates. More than half of the nominated candidates belong to five jatis: Rajput, Brahmin, Gond, Bhil, and Jatav/Ahirwar. Rajputs and Brahmins make up a significant portion of the nominations, with Rajputs comprising around 14% and Brahmins around 13% of the total candidates.

Gonds and Bhils, as well as Jains, Baniyas, and Gurjars, also receive notable political representation. Among Scheduled Castes, the Jatav/Ahirwar castes have the highest number of nominations. However, the Congress has not been able to implement its aggressive stance on caste issues within the party, as the traditional upper-caste local elite still have influence over nominations.

The article concludes by suggesting that the Congress may face electoral consequences if it fails to address these disparities in caste representation.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/why-are-my-kids-good-around-other-people-and-then-badly-behaved-with-me/1842704/</link>
			<description>This article discusses why children often behave well at school or in other settings but exhibit worse behavior at home. It explains that children learn from an early age that their behavior produces outcomes and can be a way to control the actions of others. Sometimes, children are inadvertently rewarded for misbehavior at home through increased attention or getting what they want. In contrast, children may behave better at school because teachers have clear expectations and reward systems in place. The article suggests that parents can help improve their children's behavior at home by establishing routines, setting simple house rules, noticing good behavior, spending regular small amounts of time with their child, and having realistic expectations.</description>

			<description>China's increasing presence in the Pacific region has led to mixed perceptions among local populations, according to surveys conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands. While both governments welcome China's engagement, concerns over environmental pollution and perceived lack of benefits from Chinese projects were raised. However, those living near mining operations tended to view them more positively due to financial benefits. Chinese government scholarships improved students' views of China, with participants recommending the program and reporting a positive change in their impressions of the country. In the Solomon Islands, support for closer ties with both China and the US was high among surveyed students, although some expressed concerns about potential debt risks associated with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Non-governmental organizations in the Pacific also raised concerns about human rights violations, governance, debt risks, and environmental pollution related to China's initiatives. The complex and nuanced perceptions of local populations in the Pacific regarding China's influence should be considered by policymakers in the US and Australia as they aim to counter China's growing relationships in the region.</description>

			<title>What do people in the Pacific really think of China? It’s more nuanced than you may imagine</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/what-do-people-in-the-pacific-really-think-of-china-its-more-nuanced-than-you-may-imagine/1842699/</link>
			<description>Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that China has been increasing its presence in the Pacific region, particularly in countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands. While the governments of these countries welcome China's engagement, there are mixed perceptions among the local populations. For example, in PNG, concerns about environmental pollution related to the China-owned Ramu NiCo project were expressed by the majority of respondents. However, those living in the mining lease area had a more positive view due to the direct financial benefits they receive. In Solomon Islands, there is support for a closer bilateral relationship with China, but some individuals have concerns about debt risks and Chinese control over resources. It's important for policymakers in the US and Australia to understand these nuanced perceptions as they navigate China's growing influence in the region.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/soccer-australia-aim-to-top-world-cup-qualifying-behich/1842697/</link>
			<description>Australia aims to secure top spot in their Asia groups during World Cup qualifying in order to avoid a difficult route to the 2026 finals in North America, according to defender Aziz Behich. Australia had to win playoffs against the United Arab Emirates and Honduras to reach the previous World Cups in Qatar and Russia, respectively. While the expanded 48-team World Cup in 2026 offers Asia eight direct qualifying spots, Behich emphasized the team's goal of topping their group. Australia, ranked 27th in the world and fourth in Asia, begins qualifying against Bangladesh in Melbourne. The team is eager to play in front of home fans after being forced to play abroad for much of the Qatar qualifying cycle due to COVID-19 restrictions.</description>

			<title>In the Market: Inside Wall Street’s scramble after ICBC hack</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/in-the-market-inside-wall-streets-scramble-after-icbc-hack/1842695/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) experienced a significant cyber hack on its U.S. broker-dealer, causing disruption to its operations. The attack was so extensive that the corporate email system stopped working, forcing employees to switch to Google mail. As a result, the brokerage temporarily owed BNY Mellon $9 billion, which was much larger than its net capital. ICBC's New York-based unit received financial support from its Chinese parent to repay BNY Mellon, and manual processing of trades was conducted with the help of the custody bank. ICBC expected the process of setting up secure systems and resuming normal business to take at least until Monday. During this time, clients were asked to temporarily suspend business and clear trades elsewhere. The ransomware attack, claimed by cybercrime gang Lockbit, raises concerns about the resilience of the Treasury market and highlights the importance of cybersecurity. The hack may also influence regulatory discussions surrounding central clearing of Treasury trades. The incident is likely to be a topic of conversation at an upcoming Treasury market conference. Despite being a mid-sized broker, ICBC's systems being paralyzed caused disruptions in the market, leading some market participants to reroute their trades. BNY Mellon played a crucial role in helping sort through the situation and facilitated the clearing of trades manually. ICBC's parent injected capital into the unit to ensure payment to BNY Mellon. Once ICBC's new system is operational, others in the industry will also review its safety measures, potentially causing further delays in returning to normal operations.</description>

			<title>Payments app Zelle begins refunds for imposter scams after Washington pressure</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-for-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure/1842693/</link>
			<description>Banks on the payment app Zelle have made a significant policy change by starting to refund victims of imposter scams. This decision comes in response to concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers and the federal consumer watchdog. Zelle, which is owned by seven major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, began reversing transfers on June 30 for customers who were deceived into sending money to scammers posing as government agencies or financial service providers. The move goes beyond legal requirements, according to Ben Chance, the chief fraud risk officer at Early Warning Services (EWS), the company that owns Zelle.

Previously, banks were only required to reimburse customers for unauthorized payments made by hackers, not for transfers initiated by customers themselves. While Zelle introduced a new reimbursement benefit for specific scam types, it had not previously provided details about its imposter scam refund policy due to concerns that it could encourage false scam claims.

This policy shift represents a significant change from last year when banks argued against refunding transfers that customers were tricked into approving. Zelle has faced criticism after a New York Times report highlighted the prevalence of scams on their platform, with Senator Elizabeth Warren estimating that Zelle users lost $440 million to fraud in 2021 alone.

Impersonator fraud was the most-reported scam across all payment methods in the U.S. in 2022, resulting in $2.6 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Despite concerns that covering the cost of authorized transactions might lead to more fraud, Zelle's owner company, EWS, has implemented a mechanism that allows banks to recover funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender. Additionally, Zelle now requires lenders to implement a tool that detects transfers with risky attributes.

Zelle's changes have satisfied the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) so far, but pressure from lawmakers may lead to further rule changes to protect customers from scams. Zelle faces market pressure to improve its standards of care as it competes with other peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo, which offer purchase protection programs for eligible transactions.

While Zelle's policy change is seen as a positive step, experts emphasize that regulations mandating imposter fraud protections would be better to ensure customer well-being. Payment fraud is expected to be a topic of discussion when bank CEOs appear before the Senate in the future.</description>

			<title>Dollar steady ahead of US inflation data, yen near one-year low</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/dollar-steady-ahead-of-us-inflation-data-yen-near-one-year-low/1842689/</link>
			<description>The dollar remained strong as traders awaited U.S. inflation data to gauge the Federal Reserve's response to price pressures. The Japanese yen stayed weak, close to a one-year low, amidst speculation of possible intervention by Tokyo. The focus for traders will be on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) numbers, with more Fed speakers expected to leave room for further interest rate hikes. Moody's lowering of the U.S. credit rating outlook had little impact on the market. The yen was pressured by rising U.S. treasury yields and continued dollar strength. Wholesale inflation in Japan slowed below 1%, suggesting fading cost pressures. Sterling held firm ahead of UK economic data releases, while the euro hovered around $1.0688.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/yen-hits-fresh-one-year-low-as-focus-swings-to-us-inflation-data/1842687/</link>
			<description>The Japanese yen reached a one-year low against the dollar as traders eagerly awaited U.S. inflation data, which is expected to provide insight into whether the Federal Reserve needs to take further action to control rising prices. Market analysts believe that even if the CPI numbers are softer, the Fed will continue to resist rate cuts, considering inflation remains above target. Moody's recent announcement of lowering its outlook for the U.S. credit rating had little impact on the market. The yen remained under pressure due to increasing U.S. Treasury yields and a strong dollar. Meanwhile, data from Japan indicated that wholesale inflation had slowed below 1% for the first time in over two years, suggesting fading cost pressures that offered little support to the yen. In other news, sterling held steady ahead of UK earnings data, while the euro hovered around $1.0688.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/indonesias-prabowo-stretches-lead-in-new-survey-on-presidential-contenders/1842685/</link>
			<description>Indonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto has taken a significant lead over his rival in a recent opinion poll, despite controversy surrounding his choice of running mate, the son of the outgoing leader Joko Widodo. The survey conducted by Indikator Politik Indonesia showed that 39.7% of respondents would vote for Prabowo, while 30% would support the ruling party's Ganjar Pranowo. The inclusion of Widodo's son in the race has been seen by some analysts as a strategy to help retain political influence and boost support for Prabowo. The survey also indicated that younger voters and Jokowi loyalists are increasingly backing Prabowo.</description>

TPG will continue its strategic review and says it has received strong interest from potential investors in its fixed infrastructure assets.

			<title>More Gaza hospitals suspend operations as Israel hunts Hamas</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/more-gaza-hospitals-suspend-operations-as-israel-hunts-hamas/1842551/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Two major hospitals in Gaza have closed to new patients due to Israeli bombardment, fuel shortages, and lack of medicine. The hospitals in the north of the Palestinian enclave are blockaded by Israeli forces, leaving them barely able to care for those inside. As a result, more babies and patients could die as there are fewer places available for the injured. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the situation as dire and perilous, with patient fatalities increasing significantly. Hospitals are struggling to cope with constant gunfire and bombing. Israel claims that Hamas has placed command centers under and near the hospitals, but Hamas denies this. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that Al-Quds hospital is also out of service, lacking medicine, food, and water. Three U.N. agencies expressed horror at the attacks on healthcare facilities, with half of Gaza's hospitals now closed. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is worsening, with disease spreading among evacuees living in overcrowded shelters. Aid deliveries have been limited, but some aid trucks have entered Gaza from Egypt, and Jordan has air-dropped supplies into a field hospital. The conflict in Gaza has also reignited clashes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.</description>

			<title>Trapped Brazilians, whose fate hurt Israel-Brazil ties, leave Gaza</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/trapped-brazilians-whose-fate-hurt-israel-brazil-ties-leave-gaza/1842548/</link>
			<description>A group of 32 Brazilians and their families, who had been trapped in Gaza for weeks, have crossed the border into Egypt. The Brazilian foreign ministry announced that they were received by the Brazilian embassy in Cairo and are expected to return to Brazil on Monday. However, two members of the group decided to stay for personal reasons. The release of the trapped Brazilians was a point of contention between Brazil and Israel, which escalated when the Israeli spy agency Mossad claimed it helped foil a Hezbollah attack in Brazil. This incident, along with an appearance by Israel's ambassador to Brazil alongside former President Jair Bolsonaro, strained relations between the two countries.</description>

			<title>New Zealand Prime Minister-elect unlikely to attend APEC as coalition talks continue</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/new-zealand-prime-minister-elect-unlikely-to-attend-apec-as-coalition-talks-continue/1842546/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.New Zealand's Prime Minister-elect, Christopher Luxon, stated that he is unlikely to attend the upcoming APEC meeting in San Francisco due to ongoing coalition negotiations. Although Luxon's conservative National Party won the largest share of votes in last month's general election, they require the support of both the right-wing ACT New Zealand and populist New Zealand First Parties to form a majority government. While talks have intensified since the release of final election results on November 3, there is still no set timeline for reaching an agreement. Luxon believes that progress is being made and wants to focus on concluding negotiations and forming a government. However, he expressed a desire to attend APEC to showcase New Zealand as open for business and establish relationships with world leaders. If Luxon doesn't attend, New Zealand will send representatives from the caretaker government and the National Party. The process of forming a government in New Zealand typically takes about a month but can sometimes take longer under the country's mixed member proportional system.</description>

			<title>Biden, Qatari emir discuss Gaza, agree all hostages must be released</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/biden-qatari-emir-discuss-gaza-agree-all-hostages-must-be-released/1842544/</link>
			<description>U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani regarding the situation in Gaza and efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. Biden strongly condemned the holding of hostages, including a 3-year-old American citizen whose parents were killed by Hamas. Both leaders emphasized the need for the immediate release of all hostages. Israeli officials reported that Hamas fighters crossed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking over 200 hostages. The Israeli bombardment of Gaza has resulted in the deaths of more than 11,000 Palestinians, many of them children. Qatar has been leading mediation efforts between Hamas and Israeli officials. Negotiations involving Israel, Qatar, Egypt, and the United States are ongoing to secure the release of the remaining hostages. U.S. officials are uncertain about the status of the missing individuals but are working towards their safe recovery. Biden's national security adviser will meet with the families of the American hostages. A U.S. official stated that visits are planned to Israel, Brussels, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar. Qatar called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the permanent opening of the Rafah crossing into Egypt during the call with Biden. The White House statement did not mention discussions about a ceasefire but focused on protecting civilians and increasing humanitarian assistance. Biden reaffirmed his vision for a future Palestinian state and acknowledged Hamas as an obstacle to achieving stability. Both leaders agreed to continue working towards a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.</description>

			<description>The United States carried out two airstrikes in Syria against Iran and its aligned groups in response to attacks against American forces. The strikes targeted a training facility near Albu Kamal and a safe house near Mayadeen. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated that President Joe Biden ordered the strikes to protect American personnel and interests. Local sources reported that the strikes also targeted a camp run by pro-Iranian militias. These airstrikes are part of the United States' efforts to address the ongoing wave of drone and rocket attacks on its troops in Iraq and Syria. Iran and its supporters argue that the U.S. shares responsibility for Israel's conflict with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.</description>

Ukrainian officials have said that Russia has already struck Ukrainian infrastructure 60 times in recent weeks. The Ukrainian military has been increasingly active in attacking Russian-held areas but does not always acknowledge the strikes.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Political parties in Pakistan are struggling with digital political communication, which raises concerns about the quality of democratic discourse in the country, according to a report by the Institute for Research, Advocacy, and Development. The report highlights that many parties lack official websites, depriving citizens of essential party information. It also notes a lack of transparency, including the omission of party chiefs' names on websites and the failure to share party constitutions online. This digital deficiency allows for the spread of propaganda and hate speech in online political discourse. The report indicates a lack of digital literacy among political leaders and a trend where inflammatory rhetoric takes precedence over inclusive communication.</description>

The visit aims to implement agreements signed between Nepal and China during recent high-level visits. The Chinese delegation also expressed interest in helping Nepal operate the Pokhara International Airport by initiating regular flights from Chinese cities. Additionally, they discussed trade, connectivity, tourism, and people-to-people contact.

This comes almost a month after an agreement was made to keep the high-altitude road open throughout the year. The closure will be from December to March, and the pass will adopt a seasonal mode of customs clearance during this time. The closure is due to excessive snowfall, which has already covered the road with up to six inches of snow. Travelers have complained about the lack of authorities present to clear the road for traffic.</description>

			<title>Trudeau trying to manage damage he inflicted: Experts on fresh claims by Canadian PM amid diplomatic row</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/trudeau-trying-to-manage-damage-he-inflicted-experts-on-fresh-claims-by-canadian-pm-amid-diplomatic-row/1842481/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the diplomatic standoff between India and Canada, sparked by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations of Indian involvement in the killing of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Foreign affairs analysts criticize Trudeau for making these accusations before the investigation is complete, emphasizing that it was Canada that first expelled an Indian diplomat. They argue that reciprocity is expected in diplomacy and India will likely retaliate. The article also mentions India's support for a resolution against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which strategic experts view as a principled stance. Trudeau accuses India of violating the Vienna Convention, but former diplomats assert that the host country has the authority to determine the number of diplomats. The article concludes by mentioning previous tensions between the two countries, including Canada's withdrawal of diplomats and India seeking diplomatic parity.</description>

			<title>Ban on firecrackers flouted in Delhi despite SC order</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/ban-on-firecrackers-flouted-in-delhi-despite-sc-order/1842480/</link>
			<description>Despite a ban on firecrackers, people in several areas of Delhi violated the rules and celebrated Diwali by bursting them. Firecrackers were seen being burst in Shahpur Jat and Hauz Khas areas, with gatherings in parks for this purpose. The intensity of firecracker usage was lower compared to last year, but environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari reported that firecrackers were also burst in her residential area, Defence Colony, despite complaints to the police. The lack of enforcement has raised questions about the effectiveness of the ban. In some areas, such as Greater Kailash and Chittaranjan Park, there was less firecracker activity until later in the evening after the puja rituals. However, violations of the ban were observed in other parts of the city, including South Delhi and East of Kailash, where shopkeepers sold small firecrackers to children. While the intensity of firecracker usage was reportedly lower than last year, it still caused concerns about air pollution.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/why-diwali-isnt-as-big-in-bollywood-films-as-holi-karwa-chauth-are/1842251/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the portrayal of Diwali, Holi, and Karwa Chauth festivals in Bollywood movies. It highlights how Diwali, once a significant plot point in movies like Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and Vaastav: The Reality, has gradually disappeared from the big screen. In contrast, Holi has become Bollywood's favorite festival, often depicted with suggestive lyrics and the glorification of harassment. Karwa Chauth, a traditional festival centered around devotional love, has also gained prominence in Bollywood movies. The article suggests that it is time for Diwali to make a comeback in Bollywood and calls for more diverse and respectful portrayals of festivals in films.</description>

			<title>Researchers reveal genetics of near healthy tissue help detect lung cancer’s return</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/researchers-reveal-genetics-of-near-healthy-tissue-help-detect-lung-cancers-return/1842241/</link>
			<description>New research led by NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Centre suggests that genetic data from healthy tissue near lung tumors may be a better predictor of cancer recurrence than analyzing the tumors themselves. The study, which focused on lung adenocarcinoma, found that analyzing the transcriptome of apparently healthy tissue accurately predicted recurrence 83% of the time, compared to 63% when analyzing tumor tissue. The study also revealed that genes associated with inflammation in adjacent healthy tissue were particularly useful for making predictions. The findings suggest that immunotherapy could be used to combat tumor growth before it becomes detectable by traditional methods. The researchers plan to use their findings to assess recurrence risk in newly treated lung cancer patients.</description>

Sri Lanka is scheduled to host Zimbabwe for a limited-overs series in January-February 2024, followed by the U19 World Cup starting on January 13. The ICC suspended SLC due to government interference after the Sri Lankan parliament passed a resolution calling for the sacking of the country's cricket governing body. Mendis acknowledged the team's recent poor performance against India but mentioned that they had shown resilience despite being bowled out for low scores. The article also mentions the appointment of an interim committee and the efforts to address deficiencies in the team's performance.</description>

			<title>Do you know exposure to broccoli sprouts protects against colitis in bowel disease? Study reveals</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/do-you-know-exposure-to-broccoli-sprouts-protects-against-colitis-in-bowel-disease-study-reveals/1842221/</link>
			<description>A study published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mSystems found that diets high in fiber, particularly those that include broccoli sprouts or other cruciferous vegetables, could help mice with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) live longer and improve their well-being. The researchers examined the impact of a broccoli sprout diet on the immune systems of the mice and the microbes in their gut affected by Crohn's disease. They also studied the reduction of Crohn's symptoms and the anti-inflammatory compounds found in broccoli sprouts. The study involved IL-10-ko mice divided into different diet groups and used new healthy mice to trigger symptoms of colitis and Crohn's disease. The researchers examined gut tissues and microbial communities in the intestines of the mice. They found that the mice on the broccoli sprout diet had higher levels of the anti-inflammatory metabolite sulforaphane in their blood, resulting in milder disease symptoms. The study also revealed that younger mice responded better to the diet and had stronger gut bacterial communities compared to adolescent mice.</description>

			<title>Researchers find obesity associated with neurodegeneration via insulin resistance</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/researchers-find-obesity-associated-with-neurodegeneration-via-insulin-resistance/1842219/</link>
			<description>Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in the United States have discovered a link between obesity and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Using fruit flies, the study found that a high-sugar diet, which is common in obesity, causes insulin resistance in the brain. This impairs the brain's ability to eliminate neuronal debris, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. The findings could have implications for medications aimed at reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. The study provides insight into how obesity-inducing diets may contribute to the development of these disorders.</description>

Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal highlighted the large number of bail petitions filed in high courts, which inevitably leads to some delays in their disposal. The court emphasized that unless there is an exceptional urgency, fixing a time-bound schedule should be avoided. However, it assured that genuine requests for urgent matters can be entertained by the concerned bench.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia joined forces at a joint summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League in Riyadh to reject Israel's claim of self-defense. They called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Israel for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Palestine. The summit, attended by leaders from various Arab and Islamic nations, marked Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's first visit to Saudi Arabia since ties were restored earlier this year. The emergency summit was prompted by Israel's response to attacks by Hamas, resulting in numerous deaths, including many children. The joint resolution adopted at the summit condemned Israel's aggression and affirmed Palestinians' right to self-determination, an independent state, and their demand for Jerusalem as its capital. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proposed an international peace conference, while Raisi blamed the US for enabling Israel's atrocities. The OIC and the Arab League also called for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East and the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction in the region. Disagreements arose among the leaders regarding severing diplomatic ties with Israel, with some advocating for it and others emphasizing the importance of maintaining dialogue.</description>

			<title>Cement industry’s new ‘EV’ – A new low-carbon tech is here</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/feature/cement-industrys-new-ev-a-new-low-carbon-tech-is-here/1842157/</link>
			<description>The construction of cities equivalent to the size of New York City every month is being driven by population growth and urbanization. However, this rapid urban development is putting increased pressure on the planet and its natural resources because concrete and cement, which are key construction materials, contribute approximately 7% of global CO2 emissions. To address this issue, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and industry input from the Global Cement and Concrete Association, has developed a framework to reduce concrete emissions. The framework suggests three key strategies: decarbonizing the manufacturing process, using lower-carbon cement blends, and optimizing the volume of material used in projects. One potential solution for decarbonizing cement production is an electric chemical approach that replaces fossil fuel kilns with an ambient temperature process. This approach aims to achieve true zero carbon and can be a high-performance, low-carbon building material. The journey of developing sustainable cement production technology serves as a lesson that good ideas can come from anywhere.</description>

			<title>Oil price rise would hit 2024 global growth, inflation outlook: Fitch</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/oil-price-rise-would-hit-2024-global-growth-inflation-outlook-fitch/1842074/</link>
			<description>Higher oil prices resulting from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to lower economic growth and higher inflation, according to Fitch Ratings. The rating agency estimates that world GDP growth would be 0.4 percentage points lower in 2024 and 0.1 percentage points lower in 2025. Fitch's simulations assume average oil prices of $120 per barrel in 2024 and $100 per barrel in 2025. The impact of higher oil prices would dampen GDP growth in most economies, with South Africa and Turkey being the most affected. Fitch also expects higher inflation rates in 2024, followed by corrections in 2025. The potential oil price shock could result in tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets.</description>

The Boston Celtics defeated the Toronto Raptors 117-94 behind Jaylen Brown's 29 points and Jayson Tatum's 27 points. Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 17 points, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Celtics' strong performance. The Celtics improved their home record to 4-0.

Finally, the Miami Heat earned a 117-109 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Bam Adebayo recorded 26 points and 17 rebounds, while rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. had a season-high 20 points. Jimmy Butler sat out for the Heat due to a personal family issue. Trae Young scored 27 points and had 11 assists for the Hawks, but it wasn't sufficient to secure a win.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Australian government has described a cybersecurity incident at ports operator DP World Australia as "serious and ongoing." The incident, which began on Friday, has forced the suspension of operations at ports in several states. DP World Australia, which manages nearly half of the country's goods flow, is investigating possible data breaches and testing crucial systems for the resumption of normal operations. The breach has affected container terminals in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Fremantle. The Australian Federal Police are investigating the incident, and the National Cyber Security Coordinator has warned that the interruption is likely to continue for several days, impacting the movement of goods in and out of the country. DP World operates in 18 locations in the Asia-Pacific region and is part of Dubai's state-owned DP World.</description>

			<title>In UN talks for a global plastic treaty, delegates to face off over production limits</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/in-un-talks-for-a-global-plastic-treaty-delegates-to-face-off-over-production-limits/1842042/</link>
			<description>Negotiations are underway for the creation of a treaty to address plastic pollution, and officials are divided on whether to limit plastic production or focus on waste management. The world currently produces around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with less than 10% being recycled. The European Union and several countries advocate for binding provisions to reduce plastic production and eliminate problematic plastics, while the plastic industry and oil-exporting nations argue for a focus on recycling and reusing plastics. The United States has shifted its stance, now calling for national plans that align with global goals to reduce plastic pollution. Environmental groups hope the discussions can move past procedural matters and focus on substantive solutions.</description>

			<title>Myanmar fighter jet crashes, rebels claim responsibility</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/myanmar-fighter-jet-crashes-rebels-claim-responsibility/1842041/</link>
			<description>A Myanmar fighter jet crashed during clashes between the military and an insurgent group in eastern Myanmar. The jet went down over Kayah State near the border with Thailand, with both the military and the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force claiming responsibility for shooting it down. The military stated that the crash was due to a technical problem and that the pilots had ejected safely. This incident adds to the challenges faced by the ruling junta, as it battles opposition forces on multiple fronts. Ethnic minority groups and anti-junta militias are coordinating a rebellion that poses a significant threat to the military's rule. The conflict in Shan State, which borders China, has displaced thousands of people and disrupted trade routes. China has called for all sides to cease hostilities. An alliance of insurgent groups claims to have seized over 100 army posts, and attacks on towns have occurred in Sagaing Region. The fighting has left hundreds of foreign workers, including nationals from Vietnam and Thailand, trapped in the conflict zone. The Thai government has stated that it is awaiting an opportunity to evacuate its citizens. The Karenni Nationalities Defence Force stated on Facebook that it shot down the jet using heavy machine guns and is currently searching for the pilots, but this information could not be verified. Images of an abandoned helmet and parachute believed to belong to one of the pilots were posted on social media.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A study conducted by researchers from Michigan State University found that there is no reliable association between pet ownership and well-being. The study involved 767 participants who completed online surveys, and while pet owners reported that their pets improved their lives, there was no difference in the well-being of pet owners compared to non-pet owners over time. The study also found that the type of pet, the number of pets, and the quality of the human-pet relationship did not affect the association. The researchers suggested that non-pet owners may have other sources of happiness in their lives. They concluded that while pets may provide positive experiences, they may not have a transformative effect on overall well-being.</description>

			<title>Diwali car discounts make for a great deal. But don’t drive home a soon-to-be extinct SUV</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/dashboard/diwali-car-discounts-make-for-a-great-deal-but-dont-drive-home-a-soon-to-be-extinct-suv/1840907/</link>
			<description>The Indian automotive industry has experienced a swift rebound after the challenges of 2020, with consistent monthly sales growth over the past two years. It is predicted that by March 2024, the Indian passenger car market will surpass four million units, making it the world's third-largest car market behind China and the United States.

However, Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor India, Tarun Garg, raises concerns about the current situation. He points out that rival carmakers are offering massive discounts on their flagship products during the Diwali season, suggesting that there may be underlying issues despite the apparent positive growth. Garg predicts a decline in growth as 2024 approaches, marking the end of a period of intense expansion.

Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) indicates that sales of passenger cars in October 2023 grew by 15.87% compared to the previous year. While major manufacturers like Hyundai saw their sales increase by close to 15%, smaller players such as Renault, Nissan, and Citroen experienced significant declines. This could be due to a lack of suitable products, although even established carmakers like Honda have resorted to offering attractive discounts to drive sales growth.

Discounts are not limited to the mainstream market and can also be found in the luxury segment. Luxury carmakers offer attractive loan deals through their finance arms to show volumes, often at rates lower than those offered by banks. There are also instances where dealers are asked to pick up cars to demonstrate monthly volumes, which are then sold off as unregistered vehicles at significant discounts.

The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) has created confusion among Indian consumers. Currently, the EV market offers limited choices, mostly retrofitted variants of internal-combustion engine cars. However, purpose-built EVs are expected to enter the market around 2025-26, providing better options for consumers. Major automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti-Suzuki, Hyundai, and Kia are working on upcoming EV models.

Despite potential economic uncertainty after the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Hyundai remains committed to its plans for a 'Made In India' EV, similar to a C-segment SUV, by 2025. This raises the question of whether buying a new vehicle at this time might lead to owning a car that could become obsolete in a few years.

In summary, while the Indian automotive industry has shown impressive growth, concerns about underlying issues such as discounts, declining sales for some manufacturers, and the impending shift towards EVs raise questions about the future of the market.</description>

			<title>Bangladeshi Muslims are building a 300-yr-old Kali temple. Now they want Modi’s help</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/ground-reports/bangladeshi-muslims-are-building-a-300-yr-old-kali-temple-now-they-want-modis-help/1841292/</link>
			<description>The 300-year-old Sasan Kali temple in Bangladesh's Magura district was partially destroyed in the 2000 floods. Now, both Muslims and Hindus are coming together to rebuild the temple and are seeking assistance from the governments of Bangladesh and India. The village of Basurdhuljhuri, where the temple is located, serves as a symbol of secularism in a country that has been witnessing communal violence during Hindu festivities.

Every year, journalist Sahidul Hasan Khokon returns to his native village for the Kali pujo at the temple. This year, he and his friends plan to form a committee to restore the temple to its original glory. Despite its current modest appearance, the temple attracts millions of devotees who believe that their wishes will be granted by the goddess Kali.

In 2001, there was no Kali pujo due to the flood, but Muslim neighbors contributed funds and resources to help construct a temporary temple for the Hindus in the village. Now, the community wants to build a proper temple and hopes for support from both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments. They cite a similar project funded by India in Natore district as a precedent.

The Kali temple at Basurdhuljhuri holds historical significance and requires a budget of at least fifteen lakh Bangladeshi Taka for construction. Bengali Hindus in West Bengal and Bangladesh worship Goddess Kali during Diwali, and the Sasan Kali form is revered in certain temples like the one in Basurdhuljhuri.

The story of Hindus and Muslims coming together to rebuild a Kali temple is seen as an example of syncretic culture defeating fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh. Many individuals, such as actress Ashna Habib Bhabna, appreciate this display of unity and hope for the prompt construction of the temple.

For Sahidul Hasan Khokon, supporting the temple's restoration is not only about rebuilding a part of his childhood, but also about defending his belief system in the face of temple attacks. He hopes that both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments will help restore this shared heritage.</description>

			<description>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background. The study focused on English and French participants and found that when paired with someone from the same cultural background, participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs, while those paired with someone from a different cultural background engaged in deeper searches and revised their beliefs in line with evidence. The researchers believe that bringing together people from opposing sides to fact-check contentious social media posts could improve media literacy and civil discourse. However, it may be challenging to get people from opposing sides to engage in such discussions. The researchers plan to conduct future studies on more controversial topics to further explore the effects of mismatched pairs.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/50-word-edit/our-take-on-cricket-world-cup-mahua-moitras-expulsion-sc-rulings-obc-quota-in-50-words/1841965/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article highlights various topics and events. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Punjab Governor's role is seen as a positive step for order in the House, encouraging Kerala and Tamil Nadu to follow suit. Another SC order includes personal guarantors in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), emphasizing the need to resolve pending cases. Mahua Moitra's expulsion draws comparisons to the Chinese Communist Party's style of justice delivery. Claims made in Panchjanya's editorial about foreign interference in elections are criticized as alarmist. The Kaleshwaram irrigation project has been cleared by multiple central agencies, but the BJP cannot disassociate itself from it. Nitish Kumar's remark on population control and his demand for 65% reservation make minimal impact due to the lack of government jobs. The need for the SC to pass an order on seizing devices from journalists is stressed, urging action rather than preaching. J&amp;K Police's adoption of GPS-enabled ankle trackers is seen as a smart move for Indian policing. Angelo Mathews' dismissal in cricket is justified as Bangladesh embraces a more aggressive approach. Air pollution continues to be a topic of debate, with calls for a strategy to tackle dust and demonstrate commitment. The government's extension of free food is seen as a negative implication for farm laws and private sector entry. India's relationship with Canada is questioned, suggesting that G7 and Five Eyes should not have different sets of rules. The shift in power within Indian cricket is celebrated, making the upcoming 2023 World Cup exciting for fans.</description>

			<title>Top US official Brett McGurk to visit Israel: Report</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/top-us-official-brett-mcgurk-to-visit-israel-report/1842002/</link>
			<description>Brett McGurk, the White House Coordinator for West Asia, is reportedly traveling to Israel as part of a visit to countries in the region. The goal of his visit is to reach a US-brokered deal for the release of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Before visiting Israel, McGurk will hold talks with NATO and European Union officials in Brussels. In Israel, he is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and senior security and intelligence officials. After his visit to Israel, McGurk will travel to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain. The report suggests that one option under discussion is a deal that could release 80 women and children from captivity in Gaza in exchange for Israel releasing female and underage terror convicts from prison. US President Joe Biden has stated that there is "no possibility" of a ceasefire in Gaza and that the US government will continue its efforts to secure the release of the hostages.</description>

			<title>Shadab backs skipper Babar, calls for change in cultural mindset</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/shadab-backs-skipper-babar-calls-for-change-in-cultural-mindset/1841998/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's vice-captain, Shadab Khan, has called for a change in the "cultural" mindset surrounding blame on the captain for the team's poor performance in the World Cup. Former Pakistan cricketers have demanded the removal of Babar Azam as captain, but Shadab believes the responsibility for the defeats should not solely rest on the captain's shoulders. Babar's captaincy has come under scrutiny, and there has been talk of making wholesale changes in the team, including removing him as skipper. Shadab also expressed disappointment in his own performance and the team's failure to adapt to modern-day cricket. Meanwhile, England leg-spinner Adil Rashid, the team's leading wicket-taker in the World Cup, hopes it's not his last outing for England's ODI cricket. Rashid dismissed Shadab with a googly, which became one of the highlights of England's win against Pakistan.</description>

			<title>People dig deeper to fact-check social media posts when paired with someone who doesn’t share their perspective – new research</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/people-dig-deeper-to-fact-check-social-media-posts-when-paired-with-someone-who-doesnt-share-their-perspective-new-research/1841997/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background. The study focused on English and French participants and found that when paired with someone from the same cultural background, participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs, while those paired with someone from a different cultural background engaged in deeper searches and revised their beliefs in line with evidence. The researchers believe that bringing together people from opposing sides to fact-check contentious social media posts could improve media literacy and civil discourse. However, it may be challenging to get people from opposing sides to engage in such discussions. The researchers plan to conduct future studies on more controversial topics to further explore the effects of mismatched pairs.</description>

			<title>Reading ‘Modi’ script, mapping family trees — how Maharashtra’s scouring old records to identify Kunbis</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/politics/reading-modi-script-mapping-family-trees-how-maharashtras-scouring-old-records-to-identify-kunbis/1840541/</link>
			<description>The Maharashtra government is working to identify all Marathas who were once part of the Kunbi caste before the January 2 deadline for their reservation quota. District officials are scrambling to complete the identification process, with more than 300-400 government officials involved in each taluka. The government has directed districts to search various documents and publish Kunbi references found. Afterward, people will be asked to submit claims for caste certificates based on their genealogy. However, there are challenges such as old and delicate records, missing last names, and discrepancies between siblings' castes. Scanning the documents has been a challenge, with smartphone cameras being used due to the issues with regular scanners. The records are in different scripts, so Modi script readers and translators have been employed to identify the word "Kunbi" in various formats. Despite the difficulties, progress is being made, with some districts having already found thousands of Kunbi records.</description>

			<description>Megan Rapinoe, a two-time World Cup winner, expressed devastation after her final professional match ended prematurely due to injury.

The 2019 Ballon d'Or winner believes she tore her Achilles tendon but is awaiting further testing to confirm. Despite the disappointing ending, Rapinoe remains positive and grateful for her career. Gotham FC went on to win the match 2-1 and claim their first championship title. Rapinoe's early exit from her final match shocked fans and fellow U.S. women's national team veterans.</description>

			<title>Unlike AAP’s corruption in Delhi, UP’s excise policy is transparent: UP minister Nitin Agarwal</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/unlike-aaps-corruption-in-delhi-ups-excise-policy-is-transparent-up-minister-nitin-agarwal-2/1841972/</link>
			<description>The Uttar Pradesh Excise Minister, Nitin Agarwal, has accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi of engaging in corrupt practices that benefit the "liquor mafia." He stated that unlike Delhi, where one person can have more than two liquor shops, Uttar Pradesh restricts individuals to a maximum of two liquor shops. Agarwal highlighted that no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption have occurred during the current term of the Yogi Adityanath-led government. The excise policy of the Delhi government for 2021-22 came under scrutiny, leading to a recommendation for a CBI investigation into alleged irregularities by the Lieutenant Governor. Agarwal criticized the AAP for blaming the BJP and suggested that the leaders responsible for the excise scam were involved with the liquor mafia. Both the CBI and the ED are investigating the excise policy cases.

Agarwal emphasized that the UP excise department differs from Delhi's as it provides a level-playing field and operates on a pro-industry policy. He mentioned that the previous policies were not transparent and favored the liquor mafia. The minister stated that the current government welcomes anyone interested in doing business in the state and highlighted the revenue growth of the excise department since the formation of the BJP government in 2017. The target is to reach a revenue figure of Rs 50,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs 80,000 crore by 2027.

Agarwal also mentioned that there have been no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption in Uttar Pradesh during CM Adityanath's second term. He explained that deaths occur when local-level liquor production involves mixing jaggery with urea, which becomes poisonous if methyl alcohol is added. Agarwal assured that country liquor made in distilleries in Uttar Pradesh is safe. The department targets an annual growth rate of 8-10% and sells one crore cases of country liquor per month. Country liquor contributes 44% to the department's total revenue.</description>

			<description>The festive seasons in India can take a toll on the skin, leading to a dull and tired complexion. Winter pollution and indulgence in rich foods can further worsen skin issues. To maintain a glowing complexion, dermatologists recommend taking a vitamin B supplement, drinking plenty of water, and applying moisturizer regularly. Home remedies such as using vinegar and lime juice for dandruff or shampooing with beer can also help. Seeking advice from a dermatologist, especially in areas with heavy pollution, is advised. For specific skin issues, treatments like microdermabrasion and exfoliation creams can be effective. However, it is important not to try new treatments right before important events. Hydration, proper cleansing, and moisturizing are essential steps in a skincare routine. Using a micellar water for makeup removal and a gentle cleanser is recommended. Regular exfoliation and sunscreen application are also important. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for overall skin health. Following these skincare steps can ensure that the skin reflects the joy and brightness of the festive season.</description>

			<title>Lok Sabha polls: SBSP seeks to contest five seats in UP, Bihar; party chief dismisses INDIA bloc threat</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/lok-sabha-polls-sbsp-seeks-to-contest-five-seats-in-up-bihar-party-chief-dismisses-india-bloc-threat/1841960/</link>
			<description>The Chief of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Om Prakash Rajbhar, has stated that his party is prepared for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and has requested five seats from the BJP, their alliance partner, for the general elections. Rajbhar also mentioned that the opposition India bloc does not pose a challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as the constituent parties within the opposition fight among themselves. In response to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's statement on contesting in 65 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajbhar claimed that Yadav wants Narendra Modi to become the prime minister again, as the Congress becoming strong in Uttar Pradesh would weaken the Samajwadi Party. Rajbhar criticized Yadav's PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) strategy, stating that the Samajwadi Party only benefits the Yadavs and not the backward classes. SBSP won six seats in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party and later formally joined the NDA. Rajbhar dismissed the threat of the opposition India bloc, describing it as not a challenge and citing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's controversial comments in the assembly on women. SBSP, with a significant presence among the OBC Rajbhar caste, aims to contest a few parliamentary seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh and contiguous areas of Bihar. Regarding seat-sharing for the 2024 elections, Rajbhar stated that the SBSP has sought three seats in Uttar Pradesh and two in Bihar from the BJP. Although discussions on seat-sharing are yet to be held, the party is laying groundwork in Bihar. Rajbhar did not disclose the specific seats his party has requested. The SBSP was previously in an alliance with the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and won four seats, and Rajbhar served as a minister during Yogi Adityanath's first term. After formally rejoining the NDA in July, there is speculation about Rajbhar's return to the cabinet and the induction of another OBC leader, Dara Singh Chauhan.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has released a white paper blaming the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government for the economic crisis in Pakistan, according to a report by Dawn. The PTI claims that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, their government managed to put the economy on a path of rapid growth. The white paper argues that the PDM government, which came into power through a regime change conspiracy, reversed the economic gains achieved by the PTI-led government and caused more economic damage than natural disasters and the pandemic combined. The white paper highlights that when the PTI took office in 2018, the economy was on the verge of collapse, with various economic indicators such as an overvalued Pakistani rupee and a high current account deficit. The document also criticizes the previous government's mismanagement of the energy sector, particularly in relation to the overbuilding of power supply through imported fuel plants. The white paper states that the PTI government had to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance, which came with tough conditions such as increasing taxes and tariffs. Despite facing a global commodity super cycle that led to higher prices for petroleum products, edible oil, and coal, the PTI government was able to maintain control over inflation rates. The white paper also emphasizes that the PTI government accumulated additional debt compared to the previous government, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In related news, the PTI has canceled its public gathering in Karachi after the district administration denied permission. The PTI described the attitude of the authorities towards the party as unfair and stated that they were being denied a level-playing field.</description>

			<title>Jordan airdrops humanitarian aid to field hospital in Gaza Strip</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/jordan-airdrops-humanitarian-aid-to-field-hospital-in-gaza-strip/1841951/</link>
			<description>The Jordan Air Force has dropped humanitarian aid to a field hospital in the Gaza Strip, operated by Amman, to assist Gazan civilians amid the ongoing crisis. This is the second operation by Jordan in recent weeks, with packages being dropped from planes along with parachutes. Earlier this week, Jordan also airdropped medical aid into Gaza, bypassing Israel's tight embargo on aid entering the Strip. The move was coordinated with the US and Israel. However, Israel insists on inspecting all aid entering the Strip due to concerns about weapons smuggling. Gazans and rights groups have criticized the amount and pace of aid reaching the Strip as insufficient. Three babies died in a neonatal unit in northern Gaza after the hospital went "out of service" due to continuous Israeli fire in the vicinity. The hospital is currently treating 36 babies and providing shelter for around 20,000 displaced people.</description>

			<description>Israel's military is prepared to evacuate babies from Gaza's largest hospital after fuel ran out amid intense fighting in the area. Palestinian officials reported that two newborns have died and dozens more are at risk. The Rafah crossing into Egypt will reopen on Sunday for foreign passport holders after closing on Friday. Hamas claims to have destroyed over 160 Israeli military targets in Gaza, including more than 25 vehicles in the past 48 hours. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the deaths of five more Israeli soldiers in Gaza, bringing the total to 46 since ground operations began. Israel said rockets were still being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, where it claims that about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage by Hamas last month. Palestinian officials said that 11,078 Gaza residents had been killed in air and artillery strikes since October 7th, with around 40% of them being children. Israel's three major TV news channels reported progress towards a deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal would involve releasing women and minor Palestinian prisoners and considering letting fuel into Gaza while reserving the right to resume fighting.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the burden of expectations and individual records carried by cricket players Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. It questions the notion that they prioritized personal milestones over the team's success, suggesting that this accusation arises only when they approach a century. The article argues that intent cannot be judged based on a player's stroke play from 80 to 100, just as a bowler shouldn't be faulted for leaking runs in search of a wicket. The obsession with records in cricket is highlighted, with numerous examples mentioned, including Tendulkar's records. It emphasizes that Kohli understands the fans' obsession but states that breaking records isn't what truly drives his cricket. The article also addresses the criticism faced by players who are deemed good enough only for quick innings and argues that match situations and team requirements take precedence over personal milestones. It concludes by suggesting that individual records can coexist with team victories and questions whether fans can accept a Kohli century in a World Cup final loss.</description>

Talay believes that the international break will provide an opportunity to make further changes and prepare for their upcoming match against Western Sydney Wanderers.</description>

			<title>China’s Singles Day sales festival wraps up with e-commerce giants reporting sales growth</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/tech/chinas-singles-day-sales-festival-wraps-up-with-e-commerce-giants-reporting-sales-growth/1841908/</link>
			<description>Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce platforms, Tmall and Taobao, experienced positive growth during this year's Singles Day sales period. Competitor JD.com also reported a record high in gross merchandising volume (GMV) during the sales period. The Singles Day festival, originally a 24-hour online shopping event, has expanded into weeks of promotions across major e-commerce platforms and physical stores in China. Alibaba did not disclose the actual yuan value of its sales for the second consecutive year. The festival is seen as a measure of consumer confidence, and expectations for sales growth this year were subdued due to economic challenges. Alibaba pressured merchants to offer low prices for Singles Day to compete with rivals such as Douyin and Pinduoduo. A Bain and Company report found that consumers planned to spend less or the same compared to last year. Shoppers focused on purchasing necessities rather than discretionary items. The final sales picture and growth rates will take longer to emerge, as return rates are expected to be high this year.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Four construction workers were killed when a building collapsed during renovation in Wenzhou city, China. The incident was attributed to continuous rain that hindered rescue efforts. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the collapse. This incident is one of several similar accidents in recent months, including the collapse of a gym in Heilongjiang province that resulted in three fatalities. Authorities suspect the illegal stacking of construction materials on the gym's roof may have caused the collapse. These incidents have prompted concerns about building safety, with social media users calling for greater attention to be given to hidden dangers.</description>

			<title>Delhi may see best Diwali day air quality in 8 years if firecracker ban works</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/delhi-may-see-best-diwali-day-air-quality-in-8-years-if-firecracker-ban-works/1841906/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Delhi experienced its best air quality on Diwali day in eight years due to a strict ban on firecrackers and favorable weather conditions. The city woke up to clear skies and an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 202, the best in at least three weeks. The AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', while 201 and 300 are considered 'poor'. The improvement in air quality can be attributed to intermittent rainfall and wind speed that helped disperse pollutants. Last year, Delhi recorded an AQI of 312 on Diwali day. However, sporadic incidents of firecracker burning were reported despite the ban, which could lead to a rise in pollution levels.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/spains-sanchez-wins-support-for-pm-bid-amid-anger-over-catalan-amnesty-vow-2/1841904/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is likely to secure another term in office with the backing of regional parties, including the National Basque Party (PNV), the Canaries' coalition, and the Catalan separatist party Junts. This support would give Sanchez an absolute majority in the lower house. However, there is widespread anger over Sanchez's pledge of amnesty for Catalan separatists, with opinion polls showing the country divided on the issue. The proposed amnesty law would release civil servants involved in the illegal independence referendum in Catalonia in 2017 and allow separatist leaders, like Carles Puigdemont, to run for office again. Critics argue that the amnesty undermines the rule of law, while tensions have led to violent clashes between protesters and police.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) in India is launching a new initiative called "Aaina" (mirror), which aims to consolidate information on over 4,700 urban local bodies (ULBs) onto a single portal. The initiative is intended to help ULBs understand their current status and improve their performance and service delivery. The portal will provide data across domains such as planning and finance, allowing ULBs to learn from each other's work. Under the initiative, ULBs will be asked to provide data on five categories: planning, municipal finance, citizen-centric services, administrative structure, and basic service delivery. The new platform will also standardize data collection, as ULBs currently have different methods of collating data. The initiative is expected to aid in planning future schemes and serve as a knowledge-sharing platform for ULBs to improve their functioning.</description>

			<title>MP: Migration for employment continues in tribal-dominated Jhabua; BJP and Congress pass the blame</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/mp-migration-for-employment-continues-in-tribal-dominated-jhabua-bjp-and-congress-pass-the-blame/1841901/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Migration for employment opportunities is a significant issue in the Jhabua assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh. Many residents, like Ran Singh, migrate to Gujarat in search of work because the rocky land in Jhabua does not yield sufficient crops. Singh himself had worked as a cotton-picker in Gujarat in the past. The upcoming state assembly elections in Jhabua, a Congress stronghold reserved for scheduled tribes, have not generated much election atmosphere. The incumbent Congress candidate is Vikrant Bhuria, while the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded Bhanu Bhuria as their candidate. Vikrant claims that the BJP government has not done enough to increase employment opportunities in the tribal-dominated region, leading to migration. Bhanu Bhuria alleges that the lack of dams in Jhabua, which could have provided water for irrigation, has contributed to the migration issue. In the 2018 assembly elections, Guman Singh Damor of the BJP defeated Vikrant Bhuria, but subsequently resigned for the Lok Sabha seat. Kantilal Bhuria, another Congress candidate, won the by-election for the Jhabua assembly seat.</description>

			<description>An emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation was held in Riyadh to discuss Israel's invasion of Gaza. However, no practical measures were adopted against Israel. Discussions focused on stopping Israeli air traffic over the Gulf, preventing the US Air Force from delivering arms to Israel through Gulf air force bases, and cutting back oil sales to the US due to its support for Israel. Some Arab countries demanded that moderate Arab states suspend their economic relations with Israel, but a resolution to adopt these measures was blocked by Israel's Abraham accords partner states. Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco voted against the measures, along with Saudi Arabia, Mauritania, and Djibouti. The meeting also rejected an Iranian demand to designate the Israel Defense Forces as a terror organization.</description>

			<title>Hamas’s human shields: ‘Terrorists left the hospital with civilians’</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/hamass-human-shields-terrorists-left-the-hospital-with-civilians/1841897/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) evacuated Rantisi Hospital in the Gaza Strip to avoid harming Palestinian noncombatants. They chose not to target Hamas terrorists leaving with civilians and instead worked with the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) to later kill the terrorist who held approximately 1,000 Gaza residents hostage at the hospital. The IDF stated that Ahmed Siam, a commander of the Naser Radwan Company of Hamas, was killed while hiding in the Al Buraq School, along with other terrorists. The IDF emphasized that Hamas uses civilians as human shields for their terror activities.

The IDF's Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza clarified that there was no shooting or siege at Shifa Hospital, and they were willing to coordinate the safe evacuation of anyone who wanted to leave. However, Lt. Col. (res.) Peter Lerner stated that hospitals would have to be evacuated in order to go after Hamas.

The Givati Brigade, an IDF unit, had been asking civilians to leave Rantisi Hospital for three days, but they realized that Hamas was holding hostages there. The IDF allowed Hamas operatives to leave with civilians to avoid causing more harm. Nevertheless, terrorists still shot at those evacuating. IDF ground troops killed numerous terrorists and targeted infrastructure and weapons belonging to Hamas.

The IDF also conducted operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Furthermore, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah blamed the United States for the Israeli aggression against Gaza and called for pressure to be directed at them to stop the conflict.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have stated that they are working with hospital staff in Gaza to facilitate safe passage for Gazans from Shifa Hospital. The IDF spokesperson clarified that there is no siege of the hospital and that the east side of the hospital is open for Gazans who wish to leave. The hospital staff has requested assistance in transferring babies to a safer hospital, which the IDF has agreed to provide. However, three babies in the neonatal unit of Al-Shifa Hospital died after the hospital went "out of service" due to continuous Israeli fire. The hospital is reportedly surrounded, and doctors are now manually providing artificial respiration to 36 babies. The Hamas-run Ministry of Health estimates that there are around 400 people being treated at the hospital, with 20,000 displaced seeking shelter there. The hospital's intensive care unit, pediatric department, and oxygen devices have stopped working. In response to attacks, IDF fighter jets targeted Hezbollah infrastructure and military posts in Lebanon. The IDF also struck a Hezbollah terrorist cell and launch pad after rockets were launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel.</description>

			<title>Over 800 Sudanese reportedly killed by armed groups in West Darfur: UNHCR</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/over-800-sudanese-reportedly-killed-by-armed-groups-in-west-darfur-unhcr/1841889/</link>
			<description>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that over 800 people have been killed and more than 4.8 million people displaced in the past six months due to armed insurgency in Ardamata, Sudan's West Darfur region. The UN warns that the escalating violence in Darfur raises concerns of a repeat of the atrocities committed two decades ago. The conflict has resulted in the destruction of close to 100 shelters and extensive looting, including UNHCR relief items. In the past, thousands were killed and millions displaced during fighting between government forces and rebel groups in Darfur. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide has warned that continued fighting, including attacks based on ethnicity, could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. The UN refugee agency expresses alarm over reports of sexual violence, torture, arbitrary killings, extortion, and targeting of specific ethnic groups. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, urges an immediate end to the fighting and respect for civilians to avoid another catastrophe. Since mid-April, over 4.8 million people have been displaced within Sudan, with an additional 1.2 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Over 8,000 people have fled to Chad in the last week alone, according to UNHCR.</description>

			<title>Satisfaction level of Afghan women for their freedom, social life lowest in world: Survey</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/satisfaction-level-of-afghan-women-for-their-freedom-social-life-lowest-in-world-survey/1841881/</link>
			<description>According to a recent survey by the Gallup Institute, Afghan women have the lowest satisfaction level for their freedom and social life compared to other countries. Only 11% of Afghan women are satisfied with their social freedom in Afghanistan, while 17% said they are treated with respect. The survey highlights that women in Afghanistan continue to face suffering despite some level of freedom. The Taliban, however, dismissed the survey as invalid and claimed that the suffering of Afghan women has ended. The report also expresses concern about the deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and the pressure it puts on the lives of deported women and girls.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/trump-backs-requests-for-tv-coverage-of-his-federal-criminal-trial-court-filing/1841867/</link>
			<description>Former US President Donald Trump has filed a legal motion supporting media requests for live television coverage of his federal trial. Trump argues that prosecutors want the trial held in darkness as part of a politically motivated effort by President Joe Biden's administration to undermine his bid for re-election in 2024. Trump is facing four criminal proceedings, including charges of attempting to defraud the federal government and obstructing Congress by spreading false claims of election fraud. The latest filing by Trump's lawyers endorses media organizations' requests for live television coverage, stating that it would allow the American public to see that the case is a "dreamt-up constitutional charade." Special prosecutor Jack Smith had previously opposed the media requests, citing a federal court rule that prohibits broadcasts of criminal proceedings.</description>

			<title>Wegovy’s heart benefits due to more than weight loss, Novo says</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/wegovys-heart-benefits-due-to-more-than-weight-loss-novo-says/1841862/</link>
			<description>Novo Nordisk has announced new data that suggests the heart protective benefits of its obesity treatment, Wegovy, are not solely due to weight loss. The drug, which has been shown to help patients lose an average of 15% of their weight, also reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from heart disease by 20%, according to early data from the company's select trial. The study found that the cardiovascular benefits of Wegovy appeared almost immediately after starting treatment, suggesting they were not solely a result of weight loss. The drug also demonstrated a reduction in non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death. The study's authors note that while the mechanisms behind Wegovy's cardiovascular protection remain speculative, it has a consistent effect on associated risk factors such as inflammation, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. However, the trial did report adverse side effects, primarily gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, in almost 1,500 patients taking Wegovy compared to 718 patients in the placebo group. Novo Nordisk expects to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits in the U.S. and EU next year.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Pakistan's special envoy to Afghanistan, Asif Ali Durrani, has claimed that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is present in Afghanistan and that peace in Afghanistan has become a nightmare for Pakistan. According to Durrani, the TTP has disobeyed the Taliban's order to forbid terrorist acts within Pakistan. He highlighted the increase in attacks since the Taliban came to power, with suicide attacks having increased five hundred percent. Durrani questioned whether the TTP's disobedience invalidated their allegiance and called for their punishment. Political analysts emphasized the need for evidence-based discussions on the TTP's location, training, and equipment. They also stated that the TTP is an internal issue for Pakistan.</description>

			<description>Pakistan's decision to deport Afghan immigrants has been criticized by Mohammad Arsala Kharoti, the Taliban-appointed deputy of Afghanistan's Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation. Kharoti stated that the decision was rushed and violated the rights of immigrants, calling on Pakistan to allow them to return voluntarily. He highlighted that approximately 300,000 Afghan refugees had returned to Kabul from neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan, in the past two weeks. Kharoti emphasized that more assistance should be provided to these returnees, as current support from the international community and organizations is insufficient. Additionally, Jan Achakzai, Balochistan's caretaker information minister, claimed that the Pakistani government would take similar actions against those residing without legal documents in the country.</description>

Skirmishes occurred between the counter-protesters and police near the Cenotaph war memorial. The pro-Palestinian rally had a large turnout, and police were determined to prevent the two groups from meeting. Some pro-Palestinian protesters used chants and banners that were viewed by many as antisemitic. Similar protests also took place in Paris, where several thousand demonstrators called for a ceasefire in Gaza.

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/pakistan-play-old-school-cricket-to-end-world-cup-with-embarrassing-defeat-against-england/1841795/</link>
			<description>England defeated Pakistan by 93 runs in their World Cup game, securing seventh place in the tournament. Pakistan's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals were shattered as England scored 337 runs in their innings, while Pakistan only managed 244 runs in response. Pakistan's batting performance was lackluster, with Babar Azam and Mohammed Rizwan struggling to make an impact. The pitch conditions at Eden Gardens made it difficult for Pakistan to chase a near 340-run target. England's star-studded batting lineup, including Ben Stokes, Joe Root, and Jonny Bairstow, contributed to their commendable total. Stokes, in particular, played a crucial role in their batting performance, scoring 84 runs. Pakistan's Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi took wickets, but England lost momentum towards the end of their innings. Stokes, who returned from retirement, had a successful World Cup with three consecutive innings of 50-plus scores. Root also performed well, forming a 132-run partnership with Stokes. Bairstow provided a strong start for England with his quick 59 runs off 61 balls.</description>

			<description>Icelandic authorities have evacuated 3,000 residents from a town in the southwest of the island due to concerns of a volcanic eruption. The Icelandic Meteorological Office has warned of a "considerable" risk of an eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula, citing the size and movement of the underground magma intrusion. Professor Thorvaldur Thordarson, a volcanology expert, believes an eruption could occur within hours or days. The evacuation order is not described as an emergency, but authorities believe there is an immediate risk to the town. The area has experienced previous volcanic activity, including eruptions in 2021 and 2022. The current eruption threat is in the Fagradalsfjall volcanic system, which had been inactive for over 6,000 years prior to recent eruptions.</description>

			<title>LinkedIn says spy firm targeted Hungarian activists, journalists before 2022 election</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/linkedin-says-spy-firm-targeted-hungarian-activists-journalists-before-2022-election/1841758/</link>
			<description>Private spy firm Black Cube used LinkedIn to target Hungarian activists and journalists in a hidden video campaign leading up to Hungary's 2022 election, according to the professional networking site. Black Cube, based in Israel, created a network of fake personas on LinkedIn that used bogus job postings to connect with their targets. Video conversations occurred off-platform, and clips from those conversations were used to discredit NGOs in Hungary. LinkedIn has taken down the fake accounts and removed Black Cube's company page due to violations of its terms of service. Black Cube has previously been accused of interfering in Hungary's 2018 elections by secretly recording NGO leaders and publishing the footage on right-wing news outlets. The operation attributed to Black Cube by LinkedIn began in 2020 and targeted at least 12 activists and journalists critical of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The footage was widely covered in Hungarian media ahead of the election, which resulted in a victory for Orban's party.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/israels-war-on-hamas-homes-in-on-gaza-hospitals/1841754/</link>
			<description>The article reports on the dire situation in Gaza, where a baby has died and many patients are at risk due to an Israeli siege around Al Shifa hospital. Israel claims that Hamas militants have used hospitals as command centers, leading to their demand for evacuation. However, Hamas denies these allegations and argues that moving patients could result in their deaths. The hospital has suspended operations due to fuel shortages caused by Israeli shelling. Palestinian officials claim that Israeli snipers on nearby rooftops and ongoing bombardment make it dangerous for medics and people to move. Furthermore, clashes between Israeli troops and Hamas gunmen have been reported throughout Gaza City. The article also mentions that Hamas has requested international investigations into Israeli allegations of military use of hospitals. As the crisis continues, the health ministry warns that failure to bring in fuel will be a death sentence for patients, including 39 babies at risk. The World Health Organization expresses concerns about the safety of healthcare workers. Israel states that rockets are still being fired from Gaza into southern Israel, and it has implemented temporary pauses in firing to allow Gazans to evacuate. The article concludes by mentioning that Muslim and Arab countries meeting in Saudi Arabia called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza and held Israel responsible for "crimes" against Palestinians.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pro-palestinian-rally-kicks-off-in-london-amid-israel-hamas-war/1841739/</link>
			<description>Thousands of people gathered in central London for a pro-Palestinian rally to protest against Israeli aggression in Gaza. The protesters held signs that read "Free Palestine." The Metropolitan Police mobilized 1,850 officers to anticipate potential conflicts and disruption from splinter groups and far-right activists. The demonstrators planned to march to the US embassy to protest against the US's support for Israel. This protest was expected to draw even larger numbers than previous ones due to the political debate surrounding its occurrence. Counterprotesters faced off with the police, and a large group of counterprotesters was detained. In the US, anti-Israel demonstrators stormed Grand Central Terminal, closed the station, burned an Israeli flag, and chanted slogans against Israel.</description>

			<description>Pakistan cricket captain Babar Azam has been advised by his teammates not to step down from his position, despite criticism following the team's failure to qualify for the World Cup semi-finals. Babar has a strong following within the team, and players such as Imam ul Haq, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and Haris Rauf are considered to be close to him. Babar is expected to leave the decision of his captaincy up to the Pakistan Cricket Board, headed by Zaka Ashraf. While Babar has had success in T20 Internationals, his record in Tests and ODIs has been less impressive. The PCB head has stated that he will consult with former players, including Misbah ul Haq and Muhammad Hafeez, before making any decisions regarding the captaincy and team management.</description>

			<title>Pak stays till Dec 31st its decision to deport legal Afghan residents: Official</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pak-stays-till-dec-31st-its-decision-to-deport-legal-afghan-residents-official/1841736/</link>
			<description>The Pakistan government has suspended its decision to repatriate legal Afghan refugee residents whose residency documents expired this year. The pause will be in effect until December 31. Previously, the government had planned to send back Afghans living with legal documents after their expiration. The deportation of illegal Afghan refugees has been ongoing, with as many as 250,000 voluntarily returning home and 80,000 being deported. The decision was made due to concerns that Afghan soil is being used by terrorists to target Pakistan. Pressure from international organizations and countries has urged Pakistan not to deport Afghans who fled the Taliban rule or conflict in their home country. Pakistan claims there are approximately 1.7 million illegal Afghan residents. Human rights groups have criticized Pakistan's move, warning of a potential humanitarian crisis and increased child labor in Afghanistan.</description>

			<description>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that a committee will be formed to empower the Madigas, a Scheduled Caste community, in response to their demand for categorization. Speaking at a rally organized by the Madiga Reservation Porata Samithi (MRPS), Modi pledged to end the injustice faced by the Madigas and ensure their access to justice through legal processes. He also criticized the Congress party for its treatment of B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian constitution. Modi accused the Congress of preventing Ambedkar from winning elections and not displaying his portrait in parliament. He also took a swipe at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government, stating that it had failed to appoint a Dalit chief minister as promised during the statehood agitation. Modi apologized on behalf of political parties and leaders who had made promises to the Madigas in the past and betrayed them. During the rally, Modi interacted with a young woman who had climbed a structure and thanked her for expressing her concerns.</description>

			<title>Turbulent winters are coming. Blame El Niño and global warming combo</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/environment/turbulent-winters-are-coming-blame-el-nino-and-global-warming-combo/1841694/</link>
			<description>According to a new forecast from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the climate pattern known as "El Niño" is predicted to intensify over the winter, potentially leading to a winter of extreme weather, particularly in the US. El Niño refers to a rise in sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, which results in warmer-than-average weather globally. After three years of a cooling phase called La Niña, El Niño is returning at a time when the world is already experiencing high temperatures due to climate change. As a result, NOAA predicts warmer-than-average temperatures in wide areas of the US, along with above-average rainfall in some southern states. El Niño's impact extends beyond the Americas, with potential hotter and drier weather in areas like Australia and Indonesia, and increased hurricane activity in the Pacific Ocean. Studies suggest that global warming may lead to stronger El Niño phases, and climate-related risks are a top concern for risk experts. Mitigating and adapting to climate change is seen as the most pressing issue of the next decade.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Tribal activists in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, are demanding recognition of Sarna as a separate religion and have threatened to immolate themselves if Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn't make an announcement regarding it during his visit on November 15. They will also observe a fast in support of their demand. The activists are part of the Adivasi Sengel Abhiyan (ASA) group, and its president, Salkhan Murmu, stated that the decision to immolate was made independently by two ASA members. The activists are expecting the Prime Minister to address their demand for the recognition of a separate 'Sarna' religion and will carry out immolations at 4 pm at Ulihatu and Bokaro if their demand is not met. ASA leaders from Assam, Bengal, and Jharkhand have decided to hold a rail and road blockade on December 30 to support their cause. Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren has stated that the decision to recognize the 'Sarna' religion is pending with the center. Soren has previously requested the recognition of the 'Sarna' code for tribals, asserting that their population in the region has decreased over the years.</description>

			<title>Can taking salt off the table help prevent diabetes? It’s not that simple</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/can-taking-salt-off-the-table-help-prevent-diabetes-its-not-that-simple/1841665/</link>
			<description>A new study from Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that salt consumption may be linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the study is an observational study and cannot prove causation, only association. The data used to assess salt intake was based on a simple question, making it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of salt associated with an increased risk. Most salt intake comes from processed foods rather than added at the table. The study also found a weak association between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but did not provide specific recommendations for reducing salt intake. The key takeaway is that maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet are known to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.</description>

			<description>The Taliban's Embassy in Qatar has expressed concerns about the forced deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan in a memorandum addressed to diplomatic and international organizations. The memo, obtained by Khaama Press, criticizes Pakistan for its mistreatment and inadequate handling of Afghan refugees during the deportation process. It highlights that Pakistan made the decision to deport Afghan refugees without consulting the Afghan government, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The Afghan Embassy in Qatar calls for Pakistan to be held accountable for the consequences of its actions and to collaborate with Afghanistan in finding solutions to the crisis. The statement also raises concerns about the well-being and rights of Afghan nationals facing harsh conditions and mistreatment during repatriation. The mass deportation of Afghan nationals poses significant challenges for Afghanistan, which must reintegrate these individuals into society and provide essential services. The Afghan government seeks international support and attention for the issue, aiming to uphold the rights and dignity of its citizens. The report emphasizes the need for cooperation, diplomacy, and international engagement to address the deportation crisis and ensure the well-being of Afghan refugees.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-seeks-usd600-million-from-chinese-banks-amid-imf-bailout-negotiations/1841619/</link>
			<description>Pakistan has formally requested fresh loans amounting to USD 600 million from two Chinese banks, as part of its ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a USD 3 billion bailout package. The Pakistani government is in discussions with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Bank of China, seeking a combined loan of USD 600 million. China has been a crucial source of financial support for Pakistan, providing various forms of assistance. These loans are important for Pakistan's low credit ratings and fragile macroeconomic situation, which have made it challenging to secure financing. Successful completion of the negotiations is expected to have a positive impact on Pakistan's credit ratings and access to capital markets. Under the terms of the IMF bailout deal, Pakistan has committed to adopting a market-based exchange rate regime.</description>

			<title>Kerala farmer ends life allegedly due to financial crisis; Governor, opposition criticise govt</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/kerala-farmer-ends-life-allegedly-due-to-financial-crisis-governor-opposition-criticise-govt/1841603/</link>
			<description>A farmer in Alappuzha district, Kerala, allegedly died by suicide due to financial problems related to unpaid paddy procurement. The farmer, K G Prasad, left a suicide note blaming the state government and some banks for his extreme step. This incident has sparked a political controversy in Kerala. The opposition party leader, V D Satheesan, criticized the government for its failure in paddy procurement and delayed payments to farmers. While the police are yet to confirm the exact reason behind the farmer's suicide, friends and other farmers claim that Prasad took his own life because he didn't receive payment from the government for the paddy he had procured. The farmer's alleged suicide note accused the government and banks of being responsible for his death. A video call made by Prasad before his death was also broadcasted, where he expressed his frustration over banks denying him a loan due to a low credit score. Farmers have expressed grievances over the government's handling of the situation and lack of support for their financial struggles. Governor Arif Muhammed Khan expressed his condolences to Prasad's family and acknowledged the crisis faced by farmers in the state. The opposition parties, Congress and BJP, blamed the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) government for neglecting farmers' issues. The state government defended itself, stating that PRS arrears were not the reason for the farmer's suicide, and money had been paid for the rice procured from farmers.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/human-rights-group-accuses-pakistan-of-using-afghan-refugees-as-political-pawns/1841567/</link>
			<description>Amnesty International has called on the Government of Pakistan to stop the detention, deportation, and alleged harassment of Afghan refugees. The human rights group expressed concern for the safety of Afghan refugees returning to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, citing reports of harassment in holding centers and instances where legal migrants with proper documentation were targeted. Amnesty warned that continued deportations would deny at-risk Afghans, especially women and girls, access to safety, education, and livelihood. The international community has been reluctant to recognize the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan due to allegations of human rights violations. Pakistan has linked the increase in terrorist incidents to the Taliban's return to power and their failure to take action against militants using Afghan soil for attacks in Pakistan. The Doha Accord, which facilitated the US exit from Afghanistan, included assurances from the Taliban that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against any country, including Pakistan.</description>

			<description>Bharat Housing Network, a technology platform for co-lending in affordable housing, has raised INR 125 crores in funding. The investment was led by NABVENTURES Fund, with participation from other investors such as Varanium NexGen Fund, 9Unicorns, Riverwalk Holdings, SMK Ventures, DMI Sparkle Fund, LC Nueva, and more. This is the seventh investment announced by NABVENTURES Fund in 2023.

Bharat Housing Network is India's largest co-lending infrastructure for credit delivery in the affordable mortgages-priority sector. The platform provides capital, technology, and infrastructure to housing finance companies and non-banking finance companies. It operates on a hybrid capital model for growth and scale.

The demand for housing finance in India is expected to grow significantly due to the country's growing population, rising household incomes, and declining average household size. The industry is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13-14% in the long run, with home loan originations reaching INR 10.4 trillion by FY25 and INR 18.7 trillion by FY30. The co-lending platform aims to address this demand, with a focus on the &lt;INR 2.5 million ticket size category.

The platform's integrated technology stack offers a complete co-lending solution to lenders in the affordable housing finance segment. It has onboarded 23 financial institutions and leverages partner branch networks across 12 states. Since its inception in 2021, the platform has achieved significant growth while maintaining high asset quality.

Bharat Housing Network is enabling financial inclusion by providing credit to semi-urban and rural areas. It focuses on delivering housing credit to low-income and economically weaker sections of society, contributing to 13 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The investment by NABVENTURES Fund aligns with the government's initiatives, such as PM Awaas Yojana, to encourage low-cost housing and affordable loans. The CEO of NABVENTURES Fund highlighted the importance of affordable housing and their intention to invest in at least nine startups by the year-end.

The founder of Equity 360 expressed confidence in Bharat Housing Network's ability to contribute to the "Housing for All" vision of New India. The platform aims to make housing credit more accessible and affordable across income groups.

The UAE aims to have a moderating influence on Israel's campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. The mounting death toll in Gaza has stirred outrage in Arab capitals, but the UAE has publicly condemned Israel's actions and called for an end to the violence. The UAE is also working to moderate the public positions of other Arab states to facilitate a return to dialogue once the war ends. The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and has no plans to sever diplomatic ties. The UAE's motivation for establishing ties with Israel includes shared concerns over Iran and economic-driven realignment of foreign policy. Despite their close ties, Abu Dhabi has been concerned about Israel's right-wing government's expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and visits to the Al Aqsa mosque compound. The displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan is seen as a red line for Abu Dhabi. The UAE has distanced itself from Hamas, viewing them as a threat to regional stability. They have played a significant role in opposing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Sudan.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/japan-led-navy-exercise-starts-with-philippines-observing-for-first-time/1841541/</link>
			<description>Japan has started a joint annual military exercise called Annualex, with the Philippines observing the operations for the first time. The exercise involves the naval forces of the United States, Australia, and Canada, with the Philippines attending as an observer. The goal is to seek closer maritime cooperation between Japan and the Philippines. The exercise is not being conducted to target a specific country, but rather to enhance security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. The operations will last for 10 days and involve 30 ships and 40 aircraft. This comes as Japan, the US, and the Philippines aim to strengthen ties and deepen security cooperation to counter China. Last week, Japan announced it would provide radar systems to the Philippines, and the two countries also started negotiations for a reciprocal military access agreement.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/mexicos-acapulco-hit-by-garbage-pile-up-after-deadly-hurricane/1841538/</link>
			<description>Residents of Acapulco are facing an additional issue following Hurricane Otis: piles of garbage in the streets. The hurricane, which struck on October 25th, caused major flooding and destroyed many homes in the city. As a result, furnishings, bedding, and household appliances are being discarded outside homes along with bags of rotting organic waste, causing foul odors and concerns about disease. The government has deployed troops to help clean up the city, but the rubbish is accumulating rapidly. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has stated that clearing up Acapulco is a top priority and measures are being taken to prevent disease. However, experts warn that if waste blocks drainage and contaminates the water supply, there is a risk of mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue and yellow fever outbreaks.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Saudi Arabia hosted an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh, gathering Arab and Muslim leaders to address the conflict in Gaza. The summit is expected to strongly condemn Israel's campaign in Gaza, as well as the forced displacement of Palestinians. Leaders from various countries, including Iran, Turkey, Qatar, and Syria, are attending. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi emphasized the need for action rather than just talk, suggesting that Muslim countries ban Israel from using their airspace and prevent the US from shipping weapons to Israel. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman condemned the military assault and violations of international law by Israeli authorities. The war in Gaza has caused an escalation of violence and strained traditional Middle East alliances. This summit replaces two separate gatherings and aims to address the "extraordinary" Gaza situation. Hamas called for a decisive decision to stop Zionist aggression, while Arab foreign ministers were divided on their response to Israel, with some countries pushing for diplomatic ties to be severed and others emphasizing the need to maintain open channels of communication.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/india/vigilance-minister-initiates-inquiry-against-delhi-chief-secy-in-bamnoli-land-acquisition-case/1841501/</link>
			<description>Delhi Vigilance Minister Atishi has initiated an inquiry into a complaint against Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar. The complaint alleges that the chief secretary's son was employed by a relative of a landowner who received enhanced compensation for land acquired for a road project. Atishi has directed the divisional commissioner and vigilance director to provide all the files related to the land acquisition. The chief secretary claims that the complaint is an act of "mudslinging" by disgruntled individuals facing vigilance investigations. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has requested a detailed report on the matter. The complaint involves the acquisition of land in Bamnoli village for the Dwarka Expressway. The District Magistrate and the Additional District Magistrate had differing valuations for the land, resulting in a significant increase in compensation. Hemant Kumar, who awarded the increased compensation, was suspended by the Ministry of Home Affairs and a CBI probe was ordered. The involvement of the chief secretary is now being examined.</description>

Mathews became the first player in international cricket to be dismissed for a time ruling when he failed to be ready within the two-minute allowance to face Bangladesh captain and bowler Shakib Al Hasan. Mathews' helmet chin strap broke, and by the time a replacement arrived, he was judged to have overrun his time. Mathews called Bangladesh "disgraceful" and criticized the umpires for lacking common sense. However, the MCC said Mathews should have informed the umpires about his broken helmet and asked for time to resolve the issue.

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh stated that the party is seeking a mandate based on the accomplishments of its government in Rajasthan over the past five years. He accused the BJP of focusing on polarisation and using the ED and CBI as their main strategy. Ramesh dismissed the allegations made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi against the Rajasthan government, calling them baseless. He emphasized that the BJP cannot criticize the schemes of the Congress government as they are not in a position to do so. Ramesh expressed confidence that the people of Rajasthan will reject polarisation and the politics of the ED and CBI in the upcoming elections. He criticized the central government's policy of privatization, stating that it is not in the country's interest and has led to declining employment. Ramesh believes that the Congress will receive public support in the elections due to the absence of anti-incumbency and resentment against the state government.</description>

			<title>Study gives more insight into bacterium’s protective role in chronic rhinosinusitis</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/science/study-gives-more-insight-into-bacteriums-protective-role-in-chronic-rhinosinusitis/1841441/</link>
			<description>The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been increasing in Japan and around the world. CRS is an inflammatory condition that causes symptoms like nasal congestion, discharge, trouble breathing, face pain, and loss of smell. Treating CRS is challenging because it presents in various ways. There are two categories: eosinophilic (ECRS) and non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS) CRS. ECRS is associated with higher levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that releases pro-inflammatory substances, in the nasal and sinus tissues.

The rise in CRS is influenced by environmental factors, which in turn are affected by lifestyle changes. The role of the nasal microbiome in the development of ECRS has not been clear. To address this, a research team from the University of Fukui conducted a study on CRS in a Japanese population, specifically focusing on the nasal microbiome. They collected nasal swabs from 143 subjects, including those with ECRS, non-ECRS, and healthy controls.

The researchers found significant differences in the microbiome diversity between the CRS and control groups, indicating the involvement of the nasal microbiome in the disease. Additionally, they observed distinct microbiome compositions between the ECRS and non-ECRS groups. The bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum) was found to be less abundant in patients with ECRS. Metagenomic analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis was greater in patients with non-ECRS compared to ECRS.

Based on these findings, the researchers speculated that LPS produced by F nucleatum may be linked to the pathogenesis of both ECRS and non-ECRS. Further experiments demonstrated that LPS derived from F nucleatum suppressed the expression of ALOX15, an enzyme involved in nasal polyps and eosinophil-related inflammation.

The study concludes that disruptions in the nasal microbiome likely play a crucial role in ECRS. Understanding this could lead to the development of more effective strategies for treating CRS. The researchers believe that the microbiome may also have an impact on other allergic diseases and suggest future studies for probiotic development and lifestyle modifications to prevent chronic sinusitis.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/world/riyadh-hosts-islamic-arab-summit-to-push-for-gaza-war-end/1841434/</link>
			<description>Saudi Arabia is hosting an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh, gathering Arab and Muslim leaders to address the conflict in Gaza. The summit is expected to strongly condemn Israel's campaign in Gaza and call for an end to the forced displacement of Palestinians. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who is attending the summit, emphasized the need for action rather than words in resolving the conflict. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman condemned the military assault on Gaza and the violations of international law by Israeli authorities. The war in Gaza has strained Middle East alliances, with Saudi Arabia engaging more closely with Iran and delaying plans to normalize ties with Israel. The summit replaces two separate gatherings and aims to unify efforts and establish a collective position on the Gaza situation. Arab foreign ministers were divided on whether to cut diplomatic ties with Israel, with some countries advocating for maintaining open channels with the Israeli government.</description>

			<title>Joe Biden to meet with Xi Jinping – what a good result looks like for the US president</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/joe-biden-to-meet-with-xi-jinping-what-a-good-result-looks-like-for-the-us-president/1841433/</link>
			<description>As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. US President Joe Biden is expected to meet with China's leader, Xi Jinping, during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in San Francisco. This meeting holds significance as the two leaders have not met since the G20 in 2022 and have disagreements on global conflicts, including the Ukraine war. Biden's relationship with Xi is strained, and topics such as China's position on Taiwan, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the US-China trade relationship are expected to be on the agenda. The US-China relationship may have an impact on the 2024 US presidential election, with a majority of Americans having a negative view of China. Biden aims to curb China's economic growth and limit its diplomatic influence while maintaining US geopolitical dominance. The meeting may also involve discussions on AI, military dialogue, and the possibility of China restricting the supply of chemicals used to make fentanyl. The expectations of the meeting have not been outlined by either side, but it is seen as a catalyst for further negotiations.</description>

			<title>Do you know lung cancer screening significantly improves long-term survival? Study finds</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/do-you-know-lung-cancer-screening-significantly-improves-long-term-survival-study-finds/1841425/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in Radiology found that low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening can significantly increase the cure rate for early-stage lung cancer over a 20-year period. The study revealed that individuals who received a CT screening-based diagnosis of lung cancer had an estimated 81% survival rate after 20 years. Among those diagnosed, 81% had stage I illness, and 87% of them had an 87% long-term survival rate. The study emphasized the importance of routine early screening, as only 21% of lung cancers are currently diagnosed at an early stage in the United States. Additionally, the study highlighted that symptoms mainly occur in late-stage lung cancer, making early screening crucial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for adults aged 50 to 80 with a 20-pack-year smoking history. The researchers involved in the study have been studying the effectiveness of CT screening for lung cancer detection for years, and the study builds upon their previous research.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The European Pakistani Christian Action Committee held a protest outside the European Parliament, highlighting various issues faced by religious minorities in Pakistan. They raised concerns about the abuse of blasphemy laws, a culture of impunity, discrimination, incitement of violence, coerced faith conversions, and forced child marriages of Christian and Hindu girls. The protesters called on the European Union to encourage Pakistan to adhere to human rights obligations under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Plus status. They demanded reforms in the Pakistani legal system, including amendments to blasphemy laws and the introduction of laws criminalizing coerced faith conversion. A member of the European Parliament, Charlie Weimers, attended the protest and condemned forced conversions and child marriages. The protest also emphasized Pakistan's responsibility as a beneficiary of the GSP Plus mechanism to improve freedom of expression and religion. The protesters criticized the Pakistani government for its handling of blasphemy laws, specifically mentioning the case of Anwar Kenneth, a Christian man sentenced to death under blasphemy charges. They called for his immediate acquittal and release without any conditions. Pastors at the protest expressed the need for tangible changes to make Pakistan safer for religious minorities, and they hope the EU will leverage its influence to bring about this change.</description>

			<title>COP28 aims to bolster climate action, reinforcing Paris Agreement as a global cornerstone</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/cop28-aims-to-bolster-climate-action-reinforcing-paris-agreement-as-a-global-cornerstone/1841417/</link>
			<description>The article discusses the impact of heatwaves that occurred in July and August of the previous year, causing widespread disruptions such as forest fires, water and food shortages, and hurricanes resulting in numerous deaths. The global momentum for addressing climate change is increasing, and world leaders will discuss effective solutions at COP28, which will be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The conference marks a turning point after the Paris Agreement (COP21) in 2015, where countries committed to limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and making efforts to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Paris Agreement focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting technology transfer and adaptation to carbon-free economies. The agreement's provisions include two review processes until 2025. It entered into force in 2016 after being signed by 195 countries and ratified by 191 out of 197 countries.

COP28 will initiate the first global stocktake of progress made in implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement, measuring countries' efforts to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United Nations emphasizes the need to recalibrate the course due to the significant increase in global temperatures. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledges the challenges faced by developing countries in responding to climate change and calls for funding support.

Air pollution's detrimental impact on health, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO issued new Air Quality Guidelines, emphasizing the need to reduce suffering and save lives through improved air quality.

Fossil fuels are identified as the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions and around 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. To address the climate challenge, emissions must be reduced by nearly half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050. The UN emphasizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, accessible, and sustainable sources of energy.

Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water, waste, and geothermal energy, are highlighted as effective alternatives to fossil fuels. While cleaner energy sources are gaining ground, fossil fuels still dominate global energy production with over 80% contribution.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address climate change, particularly in light of recent extreme weather events and their devastating consequences.</description>

			<title>Urban land pattern may hold key to reduce exposure to weather extremes, study finds</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/urban-land-pattern-may-hold-key-to-reduce-exposure-to-weather-extremes-study-finds/1841368/</link>
			<description>Scientists from the universities of Delaware and Wyoming have found that the layout of cities can help in reducing population exposure to future weather extremes. The design of urban landscapes, including how buildings are spread out or clustered, seems to be more important than the size of a city. The researchers investigated how changes in urban land and population will affect future populations' exposures to weather extremes by the end of the 21st century. Well-planned urban land patterns can reduce population exposures to weather extremes, regardless of the size of a city. The findings encourage researchers and practitioners to reconsider how cities are designed and built to be more resilient to climate risks. The researchers looked at urban areas across the US and predicted their growth by 2100. They analyzed how these urban land changes might affect weather extremes and the number of people potentially exposed to these events. Carefully designed urban land patterns can reduce the increase in risks caused by climate change. The researchers suggest adjusting how cities are built and renovated to consider their natural surroundings and create an integrated human-environment system.</description>

			<title>UAE leverages oil power to push secretive oil companies on emission reductions: Report</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/uae-leverages-oil-power-to-push-secretive-oil-companies-on-emission-reductions-report/1841299/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is using its position as an oil producer and host of the upcoming United Nations climate talks to urge secretive state-run oil companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The UAE's effort, called the Global Decarbonisation Alliance, aims to have a significant impact at the COP28 negotiations in Dubai. Led by Sultan al-Jaber, head of this year's climate talks and chief of the UAE's national oil company, the initiative suggests using resources to clean up petroleum production rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels. It seeks to engage national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Colombia's Ecopetrol, which account for half of global crude production and hold 90% of the world's oil and gas reserves. While environmentalists criticize the lack of stringency and inclusion of emissions from oil and gas produced and sold, supporters hope that public and international pressure will encourage these companies to adopt eco-friendly practices. A spokesperson for COP28 confirmed that 20 companies, both national and investor-owned, have already joined the alliance. Critics also express concerns about the leadership of al-Jaber, as his role overseeing negotiations while heading Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) may lack impartiality. Nonetheless, the potential alliance of oil producers represents the first such effort to institutionalize engagement on climate emissions within the industry.</description>

			<title>Pakistan’s move to deport Afghan refugees increases mistrust between Kabul-Islamabad: Taliban spokesperson</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/pakistans-move-to-deport-afghan-refugees-increases-mistrust-between-kabul-islamabad-taliban-spokesperson/1841293/</link>
			<description>Pakistan's forceful expulsion of Afghan refugees has led to increased mistrust among Afghans towards Pakistan, according to Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid. He also denied the presence of terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan. The Balochistan caretaker information minister, Jan Achakzai, claimed that Pakistan would start a similar campaign against Afghan refugees with legal documents. However, Achakzai previously called on Afghan officials to hand over refugees coming from across the Durand Line. The Taliban spokesperson denied Achakzai's remarks and stated that Afghan soil is not used against anyone. Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman, president of Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Pakistan, called for the formation of a joint commission between Kabul and Islamabad to facilitate the deportation of Afghan refugees. Pakistan has been blaming Afghanistan for the surge in terror attacks in their country. Around 200,000 Afghans have returned home via the Torkham border after Pakistan ordered 1.7 million undocumented Afghans to leave or face deportation.</description>

			<title>ONGC Q2 net profit drops 20 pc on lower oil prices, output</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/ongc-q2-net-profit-drops-20-pc-on-lower-oil-prices-output/1841290/</link>
			<description>State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a 20% drop in net profit for the September quarter due to lower oil prices and decreased output. The company's net profit was Rs 10,216 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs 12,826 crore in the same period last year. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline in net profit for ONGC. The decline in profit is mainly attributed to lower oil prices and slightly lower oil and gas production. However, the company expects production to increase in the current quarter with the start of production from a new oilfield in the KG basin. ONGC also faced challenges such as a shutdown in Panna-Mukta for commissioning a new crude oil pipeline and disruptions caused by Cyclone Biparjoy. Despite the current decline in production, ONGC anticipates compensation with the commencement of additional production from new projects.</description>

			<title>5 green flags that show your employer is serious about making you find ‘purpose’ in work</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/feature/5-green-flags-that-show-your-employer-is-serious-about-making-you-find-purpose-in-work/1841273/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The concept of purpose at work is important to many individuals, with 70% of respondents in a survey stating that their personal sense of purpose is defined by their work. Organizations often use the promise of purpose to attract and retain employees, offering opportunities to contribute to social or ecological causes beyond just completing tasks. However, sometimes employers fail to deliver on this promise, engaging in "purpose-washing" where they make promises but don't follow through with consistent actions.

To determine if an employer's promise of purpose is genuine, there are five green flags to look for. Firstly, the organization should dedicate resources such as time, money, training, and staff towards purpose-driven work. Secondly, they should provide well-being support to protect employees from exploitation and burnout. Thirdly, purpose should be made relevant to all roles within the organization, encouraging collaboration beyond specific departments. Fourthly, diverse representation across gender, race, occupations, and organizational levels can facilitate purpose-driven aims. Lastly, organizations should provide opportunities for employees to see the impact of their work, whether through reports, case studies, or feedback conversations.

While purpose-driven work may be justified by its benefits to the organization and bottom line, solely relying on this justification can disconnect employees from their values over time. Instead, organizations need to redefine what counts as doing business and adapt their operations accordingly. This includes giving autonomy to purpose-driven workers, aligning performance indicators and reward systems with efforts to change, and creating career paths that value and support purpose-driven projects.

Ultimately, purpose can provide meaningful work for those interested in finding solutions to social and ecological challenges. Falling victim to purpose-washing can negatively affect one's career and well-being, so it's crucial to identify companies that demonstrate commitment, authenticity, and support for purpose-driven initiatives.</description>

			<description>The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a rush to extract cobalt, a crucial component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and low-carbon innovations. The country's Katanga region holds more cobalt reserves than the rest of the world combined. However, this exploitation of resources is reminiscent of King Leopold II's brutal reign, during which millions of Congolese lost their lives. Today, the harsh realities of cobalt mining involve hazardous conditions, including child labor and toxic exposure. Companies in the supply chain claim to uphold human rights standards but often fail to address these issues effectively. International coalitions, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), aim to ensure clean supply chains and eliminate child labor in cobalt mining. However, on-ground observations reveal extreme suffering and environmental devastation in the Congo due to cobalt extraction.</description>

			<title>Global economic jitters: Fitch Ratings predicts 2024 impact from soaring oil price</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/economy/global-economic-jitters-fitch-ratings-predicts-2024-impact-from-soaring-oil-price/1841217/</link>
			<description>Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has issued a warning about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic growth. The agency's Global Economic Outlook predicts that potential disruptions in the Middle East's oil supply due to conflicts could cause oil prices to surge, leading to a significant decrease in global GDP growth and a rise in inflation. Fitch's simulations show that if oil prices reach USD 120 per barrel in 2024 and USD 100 per barrel in 2025, there could be a 0.4 percentage point reduction in world GDP growth in 2024, with a lingering 0.1 percentage point lower growth in 2025. The impact is expected to be felt across the board, with most countries experiencing longer-lasting effects on GDP levels. Inflation rates would also be elevated in 2024, with India, Turkey, and Poland being particularly affected. Fitch highlights the potential ripple effects of an oil price shock, such as tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets. The report emphasizes the intricate web of global economic interdependencies and the vulnerabilities arising from geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions.</description>

			<link>https://theprint.in/sport/australia-have-a-good-reference-of-playing-a-sf-says-van-der-dussen/1841214/</link>
			<description>South Africa's Rassie Van der Dussen believes that Australia has a good reference for winning knockout matches, but South Africa will maintain their must-win mindset in the upcoming semifinal match. Van der Dussen acknowledges that Australia has more experience in these situations, having won the World Cup and played in the semifinals before. However, he emphasizes that the outcome will depend on the performance of the teams on the day. South Africa has approached the tournament with a must-win mentality from the start, and they will continue to do so. Van der Dussen also mentions that South Africa wanted to test themselves by chasing down a total before the semifinal, as their chasing record in the tournament has been poor. They were successful in their recent match against Afghanistan, where Van der Dussen played a crucial unbeaten innings. South Africa's captain, Temba Bavuma, is a doubtful starter for the semifinal due to a hamstring injury. If he is unable to play, Reeza Hendricks is likely to open the batting.</description>

			<title>On CM Chouhan’s home turf Budhni, Congress’ ‘Hanuman’ seeks to pull off a miracle</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/india/on-cm-chouhans-home-turf-budhni-congress-hanuman-seeks-to-pull-off-a-miracle-2/1841213/</link>
			<description>The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh is preparing for assembly polls, with BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing Congress candidate Vikram Mastal. Despite the entry of Samajwadi Party's Vairagyanand Giri, also known as Mirchi Baba, the contest has not gained much momentum. Chouhan, confident in his position as the longest-serving chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, has not visited his assembly constituency since filing nomination papers. The BJP dominates the constituency with their flags and posters, while the Congress' presence is scarce. Although the BJP has chosen not to project Chouhan as its CM face this time, they heavily rely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity to secure victory. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains optimistic about his chances and claims that people are angry with Chouhan for not doing enough for Budhni. However, supporters of Chouhan believe he will win due to his track record and the development he has brought to the area. Chouhan's son Kartikeya is actively campaigning on his behalf, aiming for a record victory margin. Overall, Budhni seems to have a strong support base for Chouhan, although Mastal is putting up a brave fight.</description>

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.WeWork's announcement of its intent to terminate 65 leases as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing has had a significant impact on the real estate industry.

Some notable affected properties include 222 Kearny Street in San Francisco, 57 East 11th Street in Greenwich Village, and 315 West 36th Street in Hudson Yards.

The impacts of the bankruptcy filing are substantial and complex for WeWork's relationships with these spaces.</description>

			<description>The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh appears lukewarm to the upcoming assembly polls, despite BJP's longest-serving chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing competition from Congress candidate Vikram Mastal and Samajwadi Party's Vairagyanand Giri. Chouhan, who has won four times from Budhni since 2006, has not visited his assembly constituency after filing nomination papers. BJP flags dominate the constituency, while Congress emblems are rare. The BJP has focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi rather than projecting Chouhan as its CM face. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains confident, banking on people's anger towards Chouhan.

			<description>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the Hamas terror group misfired a projectile at IDF troops near Shifa Hospital in Gaza. However, Hamas-run media immediately stated that the strike was carried out by the IDF. The IDF Arab Spokesman Avichay Adraee confirmed that a rocket-propelled grenade hit the hospital, and Hamas was responsible for the failed missile. The IDF also reported that they controlled the Hamas Beach Brigade's Badr site and eliminated approximately 150 Hamas terrorists. The 401st Armored Brigade destroyed the military command headquarters, rocket launch sites, and manufacturing sites for weapons and rocket launchers. About 30 Hamas saboteurs were found inside the Blue Beach hotel, using it as a safe haven and to plan attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that Israel is trying to avoid harming Gazan civilians, while Hamas is preventing civilians from moving to safe zones and using them as human shields. Netanyahu also accused Hamas of using schools, mosques, and hospitals as terror command centers. The Israeli Foreign Ministry revised the death toll of last month's Hamas attacks to nearly 1200.</description>

			<title>This is how London tackled air pollution. Delhi can learn</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/opinion/this-is-how-london-tackled-air-pollution-delhi-can-learn/1841039/</link>
			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the issue of air pollution in London and Delhi, highlighting the steps taken by London to improve air quality and suggesting similar actions should be taken in India. In 1952, London experienced a severe fog that led to thousands of deaths and prompted the implementation of the Clean Air Act. Over time, coal was replaced with gas, power plants were cleaned up, and emission standards were introduced. London has also implemented low emission zones and restrictions on polluting vehicles. Despite not meeting WHO guidelines, London's air quality is better than Delhi's. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action in India, where an estimated 1.6 million people die from air pollution each year. Road dust and vehicular pollution are major contributors, and collective action is required to address the issue. Improving public transport and reducing vehicle emissions are key solutions. Short-term emergency measures are not enough; sustained action is necessary to clean up the air.</description>

			<description>The possession of Rampur Public School, a property owned by Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan's trust, along with an office of the SP leader and another building used for party activities, was handed over to the Secondary Education Department according to a state cabinet decision. Locks were placed on both buildings in the presence of heavy police force, sealing them. The decision to take back ownership of the land leased to the Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Trust, which operates the school, was made due to alleged violations of the lease deed. The old Murtaza School building, previously used as the office of the District Inspector of Schools (DIOS), was also allocated to the trust. The administration has taken possession of both buildings and transferred them to the DIOS. However, SP members protested, claiming that the office was separate from the school's land. The government canceled the 30-year lease and the education department assumed control of the property. Azam Khan and his family are currently in jail after being convicted in a fake birth certificate case.</description>

			<title>Clinical trial in pregnant women aims to detect foetal cardiac defects</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/health/clinical-trial-in-pregnant-women-aims-to-detect-foetal-cardiac-defects/1841011/</link>
			<description>A recent study published in the journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology has found a link between high levels of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in pregnant women and foetal atrioventricular block (AVB). Foetal AVB occurs when inflammation and scarring prevent electric signals from reaching the heart's ventricles, leading to lifelong pacing and potential fatality. The incidence of AVB increased with higher levels of these antibodies, particularly in women who had a previous child with AVB. The study also showed that home-based foetal heart rate monitoring can accurately diagnose conduction problems, reducing the need for repeated echocardiograms. The researchers emphasize the importance of monitoring antibody levels in pregnant women to determine the risk and need for surveillance.</description>

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Researchers have found that obinutuzumab, an antibody that targets immune cells, is effective in preserving kidney function and preventing flares in patients with lupus nephritis. The study, published in Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology, showed that adding obinutuzumab to lupus nephritis treatment reduced the risk of mortality, decline in kidney function, or treatment failure by 60% compared to standard care. It also lowered the incidence of lupus nephritis relapses by 57% and improved kidney function. Additionally, a higher percentage of obinutuzumab-treated patients achieved complete remission of lupus nephritis without the need for as many glucocorticoids. The findings suggest that obinutuzumab may help preserve kidney survival and improve outcomes for patients with lupus nephritis.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court heard several important cases on Friday, November 10. Here are the key highlights: 

1. The court emphasized that the decision on implementing the odd-even car rationing scheme in Delhi should be made by the city government, not the court.

2. The court warned that burning crop residue in Punjab and neighboring states must stop, and a "carrot and stick" policy is needed to address this issue. Failure to take action will have negative consequences for everyone, especially children.

5. The court reprimanded the Uttar Pradesh government for not complying with its order to provide counseling to a Muslim boy and his classmates who were instructed by their teacher to slap him for not completing his homework.

6. The court granted protection from arrest to two journalists who challenged summons issued by Gujarat Police related to an article they allegedly wrote about Adani Group.

7. The court refused to stay proceedings before the Allahabad High Court regarding suits related to the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah dispute, stating that it would not be fair to interfere without hearing both sides.

8. The Nagaland government informed the court that a bill reserving 33% of seats in urban local bodies for women has been passed by the state assembly, and elections will be completed by April 30 next year.

9. The court declined to entertain a plea seeking guidelines from the central government for protecting Hinduism in India.

			<description>Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has criticized the governors of Punjab and Tamil Nadu for delaying approval of bills passed by their respective state legislatures. The court warned Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit against "playing with fire" and expressed concern over his Chennai counterpart, who was accused of withholding assent to 12 bills. The court emphasized that as the titular head of the state, the governor cannot question the validity of an assembly session or indefinitely delay decisions on bills. It cited Article 200 of the Constitution, which outlines the governor's options when presented with a bill. The court also questioned the Punjab government for repeatedly adjourning the budget session instead of proroguing it. In a similar case, the court deemed the delay by Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi in granting assent to bills a "matter of serious concern" and sought a response from the central government.</description>

			<title>South Korea: President Yoon’s war against “fake news” raises concerns over free speech</title>
			<link>https://theprint.in/world/south-korea-president-yoons-war-against-fake-news-raises-concerns-over-free-speech/1840994/</link>
			<description>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.</description>
