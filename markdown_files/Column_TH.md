### [IPL | When players go beyond cliches and illuminate the format](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-players-go-beyond-cliches-and-illuminate-the-format/article68071847.ece)

The article reflects on the rarity of memorable quotes in IPL amidst the usual clichés. It highlights Suryakumar Yadav's candid admission about avoiding batting against Jasprit Bumrah in nets due to Bumrah's intimidating bowling. Bumrah, known for his versatility and lack of ego in the game, is contrasted with the two types of ego in sports: the positive, which drives self-improvement, and the negative, which hinders growth. The piece also touches on the old-school cricket mentality that dismisses data analysis, as voiced by legends like Bishan Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna. However, it acknowledges the overwhelming nature of data, citing Sunil Narine's approach of simplicity and focus on his role. The article concludes with insights from top players, suggesting a blend of tradition and modernity in cricket's evolution.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja was asked by the International Cricket Council (ICC) not to wear shoes with slogans such as "All lives are equal" and "Freedom is a human right" during a Test match against Pakistan. The ICC considered it a political statement and reminded Khawaja that personal messages are not allowed on equipment. Khawaja intends to discuss this with the ICC and may wear the slogans on his shoes in future matches. The larger question raised is the responsibility of sportsmen towards the world around them and their ability to use their platform to speak up for humanitarian causes. Some teams have previously worn logos or taken actions related to social issues, and the ICC allowed these expressions as they were seen to be in the larger good. However, international sportsmen often face criticism when they break the bubble of sports and engage with real-world issues. Khawaja's actions have sparked a conversation on this topic.

### [Political Line | Big Picture: Five vantage points of opposition to Narendra Modi](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/big-picture-five-vantage-points-of-opposition-to-narendra-modi-political-line/article66687763.ece)

The article discusses the various strands of opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India. It highlights five different vantage points from which opposition groups approach their stance against the BJP.

Firstly, regional elites, such as the DMK in Tamil Nadu and the TMC in West Bengal, can align with either the BJP or the Congress depending on the situation. They negotiate with both parties but currently view the BJP as a bigger threat to their interests.

Secondly, Arvind Kejriwal of the AAP represents an apolitical opposition to the BJP. Although he doesn't oppose the Hindutva agenda, he openly declares war on Prime Minister Modi. Kejriwal focuses on governance as a service delivery platform and can adapt to different ideological settings.

The third vantage point is dominated by middle castes in the Hindutva heartland, such as the Yadavs and Jats. Parties like the SP, RJD, and RLD represent this group, which views both the Congress and BJP with suspicion. They oppose the upper caste prominence within the Hindutva ideology.

Constitutional liberals constitute the fourth vantage point. They focus on principles of constitutional liberalism, individual rights, and the integrity of institutions. While they are opposed to the BJP, they also have reservations about the other opposition vantage points. The Congress and the Left are principal rivals in some states.

Lastly, religious minorities, including Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians, form the fifth vantage point. They may support their own parties or join hands with other opposition groups. Overall, the BJP is seen as a bigger enemy than the Congress, but there are still many contradictions and differences within the opposition.

The interplay between these vantage points will determine the strength and scope of the opposition to the BJP in the upcoming 2024 elections.

Critics argue that the bill gives the government too much power to collect data and infringe on individual privacy. The draft emphasizes state authority over data, including trade-related issues. Retired Justice B. N. Srikrishna believes the proposed regulator will lack independence and act as a puppet of the government. However, junior minister for IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, disagrees and states that the Data Protection Board will be independent. Despite concerns about state control, some see it as preferable to unregulated private entities having unrestricted access to data. The article also briefly touches on caste dynamics in Bihar, border tensions between India and China, and the elevation of Tamil music by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

### [Political Line | Hardik, Alpesh, Dimple, Kedar: caste tales from Gujarat, U.P., Bihar](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/political-line-hardik-alpesh-dimple-kedar-caste-tales-from-gujarat-up-bihar/article66248561.ece)

This article discusses the transformation of the Bharata Janata Party (BJP) under Narendra Modi's leadership and its ability to incorporate different caste identities. The BJP, under Mr. Modi, has managed to restrain dominant castes such as Patels in Gujarat, Marathas in Maharashtra, and Jats in U.P. and Haryana, by aggregating several minor caste groups. Previously, the Patel community controlled the BJP in Gujarat, but Mr. Modi successfully faced challenges from them. Ahead of the 2017 elections, Hardik Patel, a Patel leader, demanded OBC (Other Backward Classes) status for the community and later joined the Congress party. However, in 2022, he switched to the BJP and won as a candidate. Similarly, Alpesh Thakore, an OBC leader who opposed Patel's demand for reservations, also joined and won as a BJP candidate.

The article highlights the conflicting positions on caste quotas held by both Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakore, who are now BJP MLAs. The BJP managed to bring them together by utilizing state power, and both individuals faced police cases, realizing that opposing the BJP was risky. While some communities within the BJP may not be entirely satisfied with the space and power they hold, the BJP has contained their discontent for now. This situation is comparable to the Jats in Uttar Pradesh, who initially opposed the BJP but ended up voting for the party in large numbers.

The article also touches upon the political dynamics in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Janata Dal (United) (JDU) claim to champion the cause of OBCs but faced defeat in recent by-elections. The BJP's victory in these bypolls indicates that the alliance between the RJD and JDU is not effectively working on the ground.

In addition to the political analysis, the article briefly mentions the struggle of reviving the Meetei Mayek script in Manipur. The script was replaced by the Bengali script in the 18th century, but language activism is now pushing for its revival.

Overall, the article highlights the BJP's ability to navigate caste dynamics and bring together conflicting interest groups, as well as shedding light on political developments in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.

The article also mentions that forest plantations are not as suitable for hornbill populations as natural-growth rainforests. Overall, the article highlights the ecological significance of hornbills and the need for their conservation.

Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA) are developing batteries made of Americium, a nuclear waste material, to power space missions. The technology is expected to be developed by the end of the decade and will be used for missions in areas where solar power is limited, such as the dark side of the Moon or far-off regions of the Solar System. The batteries will be encapsulated in layers to ensure safety, and Americium will be extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel to make fuel pellets for the batteries. Americium is cheaper, more abundant, and has a longer half-life compared to the currently used plutonium-238 batteries. The ESA has approved a funding of $30 million for the battery system, and plans to launch Americium-based power sources in moon missions in the early 2030s. The technology is also of interest to NASA for its Artemis program.

Elon Musk's recent quarrel with Apple is causing trouble for his platform, Twitter. Musk has been making changes on Twitter since purchasing the platform, including laying off half the staff, which led to voluntary resignations and advertisers leaving. In an attempt to keep the platform active, Musk reinstated former President Donald Trump's account and launched a paid blue verification tick mark. However, the launch did not go smoothly, and the service had to be relaunched. It is speculated that Apple's 30% app tax played a role in delaying the relaunch, as Musk would have to pay a third of his earnings from selling blue tick marks to Apple. Musk publicly criticized Apple's app store in-app purchase policy, calling it a "hidden 30% tax on the internet." He also claimed that Apple has stopped advertising on Twitter and threatened to withhold the platform from its app store, though Apple has not publicly responded.

China is experiencing anti-lockdown protests as citizens oppose the country's zero-covid policy.

Twitter staff are trying to fight back against this stream of spam, particularly targeting city names such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and Lanzhou. The protests have been fueled by issues such as confusion surrounding hiring, mass quarantines, worker bonuses, and lockdowns as part of China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19. Some protestors have been sharing videos online to raise awareness about their situation. It is noted that Twitter's staff has significantly decreased in number following mass layoffs and resignations after Elon Musk took over the platform.

In Assam, the BJP has gained significant support, while in Tamil Nadu, the party aims to expand its presence. The Prime Minister addressed a group of Tamils in Varanasi, emphasizing the connection between Kashi and Tamil Nadu and celebrating Tamil culture. This move seeks to address criticism that the BJP undermines Tamil Nadu's cultural identity. Additionally, Mr. Modi participated in an event organized by Himanta Biswa Sarma to commemorate a 16th-century Ahom army general in Assam. By retelling the story of Assamese pride, the Prime Minister reinforces the idea of Assamese exceptionalism and resistance to outside influences. The article also briefly mentions ongoing border disputes between Assam and Meghalaya, as well as Karnataka and Maharashtra. Finally, the author reflects on the changing dynamics of politics in Gujarat, where Gujarati sub-nationalism blended with Hindutva has been weakened by the rise of Modi and Amit Shah in national politics.

Users complained about buffering issues and missed goals during live streaming. The article explains that streaming involves a series of steps including compression, encoding, segmentation, and distribution through a content distribution network (CDN).

### [Meta Quest Pro VR users need almost five hours to read its privacy policy: report](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-virtual-reality-users-need-almost-five-hours-read-privacy-policy-mozilla-report/article66144169.ece)

Mozilla researchers have discovered that it would take hours to read through the privacy policy for Meta's new Quest Pro VR headset. In Mozilla's 'Privacy Not Included' guide, it was noted that big tech companies like Meta, Verizon, and Amazon release lengthy privacy policies for their devices, some of which run for tens of thousands of words. The researchers estimated that it would take around four hours and fifty minutes to read all the privacy documents associated with the Meta Quest Pro. Mozilla suggested that the overwhelming volume of documents could be used to pressure users into quickly agreeing to the terms, potentially allowing their data to be collected and sold to external parties.
