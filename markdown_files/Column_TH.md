### [Judges and the people](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-judges-and-the-people/article68539776.ece)

The article examines the increasing politicization of judiciaries globally.  In Bangladesh, recent protests led to the resignation of the Chief Justice and other judges, highlighting the judiciary's vulnerability to political pressure. This trend is not unique to Bangladesh, as seen in the U.S. where judicial appointments often align with political affiliations, influencing rulings on politically charged issues like abortion rights.

The author explores the tension between judicial autonomy and public opinion, questioning whether a purely apolitical judiciary is truly feasible.  The article also touches upon debates in India regarding the Supreme Court's power to amend the Constitution and the perceived lack of transparency in judicial appointments. 

Finally, it uses examples from India and Bangladesh to illustrate how the concept of "traitor"  is often weaponized in political conflicts, further blurring the lines between law and politics.

### [Column | Feet of fortune](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece)

The practice of placing crowns with the deity's footprints on devotees' heads in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes a deeper connection to Hindu bhakti traditions.  Originally, bhakti didn't signify submission but participation in the divine's life. Temples, unlike places of meditation, were vibrant centers celebrating life,  where deities were treated as residents and involved in daily rituals and festivals. This devotion was supported by village grants known as deva bhoga. 

However, this movement coexisted with societal stratification based on purity, leading to instances of exclusion and segregation.  Depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi highlight the importance of contentment over the pursuit of fortune. The Vishnu narrative suggests that a humble mindset and acceptance of all, symbolized by the veneration of the feet, leads to true fortune.

The recent turmoil in Bangladesh, with the U.S. seemingly supportive of a potential Islamist government, tests India-U.S. strategic alignment.  

 India and the U.S. have historically shared goals in countering China's influence, but the U.S. stance on Bangladesh raises concerns for India, as it tolerates actors against India's interests in the region. Both nations face challenges regarding trade restrictions on China, with evidence suggesting they may harm domestic innovation.  Internal dynamics in India, such as debates over caste-based quotas and immigration from Bangladesh, also highlight complexities in navigating both domestic and international issues.

### [Unequal, and the more unequal](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece)

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision recognizes the unequal treatment faced by different SC groups,  despite existing quotas and schemes. 

The court cited the need for "substantive equality" and  drew parallels to the  'more backward' categories allowed for backward classes. Proponents argue that sub-categorization prioritizes those who need it most, while opponents fear it could further fragment already marginalized communities. The implementation of sub-categories will likely lead to new political dynamics and challenges.

It highlights the ancient city of Ayutthaya, once the capital of Thai kings and now a ruin, where the epic is depicted in temples and royal performances.

### [From the desirable to the derogatory](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/from-the-desirable-to-the-derogatory/article68319809.ece)

The word "woke," initially positive, has rapidly become derogatory.  Once associated with inclusivity and awareness of social injustices, it is now used by some as a pejorative to criticize political correctness and an emphasis on marginalized voices. This shift reflects the politicization of language, where terms can be easily manipulated and redefined based on political agendas.  

The author argues that this trend hinders clear communication and stifles creative expression. For example, the increasing sensitivity around cultural appropriation can lead to a reluctance to engage with different cultures, limiting artistic and personal growth.  Ultimately, the article warns against the dangers of  taking language too literally and encourages a more nuanced understanding of evolving terms.

The rupee's journey as a global currency began with Sher Shah Suri, who standardized coinage denominations and established mints across his kingdom. Akbar further solidified the rupee's position by expanding its circulation and ensuring consistent weight and purity.

The East India Companies adopted the rupee for trade with India, exporting it to territories under their control and influencing the design of local currencies. European powers later mimicked this, with British East Africa and other colonies issuing their own rupees. 

  The rupee even became legal tender in Arab sheikhdoms under British treaties. While the Arab kingdoms eventually adopted their own currencies, India's modern UPI system reflects a renewed international embrace of Indian monetary innovation.

### [Improving the language of biodiversity conservation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/improving-the-language-of-biodiversity-conservation/article68245700.ece)

This article explores the challenge of communicating the importance of biodiversity to the public. While climate change has gained mainstream attention, biodiversity remains an abstract concept.

The Congress employs regional identity politics in Karnataka and Telangana, and Rahul Gandhi's campaign in Kerala and Tamil Nadu emphasized regional pride.  

The BJP's strategy is more complex, aiming to woo Tamil Nadu voters while simultaneously attacking Odisha's ruling party for appointing a non-Odia, Tamil Nadu-born official. The article notes the BJP's shift in tactic in West Bengal, being more sensitive to Bengali pride after facing resistance in the 2021 assembly elections.  

The author concludes by pointing out the dangers of regionalism when it targets and demonizes other regions and people.

It highlights the  difference in perspective between adults and children, where past mistakes are seen as more impactful than current triumphs.

Contemporary writers increasingly focus on backstories for popular characters, from superheroes to literary detectives like Perry Mason. While some readers and viewers appreciate these extra layers, critics argue they can be unnecessary, unimaginative, and even disrespectful to the original authors' intentions.

The BJP's 2024 election campaign is focusing on communalism, casteism, and a claim to constitutionalism.  Prime Minister Modi is targeting OBCs, tribal communities, and Dalits with messages emphasizing Hindu subaltern unity against Muslims.

The Indian political landscape is marked by accusations of division from both the BJP and Congress. The BJP criticizes the Congress's demand for a caste census and its stance on State autonomy, claiming these encourage division.  Conversely, the Congress accuses the BJP of dividing the nation by allegedly discriminating against religious minorities and subaltern castes, and centralizing power. 

The BJP aims to unify Hindus, viewing it as synonymous with national unity, while including subaltern groups in political and cultural spheres. However, it excludes religious minorities, particularly Muslims. The Congress struggles to advocate for caste justice without alienating Hindu identities.  The BJP faces the challenge of managing the discontent of upper castes who perceive the party's focus on subaltern groups as detrimental to their interests.

It argues that heckling, when done playfully, is a unique aspect of cricket fandom that adds to the game's entertainment. The article acknowledges that lines can be crossed with abusive language but suggests that non-toxic heckling, like the famous witticism of "Yabba" from Australia, enriches the spectator experience.

The discussion over whether to include both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in India's World T20 squad highlights the complexities of experience in the rapidly evolving T20 format. 

While experience is valuable in other formats like Test cricket, where memory and pattern recognition are crucial, T20 demands adaptability and a "forgetfulness" of past deliveries.  Young players, unburdened by past knowledge, often thrive in this environment. Meanwhile,  established batters like Kohli and Sharma, despite their understanding of the game, might struggle to adapt to the constant changes in T20. 

The selectors will carefully analyze their performances in the IPL before making a final decision.

Kuldeep Yadav, India's left-arm wrist spinner, has emerged as a dominant force in the recent Test series against England, taking 19 wickets. After a period of inconsistency and limited opportunities,  Kuldeep has worked on his craft, improving his run-up, pace, and batting.  His resurgence has been key to India's success, showcasing the potential of wrist spin in modern cricket. 

Captain Rohit Sharma's understanding of Kuldeep's strengths and vulnerabilities has been instrumental in his success. Kuldeep's ability to bowl the unpredictable "chinaman" delivery, which defies conventional expectations, makes him a valuable asset to the Indian bowling attack.  His recent performances highlight his evolution as a bowler and his importance to India's future Test plans.

This week sees several cricketers reach the milestone of playing their 100th Test match: R. Ashwin and Jonny Bairstow for India and England respectively, and Kane Williamson and Tim Southee for New Zealand.

Having played 100 Tests is a significant achievement, as the format is especially demanding.  Ashwin, India's most successful off-spinner, faces scrutiny regarding his place in an all-time India team.  His success is undeniable, but questions arise about comparing him to players from earlier eras due to advancements in cricket knowledge and techniques.  Ashwin's unique approach, combining natural talent and constant experimentation, sets him apart. 

While figures are important, they don't fully capture his impact.  His "Ashwinness" –  a relentless pursuit of wickets –  is a testament to his skill and strategy. Ashwin's constant drive to improve and challenge himself makes him a modern master of the craft, deserving recognition as a cornerstone of Indian cricket history.

The ongoing India-England Test series promises to be a thrilling clash, with both teams adapting to each other's styles.  England's Bazball approach faces a test against India's more cautious strategies.  Rohit Sharma showcased a Bazball-esque attack, while India's young batsmen, led by Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubhman Gill, played freely. Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional bowling, threatening every delivery, has earned him comparisons to India's greatest fast bowlers. 

The series mirrored the 1970s India-West Indies series, characterized by its intensity and close contests.  A five-Test series allows for greater exploration of the format's possibilities, showcasing its dramatic potential. Bazball has breathed new life into Test cricket, leading to compelling matches that defy notions of Test cricket's potential decline. Ben Stokes' captaincy, compared favorably to legends like Mike Brearley and Ray Illingworth, will be a key factor in the series outcome.

South Africa's decision to prioritize their domestic T20 tournament over a Test series against New Zealand highlights a concerning trend in cricket: the diminishing value of Test cricket. 

Only two players from the team that previously defeated India remain in the squad for the New Zealand series, indicating a serious shift in priorities.  This action has drawn criticism, particularly from former Australian captain Steve Waugh, who points to a lack of care from administrators for the longest format of the game. 

The article argues that the allure of lucrative T20 franchise leagues is driving this trend, with players and administrators seemingly more focused on financial gain than upholding the traditions of Test cricket. Unless a balance between franchise cricket and Test matches is achieved, Test cricket risks becoming a relic of the past.  The author suggests that greater financial incentives for Test cricket, and more sensible distribution of player schedules, are needed to ensure its survival.

Though India now ranks as the No.1 Test team and possesses a formidable bowling attack, they face a  difficult task in breaking the cycle of defeats.  Factors such as inconsistent performances, struggles against left-arm pace bowling, and poor team balance have hampered their progress.

While some see it as a symbol of national unity, others view it as a move towards religious homogeneity and an attempt to impose a single interpretation of Indian nationalism.  This finality represented by the temple construction is a paradoxically a challenge to the idea of a constantly evolving and inclusive nation. This culminates in new religious conflicts,  such as the dispute over the Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, and highlights the ongoing tension between religious identity and the idea of a secular India.

The Cricket World Cup, despite pre-tournament hype surrounding India as favorites, culminated in an Australian victory, reminding us of sport's unpredictable nature. India, dominant in world cricket,  failed to control the result, leading to disappointment and silence from the home crowd.

Though the tournament showcased India's best cricketing talent, the absence of former captain Kapil Dev,  and the hubris displayed by fans and officials  raised questions.

The rise of populism has significantly impacted diplomacy, pushing it into the realm of everyday citizen discussions. What used to be confined to elite circles is now debated in local assemblies, online forums, and public discourse. 

This shift is particularly evident in India, where populist sentiment aligns with a more assertive foreign policy stance.  In contrast, Western populism tends to be more skeptical of military intervention and global entanglements. 

Despite these differing approaches, strategists in both India and the West face the challenge of managing public opinion on foreign policy issues. Pro-war rhetoric and strong nationalistic sentiments, often fueled by social media, make it difficult to navigate complex international conflicts.

The World Cup often serves as a farewell stage for veteran cricketers. Historically, players have used the tournament to mark the end of their international careers, moving into commentary, coaching, or other pursuits.  

Departures are often planned, allowing for fitting send-offs like Sachin Tendulkar's grand finale. Other times, retirements are more abrupt, influenced by performance or team changes. Players like Quentin de Kock and Naveen-ul Haq have announced their intentions to retire after the current World Cup.  

Whether planned or unexpected, a World Cup can be a poignant platform for cricketing legends to say goodbye.

### [Political Line | Brownwashing conservative politics in the U.S. and the U.K.](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-big-picture-brownwashing-conservative-politics-in-the-us-and-the-uk/article67364991.ece)

Vivek Ramaswamy and Suella Braverman, both of Indian origin, represent a rising trend of conservative leaders emphasizing western identity.  Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate in the US, criticizes the culture wars driven by the left, advocates for faith-based action, and seeks to restrict immigration. Similarly, Braverman, the UK Home Secretary, argues that uncontrolled migration threatens western civilization and calls for integration. 

Scholars suggest this alignment of brown populations with conservative causes stems from shared values and a natural distrust of left-leaning social agendas. This political shift could potentially influence the future of western identity, as conservative groups seek to broaden their appeal beyond traditional white voters.

The 1987 World Cup in India began with a dramatic one-run victory for Australia against India in Chennai. Despite facing accusations of being a weaker team, Australia, led by Steve Waugh, capitalised on India's late collapse to set the tone for their dominant tournament run.  

The match was notable for an umpire's error and Jones' innings six being initially misidentified as four before being corrected. India, with a formidable batting lineup, seemed poised for victory at 202 for two but were undone by Craig McDermott's bowling.  
The tournament offered thrilling encounters and unpredictable twists, ultimately seeing Australia triumph and cementing their place as a cricketing powerhouse.

### [Political Line | Global nationalists, national globalists](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/big-picture-global-nationalists-national-globalists/article67341289.ece)

The recent clash between India and Canada over the killing of a suspected terrorist has highlighted the global reach of nationalism.  

Interestingly, nationalisms across the world, such as Indian, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Chinese, are increasingly mobilizing across national boundaries. This contradicts the earlier belief in a shrinking world where national sovereignty was fading.  

While countries assert national sovereignty and ring-fence their interests, they also seek to influence global affairs and promote universal goals. This creates a  complex interplay of  nationalism and globalism, often seen as opportunistic and hypocritical. The tension is further evident in the debate surrounding immigration policies like the H-1B visa program in the U.S.


The case of India and Canada demonstrates the ongoing struggle to balance national interests with global realities. In India, internal divisions are being exposed as political parties navigate the issue. Courts are also grappling with constitutional questions related to citizenship and reservation for SCs/STs, highlighting the complexities of national identity within a diverse nation.

The story follows Phuphee, a wise woman, who helps Bashir, a local farmer, when his cows mysteriously escape and stop producing milk. Bashir blames a curse and seeks Phuphee's guidance.  

Phuphee, while acknowledging the situation, advises Bashir to recite verses from the Quran and tie a rope around his cows and wrist. She then whispers something in Bashir's ear, causing him distress. 

After this encounter, the narrator learns from Phuphee that the "curse" was orchestrated by Bashir's wife, who requested help in keeping her unfaithful husband at home. Phuphee explained that she helped the wife by subtly suggesting she release the cows, prompting Bashir to believe a curse was involved.   

The story highlights the importance of empowering individuals to make their own decisions and the wisdom in sometimes offering help through subtle guidance rather than direct intervention.

The article discusses the growing dominance of franchise T20 cricket over traditional Test cricket.  South Africa's decision to prioritize their domestic T20 tournament, the SA20,  over a second-string team for a Test series against New Zealand exemplifies this shift.  

The author argues that the International Cricket Council (ICC) is increasingly beholden to financially powerful teams and broadcasters, prioritizing lucrative T20 leagues over the health of Test cricket. While acknowledging the financial benefits of franchise cricket, the author questions its long-term sustainability, suggesting the potential for audience fatigue and decline in the overall appeal of the sport.

### [Political Line | Reversing democracy for stability](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-reversing-democracy-for-stability/article67266927.ece)

The BJP's proposal for 'one nation, one election' aims to hold parliamentary, state assembly, and local elections simultaneously every five years.  The argument is that this would reduce costs, minimize disruption to development, and prevent instability caused by hung assemblies.

However, critics argue that this move undermines democratic principles. They point out that diverse political landscapes often lead to fractured verdicts, reflecting the nation's complexity. Synchonised elections could restrict voter freedom and prioritize efficiency over the messy, dynamic nature of democracy. Concerns are also raised about the potential for abuse, as the proposal could further empower the incumbent government.

The author's gratitude towards Phuphee highlights the profound impact a supportive and understanding adult can have on a child's development.

A deepening political polarization in India is shaping alliances ahead of the 2024 elections. The ruling NDA, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,  grouped 38 parties, while the emerging INDIA alliance aims to challenge Modi's third term bid with 26 members.  

Both coalitions are vying for the subaltern vote, particularly among OBCs and Dalits. The BJP has made inroads with these groups, leaving a void for other parties to fill.  The Congress, despite its dwindling influence, has an opportunity to connect with these voters by embracing more inclusive representation and rhetoric.

Political dynamics are shifting across the country. Alliances are being renegotiated, creating uncertainty. Regional parties like the BRS, TDP, and YSRCP are playing a complex role, maintaining distance from both major alliances, potentially influencing the outcome of the 2024 elections.

A U.S. judge has cleared Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, rejecting the Federal Trade Commission's argument that the deal would harm competition. The ruling came days before a $3 billion fee would have been triggered if the deal failed. 

To address concerns, Microsoft promised to make Activision Blizzard's popular Call of Duty game available on other platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Nvidia's cloud gaming service, for at least a decade. The decision, however, faced criticism due to a perceived conflict of interest involving the judge's son's employment at Microsoft.

The inauguration of the new Parliament building was marked by controversy, with opposition parties boycotting the event. The installation of a sengol, a religious symbol gifted to Jawaharlal Nehru, sparked debate about the government's intent to revise India's founding principles. 

The BJP's narrative of the sengol signifying the transfer of power from British to Congress lacks historical basis, yet reinforces a new official narrative around nation-building.  This narrative may solidify over time, potentially suppressing dissenting voices.  The choice of a specifically Saivite sect from Tamil Nadu to associate with the sengol has also been interpreted as an attempt to undermine Dravidian politics in the state.

Sudha Murty, wife of Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, recently sparked a social media frenzy for comments about her  "simple" lifestyle. 

During an appearance on The Kapil Sharma Show, Murty recounted old anecdotes about being mistaken for an economy class passenger and playfully claiming 10 Downing Street as her address during immigration. These stories, meant to portray her humility, were met with cynicism and humor online. 

The article argues this backlash stems from a generational shift. Earlier generations valued simplicity, but today’s generation, raised on tales of entrepreneurial success, doesn't see simplicity as aspirational.  Furthermore, the era of carefully curated public personas has bred suspicion, making it harder for Murty's message to resonate.

Root, known for his elegant style in Test cricket, appears less comfortable in T20 and the author suggests that while he might be aiming for the T20 World Cup, his natural game may not be fully suited for the format.

This article discusses the imbalance in wealth distribution within international cricket.  Historically, England and Australia dominated the sport due to their colonial power, but now India's financial clout has created a new hierarchy.  

The ICC's proposed revenue-sharing model favors the Big Three (India, England, and Australia),  giving them a disproportionate share of the surplus.

The internet's excessive focus on opinion-based engagement has led to a culture of quick judgments and polarized debates. Recent events, such as the Dalai Lama controversy and the J.K. Rowling transgender debate, highlight the complexity of issues and the dangers of forming strong opinions without thorough understanding.   

The author, through examples from Jon Ronson's book "So You've Been Publicly Shamed," argues that social media outrage often lacks nuance and traps individuals in destructive cycles of blame and defensiveness.  The author encourages stepping back from the urge to express an opinion on every topic and instead embracing humility and a willingness to learn.
