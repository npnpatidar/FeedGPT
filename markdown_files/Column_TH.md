### [Improving the language of biodiversity conservation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/improving-the-language-of-biodiversity-conservation/article68245700.ece)

The article discusses the challenges of communicating and understanding biodiversity in the context of climate change and human well-being. It highlights that while climate change has gained public attention due to its immediate dangers, biodiversity remains a less popular concept. The article suggests that the scientific and utilitarian language used to describe biodiversity fails to convey its true value to human well-being and calls for a language that resonates with the public.

It explains biodiversity as the variety among living organisms and ecosystems but notes its abstract nature makes it difficult for people to grasp. The article argues for using local languages and examples to make the concept more relatable. It also points out that mainstreaming biodiversity in policies and business practices is challenging due to the focus on financial targets.

The author mentions the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-Being in India, which aims to link biodiversity with economic and health prosperity. However, the article criticizes the narrow focus on income and calls for a broader understanding of well-being that includes capabilities and opportunities for individuals to pursue valuable life pursuits.

In conclusion, the article advocates for a shift in how we communicate and value biodiversity, emphasizing the need to consider human variability and functioning to truly understand its link to well-being. The author is identified as the Lead of the Ecosystems and Human Well-being Programme at ATREE, Bengaluru, and the views expressed are personal.

### [When Belgian policemen become Catholic priests](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/when-belgian-policemen-become-catholic-priests/article68165968.ece)

The article discusses the trend of creating backstories for well-known characters in contemporary literature and media. It notes that this practice has become embedded in our culture, with characters ranging from superheroes like Batman to literary figures like Hercule Poirot receiving elaborate histories. The author suggests that often these backstories are unnecessary and lack imagination, citing a recent TV adaptation of Perry Mason as an example of a poorly conceived backstory.

The piece also touches on the tradition of new authors taking on old favorites and crafting new adventures that respect the original backstories. However, it criticizes the tendency of some adaptations, particularly on television, to alter characters' backstories or the plots of their stories significantly. This includes changes made to Agatha Christie's characters and stories, which have sparked opposition among fans and researchers. The author argues that such changes may be driven by a desire for political correctness or inclusivity, but they often detract from the original works.

The BJP is facing challenges in the 2024 general election campaign, with allegations against one of its allies, Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, for rape. The party is pivoting its campaign around communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism, targeting specific demographics like OBCs, tribals, and Dalits.

Revanth Reddy criticizes what he terms "Gujarat hegemony," while the BJP accuses the Biju Janata Dal of disrespecting Odisha's sentiments.

As the women arrive, they engage in a communal ritual of sharing kehwa (a traditional tea) and tehar while opening up about their personal longings and sorrows.

The opening of India's new Parliament building sparked controversy as opposition parties boycotted the inauguration due to the installation of a sengol, a golden sceptre with religious significance.

The BJP's appropriation of a Saivite sect from Tamil Nadu aims to undermine Dravidian politics. Assam's Chief Minister discusses shifting towards multilingualism, while there's debate over the impact of north Indian migrants in Tamil Nadu. Criticism arises over a mural in the Parliament depicting undivided India, and there are calls for southern states to challenge the delimitation of Lok Sabha seats. Sedition laws, a colonial legacy, are debated for retention with proposed amendments for clarity.

### [Mirror, mirror, is that me?](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mirror-mirror-is-that-me/article66658610.ece)

The article discusses the concept of self-recognition, typically tested through the mirror test, which evaluates an individual's ability to recognize themselves in a mirror. This ability is not exclusive to humans; various animals, including monkeys, dolphins, and birds, have shown signs of self-recognition. Recent research from a Japanese laboratory focuses on the bluestreak cleaner wrasse fish, known for its mutualistic relationship with larger fish in tropical oceans. The study found that these fish display signs of self-recognition, passing the mirror test by showing aggression only towards images of strangers and recognizing marks painted on their bodies. The article ponders whether this ability in animals parallels human self-awareness, which typically develops around 18 months of age. It suggests that the ability to recognize oneself in a mirror may be a precursor to broader self-awareness, evidenced by children's ability to talk about themselves and recall events from memory around the same age.

It laments the current state of Test cricket, where only a few nations dominate, and expresses a sense of loss for the West Indies' rich cricketing heritage. The sentiment is encapsulated by a quote from Clive Lloyd, who once said he had no more tears for the state of West Indies cricket, reflecting the feelings of many fans who revered the once-great team.

Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, has announced plans to make the platform's algorithm open source, allowing the developer community to see how content and ads are prioritized. Despite promising improvements, the algorithm has not yet been made public, and no updates have been provided. Musk's acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion led to a brief loss of his title as the world's richest person, but he has since reclaimed it. The article questions the business sense behind making Twitter's algorithm open source, considering Musk's description of the purchase as acquiring a "non-profit."

The article also delves into the history of free and open source software (FOSS), highlighting Linux as a key example of a non-proprietary operating system that gained popularity through community development. It discusses the success of Red Hat Inc., which capitalized on the open-source model by offering enterprise-level support and services, and contrasts this with the proprietary models of Microsoft and Apple.

The piece suggests that Musk could potentially use Red Hat's approach to develop a new business model for Twitter, transforming it from an ad-driven platform to something new through community involvement. However, it acknowledges the challenges and changes that would come with such a shift, including the need for Musk to continue making interest payments on the loans for the Twitter acquisition. The article concludes by reflecting on the potential for a new paradigm to emerge from Musk's experiment with open sourcing Twitter's algorithm.

### [The evil effects of deforestation](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/the-evil-effects-of-deforestation/article66603977.ece)

The article discusses the significant issue of deforestation and its impact on the environment and human health. It highlights that **since 1990, 420 million hectares of forest have been lost** to various land uses, which is particularly concerning for tropical regions like India, China, and Africa. The **FAO reports that forests cover 31% of the Earth's land**, but deforestation contributes to **11% of global greenhouse gas emissions** and can lead to an increase in diseases like malaria and dengue.

Dr. S.B. Kadrekar emphasizes the importance of preserving not only trees but also soil and water, as deforestation can lead to a decrease in the availability of clean drinking water. The article also points out that **India's forest cover is about 8 lakh sq km**, which is **22% of its geographic area**, with significant portions in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Himalayan states. However, development activities, such as the expansion of highways, are leading to the loss of large numbers of trees, including ancient banyan trees in Telangana.

The article discusses the controversy surrounding pitch conditions in Indian cricket, particularly after India's loss to Australia in the third Test match in Indore. It highlights the debate on whether desperation to win is leading to the preparation of pitches that excessively favor spin bowling, which is seen as a home advantage. The article reflects on past instances where curators were pressured to create turning pitches and how this strategy has backfired, such as when England's spinners outperformed India's on a turner at Eden Gardens.

The author argues that this approach is regressive and insults the progress India has made in producing quality fast bowlers. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had previously instructed to leave grass on domestic pitches to encourage fast bowling, leading to a successful generation of fast bowlers who have performed well internationally. The article suggests that matches dominated by spin undermine these efforts and discourage young fast bowlers.

In conclusion, the article calls for a balance between bat and ball, rather than just a home advantage, and criticizes the short-sightedness of preparing pitches that heavily favor the home team's bowling style. It emphasizes that desperation in sports can be inspiring but also disheartening or embarrassing, as exemplified by the pitch in Indore.
