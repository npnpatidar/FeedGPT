Scientists at the European Space Agency (ESA) are developing batteries made of Americium, a nuclear waste material, to power space missions. The technology is expected to be developed by the end of the decade and will be used for missions in areas where solar power is limited, such as the dark side of the Moon or far-off regions of the Solar System. The batteries will be encapsulated in layers to ensure safety, and Americium will be extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel to make fuel pellets for the batteries. Americium is cheaper, more abundant, and has a longer half-life compared to the currently used plutonium-238 batteries. The ESA has approved a funding of $30 million for the battery system, and plans to launch Americium-based power sources in moon missions in the early 2030s. The technology is also of interest to NASA for its Artemis program.

### [Today’s Cache | ChatGPT opens a new search paradigm](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/chatgpt-open-a-new-search-paradigm-todays-cache/article66233972.ece)

OpenAI has introduced its large language model (LLM) ChatGPT, which allows users to interact with it using natural language. The chatbot not only answers questions but also corrects codes in computer programs. While there are limitations to the chatbot's responses, it has the potential to fundamentally change the way we search the web. OpenAI's chatbot is built on GPT 3.5 architecture and is powered by Microsoft's cloud. The chatbot could be monetized in the future, and there may be a need for a watermark solution to prevent misuse of its capabilities.

### [Today’s Cache | Elon Musk picks a quarrel with Tim Cook](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/twitter-ceo-elon-musk-picks-quarrel-iphone-smartphone-applie-ceo-tim-cook-todays-cache/article66204324.ece)

Elon Musk's recent quarrel with Apple is causing trouble for his platform, Twitter. Musk has been making changes on Twitter since purchasing the platform, including laying off half the staff, which led to voluntary resignations and advertisers leaving. In an attempt to keep the platform active, Musk reinstated former President Donald Trump's account and launched a paid blue verification tick mark. However, the launch did not go smoothly, and the service had to be relaunched. It is speculated that Apple's 30% app tax played a role in delaying the relaunch, as Musk would have to pay a third of his earnings from selling blue tick marks to Apple. Musk publicly criticized Apple's app store in-app purchase policy, calling it a "hidden 30% tax on the internet." He also claimed that Apple has stopped advertising on Twitter and threatened to withhold the platform from its app store, though Apple has not publicly responded.

### [Today’s Cache | Twitter’s anti-propaganda team grapples with Chinese spam accounts on lockdown protests](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/twitter-anti-propaganda-team-grapples-chinese-spam-accounts-hashtag-zero-covid-19-lockdown-protests-elon-musk-layoffs-todays-cache/article66194811.ece)

China is experiencing anti-lockdown protests as citizens oppose the country's zero-covid policy. According to a report by Washington Post, China's state-backed accounts are spamming hashtags on Twitter, including hashtags related to protests. Twitter staff are trying to fight back against this stream of spam, particularly targeting city names such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and Lanzhou. The protests have been fueled by issues such as confusion surrounding hiring, mass quarantines, worker bonuses, and lockdowns as part of China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19. Some protestors have been sharing videos online to raise awareness about their situation. It is noted that Twitter's staff has significantly decreased in number following mass layoffs and resignations after Elon Musk took over the platform. Activists and researchers have expressed concerns about the impact this reduced manpower may have on handling spam and ensuring access to vital information during anti-regime protests.

Users complained about buffering issues and missed goals during live streaming. The article explains that streaming involves a series of steps including compression, encoding, segmentation, and distribution through a content distribution network (CDN). If the CDN is not functioning properly, it can cause streaming issues. If the app does not fix its CDN issue, users may switch to traditional set-top boxes to watch the rest of the World Cup.

The article emphasizes the importance of considering stakeholders and delivering long-term value to customers, employees, and communities.

### [Meta Quest Pro VR users need almost five hours to read its privacy policy: report](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-virtual-reality-users-need-almost-five-hours-read-privacy-policy-mozilla-report/article66144169.ece)

Mozilla researchers have discovered that it would take hours to read through the privacy policy for Meta's new Quest Pro VR headset. In Mozilla's 'Privacy Not Included' guide, it was noted that big tech companies like Meta, Verizon, and Amazon release lengthy privacy policies for their devices, some of which run for tens of thousands of words. The researchers estimated that it would take around four hours and fifty minutes to read all the privacy documents associated with the Meta Quest Pro. Mozilla suggested that the overwhelming volume of documents could be used to pressure users into quickly agreeing to the terms, potentially allowing their data to be collected and sold to external parties.
