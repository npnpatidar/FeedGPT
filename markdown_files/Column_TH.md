### [Judges and the people](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-judges-and-the-people/article68539776.ece)

The article examines the increasing politicization of judiciaries globally.  In Bangladesh, recent protests led to the resignation of the Chief Justice and other judges, highlighting the judiciary's vulnerability to political pressure. This trend is not unique to Bangladesh, as seen in the U.S. where judicial appointments often align with political affiliations, influencing rulings on politically charged issues like abortion rights.

The author explores the tension between judicial autonomy and public opinion, questioning whether a purely apolitical judiciary is truly feasible.  The article also touches upon debates in India regarding the Supreme Court's power to amend the Constitution and the perceived lack of transparency in judicial appointments. 

Finally, it uses examples from India and Bangladesh to illustrate how the concept of "traitor"  is often weaponized in political conflicts, further blurring the lines between law and politics.

### [Column | Feet of fortune](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece)

The practice of placing crowns with the deity's footprints on devotees' heads in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes a deeper connection to Hindu bhakti traditions.  Originally, bhakti didn't signify submission but participation in the divine's life. Temples, unlike places of meditation, were vibrant centers celebrating life,  where deities were treated as residents and involved in daily rituals and festivals. This devotion was supported by village grants known as deva bhoga. 

However, this movement coexisted with societal stratification based on purity, leading to instances of exclusion and segregation.  Depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi highlight the importance of contentment over the pursuit of fortune. The Vishnu narrative suggests that a humble mindset and acceptance of all, symbolized by the veneration of the feet, leads to true fortune.

The recent turmoil in Bangladesh, with the U.S. seemingly supportive of a potential Islamist government, tests India-U.S. strategic alignment.  

 India and the U.S. have historically shared goals in countering China's influence, but the U.S. stance on Bangladesh raises concerns for India, as it tolerates actors against India's interests in the region. Both nations face challenges regarding trade restrictions on China, with evidence suggesting they may harm domestic innovation.  Internal dynamics in India, such as debates over caste-based quotas and immigration from Bangladesh, also highlight complexities in navigating both domestic and international issues.

### [Unequal, and the more unequal](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece)

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories within Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision recognizes the unequal treatment faced by different SC groups,  despite existing quotas and schemes. 

The court cited the need for "substantive equality" and  drew parallels to the  'more backward' categories allowed for backward classes. Proponents argue that sub-categorization prioritizes those who need it most, while opponents fear it could further fragment already marginalized communities. The implementation of sub-categories will likely lead to new political dynamics and challenges.

Numerous Indian TV shows and films also reflect this sentiment, showcasing the dark side of corporate culture. This widespread frustration underscores the bleak job market and  lack of fulfilling professional opportunities for young Indians.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Thailand's Ayutthaya, a former capital city, is now a ruin filled with temples and Buddha statues.  The city was heavily influenced by the Ramayana, with the king holding a semi-divine status and the epic used to justify royal power and grandeur. Thai kings, like those in Cambodia and Burma, adopted a Mandala model of governance that expanded and contracted based on charisma and capability.  

A merchant-based economy and vast trade networks fueled the city's prosperity, and religious influences from both Hinduism and Buddhism shaped its culture. The decline and sacking of Ayutthaya in the 18th century echoed a similar historical event in earlier capital Sukhothai, leading to the establishment of Bangkok as the new capital.

It highlights the ancient city of Ayutthaya, once the capital of Thai kings and now a ruin, where the epic is depicted in temples and royal performances.

They explain the Mandala model of governance prevalent in Southeast Asian kingdoms, which extended their influence regionally. 

The article then delves into the spread of the Ramayana across Southeast Asia through trade routes and its impact on the architecture of grand temples. It also notes the absence of bhakti in the Thai Ramakien compared to its South Indian counterparts, attributing it to the cultural influences on Thai kings. Finally, it  mentions the sacking of Ayutthaya in 1765,  similar to the earlier capital Sukhothai, and the subsequent establishment of Bangkok.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The term "woke" has undergone a rapid shift from a positive descriptor of social and political awareness to a derogatory term used for criticism.  Originally associated with inclusivity, respect for diverse cultures, and support for marginalized groups, "woke" has been appropriated by the political right to denigrate such ideals. This manipulation of language reflects how politics often corrupts and is corrupted by the language used.  The author argues that while the goal of being "woke" is laudable, its overzealous application, especially in terms of "cultural appropriation," can lead to an imprecision in language and stifle creativity, as exemplified by the debate surrounding Lionel Shriver's comments on identity politics.
=======
The word "woke," initially positive, has rapidly become derogatory.  Once associated with inclusivity and awareness of social injustices, it is now used by some as a pejorative to criticize political correctness and an emphasis on marginalized voices. This shift reflects the politicization of language, where terms can be easily manipulated and redefined based on political agendas.  

The author argues that this trend hinders clear communication and stifles creative expression. For example, the increasing sensitivity around cultural appropriation can lead to a reluctance to engage with different cultures, limiting artistic and personal growth.  Ultimately, the article warns against the dangers of  taking language too literally and encourages a more nuanced understanding of evolving terms.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The article explores the history of the Indian rupee as a widely used currency. It traces its origins to Sher Shah Suri's reforms in the 16th century and its consolidation under Akbar, who established mints across a vast Mughal empire.  Europe's trade with India led to the rupee becoming a crucial "trade coin," used by East India Companies and beyond. European colonies in Africa even minted rupees, showcasing its global reach.  



The rupee's use extended to the Gulf, officially recognized by the Reserve Bank of India till the 1960s when Gulf nations adopted their own currencies.  Interestingly, recent advancements in Indian payment technology have seen the “Rupay” system gain traction, echoing the historical journey of the rupee.
=======
The rupee's journey as a global currency began with Sher Shah Suri, who standardized coinage denominations and established mints across his kingdom. Akbar further solidified the rupee's position by expanding its circulation and ensuring consistent weight and purity.

The East India Companies adopted the rupee for trade with India, exporting it to territories under their control and influencing the design of local currencies. European powers later mimicked this, with British East Africa and other colonies issuing their own rupees. 

  The rupee even became legal tender in Arab sheikhdoms under British treaties. While the Arab kingdoms eventually adopted their own currencies, India's modern UPI system reflects a renewed international embrace of Indian monetary innovation.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This article critiques the communication of biodiversity conservation, arguing that its abstract nature and emphasis on utilitarian benefits hinder public understanding and engagement. 

The author proposes moving beyond a solely functional approach to well-being, emphasizing the importance of recognizing human diversity and agency in experiencing and benefiting from biodiversity. They highlight the limitations of equating ecosystem services with well-being, particularly in the context of social inequalities.  

Drawing on Amartya Sen's concept of capabilities, the article advocates for framing biodiversity conservation in terms of the freedoms and opportunities it enables for individuals and communities. This shift in perspective, the author suggests, will lead to a more nuanced and effective approach to engaging the public in biodiversity conservation efforts.
=======
This article explores the challenge of communicating the importance of biodiversity to the public. While climate change has gained mainstream attention, biodiversity remains an abstract concept.  

The author argues that the language used to describe biodiversity, focusing on  ecosystem services and monetary values, fails to capture its full significance. Instead, the article advocates for a shift in perspective, emphasizing human well-being and the diverse ways communities interact with nature.

Drawing on Amartya Sen's philosophy of "capabilities," the article suggests that biodiversity conservation should focus on empowering individuals and communities to lead fulfilling lives. It calls for research that examines how biodiversity translates into tangible benefits for people, considering factors like gender, class, and caste.  Ultimately, the article proposes that by understanding the links between biodiversity and human well-being, we can create more effective and meaningful conservation strategies.

### [The national and the regional](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-the-national-and-the-regional/article68243397.ece)

<<<<<<< HEAD
This article analyses how national parties, such as the Congress and BJP, utilize regionalism during election campaigns. 

The Congress is seen employing regional identity politics in Karnataka and Telangana, while Rahul Gandhi's campaign in Kerala and Tamil Nadu emphasized regional pride. The BJP, on the other hand, targeted the BJD in Odisha by highlighting the influence of a non-Odia individual in the state government, although the party is also attempting to appeal to regional sentiments in Tamil Nadu. 

The article notes that while regionalism may be acceptable if it doesn't target other regions or people, using it as a weapon against them can be harmful.  It concludes that the tendency of national parties to cater to regional sentiments more intensely than regional parties themselves is a notable trend in contemporary politics.
=======
The article examines how national political parties in India, particularly the Congress and BJP, leverage regionalism in their campaigns.  

The Congress employs regional identity politics in Karnataka and Telangana, and Rahul Gandhi's campaign in Kerala and Tamil Nadu emphasized regional pride.  

The BJP's strategy is more complex, aiming to woo Tamil Nadu voters while simultaneously attacking Odisha's ruling party for appointing a non-Odia, Tamil Nadu-born official. The article notes the BJP's shift in tactic in West Bengal, being more sensitive to Bengali pride after facing resistance in the 2021 assembly elections.  

The author concludes by pointing out the dangers of regionalism when it targets and demonizes other regions and people.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The author humorously reflects on the complexities of family relationships, particularly with relatives who knew them in childhood. 

These relatives, often baffled by the author's maturation and accomplishments, tend to dwell on past mishaps, causing awkwardness and discomfort.  The author compares the dynamics to a playful weaponized storytelling game,  where grandparents deliberately recount embarrassing anecdotes about older siblings to younger generations.  Drawing on Euripides' wisdom, the author suggests that true friends are more valuable than numerous relatives, especially distant ones, who are less likely to hold childhood transgressions against them.
=======
Relatives, particularly those who knew us as children and reconnect after decades, can be a source of both amusement and exasperation. They often dwell on past childhood mishaps, finding them more significant than our adult achievements. This can feel embarrassing and make us question why these anecdotes hold such importance in their present lives.  It highlights the  difference in perspective between adults and children, where past mistakes are seen as more impactful than current triumphs. As Euripides observed, true friends are far more valuable than numerous relatives.

Arvind Kejriwal's recent allegations regarding power struggles within the BJP, including speculation about Amit Shah replacing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, have forced the party to defend its positions. This has shifted the focus of the 2024 election narrative from the BJP's achievements to addressing these challenges. 

Modi, for the first time in his career, is struggling to establish a clear campaign theme, vacillating between promises and attacks on the Congress. This struggle highlights a potential shift in voter sentiment, with the BJP facing pressure to address concerns raised by Kejriwal.
=======
Arvind Kejriwal's recent allegations concerning Prime Minister Modi's potential retirement at 75 years old and a power struggle within the BJP have forced the party to shift from touting its achievements to defending its position.

Modi's 2024 campaign strategy is lacking a clear central theme, with attempts to connect with voters through different messages, such as addressing concerns about economic disparity.

The BJP's response to Kejriwal's accusations highlights the party's defensive stance in the elections. Modi's campaign, unlike in 2019, faces challenges in connecting with voters, particularly the economically disadvantaged.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The article discusses the contemporary trend of adding backstories to popular characters, arguing that it is often unnecessary and even detrimental. While some authors successfully continue the adventures of established characters, others, seeking to update stories or embrace inclusivity, take liberties that deviate significantly from the original works. The author cites examples like Agatha Christie's novels, where recent adaptations have altered plots, protagonists, and even murderer identities, leading to criticism from fans who prefer faithful adaptations. While defending such changes as necessary for modern audiences, the article ultimately warns against excessive creative license,  illustrating the potential pitfalls with humorous examples of drastically altered classic stories.
=======
Contemporary writers increasingly focus on backstories for popular characters, from superheroes to literary detectives like Perry Mason. While some readers and viewers appreciate these extra layers, critics argue they can be unnecessary, unimaginative, and even disrespectful to the original authors' intentions.  Modern adaptations of classic works often take creative liberties, altering plots, characters, and even endings for reasons of inclusivity, relevance, or simply to create a longer narrative. This raises questions about the balance between honoring original works and updating them for modern audiences.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The BJP is shifting its 2024 election strategy, embracing communalism and casteism couched in constitutionalism. They are using  communal insinuations and targeting OBCs, tribal communities, and Dalits with appeals that were previously used by opposition parties. 

This approach, led by Prime Minister Modi, prioritizes the votes of marginalized communities, potentially alienating upper caste and middle-class supporters. 

The BJP claims the Congress seeks to undermines the Constitution by granting Muslim reservations,  playing on fears of Hindu subaltern communities. Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena (UBT) presents a contrasting Hindutva ideology emphasizing skill and hard work, appealing to Muslim voters and accusing the BJP of being anti-Maharashtra.
=======
The BJP's 2024 election campaign is focusing on communalism, casteism, and a claim to constitutionalism.  Prime Minister Modi is targeting OBCs, tribal communities, and Dalits with messages emphasizing Hindu subaltern unity against Muslims. This strategy, while aiming to solidify the party's base among marginalized groups, has generated unease among upper caste supporters.  

The BJP accuses the Congress of undermining the Constitution and plans to prioritize Muslim reservations at the expense of Hindu groups. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray contrasts this with his party's Hindutva, emphasizing social progress and respect for the Constitution.

The BJP's outreach to subaltern communities is also generating regional tensions, with accusations of "Gujarati hegemony" directed at the party.

The article discusses the lack of memorable quotes in the IPL, highlighting the sanitized nature of player interviews. The author uses Suryakumar Yadav’s honest admission about Jasprit Bumrah’s ability to break bats and ankles to illustrate the rarity of such candidness. Bumrah’s statement about “no ego in this format” is then explored, differentiating between healthy and destructive ego in sports.  

The article further analyzes Sunil Narine’s approach, emphasizing the value of clarity and focus on one’s role. By limiting his knowledge to his core task of hitting the ball, Narine thrives.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The article analyzes the dynamics of political discourse in India, focusing on accusations of divisiveness levied by the BJP and Congress.  The BJP accuses the Congress of promoting division through demands for a nationwide caste census and criticisms of centralizing policies. The Congress, in turn, criticizes the BJP for allegedly excluding and marginalizing Muslims and other religious minorities. 

The BJP's approach to "Hindu unity" is complex, aiming to both include lower castes in political and cultural spheres while excluding religious minorities, particularly Muslims. The Congress faces the challenge of advocating for caste justice without appearing to undermine Hindu identity. 

The article also highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the definition of "Hindu" and its implications for Indian nationalism.
=======
The Indian political landscape is marked by accusations of division from both the BJP and Congress. The BJP criticizes the Congress's demand for a caste census and its stance on State autonomy, claiming these encourage division.  Conversely, the Congress accuses the BJP of dividing the nation by allegedly discriminating against religious minorities and subaltern castes, and centralizing power. 

The BJP aims to unify Hindus, viewing it as synonymous with national unity, while including subaltern groups in political and cultural spheres. However, it excludes religious minorities, particularly Muslims. The Congress struggles to advocate for caste justice without alienating Hindu identities.  The BJP faces the challenge of managing the discontent of upper castes who perceive the party's focus on subaltern groups as detrimental to their interests.

This article explores the phenomenon of heckling in cricket stadiums, focusing on Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya's recent experience. The author argues that while some fans' displeasure over Pandya's captaincy is understandable, the "booing" strategy lacks originality. 

The piece delves into historical examples of Indian cricketers facing heckling, such as Ravi Shastri being greeted with "Hai, hai Shastri" during his playing days, highlighting how players often learn to ignore it and use it as motivation.  Ultimately, the article emphasizes that while heckling can sometimes be unpleasant, it is an integral part of the spectator experience, bringing a unique form of engagement and humor to the game.
=======
An ongoing saga in the IPL involves Hardik Pandya facing boos from fans, allegedly due to replacing Rohit Sharma as Mumbai Indians captain. 

While Pandya has maintained a calm demeanor, the article examines the history of heckling in cricket, referencing instances involving Ravi Shastri and Tiger Pataudi. It argues that heckling, when done playfully, is a unique aspect of cricket fandom that adds to the game's entertainment. The article acknowledges that lines can be crossed with abusive language but suggests that non-toxic heckling, like the famous witticism of "Yabba" from Australia, enriches the spectator experience.

India's selectors face a dilemma regarding the selection of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for the upcoming World T20.  While experience is valuable in cricket, the T20 format emphasizes adaptability and an ability to constantly evolve.  Young players often thrive in this environment due to their lack of experience-driven constraints.  

Kohli and Sharma, though seasoned veterans,  have shown the ability to adapt their game. Notably, Kohli's recent innings against Punjab Kings showcased both his textbook shots and innovative strokeplay.  The selectors, however, need more data on their performance in the ongoing IPL to make a final decision.
=======
The discussion over whether to include both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in India's World T20 squad highlights the complexities of experience in the rapidly evolving T20 format. 

While experience is valuable in other formats like Test cricket, where memory and pattern recognition are crucial, T20 demands adaptability and a "forgetfulness" of past deliveries.  Young players, unburdened by past knowledge, often thrive in this environment. Meanwhile,  established batters like Kohli and Sharma, despite their understanding of the game, might struggle to adapt to the constant changes in T20. 

The selectors will carefully analyze their performances in the IPL before making a final decision.

The series demonstrated Rohit Sharma's understanding of Kuldeep's strengths and weaknesses, offering him both guidance and support. Kuldeep's ability to deceive batsmen with his unpredictable delivery makes him a formidable weapon, and his growing maturity and consistency bode well for his future.

=======
This week sees several cricketers reach the milestone of playing their 100th Test match: R. Ashwin and Jonny Bairstow for India and England respectively, and Kane Williamson and Tim Southee for New Zealand.

Having played 100 Tests is a significant achievement, as the format is especially demanding.  Ashwin, India's most successful off-spinner, faces scrutiny regarding his place in an all-time India team.  His success is undeniable, but questions arise about comparing him to players from earlier eras due to advancements in cricket knowledge and techniques.  Ashwin's unique approach, combining natural talent and constant experimentation, sets him apart. 

While figures are important, they don't fully capture his impact.  His "Ashwinness" –  a relentless pursuit of wickets –  is a testament to his skill and strategy. Ashwin's constant drive to improve and challenge himself makes him a modern master of the craft, deserving recognition as a cornerstone of Indian cricket history.

The passing of Fali S. Nariman prompted reflection on India's secular state. One view argues that India once flourished as a secular nation, but the rise of Hindu nationalism with milestones like the destruction of the Babri Masjid and construction of a Ram Temple threatens this past peace. Another view sees the current regime as correcting a historical path, restoring a glorified Hindu past ignored by secular politics. Both perspectives agree that the present deviates from a previous era, considered flawed in either its secularism or non-Hindutva stance.  While lamenting a lost past is not constructive, examining the past realistically can offer insights into the current political climate.  For example, experiences recounted about voting practices during India's early republic highlight the complexities and limitations of democracy.
=======
The article examines differing perspectives on India's past and present, particularly in the context of secularism and the rise of Hindu nationalism. 

One view, exemplified by constitutional scholar Fali S. Nariman, sees a decline from a past of peaceful religious coexistence to the present threat posed by Hindu nationalism. The other view frames the current regime as restoring a true Hindu identity and correcting past secular deviations.

The article criticizes the romanticized notion of a pristine past, citing an example of voter confusion during elections in the past. It suggests a more nuanced understanding of India's history and challenges the notion of a lost secular glory as a basis for the future.

South Africa's decision to prioritize their domestic T20 tournament over a Test series against New Zealand highlights a concerning trend in cricket: the diminishing value of Test cricket. 

Only two players from the team that previously defeated India remain in the squad for the New Zealand series, indicating a serious shift in priorities.  This action has drawn criticism, particularly from former Australian captain Steve Waugh, who points to a lack of care from administrators for the longest format of the game. 

The article argues that the allure of lucrative T20 franchise leagues is driving this trend, with players and administrators seemingly more focused on financial gain than upholding the traditions of Test cricket. Unless a balance between franchise cricket and Test matches is achieved, Test cricket risks becoming a relic of the past.

India have struggled to win Test series in South Africa over the past three decades, despite boasting some of the finest players in history. 

While they have improved in overseas conditions, South Africa's bowling attack, particularly left-arm pacers, has often posed a challenge for Indian batsmen. Past series defeats have often been attributed to a combination of poor batting, specific bowling vulnerabilities, and strategic errors. 

India's current captain, Rohit Sharma, possesses a more aggressive approach that aims to seize control early, unlike previous generations who often opted for defensive strategies in South Africa.  


The upcoming two-Test series holds significant importance for India, as a win would not only end their long-standing drought but also establish them as a force to be reckoned with in all Test-playing nations.
=======
India's history in Test matches against South Africa has been marked by challenges. Despite boasting some of cricket's greatest players, they have struggled to win series in South Africa, with a particularly poor record in Durban and Johannesburg. 

Though India now ranks as the No.1 Test team and possesses a formidable bowling attack, they face a  difficult task in breaking the cycle of defeats.  Factors such as inconsistent performances, struggles against left-arm pace bowling, and poor team balance have hampered their progress.

The BJP's approach, symbolized by the temple's construction, centers on a singular certitude of Hindu nationalism.  This raises concerns about the future, as other religious disputes, such as the one in Mathura, are likely to emerge, fueled by competing claims and the inherent tensions within a singular national narrative.
=======
The inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya marks the end of a long-standing religious dispute, but it also raises questions about the future of India. While some see it as a symbol of national unity, others view it as a move towards religious homogeneity and an attempt to impose a single interpretation of Indian nationalism.  This finality represented by the temple construction is a paradoxically a challenge to the idea of a constantly evolving and inclusive nation. This culminates in new religious conflicts,  such as the dispute over the Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, and highlights the ongoing tension between religious identity and the idea of a secular India.

Usman Khawaja, an Australian cricketer, was asked by the ICC not to wear shoes with the slogans "All lives are equal" and "Freedom is a human right" during a Test match against Pakistan. The ICC deemed these messages political and against their policy prohibiting personal messages on equipment.  

While the ICC seeks to maintain neutrality and avoid endorsing specific political viewpoints, Khawaja argues his slogans are humanitarian messages. This incident raises questions about a sportsman's responsibility to speak out on global issues. 

The article also highlights the increasing prominence of social causes in sports, citing examples like "Black Lives Matter" and climate activism within cricket. It contrasts this with the more reserved stance of Indian cricketers, ultimately suggesting that Khawaja's initiative, even if unsuccessful, prompts important conversations.

The ICC Cricket World Cup final saw Australia defeat India, shattering the pre-tournament hype surrounding India's victory.  Despite being considered favorites, India failed to win, reminding everyone that upsets are an inherent part of sport.  

Australia's underdog status fueled their aggressive approach, contrasting with India's perceived confidence.  The disappointed Indian crowd, known for its silence even in defeat, failed to fully embrace the visitors' victory. 

The Indian team, considered one of the strongest, put up a valiant fight. However, the loss highlights the cruelty of sport, as some players may never get another chance to compete for the World Cup.

The Cricket World Cup, despite pre-tournament hype surrounding India as favorites, culminated in an Australian victory, reminding us of sport's unpredictable nature. India, dominant in world cricket,  failed to control the result, leading to disappointment and silence from the home crowd.

Though the tournament showcased India's best cricketing talent, the absence of former captain Kapil Dev,  and the hubris displayed by fans and officials  raised questions. This unexpected loss serves as a reminder that while India sets trends in cricket,  momentum and hype cannot guarantee success in the face of a determined opponent like Australia.

Phuphee, the protagonist, witnessed Masarat's suffering and, in a shocking act, convinced her mother that Masarat had died after a miscarriage.  This acted as a catalyst for the mother to finally stop invalidating Masarat's grief by claiming her lost babies were not real. 

Years later, Phuphee justifies her actions, explaining that it was easier to bear the guilt of hurting Masarat's mother than to witness the unbearable emotional pain caused by the mother's words.

The article discusses the influence of public opinion on diplomacy and international relations, particularly in the context of populism. 

It highlights how populism has transformed the discussion of foreign policy from an elite domain to a public one,  with citizens expressing their views on matters such as war and national interest.  The article contrasts Indian and Western populism, noting that while Indian populism favors a strong military stance and national sovereignty, Western populism often pushes back against militarism and foreign intervention.

It also examines the challenges this presents for governments, as public demands for assertive foreign policy can complicate their efforts to navigate complex international situations. The article uses examples from India, the United States, and Israel to illustrate these points.
=======
The rise of populism has significantly impacted diplomacy, pushing it into the realm of everyday citizen discussions. What used to be confined to elite circles is now debated in local assemblies, online forums, and public discourse. 

This shift is particularly evident in India, where populist sentiment aligns with a more assertive foreign policy stance.  In contrast, Western populism tends to be more skeptical of military intervention and global entanglements. 

Despite these differing approaches, strategists in both India and the West face the challenge of managing public opinion on foreign policy issues. Pro-war rhetoric and strong nationalistic sentiments, often fueled by social media, make it difficult to navigate complex international conflicts.

The article argues that this decision reflects a pattern of exclusion and a politicization of sport. It highlights the hypocrisy of India's stance, given its fondness for the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry and its financial benefits.

India's performance in the Cricket World Cup has been impressive, but the denial of visas to Pakistani fans raises concerns. Mickey Arthur, Pakistan's team director, criticized the lack of Pakistani supporters at the India-Pakistan match, calling it more of a BCCI event than an ICC event. This decision contrasts with the 2011 World Cup semi-final, where a larger number of Pakistani fans were granted visas.  While India and Pakistan often portray each other as enemies, sporting events offer an opportunity for fans to connect.  The exclusion of Pakistani fans, even as the match attracted significant global attention, highlights a pattern of political interference in sporting events.

The author highlights the differences between Indian and American populism, noting that in India, populism aligns with the security apparatus, while in the U.S., it challenges it.  This, the author suggests, leads to a distinct media landscape where in India, state and media are aligned against perceived internal threats, while in the U.S., they often collude to paint populist nationalists as enemies of the state influenced by foreign powers.

Vivek Ramaswamy and Suella Braverman, despite their Indian origins, have emerged as prominent figures in conservative politics in the US and the UK respectively. Both advocate for restricted immigration and emphasize "western identity."  

Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate, connects his Hindu faith to conservative values and criticizes the impact of American capitalism on the middle class.  Braverman, the British Home Secretary, warns of the "existential challenge" posed by unchecked migration and criticizes multiculturalism.

Possible reasons for their appeal to conservative voters include shared values on family and concerns about changing cultural norms. Furthermore, conservatives may see these figures as potential allies in countering changing demographics and maintaining their influence.

Vivek Ramaswamy and Suella Braverman, both of Indian origin, represent a rising trend of conservative leaders emphasizing western identity.  Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate in the US, criticizes the culture wars driven by the left, advocates for faith-based action, and seeks to restrict immigration. Similarly, Braverman, the UK Home Secretary, argues that uncontrolled migration threatens western civilization and calls for integration. 

Scholars suggest this alignment of brown populations with conservative causes stems from shared values and a natural distrust of left-leaning social agendas. This political shift could potentially influence the future of western identity, as conservative groups seek to broaden their appeal beyond traditional white voters.

India's middle order collapse, fueled by Craig McDermott's bowling, sealed their fate.  A promised India-Pakistan final did not materialize as Australia defeated Pakistan in the semis and England eliminated India. 

Australia's win highlighted the importance of singles and patience, concepts that differed from today's modern cricketing approach.

The article discusses the paradoxical trend of rising nationalism becoming a global phenomenon. Using the India-Canada dispute over Khalistan as an example, it highlights how nationalist movements transcend geographical boundaries.  The author argues that even though the world witnessed a perceived shift towards globalism in the late 20th century, the rise of nationalism and the desire to control national interests have resurfaced.  

This globalized nationalism is evident in various countries, including the US, UK, and China, where domestic politics intertwine with international relations.  The article concludes by emphasizing that both nationalism and globalism continue to be relevant and influential forces shaping the world today.
=======
The recent clash between India and Canada over the killing of a suspected terrorist has highlighted the global reach of nationalism.  

Interestingly, nationalisms across the world, such as Indian, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Chinese, are increasingly mobilizing across national boundaries. This contradicts the earlier belief in a shrinking world where national sovereignty was fading.  

While countries assert national sovereignty and ring-fence their interests, they also seek to influence global affairs and promote universal goals. This creates a  complex interplay of  nationalism and globalism, often seen as opportunistic and hypocritical. The tension is further evident in the debate surrounding immigration policies like the H-1B visa program in the U.S.


The case of India and Canada demonstrates the ongoing struggle to balance national interests with global realities. In India, internal divisions are being exposed as political parties navigate the issue. Courts are also grappling with constitutional questions related to citizenship and reservation for SCs/STs, highlighting the complexities of national identity within a diverse nation.

She devises a plan for him to read Quran verses and tie a rope around the cows and his wrist,  an undertaking she claims will be difficult.  

However, Phuphee reveals to the narrator that she  actually aided Bashir's wife who had confronted her about Bashir's infidelity.  Phuphee's "cure" was nothing more than suggesting the wife milk the cows when Bashir was absent. The cryptic whisper she gave Bashir was a suggestion that the curse came from the woman he was seeing, a woman with distinctive features that Phuphee, as the woman's midwife, knew well.
=======
The story follows Phuphee, a wise woman, who helps Bashir, a local farmer, when his cows mysteriously escape and stop producing milk. Bashir blames a curse and seeks Phuphee's guidance.  

Phuphee, while acknowledging the situation, advises Bashir to recite verses from the Quran and tie a rope around his cows and wrist. She then whispers something in Bashir's ear, causing him distress. 

After this encounter, the narrator learns from Phuphee that the "curse" was orchestrated by Bashir's wife, who requested help in keeping her unfaithful husband at home. Phuphee explained that she helped the wife by subtly suggesting she release the cows, prompting Bashir to believe a curse was involved.   

The story highlights the importance of empowering individuals to make their own decisions and the wisdom in sometimes offering help through subtle guidance rather than direct intervention.

The International Cricket Council (ICC), now heavily influenced by India's financial power, faces pressure to prioritize revenue-generating T20 leagues over Test matches.  South Africa's decision to send a weakened team to New Zealand for a two-Test series while focusing on its lucrative domestic T20 tournament, the SA20, highlights this shift in priorities. 

The author questions whether the oversaturation of T20 cricket will lead to its own decline as fans lose interest in a format that becomes repetitive and predictable. The article concludes that the very organizations responsible for preserving the integrity of the sport, both national and international governing bodies, may have become beholden to private owners who prioritize profit over the long-term health of cricket.

The article discusses the growing dominance of franchise T20 cricket over traditional Test cricket.  South Africa's decision to prioritize their domestic T20 tournament, the SA20,  over a second-string team for a Test series against New Zealand exemplifies this shift.  

The author argues that the International Cricket Council (ICC) is increasingly beholden to financially powerful teams and broadcasters, prioritizing lucrative T20 leagues over the health of Test cricket. While acknowledging the financial benefits of franchise cricket, the author questions its long-term sustainability, suggesting the potential for audience fatigue and decline in the overall appeal of the sport.

The article discusses the BJP's proposal for "one nation, one election," aiming to synchronize national and state elections every five years.  

The author argues that while this could reduce election costs and government disruption, it undermines democratic principles.  The author cites concerns that it restricts voting rights, favors the incumbent government, and limits the expression of diverse viewpoints. The article also explores the implications of such a move for India's diverse population and its history of multi-party politics, suggesting it could potentially hinder the expansion and deepening of democracy in the country.
=======
The BJP's proposal for 'one nation, one election' aims to hold parliamentary, state assembly, and local elections simultaneously every five years.  The argument is that this would reduce costs, minimize disruption to development, and prevent instability caused by hung assemblies.

However, critics argue that this move undermines democratic principles. They point out that diverse political landscapes often lead to fractured verdicts, reflecting the nation's complexity. Synchonised elections could restrict voter freedom and prioritize efficiency over the messy, dynamic nature of democracy. Concerns are also raised about the potential for abuse, as the proposal could further empower the incumbent government.

The author's aunt, Phuphee, lived a peaceful life in a Kashmiri village, connected to nature and tradition.  The arrival of a television brought noise and disruption into her home, but she tolerated it. However, the loud and aggressive rhetoric of Donald Trump, constantly present on television, proved too much for her.

<<<<<<< HEAD
India's political landscape is undergoing a major realignment ahead of the 2024 elections. Two prominent alliances have emerged: the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), formed by opposition parties. 

These alliances are vying for the subaltern vote, with both BJP and INDIA parties focusing on OBCs and Dalits.  However, there is a lack of strong, independent subaltern leadership, leaving a vacuum that the BJP appears to be successfully filling.  

The emergence of these alliances has led to shifting political equations at the state level. The Congress is facing challenges in states like West Bengal and Punjab, while regional parties like the BRS and YSRCP are maneuvering for advantage. 



The situation remains fluid, with further realignments expected. The outcome of the 2024 elections will depend largely on the ability of both alliances to effectively mobilize these crucial voter segments.
=======
A deepening political polarization in India is shaping alliances ahead of the 2024 elections. The ruling NDA, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,  grouped 38 parties, while the emerging INDIA alliance aims to challenge Modi's third term bid with 26 members.  

Both coalitions are vying for the subaltern vote, particularly among OBCs and Dalits. The BJP has made inroads with these groups, leaving a void for other parties to fill.  The Congress, despite its dwindling influence, has an opportunity to connect with these voters by embracing more inclusive representation and rhetoric.

Political dynamics are shifting across the country. Alliances are being renegotiated, creating uncertainty. Regional parties like the BRS, TDP, and YSRCP are playing a complex role, maintaining distance from both major alliances, potentially influencing the outcome of the 2024 elections.

The inauguration of India's new Parliament building was marked by political divide, with opposition parties boycotting the event. 

The installation of a sengol, a golden sceptre,  triggered debate as it symbolizes religious authority. The BJP framed the sengol as symbolic of power transfer from British to Congress rule, despite historical inaccuracies. Critics argue this move attempts to redefine Indian republicanism and undermines Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu. Academic Partha Chatterjee's "The Truths and Lies of Nationalism" provides insightful context on such historical narratives. 

Meanwhile, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma discussed the evolving identity politics in the Northeast, advocating for a multilingual state with Assamese as the lingua franca. A mural depicting the subcontinent in the new Parliament building has drawn criticism from Nepali politicians for its implications on territory claims. 

Finally, the Law Commission recommends retaining the sedition law despite its colonial origins, suggesting amendments for clarity.

The inauguration of the new Parliament building was marked by controversy, with opposition parties boycotting the event. The installation of a sengol, a religious symbol gifted to Jawaharlal Nehru, sparked debate about the government's intent to revise India's founding principles. 

The BJP's narrative of the sengol signifying the transfer of power from British to Congress lacks historical basis, yet reinforces a new official narrative around nation-building.  This narrative may solidify over time, potentially suppressing dissenting voices.  The choice of a specifically Saivite sect from Tamil Nadu to associate with the sengol has also been interpreted as an attempt to undermine Dravidian politics in the state.

While often praised for her humility, these stories generated criticism, highlighting a generational shift where simplicity is no longer considered aspirational. 

The controversy stemmed from the erosion of trust in public personas, amplified by pervasive social media scrutiny and a culture of fact-checking. Murty's message of simplicity, while once widely appreciated, now appears outdated and even suspect in a world where wealth and extravagance are increasingly celebrated.

Sudha Murty, wife of Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, recently sparked a social media frenzy for comments about her  "simple" lifestyle.

The author questions whether there are distinct styles of batting suited for different formats, likening Root's T20 play to "classical music played at the wrong speed."  Comparisons are drawn with Sunil Gavaskar's initial reluctance towards ODIs and his eventual success in the format, highlighting how great batsmen adapt to different challenges. 

Ultimately, the article suggests that  Root, like Kohli, is ultimately playing to his strengths, even if it means compromising elegance for effectiveness in the demanding world of T20 cricket.

The article discusses the ICC's revenue-sharing model and India's dominant position in cricket. It highlights how the initial power dynamics  were centered around England and Australia, later shifting to a financial model where India holds significant influence due to its massive market size and commercial value. 

The article criticizes the ICC's focus on rewarding  financial contributions, arguing that it neglects the development of the game in less wealthy nations. While acknowledging India's right to its share based on its financial input, the author stresses the need for a more balanced approach that promotes equitable growth within the cricketing world.

This article discusses the imbalance in wealth distribution within international cricket.  Historically, England and Australia dominated the sport due to their colonial power, but now India's financial clout has created a new hierarchy.  

The ICC's proposed revenue-sharing model favors the Big Three (India, England, and Australia),  giving them a disproportionate share of the surplus. While India's economic contribution is undeniable, the article argues that the ICC should prioritize the growth of the game by ensuring a fairer distribution of funds. It highlights the need for a more equitable system that benefits all cricketing nations, particularly those with limited resources.

An article discusses the prevalence of online opinions, fueled by social media's constant push for engagement. The author reflects on their own experience of being drawn into online arguments and the realization that issues are rarely black and white. Drawing on Jon Ronson's book "So You've Been Publicly Shamed," the author examines examples of individuals whose careers were derailed by online shaming and highlights the dangers of mob mentality.  The author concludes that the relentless cycle of online outrage has led to a deeper understanding of the limitations of personal opinions and the need for more thoughtful engagement with complex issues.

The internet's excessive focus on opinion-based engagement has led to a culture of quick judgments and polarized debates. Recent events, such as the Dalai Lama controversy and the J.K. Rowling transgender debate, highlight the complexity of issues and the dangers of forming strong opinions without thorough understanding.   

The author, through examples from Jon Ronson's book "So You've Been Publicly Shamed," argues that social media outrage often lacks nuance and traps individuals in destructive cycles of blame and defensiveness.  The author encourages stepping back from the urge to express an opinion on every topic and instead embracing humility and a willingness to learn.
