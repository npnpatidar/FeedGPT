The article discusses denialism, defined as the refusal to accept proven truths, and its connection to assertism, the insistence on beliefs despite evidence to the contrary. It highlights how both distort reality and fuel irrational beliefs, often found in conspiracy theories.  The author uses examples like climate change denial and belief in moon landing hoaxes to illustrate how these unfounded beliefs spread, especially when perpetuated by influential figures.  The article emphasizes that while some skepticism is healthy, blind trust in leaders and narratives can be detrimental, leading to the acceptance of pseudo-science and pseudo-religion.

### [Two-tier system for Tests is an old idea whose time has come](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/two-tier-system-for-tests-is-an-old-idea-whose-time-has-come/article68626336.ece)

The International Cricket Council has long considered a two-tier system for Test cricket to address  concerns about competitiveness and resource disparities amongst teams.  

While a promotion-relegation system was initially debated, a proposal involving two divisions based on rankings has gained traction. This system aims to increase competition within nations with similar resources,  improve global touring schedules, and potentially separate major series like the Ashes from the World Test Championship cycle.  

Financial support for less affluent nations through a central fund,  aimed at preserving Test cricket, is also expected to be implemented soon. Although television rights distribution reform remains unresolved, the two-tier system, modeled after American sports,  holds promise for a more balanced and engaging future for Test cricket.

The article raises questions about Shah's leadership style and whether he will be able to foster open discussion and transparency in the ICC or if his decisions will be driven by a desire to maintain control.

The criminal justice system often neglects victims, focusing primarily on the accused. Victims suffer physical, emotional, and financial consequences from crimes, but their needs are frequently overlooked.  

Recognizing this, the United Nations adopted principles ensuring victims' access to justice, restitution, compensation, and assistance. While some developed countries have implemented comprehensive victim support laws, India's approach is limited to compensation schemes and the Protection of Human Rights Act.  

Despite progress, a paradigm shift is needed to prioritize victims' rights within the criminal justice system. A more comprehensive approach encompassing relief, compensation, and rehabilitation should be mandated, ensuring victims receive the support they need and deserve.

The International Cricket Council is proposing a new fund to support Test cricket and player salaries. This initiative aims to address the financial disparities between top cricket nations (India, England, Australia) and the rest.  The fund, potentially worth millions of dollars, would provide a minimum income of $10,000 per Test for players in weaker cricketing nations and assist their boards.  

While details are yet to be finalized, the plan is motivated by concerns about the future of Test cricket, which is facing challenges from the rise of lucrative franchise leagues.  Support from India, a major stakeholder in international cricket, is crucial for the fund's success.  The initiative could help balance the scales in international cricket and ensure the long-term viability of Test matches.

The World Cricketers' Association (WCA) is reviewing the global cricket structure to address concerns about an overcrowded and disjointed calendar. While this is seen as a positive step, the WCA lacks influence over India, the most powerful entity in cricket due to its immense financial resources. 

India's BCCI dictates significant decisions, including the scheduling of international matches. The inclusion of a representative from the Indian broadcast giant, Disney Star, on the WCA review panel highlights India's dominant position.  The WCA aims to tackle issues like scheduling conflicts, financial disparities, and player contracts. However, the feasibility of these recommendations ultimately depends on India's willingness to accept them.  Players' associations, including the Indian Cricketers' Association (ICA),  have limited influence due to the BCCI's control.

The recent political turmoil in Bangladesh, where the Chief Justice and two other judges resigned under pressure from protesters, highlights the increasing politicization of judiciaries worldwide.  This trend is seen in democratic countries like the United States where judicial appointments align with political affiliations, leading to battles over control of the judiciary.  

The rise of populism has fueled the argument for legal control over politics, raising questions about the balance between popular will and the rule of law.  In India, debates rage about the Supreme Court's power to limit Parliament's ability to amend the Constitution and concerns exist about the judiciary's potential bias towards majoritarian politics and the executive. Ultimately, finding the right balance between an independent judiciary and its responsiveness to public opinion remains a complex and ongoing challenge for democracies.

### [Column | Feet of fortune](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/feet-of-fortune-devdutt-pattanaik-hindu-bhakti-traditions/article68515425.ece)

The practice of placing a crown with the deity's footprints on a devotee's head in South Indian Vishnu temples symbolizes the devotee's connection to the divine.  This act represents the inability of devotees to physically touch the deity within the sanctum sanctorum and highlights the connection between ritual and Hindu bhakti traditions.

Originally, bhakti meant participation in the divine life, contrasting with traditional Vedic practices.  Temples became vibrant centers of celebration, mirroring life itself, with deities engaging in daily rituals, festivals, and even "joy rides."  

Temple construction was fueled by village grants (deva bhoga), managed by Brahmins appointed by kings. However, this period also saw the rise of social stratification based on purity, exemplified by stories of devotees from marginalized professions being excluded from temple spaces. 

The placement of Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, at the deity's feet signifies how fortune serves contentment.  The ritual of the footprint crown underscores the importance of humility and  overcoming hierarchical thinking, emphasizing that contentment transcends boundaries and divisions.

The political turmoil in Bangladesh, with the potential rise of Islamist forces, is straining India-U.S. relations.  While India and the U.S. share concerns about China, differences on issues like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran have always existed. The U.S. support for the toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh, and its seeming tolerance of anti-India actors in the region, is a point of contention.

Within India, the BJP's Hindutva ideology and its stance on religious minorities is generating debate. There are arguments over the 'creamy layer' principle within SC/ST quotas and differing opinions within the BJP on accepting refugees from Bangladesh. Meanwhile, other states are grappling with issues of religious conversions, caste reservations, and domicile policies.

### [Unequal, and the more unequal](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-unequal-and-the-more-unequal/article68484692.ece)

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-categories among Scheduled Castes (SCs) for affirmative action. This decision aims to address the fact that there are varying levels of inequality within the SC community.  

The court noted that sub-categorization ensures substantive equality, as those who require more assistance and face greater disadvantages should have priority access to affirmative action programs. 

Bihar's attempt at sub-categorization through the 'Mahadalit' category, though politically influenced, illustrates the complexities of implementing such a system. 

While some advocate sub-categorization as a way to provide more targeted support to marginalized SC communities, others argue that it could exacerbate existing divisions and lead to a "race to the bottom" as different groups compete for preferential treatment.

Two BJP politicians have recently called for the creation of new administrative entities within West Bengal. Nishikant Dubey, an MP, suggested establishing a Union Territory encompassing parts of West Bengal and Bihar to address the issue of Bangladeshi immigrants.  Sukanta Majumdar, the BJP president in West Bengal, proposed including North Bengal in the developmental plans of the Northeast region. These proposals have sparked controversy, with the ruling Trinamool Congress accusing the BJP of attempting to divide West Bengal.

The BJP's strategy appears to be influenced by political considerations, particularly in Jharkhand, where Mr. Dubey's demand aligns with the party's focus on migrant voters.  This issue highlights broader concerns regarding demographic changes and the allocation of resources within India. It also raises questions about tensions between state and federal powers,  particularly concerning the taxation of mineral rights and the role of Governors in the approval process for state legislation.

The highly publicized, lavish wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant has concluded, leaving a sense of anticlimax and void.  The media frenzy surrounding the event, with its focus on the extravagance and celebrity guest list, provided a collective sense of entertainment and escapism for many.

Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand, was a thriving city for four centuries before being sacked by the Burmese in the 18th century. The city's legacy is intertwined with the Ramayana, a story that profoundly influenced Thai culture.  The Thai kings, seeing themselves as semi-divine figures,  modeled their rule after the mandala system, expanding their influence through trade and alliances.  Ayutthaya's wealth came from its strategic location at the confluence of three rivers, facilitating trade within Southeast Asia. The city's grand temples and palaces, adorned with depictions of the Ramayana, reflected the kings' aspiration to emulate the epic hero, Rama. The sacking of Ayutthaya by the Burmese mirrored the earlier destruction of their previous capital, Sukhothai, leading to a shift southward to a new city: Bangkok.

The term "woke" has undergone a rapid shift from a positive connotation of awareness to a derogatory term used for criticism.  Initially associated with inclusivity and respect for marginalized groups, it has been ridiculed by those on the political right, who view it as promoting minority over majority opinions. This linguistic transformation mirrors the broader trend of "cultural appropriation," where engagement with different cultures is perceived as theft. This trend towards possessiveness of identity raises concerns about artistic expression and the limitations it imposes on fiction and other genres. The evolving meaning of "woke" exemplifies how political ideologies can influence and distort language, leading to imprecision and division.

The rupee, believed to have originated under Sher Shah Suri, became a prominent currency in India. Akbar further solidified its position by establishing mints across his vast empire, ensuring consistent weight and purity.  By the 17th century, European East India Companies adopted the rupee for trade in India and beyond, making it a widely accepted currency in regions like Sri Lanka and Indonesia.  European colonial powers later introduced their currencies in colonies but the rupee remained prevalent in East Africa, even being used as legal tender in Arab sheikhdoms.  The Gulf countries used the Indian rupee until the 1960s when they adopted their own currencies. In a significant turn of events, India's UPI system is now gaining international traction, echoing the historical reach of the rupee.

Zoroastrian fire temples, known as agiaries, are found in western India and feature unique artwork inspired by ancient Mesopotamian creatures. These beings, representing the strength of bulls and eagles, symbolize the one true God. The Parsi community, who originated in Persia, arrived in India over a thousand years ago seeking refuge.  

They assimilated into Indian culture, but maintain distinct religious practices and endogamy.  Today, the Parsi community, both descendants of historical migrants and later Iranian immigrants, represent a bridge between the monotheistic traditions of West Asia and the polytheistic beliefs of South Asia. Despite shared ancestry with Hindus, their religious beliefs and practices remain separate.

Despite the US cricket team's historic win against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, America remains largely indifferent to the sport. Unlike the anticipated football revival after the 1950 US victory over England, the ICC's efforts to popularize cricket in the US haven't resonated with the general public. 

The article critiques the ICC's marketing strategies, suggesting they need to focus on grassroots development, improve commentary and presentation, and create a more American-friendly experience. It argues for better utilization of television,  emphasizing statistics, background information, and a shift from loud commentary to more engaging conversation.  The article concludes by highlighting the stark contrast between the societal impact of past US sporting victories and the current disconnect with cricket, urging the ICC to actively involve celebrities and leverage America's passion for sports to truly establish cricket's foothold in the country.

### [Improving the language of biodiversity conservation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/improving-the-language-of-biodiversity-conservation/article68245700.ece)

This article discusses the challenge of communicating the importance of biodiversity to the public and policymakers. 

While climate change has become a widely recognized issue, biodiversity, despite being essential to human well-being, remains abstract and poorly understood. The article argues that the focus on utilitarian benefits of biodiversity, such as ecosystem services and economic gains, fails to capture its full value. It suggests that incorporating concepts like Amartya Sen's "capabilities" can provide a richer understanding of how biodiversity contributes to people's freedom and opportunities to pursue a fulfilling life.

### [The national and the regional](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-newsletter-the-national-and-the-regional/article68243397.ece)

National parties in India, despite aiming for a national presence, often utilize regionalism in their campaigns. The Congress has leveraged Karnataka and Telangana identities, while Rahul Gandhi appealed to regional pride in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The BJP, in its attempt to challenge the BJD in Odisha, targeted the southern origins of Naveen Patnaik's aide, V.K. Pandian, with some anti-Tamil undertones, while simultaneously courting Tamil Nadu voters. The party, in contrast, has toned down its attacks on Bengali pride in West Bengal compared to the 2021 elections. This tactic of employing regionalism, sometimes targeting other regions and people, raises concerns about its impact on national unity.

The BJP's 2024 election campaign strategy is shifting, focusing on communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism. This approach, exemplified by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speeches, aims to mobilize Hindu subaltern communities against Muslims.  The BJP is targeting OBCs, tribal communities, and Dalits, potentially alienating upper caste and middle-class voters. 

Modi's rhetoric frames the Congress as anti-Constitution and alleges it seeks to undermine reservations for Hindu communities by granting them to Muslims. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray, meanwhile, portrays his party's Hindutva as inclusive, emphasizing skill and constitutional adherence.  The BJP's focus on these issues is generating regional tensions, with accusations of "Gujarat hegemony" and sensitivity to regional aspirations.

The article examines the accusations of divisiveness leveled by the BJP and the Congress against each other during Indian elections. The BJP claims the Congress, particularly Rahul Gandhi, is divisive by demanding a caste census and alleging threats to states' autonomy. The Congress, in turn, accuses the BJP of alienating Muslims and other religious minorities, discriminating against subaltern castes, and overstepping the rights of states. 

The BJP argues that it unifies Hindus, seeing Hindu unity as equivalent to national unity. This "unity" involves increased representation of subaltern castes but excludes religious minorities, especially Muslims.

The Congress faces the challenge of advocating for caste justice without alienating Hindu identity. Meanwhile, the BJP grapples with discontent from upper castes who feel marginalized by its focus on subaltern representation. The article also touches upon the contentious issue of defining a Hindu, citing historical examples and  Prime Minister Modi's recent attempt to link Hindu identity to vegetarianism.

Only two players from the team that defeated India in the first Test are part of the squad for the New Zealand series, signaling a decline in the importance of Test cricket.  This move raises concerns about the future of the format, with some observers suggesting it might be on the brink of extinction. 

The prioritization of lucrative T20 leagues over traditional Test matches is driven by financial motivations and the pursuit of greater individual wealth for players.  

This raises questions about the long-term sustainability of Test cricket and the role of major cricketing nations in preserving its legacy.  A potential solution lies in addressing financial imbalances, ensuring adequate remuneration for Test players, and finding a balance between franchise cricket and established formats. The fate of Test cricket might depend on the willingness of the governing bodies and stakeholders to prioritize its preservation over short-term financial gains.

### [Ind vs SA | Moving an event from the rare to the commonplace](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/moving-an-event-from-the-rare-to-the-commonplace/article67677982.ece)

India has struggled to win Test series in South Africa over the past three decades, despite having strong teams with legendary players.  While India has historically considered draws as acceptable results abroad, their current team, ranked No. 1, views them as defeats and aims for victories.  

A combination of factors has contributed to India's difficulties, including poor sessions of play, struggles against left-arm pace bowling, and challenges with defensive cricket and team balance.  Recent close encounters, like the 2022 series where they won the first Test but lost the second, highlight this persistent challenge. The upcoming two-Test series begins with significant importance, as the winner cannot be overtaken.  This series presents an opportunity for India to break their South African series win drought and achieve a milestone victory that would solidify their status as a dominant force in Test cricket.

### [Political Line | The point of the temple](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/recasting-the-caste-debate/article67672185.ece)

The inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, a site believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, marks the end of a century-long religious conflict.  However,  this event also raises questions about the ongoing nature of Indian national identity. Some see it as a finality, while others, like Rahul Gandhi, believe India is an ongoing conversation.  The BJP's approach, emphasizing a singular certitude,  contrasts with the federalist notion of a nation composed of diverse, autonomous religious communities espoused by Mahatma Gandhi. Despite the temple's inauguration,  religious disputes continue, exemplified by the situation in Mathura, where the birthplace of Lord Krishna is contested. Additionally,  politics influences religious matters, with Odisha's chief minister using the Jagannath Temple corridor project for political gain. This raises concerns about the blurring of lines between religion and political agendas.

Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja's attempt to wear shoes with the slogans "All lives are equal" and "Freedom is a human right" was met with opposition from the International Cricket Council (ICC), who deemed them political statements. Khawaja argues that these are humanitarian messages. The incident raises questions about a sportsman's responsibility towards global issues. While the ICC allows some messages, like "Black Lives Matter," drawing the line remains challenging. Increasingly, sportspersons are using their platform to address social and environmental concerns, prompting debate about their role in wider society. In contrast, Indian cricketers are often hesitant to voice their opinions on such matters, choosing to remain neutral.

When he criticizes her cooking, Phuphee challenges his opinion, highlighting how we often get caught up in the opinions of others and lose sight of our own. She argues that opinions, unlike butterflies, are like bees that carry weight and can influence our perceptions and actions, sometimes even causing harm. The author reflects on how we tend to live in reaction to others' opinions, leading to a feeling of being trapped. Phuphee's actions teach the author a valuable lesson: sometimes the only way out is to stop listening to external opinions and start speaking our own truth.

The ICC Cricket World Cup concluded with Australia's victory over India, shattering pre-tournament expectations. Despite India's dominance in world cricket and overwhelming support, the result underscored the unpredictability of sport. Australia embraced risk, executed well, and capitalized on India's faltering momentum. The tournament witnessed a strange atmosphere in the Indian crowd, marked by silence and a lack of engagement. While the Indian team, arguably the best in recent history,  performed magnificently, the loss exposed the danger of hubris and highlighted the cyclical nature of success in sport.

Early defeats in the World Cup can force teams to re-evaluate their strategies and identify weaknesses. Australia's initial losses have led to significant improvement, while England's struggles at the bottom of the table highlight the dangers of complacency.  

India's strong performance so far, with convincing victories, positions them as a top contender to potentially go undefeated in the tournament.  However, the team needs to learn from past successes and address potential complacency to avoid repeating England's mistakes.  

 Captains of other struggling teams are emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and learning from defeats, highlighting the need for introspection and growth.   Ultimately, learning from both victories and defeats is crucial for sustained success in cricket.

Phuphee, a respected figure in the community, allowed Masarat's mother to believe her daughter had died in a miscarriage. Phuphee's intention was to protect Masarat from her mother's hurtful comments that suggested her miscarried children lacked souls. Years later, the author, who had also experienced miscarriages, understands Phuphee's difficult decision and the weight it carries. The author acknowledges the inherent cruelty of the situation, but recognizes the sacrifice Phuphee made to shield Masarat from further emotional pain.

This article discusses the rise of populism and its impact on international relations. 

The author argues that populism has "democratized" diplomacy, giving the common person a voice in strategic affairs. However, this has led to increased public scrutiny and influence, creating challenges for elites and policymakers. 

The article highlights the contrasting approaches to foreign policy taken by populist movements in India and the West. While Indian populism promotes a strong military stance and assertive foreign policy, Western populism is largely against militarism and global interventionism.

Regardless of their specific stances, the author suggests that populist movements in both India and the West pose a challenge to traditional strategic thinking and present a new dynamic in global affairs.

India's performance in the Cricket World Cup has been impressive, but  their denial of visas to Pakistani fans has sparked criticism. Mickey Arthur, Pakistan's team director,  pointed out the lack of Pakistani supporters, highlighting the event's feeling of being a domestic BCCI affair rather than an ICC event. The article contrasts this with previous World Cups where Pakistani fans were welcomed,  emphasizing the role of fans in enhancing the sporting experience. 

The piece delves into the historical animosity between India and Pakistan, noting how political tensions often overshadow sporting events.  While acknowledging the financial and political benefits of India-Pakistan matches, the article criticizes the discriminatory visa policy, urging India to promote inclusivity, especially with an upcoming bid for the 2036 Olympics.

The article argues that the belief in a strong state as the solution to internal and external threats can be misleading. It points to the example of Israel's fortified borders and military strength proving insufficient against Hamas, and suggests that this approach can also stifle dissent and curtail civil liberties.

The article uses the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict to illustrate the limitations of "peace through strength" and emphasizes the need for inclusive solutions that address the root causes of conflict. It urges India, a diverse nation itself, to learn from these global challenges and avoid falling prey to simplistic solutions that prioritize state power over social and political inclusivity.

An FIR filed by Delhi police alleges a conspiracy by promoters and contributors of the left-leaning online platform NewsClick to create communal discord in India at the behest of China. This case echoes similar narratives by US media outlets about Russian and Chinese influence operations targeting the US. 

The article draws parallels between the Indian and American contexts, noting that while US media criticizes populism in the US as aligned with foreign influence, Indian media and state apparatus often portray populist criticism as influenced by Pakistan and China. Both situations, according to the article, demonize dissenting voices and stifle intellectual discourse under the guise of national security.

The author criticizes the use of "influence operation" as a vague term in investigative journalism, arguing that it is a slippery slope to criminalize thought based on alleged foreign connections.

The World Cup frequently serves as a farewell stage for veteran cricketers. Players often choose this global event to bid adieu to international cricket, pursuing other ventures like commentary, coaching, or administrative roles.  

Their departures evoke emotions of completion and a desire to explore new avenues. While some retirements are planned and celebrated with grand send-offs, others happen unexpectedly. The article highlights instances where players received fitting farewells, such as Sachin Tendulkar's 200th and final Test, and situations where retirements were less ceremonious or even tinged with disappointment, like Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman's farewells.  

Ultimately, the desire to leave on one's own terms often drives these decisions, with players aiming to step away gracefully after a long and illustrious career.

Vivek Shanbhag's "Ghachar Ghochar" is praised as a  fine example of the novella form, which, despite being concise and powerful, is often overlooked by publishers.  Writers like  Orwell, Hemingway and  Ian McEwan  have used the novella format successfully.  The novella requires distinct skills from longer novels or short stories, where what is left unsaid can be as important as what is written.  The novella has a long history, and introducing readers to great writers like Thomas Mann, Camus, and Joyce  through their novellas is a valuable way to engage with their work.  Even non-fiction can utilize the novella format, as evidenced by works such as "The Elements of Style" and "A Room of One's Own."

Cricket is facing numerous challenges, including a decline in Test cricket's popularity. The focus on lucrative franchise T20 leagues, driven by India's dominance in the sport, is changing the game's priorities. 

Countries like South Africa are prioritizing domestic T20 tournaments, often at the expense of Test match commitments. This creates a scenario where top players are unavailable for Test series, impacting the quality and competitiveness of the format. 

The future of cricket raises concerns about the potential for over-saturation of franchise leagues, diminishing fan interest, and the long-term sustainability of the sport's traditional formats.  Governing bodies face the challenge of balancing the financial allure of T20 cricket with the importance of nurturing grassroots development and preserving the integrity of all formats.

However, critics argue that such a move restricts democratic expression and overlooks the benefits of a diverse political system. They point out that frequent elections can hold governments accountable and that India's multi-party system reflects its diverse population. They also raise concerns about the proposed mechanism requiring a positive alternative government for a no-confidence motion to succeed, potentially tilting the system further in favor of the incumbent.  This debate highlights the complexities of balancing democratic principles with the pursuit of political stability and efficiency.

The author reflects on how Phuphee's acceptance of her mistakes fostered her courage and encouraged her to explore the world.

A U.S. judge ruled against blocking Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, stating that federal regulators failed to demonstrate a negative impact on the gaming industry. Microsoft had offered to make Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty accessible on various platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Nvidia's cloud gaming service, for at least ten years to address regulatory concerns. This ruling comes shortly before a $3 billion penalty for Microsoft if the deal did not proceed. 
  
The decision has faced criticism due to the judge's son's employment at Microsoft. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gained a more favorable perception compared to Elon Musk, partly due to Zuckerberg's more measured response to Musk's aggressive comments and threats during the launch of Meta's text-based app Threads. Threads garnered around 100 million sign-ups in its first week, highlighting a potential shift in user preference.

The article describes a gathering of women at the house of a woman named Phuphee. They come together unexpectedly, drawn by a shared sense of longing and a need for connection.  Phuphee provides them with food, tea, and head massages, creating a space for them to express their unspoken desires and sorrows. 

A woman named Aapa sings a poem about her deceased parents, lamenting the love she lost and the emptiness she feels. Others share their own longing – a newlywed yearning for affection from her husband, a young woman mourning an unrequited love. The gathering provides a safe haven for these women to release their bottled-up emotions.
 
Through these shared experiences, Phuphee emphasizes the importance of female solidarity and understanding. She believes that unspoken longings, if left unexpressed, can fester and cause pain, and that sharing and supporting each other is essential for healing.

### [Political Line | The stories that make a nation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/political-line-the-stories-that-make-a-nation/article66928253.ece)

The inauguration of India's new Parliament building was marked by political division, with opposition parties boycotting the ceremony. The installation of a sengol, a religious sceptre, sparked controversy, with critics arguing it symbolizes a shift towards religious nationalism.  

The BJP's reinterpretation of the sengol's history, framing it as a transfer of power from the British to the Congress, has been disputed.  The party's appropriation of a Saivite sect from Tamil Nadu is seen by some as an attempt to undermine Dravidian politics. 

Meanwhile, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma highlighted the state's transition from a mono-lingual to a multilingual society, while Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin defended the influx of migrant labourers into the state.  A mural in the new Parliament building depicting the Indian subcontinent has drawn criticism from Nepal.

### [In the era of unicorns, there are few takers for Sudha Murty’s brand of simplicity](https://www.thehindu.com/society/sudha-murty-simple-memes-and-jokes-the-kapil-sharma-show-india-aspirations/article66910610.ece)

Sudha Murty's recent anecdote sharing stories about her perceived "simplicity" sparked a social media debate. While she has long positioned herself as modest despite her wealth, the current generation finds little appeal in the concept.  

The article suggests that societal values have shifted since economic liberalization, with ostentatiousness no longer considered gauche. Today, wealth often translates to public display of luxury, leading to skepticism and suspicion towards narratives of simplicity, especially those perceived as PR-driven.  


 
Murty's story, like that of other celebrities who have been exposed for fabrication, faced intense scrutiny, highlighting a changed social landscape where transparency and authenticity are deeply questioned.

### [IPL to WTC | Fitness and adaptability are the keys; how about the Dhoni Cup?](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/fitness-and-adaptability-are-the-keys-how-about-the-dhoni-cup/article66913436.ece)

The World Test Championship final raises a debate about the impact of the IPL on Test cricket preparation. However, modern cricketers are highly adaptable and can switch between formats seamlessly. The trend of eliminating First Class matches before international series further supports this adaptability. 

Even bowlers, traditionally needing more time to adjust, demonstrate this ability. Examples like Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow show the IPL can be beneficial preparation for Test cricket. 

Ultimately, cricketers today, especially batsmen, are adept at switching gears and excel in different formats.

The article explores the contrasting approaches of Virat Kohli and Joe Root to T20 cricket. While Kohli has reinvented T20 in his image, playing his traditional game, Root is adapting to the format, expanding his shot selection.  The author questions whether there are different "levels" of cricket, likening  Root's T20 batting to classical music played at the wrong speed. 

The article  uses Sunil Gavaskar's example of adapting his traditional Test batting style to ODI cricket as a point of reference. It concludes by suggesting that Root, while striving to succeed in T20, might be sacrificing his natural elegance in the process.
