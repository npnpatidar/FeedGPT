The BJP is facing challenges in the 2024 general election campaign, with allegations against one of its allies, Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, for rape. The party is pivoting its campaign around communalism, casteism, and constitutionalism, targeting specific demographics like OBCs, tribals, and Dalits. This strategy, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to appeal to the subalterns, risking the alienation of upper-caste supporters. The BJP frames its communal and casteist campaign as constitutionalism, accusing the Congress of undermining the Constitution. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena presents a different interpretation of Hindutva, emphasizing governance based on the Constitution over religious dictates. Additionally, regional dynamics are at play, with accusations of BJP insensitivity towards states like Maharashtra and West Bengal. Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy criticizes what he terms "Gujarat hegemony," while the BJP accuses the Biju Janata Dal of disrespecting Odisha's sentiments. In Kerala, an "ex-Muslim" seeks recourse to be governed by secular laws, raising fundamental rights concerns.

The article is a poignant narrative set in Kashmir, revolving around the theme of longing and the shared experiences of women in a village. The narrator recounts a summer morning at her aunt's (Phuphee's) house, where she observes the unique tranquility of the place and the absence of mosquitoes, a mystery to her. The morning routine includes Phuphee's prayers and the preparation of tehar, a turmeric rice dish, which seems to be a prelude to an impromptu gathering of village women.

As the women arrive, they engage in a communal ritual of sharing kehwa (a traditional tea) and tehar while opening up about their personal longings and sorrows. The gathering becomes a safe space for expressing unspoken desires and emotional burdens, often through songs and poetry. One elderly woman, Aapa, shares her yearning for her deceased parents, while another laments the lack of affection from her husband. The women find solace in each other's company, understanding that unexpressed longings can fester into wounds hard to heal.

The narrator learns that these gatherings are not planned but occur spontaneously, with Phuphee always ready to host with food and warmth. The article concludes with Phuphee explaining the significance of these meetings as a form of healing and prayer, emphasizing the importance of sisterhood and the understanding that only women can offer each other in dealing with unexpressed longings.

### [Mirror, mirror, is that me?](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mirror-mirror-is-that-me/article66658610.ece)

The article discusses the concept of self-recognition, typically tested through the mirror test, which evaluates an individual's ability to recognize themselves in a mirror. This ability is not exclusive to humans; various animals, including monkeys, dolphins, and birds, have shown signs of self-recognition. Recent research from a Japanese laboratory focuses on the bluestreak cleaner wrasse fish, known for its mutualistic relationship with larger fish in tropical oceans. The study found that these fish display signs of self-recognition, passing the mirror test by showing aggression only towards images of strangers and recognizing marks painted on their bodies. The article ponders whether this ability in animals parallels human self-awareness, which typically develops around 18 months of age. It suggests that the ability to recognize oneself in a mirror may be a precursor to broader self-awareness, evidenced by children's ability to talk about themselves and recall events from memory around the same age.
