### [Three More Cheetah Cubs Born on Indian Soil](https://thewire.in/environment/three-more-cheetah-cubs-born-on-indian-soil)

#### Summary:

Three African cheetah cubs have been born in India as part of the ambitious Project Cheetah, which aims to reintroduce the species to select grassland habitats in the country. The cubs were born to a cheetah named Aasha, who was brought from Namibia in September 2022. This is the second litter of cheetah cubs to be born in India since the project began. The announcement was made by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on January 3, 2024. The previous litter of cheetah cubs born in March 2023 unfortunately had a high mortality rate, with three out of four cubs dying. The survival rate of cheetah cubs in Africa is generally low, with only one in ten cubs reaching adulthood under natural circumstances. The birth of the three new cubs is seen as a success for Project Cheetah and its goal of restoring ecological balance in India.

#### Details:

- On January 3, 2024, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav announced the birth of three African cheetah cubs in India.
- The cubs were born to a cheetah named Aasha, who was brought from Namibia in September 2022 as part of Project Cheetah.
- The cheetah was released into the wild in Kuno National Park on March 11, 2023, but was later recaptured and placed in an enclosure due to concerns about the health of the cheetahs.
- The birth of the three cubs is considered a success for Project Cheetah, which aims to reintroduce African cheetahs to select grassland habitats in India.
- In late March 2023, another litter of cheetah cubs was born in India, but unfortunately, three out of the four cubs died.
- The mortality rate of cheetah cubs in Africa is generally low, with only one in ten cubs reaching adulthood under natural circumstances.

#### Significance:

The birth of the three African cheetah cubs in India is a significant milestone for Project Cheetah and its efforts to reintroduce the species to the country. Despite the challenges and the previous high mortality rate of cheetah cubs, the successful birth of these cubs is seen as a step towards restoring the ecological balance and preserving the cheetah population in India. It highlights the ongoing efforts to protect and conserve endangered species and their habitats.

### [Six Key Developments After Hindenburg's Report in 2023: From Vinod Adani to Pegasus Targeting on Reporter](https://thewire.in/business/adani-hindenburg-case-vinod-adani-to-pegasus-targeting-on-reporter)

#### Summary of Significant Developments Since Hindenburg Research Report on Adani Group

Since the release of the Hindenburg Research report accusing the Adani Group of stock manipulation and accounting fraud on January 24, 2023, there have been several significant developments related to the case. Here is a summary of some of these developments:

1. **Supreme Court refuses to transfer investigation**: The Supreme Court of India refused to transfer the investigation of the Adani-Hindenburg case from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to a special investigation team (SIT). The court stated that SEBI had concluded its investigation in 22 out of the 24 cases related to the matter [[1]].

2. **SEBI amendments upheld**: The Supreme Court also held that there were no valid grounds to direct SEBI to revoke its amendments on foreign portfolio investors (FPI) and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) regulations. The court stated that the regulations do not suffer from any infirmities [[1]].

3. **Dismissal of reliance on third-party reports**: The apex court dismissed the reliance on the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) report, stating that reliance on a third-party organization report without any verification cannot be relied upon as proof. The court emphasized that reliance on newspaper reports and third-party organizations to question the statutory regulator does not inspire confidence [[1]].

4. **SEBI probe completion**: The Supreme Court asked SEBI to complete its probe into the pending two cases within three months. The court had initially ordered SEBI to submit its findings by August 14, 2023, and later extended the deadline to November 8, 2023 [[1]].

5. **Vinod Adani's role and undisclosed pledging of shares**: Vinod Adani, the elder brother of Gautam Adani, gained prominence following the release of the Hindenburg report. Forbes reported that Vinod Adani played a key role in expanding Adani Group firms, with an alleged web of companies in various offshore territories that have apparently not been disclosed to regulatory authorities. Forbes also highlighted Vinod Adani's alleged role in pledging Adani Group promoter stocks for a loan from Russia's VTB bank [[2]].

6. **SEBI hit 'opaque structure' wall**: An expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court concluded that SEBI hit an 'opaque structure wall' while investigating the Adani Group. The committee highlighted the lack of transparency in financial arrangements involving foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) located in offshore countries, making it difficult to ascertain the true ownership or control of funds [[3]].

7. **Deloitte's resignation and concerns over auditors**: Deloitte raised concerns over Adani Ports' transactions with three entities and resigned as the statutory auditors of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ). Deloitte's note mentioned the company's refusal to undergo an independent external examination due to SEBI's investigation into the allegations made by Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group [[4]].

8. **SEBI 'concealed' DRI letter**: A petitioner in the Supreme Court accused SEBI of "concealing" an alert it received from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in 2014 about stock market manipulation by the Adani Group. The petitioner claimed that the DRI had sent a letter to SEBI alerting about potential stock market manipulation by the Adani group of companies [[5]].

9. **Overpricing of coal imports**: Financial Times conducted an investigation and found that Adani, the country's largest private coal importer, had been inflating fuel costs, leading to overpayment by millions of Indian consumers and businesses for electricity [[6]].

10. **Pegasus spyware targeting journalists**: An investigation revealed that Pegasus spyware was used to compromise the mobile phones of two journalists in India, including Siddharth Varadarajan of The Wire, who was working on an Adani-related story. The spyware was allegedly used by an unknown government agency [[7]].

These are some of the significant developments since the release of the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani Group. The case has attracted attention from various stakeholders and has been subject to ongoing investigations and scrutiny.

### [SC Stays Centre's Orders on Ex-Post Facto Environmental Clearance for Mining Projects](https://thewire.in/law/sc-stays-centres-orders-on-ex-post-facto-environmental-clearance-for-mining-projects)

The Supreme Court of India has issued a stay on two Union government orders from July 2021 and January 2022. These orders granted ex-post facto clearance for mining projects without the prior environmental approval required under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2006. The stay was imposed in response to a plea filed by the NGO Vanashakti, and the court has issued a notice to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-moef-office-memorandum-ex-post-facto-environmental-clearance-9093005/).

Vanashakti's counsel argued that the EIA notification of 2006 mandates prior environmental clearance for all projects, and allowing ex-post facto clearance goes against the Environment Protection Act. The counsel also cited previous Supreme Court orders that emphasized the importance of balancing sustainable development and environmental protection, stating that prior approval is a "non-derogable" requirement under the law.

In summary, the Supreme Court has stayed the Union government orders that granted ex-post facto clearance for mining projects without prior environmental approval. This decision was made in response to a plea filed by the NGO Vanashakti, which argued that such clearance is against the Environment Protection Act and the EIA notification of 2006 [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-moef-office-memorandum-ex-post-facto-environmental-clearance-9093005/).

### [Indian Jurisprudence Seems to Be Bending to the Will of Hindutva Forces](https://thewire.in/law/indian-jurisprudence-seems-to-be-bending-to-the-will-of-hindutva-forces)

The article discusses the emergence of majoritarian jurisprudence in the Indian Supreme Court and its implications for India's future as a secular, democratic, and federal republic. It highlights two key judgments: the verdict upholding the abrogation of Article 370 and the Ayodhya judgment. The author argues that both judgments align with the ideological project of Hindu Rashtra (nation) and normalize the abnormal while providing judicial legitimacy to the idea of a Hindu Rashtra. The article raises concerns about the character and direction of Indian jurisprudence and questions the selective reading and illogical reasoning in these judgments. It also points out the similarities between the two judgments and suggests that they are not accidental or coincidental.

These issues, combined with the authoritarian political environment, create a volatile situation that could lead to political and economic crises. The author emphasizes the need for tough decisions and addressing vested interests to avoid further deterioration.

Moitra's request to attend Lok Sabha proceedings as an interim measure was not granted. Moitra was expelled after an ethics committee report accused her of unethical conduct over cash-for-query allegations. The investigation was initiated based on a complaint alleging that Moitra had accepted bribes from a Dubai-based businessman to ask questions in parliament. Moitra's counsel argued that it is standard practice for MPs to delegate work to secretaries and assistants when it comes to uploading questions. The court also asked if Moitra's counsel was accepting that a one-time password was shared with the businessman.

### [As Union Govt Yields to Nationwide Outcry, Here’s a Look at What New Hit-and-Run Law Says](https://thewire.in/government/as-union-govt-yields-to-nationwide-outcry-heres-a-look-at-what-new-hit-and-run-law-says)

#### Summary:

Truck and bus drivers in Madhya Pradesh, India, staged a protest against a hit-and-run provision in the new criminal law. The provision, part of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita 2023, imposes fines up to Rs 7 lakh and imprisonment up to 10 years for drivers found guilty in hit-and-run cases. The protest disrupted educational transportation, causing schools to declare impromptu holidays. It also affected the supply chains for goods, leading to fears of escalating vegetable prices and shortages of essentials. The strike spread to other states, with drivers from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Gujarat joining in. The provision in question, clause 106 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, has drawn criticism for its potential impact on the public. The government has assured truckers that the law will only be implemented after a discussion with the truckers' association [[1]](https://thewire.in/government/as-union-govt-yields-to-nationwide-outcry-heres-a-look-at-what-new-hit-and-run-law-says).

#### Details:

- The protest in Madhya Pradesh against the hit-and-run provision in the new criminal law caused disruptions in educational transportation, prompting some schools to declare impromptu holidays. Tensions escalated, leading to clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators in Khargone.
- The provision in question, clause 106 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita 2023, imposes fines up to Rs 7 lakh and imprisonment up to 10 years for drivers found guilty in hit-and-run cases. Detractors argue that this clause may not serve the public's best interests due to several reasons [[2]](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/truck-drivers-protest-against-new-hit-and-run-law-maharashtra-madhya-pradesh-rajasthan-gujarat-fuel-supply-concerns-news-340249).
- The strike had a significant impact on the supply chains for goods, affecting both rural areas and urban centers. Fears of escalating vegetable prices and shortages of essentials, including milk and groceries, prompted authorities to expedite the dispatch of petrol tankers to replenish gas stations as many petrol pumps across the state were running out of fuel.
- The protest spread to other states, with truck drivers from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Gujarat joining in. Private vehicles remained off the roads in Rajasthan for half a day, and truck drivers in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur resorted to burning tires on the roads in protest. Protests by drivers were evident in various districts of Bihar, including the capital city Patna. Truck drivers in Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh created traffic jams in solidarity. In Maharashtra, truck drivers staged "rasta roko" demonstrations at various locations, heightening concerns about potential fuel shortages [[2]](https://www.outlookindia.com/national/truck-drivers-protest-against-new-hit-and-run-law-maharashtra-madhya-pradesh-rajasthan-gujarat-fuel-supply-concerns-news-340249).
- The provision in question, clause 106 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, came under scrutiny as a majority of opposition MPs had vacated the Lok Sabha in a walkout. The ruling party swiftly pushed the Bill through with a voice vote, sidestepping any deliberation or discourse. Protests ensued, with MPs and activists calling for a thorough review of the Bill by a joint committee. However, the government at the time stood its ground and refused to budge.
- The government has reassured truckers and urged them to return to work. In a press release, the government stated that the decision to invoke Section 106 (2) of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita will be taken only after consultation with the All India Motor Transport Congress. The government also pointed out that the new laws and provisions have not yet come into force.

### [Central Railways PRO Transferred Without Notice After Releasing Costs of Modi Selfie Points](https://thewire.in/government/central-railways-pro-transferred-without-notice-after-releasing-costs-of-modi-selfie-points)

The Central Railways chief public relations officer, Shivraj Manaspure, was unexpectedly transferred on December 29, 2023, just seven months after his appointment. This move came shortly after he disclosed the costs associated with the installation of 3D Narendra Modi 'selfie points' at railway stations. Despite not being given a specific reason or information about his next posting, it is speculated that his transfer is linked to the release of these details.

The Central Railways, one of the 19 zones of Indian Railways, was the only zone to provide a response to Right to Information Act queries regarding the costs of these selfie booths. The response from the Central Railways revealed that they had installed around 20 permanent selfie booths at a cost of Rs 6.25 lakh each, totaling to Rs 1.25 crore. Additionally, there were 32 temporary selfie booths costing Rs 1.25 lakh each, amounting to a total of Rs 40 lakh.

Ajay Bose, a social activist based in Amravati, filed these queries with multiple railway zones, and it was only the Central Railways that provided the requested information. While the information was supplied by deputy GM Abhay Mishra, the sudden transfer of the chief public relations officer has raised questions.

Shivraj Manaspure has been replaced by Swapnil D. Nila, who declined to comment on the change. Other officials mentioned that the decision was made at a top-level.

It is notable that these Modi selfie points are not limited to railway stations alone; they are also being set up in universities, public areas, and other locations, indicating the government's utilization of taxpayer money for this purpose.

However, during his state visit to the United States in 2023, Modi answered two questions from journalists at the White House. This was a rare occurrence, as Modi typically avoids unscripted events and prefers speeches and his monthly radio show to communicate with the public. Dr. Manmohan Singh's press conference in 2014 was marked by his frank assessment of his government's achievements and failures, including the Congress party's lack of success in assembly polls and the manufacturing sector job market falling short of targets.

### ['Lack of Adequate Actionable Intelligence' Behind Rise in Attacks on Security Forces in J&K: Report](https://thewire.in/security/lack-of-adequate-actionable-intelligence-behind-rise-in-attacks-on-security-forces-in-jk-report)

#### Summary:

The region south of Pir Panjal in Jammu and Kashmir has experienced an increase in terror attacks over the past two years. Security officials attribute this rise to a lack of actionable intelligence on terrorist infiltration, a decrease in security forces, and an influx of narcotics. The recent attack in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed, has prompted officials to reassess troop deployment and review counter-insurgency operations in the region. The ability of terrorists to remain undetected indicates a lack of intelligence about their presence and movements. As a result, officials are considering adjustments to the existing counter-insurgency strategy to stay ahead of the terrorists..

#### Increased Terror Attacks in South of Pir Panjal:

The region south of Pir Panjal in Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed a rise in high-intensity attacks on security forces over the past two years. While the number of attacks is fewer than those in the Valley, the trend is concerning. These attacks have resulted in the deaths of soldiers, with the perpetrators often managing to escape. The most recent attack in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed, has led to a shakeup in the local command structure. Three security officers have been removed from their positions, and an investigation has been initiated to determine what went wrong. The sustained presence of terrorists in the region indicates their ability to evade capture and suggests the possibility of internal support or intelligence gathering on military movements. The lack of actionable intelligence about their presence and activities is a cause for concern.

#### Factors Contributing to the Rise in Attacks:

Top officials in the government attribute the increase in attacks to several factors. Firstly, there is a lack of adequate actionable intelligence on the infiltration of terrorists and their sustenance. This indicates a failure to detect their presence, infiltration, and replenishment in the region. Secondly, there has been a thinning of security forces in the hinterland, which may have created a security gap. Lastly, there is an increasing influx of narcotics, which may be linked to the rise in terrorist activities. These factors combined have prompted security officials to reassess troop deployment and review the existing framework for counter-insurgency operations in the region.

#### Adjustments to Counter-Insurgency Strategy:

The rise in attacks has necessitated adjustments to the existing counter-insurgency strategy. Officials recognize the need for constant evolution of tactics and operational methodology to stay ahead of the terrorists. Counter-terrorism efforts require proactive measures to counter the advantage of surprise that terrorists often possess. By reassessing troop deployment and reviewing the existing framework, officials aim to enhance their ability to detect and respond to terrorist activities effectively.

In conclusion, the region south of Pir Panjal in Jammu and Kashmir has experienced an increase in terror attacks over the past two years. The rise in attacks is attributed to a lack of actionable intelligence, a decrease in security forces, and an influx of narcotics. The recent attack in Poonch has prompted officials to reassess troop deployment and review counter-insurgency operations. Adjustments to the existing strategy are being considered to enhance the ability to detect and respond to terrorist activities effectively

### [No Ground to Transfer Adani-Hindenburg Probe, SEBI Should Complete Probe in 3 Months: Supreme Court](https://thewire.in/law/supreme-court-adani-group-hindenburg)

The Supreme Court of India, in a recent ruling, stated that it has limited jurisdiction over the regulatory domain of the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The court emphasized that SEBI should be allowed to conclude its probe into the allegations against the Adani group, as promised.

The court rejected the transfer of the probe from SEBI to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and also dismissed the request to revoke SEBI's regulations. It noted that SEBI has already completed investigations in 20 out of 22 cases and directed SEBI to complete the remaining two cases within three months.

The court also mentioned the investigation conducted by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) after the release of the Hindenburg Research report. It rejected reliance on newspaper reports and third-party organizations to question the statutory regulator, stating that they can be treated as inputs but not conclusive evidence to doubt SEBI's probe.

The court dismissed the claim made by the petitioners regarding a conflict of interest in the court-appointed expert committee, calling it "unsubstantiated." It directed the Government of India and SEBI to consider the committee's recommendations to strengthen the interests of Indian investors.

Additionally, the court asked SEBI to investigate whether there had been a significant loss to Indian investors in Adani companies due to the Hindenburg report and to take suitable action if any infraction of the law is found.

The bench, consisting of Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, was hearing a batch of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) seeking a court-monitored probe into the allegations against the Adani group raised by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research.

The Hindenburg Research report, published in January last year, accused the Adani group of "brazen stock manipulation" and an "accounting fraud scheme." Several investigations, including those by OCCRP and Financial Times, have highlighted alleged malpractices by the Adani group, particularly in its use of offshore havens.

The Supreme Court had earlier constituted a committee headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice A. M. Sapre to look into whether a regulatory failure had led to investors losing money. The committee submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court on May 8, 2023. The court rejected the petitioner's request to reconstitute the committee based on alleged conflicts of interest.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India has upheld SEBI's jurisdiction in the Adani probe and directed SEBI to complete its investigation. The court rejected the transfer of the probe to an SIT and dismissed claims of a conflict of interest in the expert committee. It also emphasized the need for substantiated claims in public interest litigations

### [Rules Under CAA Now Ready, Likely to Be Notified Before 2024 Elections: Reports](https://thewire.in/government/rules-under-caa-now-ready-likely-to-be-notified-before-2024-elections-reports)

#### Summary of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was passed in December 2019, but has been non-functional for the last four years as the Ministry of Home Affairs sought repeated extensions to frame the rules under it. However, reports now indicate that the rules under the CAA are ready and will be notified before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Act aims to provide citizenship to Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and Christians fleeing persecution from India’s Muslim-majority neighbors, namely, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. Notably, the absence of Muslims from the provisions of the legislation, irrespective of whether or not they are being persecuted in their countries, has drawn widespread protests from citizens across the country. Despite the protests and violence that ensued, the government notified the law in January 2020, but the rules have remained unwritten until now, four years later. The rules are now ready, and an online portal to apply for citizenship under the CAA is also in place. The deadline put in place in the original Act, which was limited to those who had come to India before December 31, 2014, is likely to be extended. The Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have promised that the Act will soon be functioning, and a bunch of petitions challenging the legal validity of the CAA are pending before the Supreme Court. The Union government has defended the law and called it a "benign piece of legislation" [[1]](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/title-ii-2010-regulations/).

#### Controversy Surrounding the CAA
The CAA has drawn heavy criticism for ostensibly singling out Muslims and excluding them from its purview. The unconstitutional nature of the legislation when coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) has sparked widespread protests from thousands of citizens across the country. The Act has been the subject of petitions challenging its legal validity, with the Union government defending the law and calling it a "benign piece of legislation" [[1]](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/title-ii-2010-regulations/).

#### Recent Developments
Recent reports suggest that the rules under the CAA are now ready and will be notified before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. An online portal to apply for citizenship under the CAA is also in place, and the deadline for those eligible to apply is likely to be extended. The Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have reiterated their commitment to implementing the Act, and a bunch of petitions challenging its legal validity are pending before the Supreme Court [[1]](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/title-ii-2010-regulations/).

In conclusion, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which has been non-functional for the last four years, is now set to be implemented before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Despite the controversy and legal challenges, the government is moving forward with the implementation of the Act [[1]](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/title-ii-2010-regulations/).

### [Chart: 2023 Expected to Be Hottest Year on Record](https://thewire.in/environment/chart-2023-expected-to-be-hottest-year-on-record)

According to data, the months from June to November 2023 have been the hottest on record since 1850. In fact, July 2023 was the hottest month of all. With December data still pending, 2023 has already been confirmed as the hottest year globally. NASA, NOAA, and Copernicus Climate Change Service will soon announce the official confirmation. For instance, September 2023 was 1.43°C (2.57°F) hotter than the average temperature of the 20th century, surpassing September 2020, which was only 0.98°C (1.76°F) hotter. Additionally, 2023 witnessed the second-hottest March and the third-hottest May ever recorded. The years between 2014 and 2023 have been the ten warmest on record, with 2016 being the warmest due to the influence of a strong El Niño event. However, both 2016 and 2020 will now be surpassed by 2023. Scientists have attributed the increase in extreme weather events to climate change, as the higher concentration of CO₂ and other climate gases in the atmosphere has led to rising global temperatures.

### [Looking Beyond Politics, Constitution and Law: How the People of J&K Feel About SC’s Decision](https://thewire.in/rights/looking-beyond-politics-constitution-and-law-how-the-people-of-jk-feel-about-scs-decision)

The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the abrogation of Article 370 has been praised by people in mainland India. However, little attention has been given to the opinions of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In an article, a doctor who has treated the people of Jammu and Kashmir for several decades shares their views on the matter.

After the conditional accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India in 1947, the people of Kashmir were generally content. They had access to basic necessities such as housing, clothing, and food, thanks to land reforms implemented by the first Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah. The valley of Kashmir, the most well-known part of Jammu and Kashmir, is predominantly inhabited by an Indo-Aryan ethnolinguistic group that speaks the Kashmiri language. Over the centuries, the region's predominant religion has shifted from Buddhism to Shaivism and eventually Islam.

Prior to the unfortunate exodus of some 100,000 Kashmiri Pandits in 1990, there was harmony between the Muslim majority and the minority Kashmiri Pandits. Other religions, such as Sikhism and Christianity, make up a small percentage of the population. The people of Jammu and Kashmir had their elected representatives and political spaces to express their collective feelings. Importantly, the Kashmiri identity remained intact and held great significance to the people.

However, in August 2019, the special status of Kashmir was revoked, leading to a series of restrictive measures imposed by the central government. Communication channels were severed, people were confined to their homes, and thousands of Kashmiris were arrested and detained. Political leaders were placed under house arrest, and all political activities were banned. This imposed hardship on the residents of the city, towns, and villages, including limited access to medical care. The administration was also replaced by bureaucrats from outside the valley, who often lacked understanding of the locals' needs.

Despite claims of development and progress, the common Kashmiri has not seen significant improvements in their daily lives. While some cosmetic changes have been made to certain areas, such as improved roads and illuminated landmarks, the majority of people still face issues such as electricity shortages and limited job opportunities. Many educated youth are reluctant to leave the region due to concerns about the treatment of Muslims in other parts of India.

The article raises important questions about the lack of restoration of statehood and the absence of free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir. The author, who has witnessed the situation firsthand, emphasizes the misery faced by the people during the harsh winter, including prolonged power outages and freezing temperatures. Despite the advancements made by the Mughals over 500 years ago, the common Kashmiri still relies on traditional clothing and earthen heat pots to keep warm.

In conclusion, the article highlights the perspectives of the people of Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370. It raises concerns about the lack of attention given to their opinions and the challenges they continue to face.

Gandhi also highlights the pejorative use of the word 'secular' by those in power. She endorses Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation of secularism, which emphasizes the equality of all religions. According to her, the guiding principle of Indian secularism is to promote harmony and prosperity between diverse groups in society. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the deep meaning behind concepts like secularism and democracy to help Indians understand the past and prepare for future challenges [[1]](https://thewire.in/politics/those-in-power-today-use-secular-as-a-pejorative-term-sonia-gandhi).

Furthermore, Gandhi raises questions about majoritarian interpretations of democracy. She questions whether a majority should always have the final say and what happens if the core interests of a small group are hurt. She also asks whether an enduring but slim majority should have the right to govern unchallenged. Gandhi believes that peace and harmony in society are not helped if people feel that their language, religious practice, or way of life could be permanently threatened due to their numerical minority.

It is worth noting that some political scientists and commentators have suggested that India is experiencing democratic backsliding under the current government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The V-Dem research institute categorized India as an "electoral autocracy" in 2021, citing a deterioration in the freedom of the media, academia, and civil society. Others have also cited the marginalization of Muslims in India since 2014. However, the BJP and Modi deny allegations of discrimination against religious minorities in India [[1]](https://thewire.in/politics/those-in-power-today-use-secular-as-a-pejorative-term-sonia-gandhi).

In conclusion, Sonia Gandhi's article in the Manorama Yearbook 2024 criticizes the current government's commitment to democracy, questions majoritarian interpretations of the concept, and emphasizes the importance of promoting harmony and prosperity between diverse groups in society. She calls for a clear understanding of concepts like secularism and democracy to help Indians understand the past and prepare for future challenges [[1]](https://thewire.in/politics/those-in-power-today-use-secular-as-a-pejorative-term-sonia-gandhi) [[5]](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/secularism-has-become-pejorative-for-those-now-in-power-sonia-gandhi-11986881.html)

### [MGNREGA: After Pushback on Aadhaar-Based Pay, Govt Defensive, Says May Consider Exemptions Case-by-Case](https://thewire.in/labour/union-government-may-consider-case-by-case-exemptions-to-abps-mgnregs)

#### Summary of the Article on Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS) for MGNREGA

The Union government's implementation of the Aadhaar-based payment system (ABPS) for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has faced criticism from the Congress, which condemned it as a 'cruel new year's gift' and accused the government of 'weaponising technology to deny the most vulnerable Indians their social welfare benefits'.

The ABPS, which was made mandatory on January 30, 2023, requires a worker's bank account and job card to be linked with Aadhaar, and the account must also be connected to the National Payments Corporation of India's 'mapper' [[1]](https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2023/04/17/169/63/CREC-2023-04-17.pdf).

According to data provided by LibTech India, 7.6 crore job cards have been deleted from the system over the last 21 months, leading to concerns about the impact on vulnerable individuals.

In response to the backlash, the Union rural development ministry stated that exemptions from the ABPS for MGNREGA wages may be considered on a "case to case basis" in instances where there are technical or Aadhaar-related problems at the gram panchayat level.

The ministry also refuted claims of data being deleted due to the ABPS and emphasized the use of technology to bring transformation in the implementation of the MGNREGA scheme [[1]](https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2023/04/17/169/63/CREC-2023-04-17.pdf).

The Congress urged the government to stop weaponising technology, release delayed wage payments, and implement open muster rolls and social audits to improve transparency.

Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding the implementation of the Aadhaar-based payment system for MGNREGA and the concerns raised by the opposition regarding its impact on vulnerable individuals and the need for transparency in the welfare benefit system [[1]](https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2023/04/17/169/63/CREC-2023-04-17.pdf).

#### Summary of the Article: Supreme Court Directs Bihar Government to Make Caste Survey Data Public

The Supreme Court of India has directed the Bihar government to make the break-up of its caste survey data available in the public domain to enable those aggrieved to challenge the findings. However, the court declined the petitioners' plea for interim relief, as the government had a high court order in their favor. The survey and Patna high court order that upheld the Bihar government's move to conduct such an exercise were challenged by the petitioners. The court emphasized the importance of the data being in the public domain so that anyone can challenge the inference drawn from it. The matter has been posted for further hearing on February 5, and the Bihar government's lawyer has submitted that the data, including the break-up, is available in the public domain and can be accessed on the designated website. The caste survey revealed that the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) constituted a significant portion of the state's population, and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the government of irregularities in conducting the survey and labeled the collected data as "fake" [[1]](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/opinions.aspx).

### [Meitei Muslims Urge Police to Hasten Arrest of Armed Miscreants Behind New Year's Day Killings](https://thewire.in/communalism/meitei-pangals-urge-arrest-of-new-years-day)

#### Summary of the Article:
Four members of the Meitei Pangal community, a subgroup of the Meitei people in Manipur, were allegedly killed on January 1, with 14 others injured. The incident occurred when individuals in police uniforms entered a Pangal house, looting cash and gold before firing at the residents. The injured are currently receiving treatment in a hospital in Imphal. In response to the incident, a group of Meitei Pangals passed a resolution urging the government to arrest the culprits within 48 hours and requested the case to be handed over to the National Investigation Agency. A joint action committee has also been formed to assist the victims, with Maulana Habibullah Sheikh appointed as the committee's head. The Meitei Pangals have historically acted as a link between the Meitei and Kuki communities, who have been involved in ethnic violence in Manipur. The situation in Moreh, a town at Manipur's border with Myanmar, has also been deteriorating since December 30. Maulana Mahmood Asa'd Madani, president of the Jamat Ulama-i-Hind, has written a letter urging decisive action against the perpetrators and calling for a high-level judicial inquiry into the incident.

#### Summary:

Activists fighting for Adivasi rights in Chhattisgarh are concerned that the state's first tribal chief minister, Vishnu Deo Sai, is prioritizing corporate interests over the community's priorities. The felling of trees in the Hasdeo Arand forest for coal mines has begun despite protests from the Adivasi community and activists. The Adani Group has been excavating coal from the Parsa East and Kanta Basan (PEKB) mine since 2013. Adivasi activists have been detained by the police, and there are allegations of fake consent being obtained for deforestation activities. Both the BJP and the Congress have been accused of neglecting Adivasi rights and facilitating deforestation for corporate interests. The BJP's victory in the state elections was fueled by Adivasi anger against the Congress government. The dilution of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act and inaction on judicial inquiry reports regarding fake encounters have also contributed to Adivasi dissatisfaction. The true test for the tribal chief minister will be how he handles these issues and whether he can make a difference in the lives of the Adivasis.

### [Warli Tribe in Suburban Mumbai Fear Displacement Due to Shivaji Museum: Report](https://thewire.in/rights/warli-tribe-in-suburban-mumbai-fear-displacement-due-to-shivaji-museum-report)

#### Summary:

The Maharashtra Department of Tourism announced the construction of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj War Art Museum in Gorai, Mumbai. The museum is planned to be built across 136 acres of land, with a budget of Rs 50 crore allocated for the project. However, members of the Warli tribal community in Gorai village are concerned about the project as it may involve the destruction of their homes. The community claims that the land set aside for the museum has been with them for generations and they are dependent on it. They are reportedly in the process of filing a petition in the Bombay High Court against the takeover of their land. The Maharashtra government has assured that if tribal communities are practicing agriculture on sanctioned land, they will not be displaced or affected by such projects and will be rehabilitated safely if necessary [[1]](https://curlytales.com/chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-war-museum-to-be-made-in-gorai-136-acres-land-%E2%82%B950-crores-alotted/).

#### Details:

The Maharashtra Department of Tourism announced the construction of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj War Art Museum in Gorai, Mumbai, across 136 acres of land. The project was announced in June of the previous year, with a budget of Rs 50 crore allocated for its construction [[1]](https://curlytales.com/chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-war-museum-to-be-made-in-gorai-136-acres-land-%E2%82%B950-crores-alotted/) [[2]](https://thewire.in/rights/warli-tribe-in-suburban-mumbai-fear-displacement-due-to-shivaji-museum-report).

However, members of the Warli tribal community in Gorai village are worried about the project as it may involve the destruction of their homes. The boundary wall of the museum has already been constructed, leading to the demolition of some homes. The community claims that the land set aside for the project has been with them for generations and they are dependent on it. They have no objection to the museum but do not want it to be built on their land [[2]](https://thewire.in/rights/warli-tribe-in-suburban-mumbai-fear-displacement-due-to-shivaji-museum-report).

The community is reportedly in the process of filing a petition in the Bombay High Court against the takeover of their land. In 2011, the same court had rejected the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation's tourism proposal to construct hotels and resorts in and around Gorai and Manori villages due to the ecological sensitivity of these areas [[2]](https://thewire.in/rights/warli-tribe-in-suburban-mumbai-fear-displacement-due-to-shivaji-museum-report).

Rajendra Bhosale, the collector of Mumbai Suburban, has stated that if tribal communities are practicing agriculture on sanctioned land, they will not be displaced or affected by such projects. He assured that even if a particular place is affected, the affected communities will be rehabilitated safely.

The Maharashtra government had previously stated that "encroachments" on government land were being removed for the museum project. The museum aims to display the war skills and armor of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to allow future generations to experience the glorious history of Chhatrapati Shivaji and take inspiration from it [[2]](https://thewire.in/rights/warli-tribe-in-suburban-mumbai-fear-displacement-due-to-shivaji-museum-report).

#### Conclusion:

The construction of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj War Art Museum in Gorai, Mumbai, has raised concerns among the Warli tribal community due to the potential destruction of their homes. The community is in the process of filing a petition against the takeover of their land, while the Maharashtra government has assured that tribal communities practicing agriculture on sanctioned land will not be displaced and will be rehabilitated if necessary [[1]](https://curlytales.com/chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-war-museum-to-be-made-in-gorai-136-acres-land-%E2%82%B950-crores-alotted/)

### [Liberation From Psychic Violence: Understanding the Psychological Dimension of Domination](https://thewire.in/rights/liberation-from-psychic-violence-understanding-the-psychological-dimension-of-domination)

The article explores the concept of psychic violence and its impact on both the oppressor and the oppressed. It discusses how psychic violence differs from socioeconomic and political violence, as it embeds itself in the soul and dehumanizes both parties involved. The author references Frantz Fanon's book "Black Skin, White Masks" and his aim to liberate the black man from himself, which also extends to the liberation of the white man. The article highlights the psychological dimension of colonial power and domination, emphasizing the internalization of violence by the colonized. It also discusses the connection between psychic violence and epistemic violence, which occurs when knowledge is organized in a way that silences or obliterates targeted groups. The author argues that psychic violence is more insidious and difficult to escape than socioeconomic or political violence. The article explores various examples, including the discourse of development in post-independence India and the epistemic violence of caste. It also examines Hindutva as an example of the complex forms that epistemic violence can take. The author suggests that liberation from psychic violence requires a transcendence obsessed with love and understanding, as well as a rejection of reified forms of modernity. The article concludes by emphasizing the need to resist sociopolitical forms of psychic violence and explore alternative ways of thinking.

### ['Have to Trust Decision Makers': CJI on Case Allocations, Article 370, Other Judgments](https://thewire.in/law/cji-dy-chandrachud-article-370-supreme-court-ram-janmabhoomi)

Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud recently addressed allegations and criticisms against the Supreme Court's functioning and judgments in an interview with the news agency Press Trust of India. He responded to criticisms regarding the verdict on Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the same-sex marriage verdict, the allocation of cases, and the Ayodhya verdict.

#### Verdict on Article 370
The CJI, who headed the five-judge bench, stated that he would not respond to the criticism or defend his judgment. He emphasized that the judgment speaks for itself and is public property once delivered. He acknowledged that people have the right to exercise their freedom of speech and expression to critique or appreciate the judgment [[1]](https://main.sci.gov.in/pdf/LU/article_370.pdf).

#### Same-Sex Marriage Verdict
Regarding the judgment on same-sex marriage, the CJI stated that he has no regrets and that judges do not associate themselves with a cause. The bench refused to legally recognize same-sex marriage. However, in a minority view, the CJI and retired Justice S.K. Kaul recognized the right of same-sex couples to enter into marriages. The CJI explained that judges are trained to distance themselves from the outcome once they deliver a judgment, as outcomes are not personal to a judge.

#### Allocation of Cases and Lawyers
The CJI addressed the allegation that important matters are often reassigned to separate judges who had not previously heard a part of the case. He emphasized that the allocation of cases in the Supreme Court should not be lawyer-driven but should follow the terms of the system laid down in the Supreme Court. He stated that decision-makers should be trusted, and no lawyer can insist that their case be heard by a particular judge, as it would undermine the credibility of the judge and the administration of justice [[1]](https://main.sci.gov.in/pdf/LU/article_370.pdf).

#### Ayodhya Verdict
Regarding the Ayodhya verdict, the CJI explained that the five judges who ruled in favor of the construction of a Ram temple unanimously decided that there would be no authorship ascribed to the judgment. He emphasized that the judgment was that of the court, not any individual, and it was a case of long conflict and diverse viewpoints [[1]](https://main.sci.gov.in/pdf/LU/article_370.pdf).

In summary, Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud addressed criticisms against the Supreme Court's functioning and judgments, emphasizing the independence of judges, the public nature of judgments, and the need for trust in decision-makers. He also highlighted the importance of distancing oneself from the outcome of a judgment and the non-association of judges with causes.

### [The Context Behind Rajnath Singh's Promise for 'Justice' for Civilians Killed in Army Custody](https://thewire.in/security/the-context-behind-rajnath-singhs-promise-for-justice-for-civilians-killed-in-army-custody)

The article discusses the issue of justice for victims of alleged human rights violations by the Indian army in Kashmir. It highlights the role of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which grants immunity to armed forces in "disturbed areas" of India. The article mentions that the government has rarely granted permission to prosecute soldiers accused of crimes under AFSPA, despite numerous requests from the Jammu and Kashmir government. It also mentions the existence of a parallel justice system within the army called the court martial, which is criticized for its lack of transparency. The article provides examples of cases where soldiers accused of crimes against civilians were acquitted or had charges dismissed. The author raises concerns about the lack of accountability and calls for a fair assessment of the situation in Kashmir.

#### Lack of Justice for Victims of Human Rights Violations in Kashmir

The article raises concerns about the lack of justice for victims of alleged human rights violations by the Indian army in Kashmir. It mentions that the government has rarely granted permission to prosecute soldiers accused of crimes under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) [[7]]. The AFSPA grants immunity to armed forces in "disturbed areas" of India, and its key provision empowers individuals belonging to the police and the military to use force, including causing death, for the maintenance of public order [[6]]. The article highlights that since 1990, no sanction has ever been given to prosecute those accused by the Kashmir government of crimes [[8]].

#### The Role of Court Martial and Lack of Transparency

The article discusses the existence of a parallel justice system within the army called the court martial. It criticizes the lack of transparency in these processes, where survivors or victims do not have access [[9]]. The court martial is primarily used for military discipline-related crimes, but it has also been allowed to handle cases of soldiers accused of crimes against civilians [[9]].

#### Examples of Lack of Accountability

The article provides examples of cases where soldiers accused of crimes against civilians were acquitted or had charges dismissed. In one case, soldiers from the 7 Rashtriya Rifles unit were accused of "cold-blooded murder" of five civilians in Pathribal. The Indian Army blocked their prosecution under the AFSPA, and the charges were dismissed through a pre-trial procedure known as summary of evidence [[10]]. In another case, soldiers were convicted of murdering three civilians but were freed by an army tribunal without explanation [[11]]. The article also mentions a recent incident in Nagaland where soldiers shot and killed six coal miners, leading to violent clashes between villagers and troops. The government denied permission to pursue the prosecution in this case as well [[12]].

#### Conclusion

The article raises concerns about the lack of justice and accountability for victims of alleged human rights violations by the Indian army in Kashmir. It highlights the role of the AFSPA in granting immunity to armed forces and the limited permission granted for prosecuting soldiers accused of crimes. The existence of a parallel justice system within the army, the court martial, is criticized for its lack of transparency. The article calls for a fair assessment of the situation in Kashmir and emphasizes the need for justice for those wronged by the army [[5]].

### [‘Gujjar-Bakharwals Army's Eyes and Ears in J&K, Need to Rebuild Old Ties’: Lt Gen. Hooda](https://thewire.in/security/gujjar-bakharwal-jammu-kashmir-army-general-hooda)

#### Summary:

Retired Lieutenant General Deependra Singh Hooda has emphasized the need for the Indian Army to rebuild its relationship with the Gujjars-Bakharwal community in Jammu and Kashmir. He stated that the Gujjars-Bakharwals, who are nomads, have traditionally supported the Indian Army and played a significant role in rolling back insurgency in the region. However, a disconnect seems to have developed between the community and the Army, resulting in a lack of ground intelligence on infiltration of foreign terrorists. Hooda also highlighted the importance of reviewing the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on counterinsurgency operations and strengthening ground intelligence in the Poonch and Rajouri areas. The recent spike in militant activity in Jammu and Kashmir, along with the death of three civilians allegedly after torture in Army custody, has further underscored the need to rebuild trust and improve relations with the Gujjars-Bakharwals.

#### Importance of Gujjars-Bakharwals in Countering Insurgency:

The Gujjars-Bakharwals, who are nomadic communities, have traditionally supported the Indian Army and played a crucial role in countering insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. They move along with their herds of sheep between the Kashmir Valley and Poonch, Rajouri in the Pir Panjal belt, and possess valuable information. Their support has been one of the major reasons behind the roll back of insurgency in the region. For instance, Rukhsana Kausar KC, a young Gujjar woman, shot down a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant in Rajouri district in 2009.

#### Disconnect between Gujjars-Bakharwals and the Army:

According to retired Lieutenant General Deependra Singh Hooda, a disconnect has developed between the Gujjars-Bakharwals and the Indian Army, leading to a lack of ground intelligence on the infiltration of foreign terrorists. This disconnect has resulted in a decline in the local connect and the flow of information between the community and the Army. Hooda highlighted the need to rebuild the old connection with the Gujjars-Bakharwals to strengthen ground intelligence and counter insurgency effectively.

#### Reviewing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):

Hooda emphasized the importance of reviewing the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on counterinsurgency operations in the Poonch and Rajouri areas. He suggested that in addition to revamping ground intelligence and investing in sources and assets that provide actionable intelligence, the Army should also review the SOPs on the movement of troops. This includes considering the deployment of additional troops in the region and using better-protected bullet-proof vehicles.

#### Recent Incidents and the Need for Rebuilding Trust:

The recent spike in militant activity in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the Jammu region, has raised concerns. The death of four soldiers and injuries to three others in an ambush by terrorists in the Surankote area of Poonch led to the arrest of three people from the Gujjar community. Unfortunately, these individuals died in Army custody, leading to anger within the community. A video clip showing uniformed soldiers from 48 Rashtriya Rifles torturing the men also surfaced on social media. In response, the Army removed the brigade commander and three other officers of 13 Rashtriya Rifles. The Jammu and Kashmir police registered an FIR against unknown persons for murder. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, accompanied by Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha and Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Pande, visited the Poonch sector to review the situation and met with the families of the deceased civilians, assuring them of speedy justice. These incidents highlight the urgent need to rebuild trust and improve relations with the Gujjars-Bakharwals.

#### Conclusion:

Retired Lieutenant General Deependra Singh Hooda has stressed the importance of rebuilding the relationship between the Indian Army and the Gujjars-Bakharwal community in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gujjars-Bakharwals, who have traditionally supported the Army, have played a significant role in countering insurgency in the region. However, a disconnect has developed between the community and the Army, resulting in a lack of ground intelligence. Hooda has called for a review of the SOPs on counterinsurgency operations and strengthening ground intelligence. Recent incidents, including the death of civilians allegedly after torture in Army custody, further highlight the need to rebuild trust and improve relations with the Gujjars-Bakharwals

#### Summary of Truckers' Protest Against New Criminal Law

**Truckers and bus drivers across India have expressed alarm at a provision in the new criminal law, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which imposes a 10-year jail sentence for hit-and-run cases. This has led to a nationwide strike to protest the rule, which has entered its second day on January 2.**

In response to the new law, truckers and transport organizations have initiated protests and blockades on roads and highways in various states, including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal. The protests in West Bengal involved hundreds of truckers blocking National Highway 2 near Dankuni toll plaza in Hooghly district for two hours on Sunday, burning tires and parking their vehicles in the middle of the road [[1]](https://thewire.in/rights/truckers-transporters-protest-10-year-sentence-for-hit-and-run-in-new-criminal-law).

**The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) and the All India Transporters’ Welfare Association have called upon the Union government to address this issue before the protests escalate. They emphasize the need for constructive dialogue with the authorities to find a fair resolution that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders.**

The protests have caused disruptions, with lengthy queues at fuel pumps in several states due to fears of fuel supply disruptions. The truckers and transporters are seeking a solution that balances the benefits of the new law with the potential negative consequences, such as harassment, extortion, unnecessary detention, and legal repercussions [[2]](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/truckers-protest-against-new-law-on-hit-and-run-cases-road-accident-transport-section-304a-of-ipc-agitation-drivers-strike-2024-01-01-909826).

### [How a Calendar Exposed the Falling Standards of an IIT](https://thewire.in/education/how-a-calendar-exposes-the-falling-professional-standards-of-an-iit)

The article discusses a calendar for the year 2024 that claims to be published by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. The calendar promotes false narratives about Indian ancestry, specifically the claim that Vedic Aryans were indigenous to the Indus Valley region and supports the 'out-of-India' migration theory, despite contradicting scientific and sociological evidence.

The calendar, titled "India of the Ages: The Mother of Language, Culture and Civilization," features symbols and images to advance the idea that Vedic Aryans were active in the Indus Valley region for over 20,000 years and spread their culture worldwide. However, this theory goes against evidence from various fields such as archaeo-genetics, archaeology, linguistics, zoology, botany, geography, and theology.

Peer-reviewed studies suggest that the cultural beginnings of the pre-Indian state are associated with the Harappans, the earliest settlers of the greater Indus Valley civilization. These settlers had connections with the Iranian plains and possibly earlier migrants from Africa. The Rigvedic people, who entered the Indian subcontinent around 4000 years ago, mingled with the original settlers and contributed to the development of Sanskrit.

The article also highlights the lack of genetic studies in the calendar's content. Recent genetic studies provide evidence for the Aryan migration theory, showing a genetic ancestral lineage shared between some Brahmanical groups in India and Eastern Europeans. These studies suggest that the Aryan nomads reached the Indus Valley from the Caspian steppes around 3500 years ago.

The calendar also makes misleading claims about the unicorn seal from the Indus Valley civilization, suggesting it belongs to the Vedic period. However, this claim is not supported by evidence. Additionally, the calendar contains errors, such as a map that incorrectly places parts of Jammu-Kashmir on the opposite side of the border shared by Pakistan.

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur has disowned the calendar and stated that it is not an officially published calendar of the institute. The institute denies responsibility for the calendar's contents and claims to have no knowledge of the content represented in an individual capacity.

In conclusion, the article criticizes the 2024 calendar published under the name of IIT Kharagpur for promoting false narratives about Indian ancestry and disregarding scientific evidence. The calendar's claims about Vedic Aryans and the unicorn seal are not supported by research, and the calendar contains errors and questionable interpretations

### [Candlelight Vigil Held in Kathmandu in Solidarity with Besieged Journalists of Gaza](https://thewire.in/media/candle-light-vigil-held-in-kathmandu-in-solidarity-with-besieged-journalists-of-gaza)

#### Summary:

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, more than 70 Palestinian journalists have been killed, and many others have lost their family members. Journalists in Kathmandu, Nepal, held a candlelight vigil to express solidarity and support for the journalists in Gaza. They condemned the Israeli government's killing of Palestinian journalists and highlighted the ongoing genocide in Gaza. The journalists in Gaza face numerous challenges, including the destruction of infrastructure, electricity outages, internet shutdowns, and difficulty in communicating internationally. Despite international condemnation, the attacks on journalists in Gaza continue. The statement from the journalists of Nepal expresses their fellowship with the besieged journalists of Gaza and wishes them strength to overcome the hardships they face while providing witness to the genocide.

#### Additional Information:

The conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place primarily in and around the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023 [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war).

The number of journalists killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, exceeds the total number of journalists killed worldwide in the previous 12 months.

The Israeli government's attacks have not only targeted journalists but have also resulted in the deaths of their family members.

The journalists in Gaza face challenges in reporting the ongoing genocide, including the destruction of communications infrastructure, electricity outages, and internet shutdowns [[1]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/10/8/israel-palestine-escalation-live-israeli-forces-bombard-gaza).

The journalists in Gaza struggle to communicate with each other and to get news out, and they also face attempts to sow doubt about their coverage from the Israeli government and its supporters.

Global platforms routinely suppress news from Palestine, making it difficult for Gaza's journalists to connect internationally through social media.

The journalists in Gaza continue to report on the mass murder of innocent children, women, and men, as well as the displacement of people who have been uprooted since 1948 [[1]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/10/8/israel-palestine-escalation-live-israeli-forces-bombard-gaza).

#### Summary of the Article:
Nobel laureate economist Muhammad Yunus has been convicted by a Dhaka court on charges of labor law violation, along with three other executives of Grameen Telecom, a social business company he founded. They were awarded six months of simple or non-rigorous imprisonment and immediately granted one-month bail after furnishing bonds of Taka 5,000 each. The conviction is being described as "politically motivated" by his supporters. The charges against Yunus and his colleagues stem from the firm's alleged violation of labor laws by failing to create a workers' welfare fund. Yunus's supporters believe these charges are a result of his ongoing conflict with Sheikh Hasina's government, with whom he has had a protracted row. The 83-year-old Nobel Prize winner, credited for lifting millions out of poverty through his anti-poverty campaign, is expected to appeal the verdict in the High Court. This case has garnered international attention, with 160 global figures, including former US president Barack Obama and ex-United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, denouncing the "continuous judicial harassment" of Yunus and expressing concerns for "his safety and freedom".

#### Context and Background:
Muhammad Yunus, an 83-year-old Nobel laureate economist, is known for his work in lifting millions out of poverty through his anti-poverty campaign and the Grameen Bank. He has been involved in a protracted conflict with Sheikh Hasina's government, which has led to several investigations and legal challenges for him and his social business firms since 2008. The recent conviction on labor law violation charges is seen as politically motivated by his supporters, and it is expected that Yunus and his colleagues will appeal the verdict in the High Court.

#### International Response:
The case has garnered international attention, with 160 global figures, including former US president Barack Obama and ex-United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, expressing concerns for "his safety and freedom" and denouncing the "continuous judicial harassment" of Yunus. This international support highlights the significance of Yunus's work and the impact of the legal challenges he is facing.

#### Conclusion:
The conviction of Muhammad Yunus and three other executives of Grameen Telecom on labor law violation charges, along with the international response and concerns for Yunus's safety and freedom, reflects the ongoing conflict between Yunus and Sheikh Hasina's government. The case is expected to continue with an appeal in the High Court, and it underscores the broader implications of political and legal challenges faced by prominent figures in the international community

#### Summary of India's Merchandise Trade in Fiscal Year 2023-24

India experienced a decrease in total merchandise exports by 6.51% to $278.8 billion and imports fell by 8.67% to $445.15 billion during the first seven months of the fiscal year 2023-24. The country faced a trade deficit with nine of its top ten trade partners, with only the US showing a surplus of $19.59 billion. Deficits were recorded with China, Russia, UAE, and others, while the trade gap with Hong Kong was $7.59 billion. The decrease in exports to Iran and the impact of the Israel-Hamas war were also highlighted. The trade environment was described as uncertain due to geopolitical issues and a general slowdown across developed economies, impacting India's exports and trade balance [[1]](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/macro-economic-indicators-and-the-business-cycle/macro-the-circular-flow-and-gdp/a/measuring-the-size-of-the-economy-gross-domestic-product-cnx).

The trade deficit with various countries was attributed to specific factors, such as imports of petrol, coal, and fertilizers from Russia, and edible oil from Indonesia. The deficit with South Korea was mentioned despite a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement signed in 2009. Additionally, Iran's reduced imports of tea and rice from India were linked to foreign exchange issues and the finalization of the rupee-payment mechanism. Reviews of existing free trade agreements were deemed unlikely to address the trade deficit. The impact of the global trade environment on India's exports and trade balance was also emphasized by experts and industry representatives [[1]](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/macro-economic-indicators-and-the-business-cycle/macro-the-circular-flow-and-gdp/a/measuring-the-size-of-the-economy-gross-domestic-product-cnx).

### [‘Cruel New Year Gift’, Says Congress as MGNREGA Wage Payment Through Aadhaar System Kickstarts](https://thewire.in/politics/cruel-new-year-gift-says-congress-as-mgnrega-wage-payment-through-aadhaar-system-kickstarts)

The article discusses the implementation of an Aadhaar-based payment system in India and the concerns raised by the Congress party regarding its impact on the poor and marginalized population. The Aadhaar-based payment system, which requires linking a worker's bank account and job card with Aadhaar, is set to kickstart from January 1, 2024. However, the Congress party has condemned this move, calling it a "cruel new year gift" to the country's poor and marginalized.

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act/Scheme (MGNREGA/S) guarantees 100 days of work to rural households. According to data by LibTech India, 7.6 crore job cards have been deleted from the system over the last 21 months.

Congress MP Jairam Ramesh criticized the implementation of the Aadhaar-based payment system, stating that it excludes millions of the poorest and marginalized Indians from earning a basic income. He accused the Modi government of using technology as a weapon to exclude the marginalized community and called for the government to stop weaponizing technology, release delayed wage payments, and improve transparency through open muster rolls and social audits.

The MGNREGS has seen budget cuts in recent years, and concerns have been raised about the decline in allocation to the scheme in the 2023 budget. The Wire has reported that the scheme has not had a performance audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) since 2013.

In summary, the article highlights the concerns raised by the Congress party regarding the implementation of the Aadhaar-based payment system and its impact on the poor and marginalized population in India. The party calls for the government to stop weaponizing technology and improve transparency in the MGNREGS scheme

### [Telangana Must Announce a Humane Prison Reform Policy](https://thewire.in/rights/telangana-must-announce-a-humane-prison-reform-policy)

The article discusses the need for the Telangana Congress government to review prison practices in order to establish a fair and transparent system that promotes prisoners' reintegration. It highlights several issues within the current prison system in Telangana.

#### Inequality before the law
The article mentions the case of Revanth Reddy, who served time in a central prison as an undertrial prisoner accused of bribery. It points out the unequal treatment of prisoners based on class and caste status. Revanth Reddy was granted the status of a special prisoner, and a life-sentenced Dalit prisoner named Nagaiah was appointed as his cook and assistant. The article argues that such unequal treatment disregards the principle of equality before the law.

#### Harshness towards prisoners
The article criticizes the increasingly harsh attitude towards prisoners in Telangana, which it attributes to the rise of a new power elite. It states that Telangana has released life prisoners only twice in the last ten years, compared to four times in neighboring Andhra Pradesh. The article also highlights the criteria for prisoner release, which have become more stringent over time, leading to anxiety and depression among life prisoners.

#### Lack of a democratic process for releasing prisoners
The article points out that there is no democratic process for releasing prisoners in Telangana. It criticizes the lack of imagination in the system regarding prisoners' reformation and the absence of a method for capturing the transformations that prisoners undergo. The article mentions that the sentence review board, responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of sentences, has not met for decades. As a result, releases are based solely on the gravity of the committed crime, disregarding the goal of transforming prisoners.

#### Prison labor and wages
The article discusses the issue of prison labor and wages in Telangana. It mentions that prisoners are paid a meager wage of Rs. 70 per day, which is difficult to justify. The article compares this wage to the amounts paid in other states, such as Karnataka, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, which are significantly higher. It argues that prisoners should be paid an amount equivalent to the value of their labor and that their rights and potential for reintegration should be considered.

#### Relationship between caste and nature of work
The article highlights the relationship between caste and the nature of work assigned to prisoners. It mentions that the prison authorities assign jobs based on the professional experiences of the offenders, which often align with caste-based professions. The article suggests that this relationship between caste and nature of work may influence the government's attitude towards low wages for prisoners.

#### Need for a comprehensive review of prison policies
The article concludes by emphasizing the need for the Telangana Congress government to comprehensively review prison policies and practices. It argues that indefinite sentences, lack of hope, and uncertainty about the future have a detrimental impact on prisoners' well-being and reintegration. The article calls for a fair and transparent system that considers the rights and lives of prisoners.

### [All MGNREGS Wages to Be Paid Through Aadhaar-Linked System From Today](https://thewire.in/labour/mgnregs-aadhaar-system-payment)

#### Summary of The Hindu's Article on MGNREGA and Aadhaar Linking

The article from The Hindu discusses the linking of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to Aadhaar and its implications. According to the Union Rural Development Ministry, 34.8% of job card holders were ineligible for payment under the scheme until December 27. The implementation of an Aadhaar-based payment system has been made mandatory, and as a result, 7.6 crore workers have been deleted from the system over the last 21 months. The government's own data indicates that 12.7% of active workers were yet unconnected to the payment system as of December 27. This move has been criticized by activists and experts, and economist Jean Dreze has compared it to a national lockdown at four hours' notice. Additionally, the Narendra Modi government has significantly reduced the allocation for MGNREGA in the 2023 Budget to Rs 60,000 crore, down from the revised estimate for FY’23 at Rs 89,400 crore.

The article highlights the challenges and controversies surrounding the Aadhaar linking and its impact on MGNREGA workers, including non-payment of wages, lack of available work, and the deletion of workers from the system. The government's decision to make Aadhaar linking mandatory has raised concerns and criticism from various quarters.

### [Congress's Telangana Victory: Import of the Karnataka Model](https://thewire.in/politics/congresss-telangana-victory-import-of-the-karnataka-model)

The article discusses the factors that contributed to the Congress party's victory in the 2023 Telangana elections. It highlights the party's well-executed strategy, strong leadership, welfare-oriented policies, secularism, and civil society support as key elements in their success. The Congress party's approach in Telangana mirrored the successful Karnataka model, which involved projecting a decisive leader, implementing welfare policies, embracing secularism and inclusivity, and garnering support from civil society organizations.

#### Leadership: The rise of Anumula Revanth Reddy
Anumula Revanth Reddy's ascent as a leader in Telangana played a crucial role in the Congress party's success. He was strategically chosen from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 2017, despite the Congress party's political setbacks in the state. Reddy's political acumen and strategic alignment with the Congress party showcased the party's ability to handle regional leadership effectively.

#### Welfare policies: Echoing the Karnataka model
The Congress party in Telangana adopted a dual approach to welfare policies, combining clientelism with programmatic measures. Unlike the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), which focused on targeted redistributions favoring specific groups, the Congress party's initiatives aimed to benefit a wide range of societal groups. These initiatives included schemes such as 'Mahalakshmi', 'Rythu Bharosa', 'Gruha Jyothi', 'Indiramma Indlu', 'Yuva Vikasam', and 'Cheyutha', which addressed the needs of various demographics, including women, farmers, students, and disadvantaged groups. The Congress party's balanced approach, integrating targeted benefits with broad-based inclusive schemes, played a pivotal role in their electoral triumph.

#### Secularism and inclusivity: Beyond soft Hindutva
The Congress party's commitment to secularism and inclusivity significantly influenced their victory in the Telangana elections. Their approach distinguished them from the soft Hindutva stance observed in other states.

### [Gyanvapi Mosque Row: Looking for ‘Character’ When History Establishes it Unequivocally](https://thewire.in/law/gyanvapi-mosque-row-looking-for-character-when-history-establishes-it-unequivocally)

#### Summary of "The ‘de-religiosification’ of Hinduism by India’s judiciary"

The article discusses the impact of judicial decisions on the perception of Hinduism and its implications for religious freedom and communal harmony in India. It highlights the construction of temples on claimed mosque sites, the judiciary's role in defining Hinduism, and the potential consequences for religious minorities, particularly Muslims.

The author argues that the judiciary's characterization of Hinduism as a way of life, rather than a religion, has allowed the forces of Hindutva to present Hinduism as a supra-religious order, providing the best moral code of conduct for its adherents. This has been utilized by political entities to shield themselves from allegations of political usage of Hinduism by claiming it as a way of life rather than a religion.

The recent judgment by Justice R.R. Agarwal of the Allahabad High Court on the Gyanvapi mosque issue is highlighted as a significant development. The judgment is criticized for undermining the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, and potentially fueling communal tensions. The article also draws attention to the syncretic history of India, citing examples of mosques constructed in the Hindu architectural style and instances of religious pluralism.

The article expresses concern about the potential impact of these judicial decisions on religious minorities, particularly Muslims, and the broader implications for communal harmony in India. It also draws historical parallels, including the actions of Aurangzeb, to underscore the potential consequences of such decisions.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of historical mistakes and the potential ramifications of current judicial decisions on religious freedom and communal harmony in India.

### [As Modi Decrees a New Diwali, Remember There's More to Indian Politics Than BJP's Ram](https://thewire.in/politics/as-modi-decrees-a-new-diwali-remember-theres-more-to-indian-politics-than-bjps-ram)

The article discusses three key axes that will shape the 2024 elections in India: Hindutva, a re-energized Congress, and the social justice agenda of the socialists-federalists. 

The first axis focuses on the Indian National Congress, which recently held a gathering in Nagpur to celebrate the party's 138th anniversary. The event aimed to remind the nation that Nagpur was historically associated with the Congress before it became known as the stronghold of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The Congress has a significant electoral history in Nagpur, winning 13 out of 18 Lok Sabha elections held there since 1952. The recent gathering, attended by around 200,000 Congress members, is seen as a strategic move to reclaim political space [[1]](https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/road-to-2024-hindutva-plus-welfare-emerges-as-bjp-pitch-for-polls-congress-not-far-behind-9035056/).

The second axis revolves around the proclamation of the new Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which is considered a significant event for the Hindu community. The temple's construction has received extensive media coverage, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has even suggested celebrating Diwali on January 22, 2024, when the idol of Lord Ram is due to be consecrated. This move has raised questions about the politicization of religious events and the influence of the right-wing [[2]](https://thediplomat.com/2023/06/bollywoods-role-in-hindutvas-2024-election-strategy/).

The third axis focuses on the socialists and their emphasis on social justice. They have chosen to commemorate the memory of Karpoori Thakur, a prominent advocate for social justice in North India. This event coincides with the consecration of the Ram idol in the new temple, highlighting the fault lines within the Hindu community and offering an alternative interpretation of Lord Ram's legacy. The socialists also have a strong presence in individual states, positioning themselves as Indian federalists [[3]](https://theprint.in/opinion/foreign-media-loves-anti-bjp-champagne-socialists-columnists/415968/).

As the 2024 general elections approach, these three axes will compete for the support of the Indian electorate. The Congress aims to re-establish itself as a leading force, Hindutva seeks to consolidate its influence, and the socialists-federalists emphasize social justice as a central pillar of their campaign [[4]](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-eyeing-social-justice-as-antidote-to-fading-hindutva-for-2024-lok-sabha-elections-1229473.html).

### [Factcheck: Was the Landmark at Rezang la Dismantled as Part of Disengagement With China?](https://thewire.in/politics/factcheck-was-the-landmark-at-rezang-la-dismantled-as-part-of-disengagement-with-china)

A memorial at Rezang La, which marks the site where the body of Major Shaitan Singh, PVC was found after the 1962 battle, was dismantled by the Indian Army as it fell within the buffer zone agreed upon with China. The news was covered by The Wire, The Telegraph, and BBC Hindi. The construction at Rezang La held immense significance, honoring the soldiers of "C" Coy 13 Kumaon. However, the Indian Army dismantled it during the disengagement process. The dismantling of the memorial was part of the disengagement plan agreed upon by the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA. The plan involved the withdrawal of both sides from the Kailash range and the north bank of Pangong Lake, as well as the creation of a no-patrol zone in the contested area. The dismantling of the memorial at Rezang La was a requirement under this plan. The Indian Army and the defense ministry have maintained silence on the matter, while BJP MP Jamyang Tshering Namgyal stated that the removal of the old memorial and the construction of a new one were not related to the buffer zone. The Chushul memorial, constructed in 1963, stands kilometers away from the cemented construction at Rezang La. It was erected at the cremation place of 96 soldiers of 13 Kumaon who fell in battle on November 18, 1962. The dismantled structure near Rezang La was the site where Major Shaitan Singh's body was discovered in 1963, months after the war.

#### Summary of the Article: Vinesh Phogat, an Indian wrestler and recipient of the Khel Ratna and Arjuna awards, returned her awards in protest against the alleged sexual harassment faced by women wrestlers. Phogat, along with other Olympians Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, had been protesting against the former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The government's response to the wrestlers' allegations and the delay in taking action further demoralized them. The matter escalated when Singh's close aide won the WFI elections, causing frustration among the protesting wrestlers. The Union government suspended the newly-elected leadership of the WFI and replaced it with a three-member ad-hoc committee. Phogat's act of returning her awards highlights the ongoing struggle for justice and the lack of action in addressing the allegations of sexual harassment within the wrestling community [[2]](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/wrestling/vinesh-returns-khel-ratna-and-arjuna-awards-leaves-them-at-kartavya-path/articleshow/106406163.cms) [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat) [[7]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vinesh-phogat-returns-khel-ratna-and-arjuna-awards-leaves-them-at-kartavya-path/article67690566.ece).

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the detrimental health impact and economic toll of air pollution in India. According to the World Economic Forum, air pollution costs the Indian economy $95 billion annually, which is equivalent to 3% of India's GDP [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/). The pollution crisis in Delhi, the national capital, is primarily attributed to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning in neighboring states. This has led to a surge in harmful pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 particles, resulting in respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and a decline in overall well-being [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).

The article mentions that intense air pollution exposure is changing the way our airways behave. Even healthy individuals have reported symptoms such as cough, breathlessness, chest tightness, fatigue, headache, eye irritation, and sneezing. These symptoms are likely related to worsening air pollution, and some individuals may develop asthma-like or allergic conditions due to the intense air pollution exposure.

The impact of air pollution on heart patients is particularly concerning. Studies have shown that air pollution increases the risk of high blood pressure, which is detrimental to heart patients.

The severity of respiratory illnesses, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has escalated due to air pollution. Patients with these conditions have reported a notable deterioration in their symptoms, including increased wheeziness, breathlessness, and a greater need for inhalers. Acute asthma attacks have also increased, leading to hospitalizations and intensified treatments [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).

The economic impact of air pollution in India is significant. The World Economic Forum estimates that if India had achieved safe air quality levels in 2019, its GDP would have increased by $95 billion, or 3%. This potential increase in GDP is equivalent to 50% of all tax collected annually or 150% of India's healthcare budget. Clean air is beneficial to the economy and businesses, leading to lower absenteeism, higher on-the-job productivity, higher consumer footfall, and lower premature mortality [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).

In summary, air pollution in India, particularly in Delhi, has detrimental effects on public health and the economy. The economic toll is estimated to be $95 billion annually, equivalent to 3% of India's GDP. The pollution crisis is primarily caused by vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and crop burning. The surge in harmful pollutants has led to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and a decline in overall well-being. Even healthy individuals are experiencing symptoms related to air pollution exposure. Heart patients and individuals with respiratory illnesses are particularly vulnerable. Reducing air pollution is crucial for improving public health and increasing economic growth in India [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/).
