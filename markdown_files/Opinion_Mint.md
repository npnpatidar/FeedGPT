### [Trash it right: We must transform waste management](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/trash-it-right-we-must-transform-waste-management-11715099767446.html)

The article discusses the innovative and creative solutions being implemented to tackle environmental issues, particularly waste management. It highlights the Trash Isles campaign, which symbolically created a 'country' in the Pacific Ocean to draw attention to the unmanaged waste problem. The article emphasizes a paradigm shift in waste management policies and perspectives, advocating for zero-waste economies and viewing waste as a resource rather than something to discard.

India's current policy framework aims to reduce landfill usage to less than 10% of waste, focusing on segregation, sorting, and recycling to maximize resource recovery. Despite generating over 62 million tonnes of waste annually, India faces challenges in waste collection, treatment, and disposal, with a significant portion ending up in waste yards.

The article calls for a sustainable waste management system that includes proper infrastructure, detailed processes, and technology for tracking and recycling waste. It suggests adopting a business model that balances environmental and social impacts, integrating informal waste workers, and relying on dual revenue streams from service fees and waste sales to cover operational costs.

In conclusion, the article stresses the need for collective efforts to create sustainable and impactful waste management processes, supporting individuals and businesses in the sector, and reflecting on how waste management practices reveal societal values.

### [Value chain risk: Will Vietnam end up like another Chinese province?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/value-chain-risk-will-vietnam-end-up-like-another-chinese-province-11715099704051.html)

Vietnam's aggressive anti-corruption campaign has led to significant political upheaval, with high-profile figures and business tycoons facing charges and, in some cases, severe sentences. The campaign has raised concerns about political stability and the potential impact on foreign investment, especially as Vietnam is poised to benefit from US-China tensions. The drive against corruption has inadvertently shifted economic prosperity towards the north, particularly around Hanoi and Haiphong, leaving the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City behind.

Foreign investments are increasingly flowing into the northern region, with significant infrastructure developments such as new factories and expressways. However, the anti-corruption efforts have also caused a slowdown in public procurement and infrastructure projects, with officials hesitant to make decisions. This has resulted in delays, like the incomplete metro line in Ho Chi Minh City.

The northern province of Quang Ninh has become particularly attractive to investors due to its improved infrastructure and geographical advantages. Despite soaring power demands and infrastructure needs, decision-making has stalled since the anti-corruption campaign began. Vietnam has even resorted to importing electricity from China to meet immediate needs.

The death sentence of Truong My Lan, a prominent real estate figure, has unsettled the business community, highlighting the government's willingness to target private businesses. This has influenced Chinese entrepreneurs to align with the political elite, who currently favor the north.

The article suggests that while anti-corruption efforts are essential, they can also hinder economic progress. Vietnam's internal politics may be inadvertently aligning the northern region more closely with China, raising questions about the country's future direction and independence.

### [What TikTok failed to understand about America: Democracy](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/what-tiktok-failed-to-understand-about-america-democracy-11715099632361.html)

The article discusses the controversy surrounding TikTok in the United States. **President Joe Biden** signed a law that could ban TikTok in nine months unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it to a non-Chinese entity. The law reflects bipartisan concerns over China, but TikTok has dismissed it as "political theatre."

US lawmakers, typically hesitant to regulate business, are concerned about data privacy and the potential for Chinese government access to American user data due to China's intelligence laws. TikTok's promise to store American data on non-Chinese servers did not alleviate these concerns, which were similar to those leading to a ban on Huawei telecom equipment.

TikTok had an opportunity to collaborate with US regulators and set a positive example in data privacy. Instead, it took an aggressive approach, hiring lobbyists and urging its young American user base to protest against the legislation. This strategy backfired, highlighting fears of foreign influence on American democracy and exacerbating concerns about social media's impact on beliefs and behaviors.

The article suggests that TikTok's actions, perceived as an attack on American democracy, ensured the passage of the forced-sale bill. With its future in the US uncertain, TikTok is advised to reconsider its approach and respect American concerns about data privacy and democratic integrity. Other non-US companies are warned to learn from TikTok's mistakes. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of respecting legitimate concerns about data privacy and threats to democracy.

### [Do hybrid bonds actually offer bank depositors any protection?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/do-hybrid-bonds-actually-offer-bank-depositors-any-protection-11715099516882.html)

The article discusses the recent instances of debt capital instruments being written down in the Indian banking sector, with specific reference to the Tier 1 bonds of Yes Bank and Tier 2 bonds of Lakshmi Vilas Bank. It highlights the challenges faced by bondholders, including legal battles and the implications of the judiciary's decisions on the banking system's regulatory framework.

The write-downs are part of a global trend following the 2008 financial crisis, where new debt capital instruments were introduced to prevent government bailouts of failed banks. These instruments, known as Basel 3 Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds, or 'hybrid bonds', have features of both debt and equity and are designed to absorb losses in times of bank stress.

The article notes that in India, these instruments have grown to a significant size, with Tier 1 bonds comprising a substantial portion of the banking system's net worth. It also discusses the changes in the covenants for coupon payments on these bonds over the last decade, the government's role in bailing out banks, and the implications for investors and the banking system's stability.

The Supreme Court's upcoming judgement on Yes Bank's Tier 1 bonds is highlighted as a crucial event that will set a precedent for the treatment of such instruments in future bank resolutions. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for consensus among stakeholders on the risks and regulatory treatment of hybrid bonds to maintain confidence in the Indian banking system.

### [Leadership determines whether institutions flout or value norms](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/leadership-determines-whether-institutions-flout-or-value-norms-11715099450125.html)

The article reflects on the author's personal experiences with educational institutions run by religious trusts, highlighting the impact of foundational norms and beliefs on their functioning. The author contrasts two institutions: one focused solely on education, where everything from teacher behavior to the physical environment aligned with this purpose, and another where education was secondary to serving God, affecting teacher-student relationships and the institution's priorities.

The author extends this observation to hospitals run by religious institutions, noting that while patient care is less affected by such norms, the impact on students in educational settings can be significant. The article suggests that these foundational norms are often unspoken but deeply influence institutional behavior and the experiences of those within.

A particular case is discussed where an educational institution was found to be corrupt, with the principal and faculty involved in malpractices, including financial misconduct and caste-based discrimination. This institution's closure and the lack of accountability are cited as examples of gross violations of educational norms.

The author argues that leadership is crucial in maintaining or subverting these foundational norms, with the potential for either subtle differences or complete hijacking of an institution's purpose. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of public vigilance to safeguard against such subversion in the reality of the country's institutional landscape.

### [CBI vs banks on fraud: It’s not too late to set the record straight](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/cbi-vs-banks-on-fraud-it-s-not-too-late-to-set-the-record-straight-11715091067759.html)

The article discusses the complexities surrounding the classification of 'fraud accounts' in Indian banking, in light of a Supreme Court ruling that requires borrowers to be given a hearing before their accounts are labeled as fraud. Banks are seeking a review of this ruling due to the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) interpretation that it should apply retrospectively, which banks disagree with. The article argues that banks already follow due process in dealing with defaulting borrowers, often engaging extensively to recover dues before labeling an account as fraud. It suggests that the Supreme Court should clarify that its ruling is meant for prospective application to prevent the reopening of past cases and potential legal disputes over what constitutes a hearing. The author warns against the negative impact on credit discipline and the broader economy if legal challenges by borrowers lead to reduced lending to riskier ventures. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of maintaining progress in credit discipline for the health of the banking sector and the economy at large.

### [E-rupee: Maximize its appeal](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/erupee-maximize-its-appeal-11715091749858.html)

The article discusses the evolution of India's central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-rupee, which has been in test mode since 2022. The e-rupee is expected to become accessible offline, enhancing user convenience. It may also be made programmable for more flexibility compared to UPI transfers. However, for it to truly replace cash, it requires anonymity.

The RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das, mentioned that transactions could be technologically erased from records, but legislative support would strengthen the promise of anonymity. With the e-rupee still under development, it's an opportune moment for national debate on its design.

The article suggests that for the RBI's CBDC to achieve global success, it should integrate technological innovations with the best aspects of traditional currency, including purchasing power and assured privacy.

### [Hindujas get a 360-degree makeover but need to smoothen rough edges](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/hindujas-bofors-scandal-ashok-leyland-gocl-corp-nxt-digital-hinduja-global-indusind-bank-11715073078718.html)

The article discusses the transformation of the Hinduja Group over the past three decades, particularly since the Bofors scandal. The family business, originally founded in 1919 and once known for its secrecy and political connections, has reinvented itself into a transparent, diversified conglomerate operating in around 40 countries across various sectors, with a significant presence in India.

The group, which was led by S.P. Hinduja during the 1990s, now has at least six publicly traded companies in India, including Ashok Leyland and IndusInd Bank, all run by professionals with independent boards. The current third generation of the Hinduja family is well-educated and actively involved in the business.

Despite the progress, the family has faced internal disputes, notably a feud over the control of Hinduja Bank, which highlighted issues of cohesiveness and gender equality within the family. With the family business now in its third generation and the fourth generation set to take over, the article suggests that the Hindujas must be cautious, as most family businesses do not survive beyond the third generation.

The Hinduja brothers, once the richest Indians in the world, have shifted focus from reputation to creating a more stable and sustainable business model, aiming to triple the valuation of IndusInd International Holdings to about $50 billion by 2030 and planning new product launches through Ashok Leyland. The article implies that this strategic shift is crucial for the longevity and success of the family business.

### [Yes, releasing the EVM source code could improve our polling system’s security](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/yes-releasing-the-evm-source-code-could-improve-our-polling-system-s-security-11715020084947.html)

The article discusses the debate surrounding the release of electronic voting machine (EVM) source code for open-source use. The Supreme Court has upheld the use of EVMs but rejected the idea of making their source code public, citing potential misuse. The author argues against the belief that access to source code inherently compromises digital systems, using the open-source messaging app Signal as an example of secure software despite its publicly available source code.

The article suggests that open-source software tends to be more secure because it allows a broader community to identify and fix vulnerabilities quickly. It highlights the importance of administrative access over mere knowledge of source code in terms of security risks. The author advocates for the open-source model, noting that many everyday systems rely on it, such as Apache Web Servers and the Linux operating system.

The piece also references the Heartbleed bug to illustrate the open-source community's ability to respond swiftly to security threats. It concludes by urging the adoption of open-source practices in government systems to enhance security and public trust, mentioning India's National Open Standards Policy as a step in this direction, but notes the lack of significant progress since its introduction. The author expresses surprise at the Supreme Court's stance given the government's previous support for open source. The article ends with unrelated content and advertisements which have been omitted from this summary.

### [The neutrality of ‘Civil War’ is what makes this film powerful](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-neutrality-of-civil-war-is-what-makes-this-film-powerful-11715020009507.html)

Alex Garland's film "Civil War" has sparked debate for its depiction of a future America in conflict without explaining the cause. Critics argue it fails to realistically portray the divisions in America, but this misses the film's potential to impact US politics. The film prompts viewers to question how such a conflict could arise, with possibilities like war, pandemics, AI, or climate disasters. Surprisingly, the film and some commentators overlook the role of Christian nationalism, a topic explored in the documentary "Bad Faith" and Katherine Stewart's book "The Power Worshippers."

The film's critics are correct that discussing an American civil war without addressing Christian nationalism's goals and tendencies is challenging. However, the film's political neutrality may be its strength, allowing it to engage a wider audience in the conversation about political violence. Garland's approach invites Republicans and independents into a crucial dialogue, a feat Democrats have struggled to achieve.

The article suggests that for "Civil War" to foster bipartisan discussions, Democrats must also engage in good faith and consider threats to democracy from all sides. The film leaves important questions about democracy and peace open, which the author plans to address in a future column. The film's ability to raise these questions without bias is seen as a positive contribution to the political discourse.©bloomberg

### [The Godrej family saga: Business succession should be led by a common vision](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-godrej-family-saga-business-succession-should-be-led-by-a-common-vision-11715019912236.html)

The article discusses the recent division within the Godrej family business group, a significant player in India's industrial landscape for over a century. It highlights how family disputes over succession and strategic vision have led to the split of their business portfolio. The piece emphasizes the complexities of managing multigenerational family enterprises, stressing the importance of proactive preparation for potential splits and effective succession planning. Drawing from the example of the Merck family, who successfully navigated such challenges, it underscores the need for transparent communication and consensus-building to preserve the family's legacy and business success.

### [Could a few swing states determine who governs India?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/could-a-few-swing-states-determine-who-governs-india-11715019836004.html)

The article discusses the dynamics of India's 18th Lok Sabha elections, highlighting the historical context of majority margins in past elections and the shift to coalition governments when no single party won a clear majority. It notes that in recent elections, the BJP has managed to secure a majority, raising questions about whether this trend will continue in 2024. The article points out that only the BJP and Congress are contesting enough seats to potentially win a majority on their own.

It also explains India's first-past-the-post electoral system and analyzes the BJP's performance in the 2019 elections, where it won a significant number of constituencies with more than 50% voter share. The analysis challenges the notion that BJP's wins were concentrated in its strongholds, showing a broader distribution across various states.

The article suggests a method to predict election outcomes by considering certain seats as 'safe' for the BJP or non-BJP parties and analyzing the rest as 'swing seats.' However, it cautions that this method could be flawed due to changes in political alliances and the unpredictable nature of elections.

Finally, it identifies six states as potential swing states that could influence the overall election result, emphasizing that the outcome in these states will likely be determined by narrow margins and local factors. The article concludes with a quote from Malcolm Gladwell, implying that small influences can have significant impacts on the election results.

### [In Europe, China faces headwinds but can India gain?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/in-europe-china-faces-headwinds-but-can-india-gain-11715002113967.html)

Chinese President Xi Jinping's European tour is set to address trade tensions and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. European concerns over China's trade practices and political strategies, including 'wolf warrior' diplomacy and support for non-democratic regimes, are high on the agenda. The EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation has led to targeted actions against Chinese companies, exemplified by recent raids in Warsaw and Rotterdam. These moves reflect a shift in EU policy towards a more assertive stance against Chinese economic influence.

Xi's visits to Belgrade and Budapest are symbolic, with the former marking the anniversary of NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy and the latter showing support for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's politics. These visits underscore China's rivalry with the US and its disdain for liberal democracy.

For India, the EU-China dynamics have economic and political implications. The EU's stringent actions raise compliance costs for Indian companies, which may not directly benefit from the exit of Chinese companies. Politically, India's democratic credentials and adherence to international law contrast with China, but Europe's rightward shift and the regional conflict may limit India's acceptance. Concerns about India's democratic backsliding and 'wolf warrior' diplomacy could erode European goodwill, potentially aligning India with China as a challenger to European interests. India risks overestimating its global position as an alternative to China without the necessary market capacity or political influence.

### [Equitable survival: Climate action needs to be gender just](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/equitable-survival-climate-action-needs-to-be-gender-just-11715019764732.html)

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of KlimaSeniorinnen, a group of Swiss women over 64, against the Swiss government for not reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which increases their risk of heatwave-related deaths. This ruling sets a precedent for the 46 countries in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Swiss government contends that climate policy decisions should be made by elected officials, not courts.

Studies show Europe is warming faster than the global average, with older women particularly vulnerable to heat-related deaths. Research predicts significant future fatalities among women due to heat in India, Nigeria, and the US. Physiological differences, such as lower sweating capacity in women, contribute to this vulnerability, alongside social factors like isolation and limited access to resources.

Economic impacts are also severe, with heat expected to reduce work hours globally. Women, especially in heat-exposed unpaid work, face extended work times and income disparities due to heat stress. By 2030, heat-related job losses could reach 34 million in India alone. South Asian countries, particularly India, face substantial GDP losses due to reduced working hours for women.

The article emphasizes the need for gender-inclusive climate adaptation strategies and action plans to address the disproportionate impact of heat on women's lives, livelihoods, and economic contributions.

### [Sure, insure people, but public healthcare for all is a must for Viksit Bharat](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sure-insure-people-but-public-healthcare-for-all-is-a-must-for-viksit-bharat-11715019703870.html)

The article discusses a new government initiative in India to address the high number of road accidents by providing cashless emergency care to victims. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is reported to be working on a scheme that offers up to ₹1.5 lakh for cashless treatment to every traffic accident victim, regardless of their insurance status. This would be applicable at all hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat plan for up to a week from the date of the accident.

The scheme aims to reduce treatment refusals and delays, with costs being reimbursed through the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, initially established to aid hit-and-run victims. The government is exploring ways to keep the fiscal cost low, including discussions with insurers about using a portion of vehicle owners' third-party coverage premiums.

The article suggests that while expanded insurance is beneficial for immediate welfare, the ultimate goal should be a robust public health system that provides efficient and affordable care to all, similar to the systems in the world's happiest countries. It argues that direct healthcare services are preferable to insurance-based models, which can be bogged down by bureaucratic processes. The piece concludes by advocating for subsidized state provisions and fiscal planning for a significant upgrade in public health services as the economy grows.

### [India’s economy: Off to a flying start](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/indias-economy-off-to-a-flying-start-11715019334360.html)

India's economy has shown a strong start in the fiscal year 2024-25, according to high-frequency indicators. The services sector PMI stood at **60.8 in April**, slightly down from **61.2 in March**, but still indicating one of the strongest performances in 14 years. The manufacturing PMI was also robust at **58.8**, marking the second-highest level since early 2021.

The PMI readings, which are well above the 50 threshold that demarcates expansion from contraction, suggest economic growth. Additionally, India's GST collections reached a record high of **₹2.1 trillion in April**, further fueling optimism for the economic outlook of the year.

Despite these positive signs, the economy is not operating at full capacity, with private investment and consumption lagging behind expectations. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept interest rates from falling due to inflation concerns. The situation could have been more complex if the US Federal Reserve had started lowering rates, but its decision to maintain a 'higher-for-longer' stance has alleviated some pressure. Nevertheless, monitoring domestic economic variables remains a complex task.

### [Artificial intelligence holds the key to urban resilience](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/artificial-intelligence-holds-the-key-to-urban-resilience-11714930800164.html)

The article discusses the increasing risk of climate-driven events in cities, where 4.4 billion people live. It highlights the threats of rising sea levels, flooding, and extreme heat waves, particularly in coastal megacities and regions like South Asia and the Middle East. Urban areas, which are significant contributors to global carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption, are expected to house 68% of the population by 2050.

The piece emphasizes the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to support cities in building resilience against climate change. AI could accelerate urban climate solutions, enable sustainable development, and innovate at a rapid pace. It could also assist in disaster response, make city operations more sustainable, and optimize public transportation and traffic planning.

However, the article notes that while many cities are exploring AI, few have implemented it due to challenges in technology access and skill requirements. It calls for greater access to AI tools and training, especially for vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by climate threats. The author urges all stakeholders, including governments, companies, and communities, to embrace AI to make cities safer and more adaptable to climate change. The private sector is encouraged to partner with public agencies and support marginalized urban populations. The article concludes that the technology to combat climate-driven events exists, but collective action is needed to utilize it effectively. ©2024/project syndicate

The article discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the creative industry, particularly animation. Yael Biran, an animator with 25 years of experience, has seen a significant decline in her work due to clients and agencies using AI tools for animation, which they previously outsourced to professionals like her. The AI-generated content can rival human-created work, saving time and money, as evidenced by its use in high-profile projects for Madonna and Stephen Colbert's show.

However, there is concern that reliance on AI will lead to a lack of originality and meaningful impact, as AI often replicates existing art styles. Biran warns that without the critical input of visual thinkers, companies may produce ineffective visual communications, such as animations that misrepresent intended messages. The article highlights the importance of human creativity and understanding in visual storytelling, suggesting that businesses should not fully replace human creatives with AI. Despite the advancements in AI, the need for human judgment and skill in challenging ideas and creating impactful visuals remains crucial.

The article discusses the lessons startups can learn from established companies. Here's a summary:

**1. Seek Trusted Advisors:** Startups should have advisors or challengers to provide balance and prevent blind spots that could lead to failure.

**2. Build a Team of Owners:** As startups grow, it's crucial to have a senior team with complementary skills to scale the business effectively.

**3. Focus on Reality Metrics:** Startups should concentrate on operating and financial metrics that matter in the long term, rather than vanity metrics.

**4. Develop 'Good Bureaucracy':** Implementing fit-for-purpose systems and processes can help startups manage growth without losing agility.

**5. Prioritize Governance:** Good governance should be part of a startup's DNA from the beginning to avoid future disputes and ensure long-term success.

The article concludes by emphasizing that while startups can teach large companies about innovation and agility, they can also learn about sustainability and governance from the experience of established firms. These insights are presented as the authors' personal views.

The article discusses the impact of youth movements on social and political issues, drawing parallels between the past and present. It references the song "The Kids are Alright" by The Who as a symbol of youth resilience. The focus is on recent student protests in America against Israeli actions in Gaza, calling for divestment from companies doing business with Israel and ending partnerships with Israeli universities. The movement has spread internationally and is compared to historical student movements against the Vietnam War and apartheid. The article contrasts the informed activism in America with a lack of awareness among some protestors in Delhi. It praises American universities as free speech havens and urges Indian universities to foster similar environments for debate and dissent to prepare future generations. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of free expression within educational institutions for the growth of knowledge and creativity.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy. The FTX scandal resulted in significant financial losses, with conservative estimates at $8 billion for customers, $1.7 billion for investors, and $1.3 billion for Alameda lenders. The collapse of FTX contributed to a sharp decline in the overall crypto market value and led to increased regulatory scrutiny.

In India, the response to crypto regulation has been inconsistent, with conflicting views among the RBI, Sebi, and the government. A cryptocurrency bill has been pending since 2021, and in the meantime, heavy taxes have been imposed on crypto trades, including a 1% TDS and a 30% capital gains tax, with no provision to offset losses. Despite these measures, Indian users have been moving to offshore platforms, leading to a significant outflow of trading volume and tax revenue.

The Indian government's approach to crypto regulation has been unclear, and the industry is awaiting decisive policy direction. Comparatively, countries like the US, UK, EU, Singapore, Japan, and Australia have developed more comprehensive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. For India, the challenge remains to establish clear regulatory authority and purpose for overseeing the crypto industry.

The Indian Constitution has unexpectedly become a focal point in the current national elections, with both major parties, the BJP and Congress, accusing each other of manipulating it for political gain. The main issue revolves around affirmative action, particularly regarding proportional quotas for jobs and education. This election seems likely to hinge on the votes of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), who make up a significant portion of the electorate. While identity politics are at play, there's a silver lining in both sides affirming the Constitution in their rhetoric. However, doubts remain about whether this signals genuine stability or is merely superficial. The BJP's historical stance on the Constitution contrasts with its recent rhetoric, suggesting a political evolution. Nonetheless, there's acknowledgment that the Constitution isn't perfect and should be open to debate. Despite political tensions, there's consensus on upholding key principles like equality and liberty. The article emphasizes the importance of these principles as the foundation of Indian unity, urging a focus on what unites rather than divides.

The government has lifted its ban on onion exports but with conditions: a minimum export price of $550 per tonne and a 40% tariff. This move, just before elections in Maharashtra, aims to appease farmers affected by the ban. While the decision is welcomed, it highlights the issue of frequent government interventions in agricultural markets. Such bans disrupt market dynamics and discourage farmers from cultivating certain crops. Moreover, they harm India's reputation as a reliable global supplier. The government must establish a clear framework to ensure stability and predictability in agricultural policies.

The article describes the author's experience at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Omaha, which is transformed once a year from a modest city into a bustling hub of activity. The AGM, hosted by Warren Buffett, is not only a chance to hear from the legendary investor but also a gathering that fosters a sense of community among attendees. The author highlights the camaraderie and shared passion for learning and growth that unite both seasoned investors and newcomers. The true charm of the event, as per the author, lies in the connections and friendships made, bound by mutual respect and a desire to grow.

Jason Zweig's passage from 2004 is quoted, emphasizing the comfort of being part of a community and not facing the uncertainties of investing alone. The author reflects on the ethos of Buffett and Munger, which goes beyond wealth creation to building relationships, trust, and a nurturing community. Attending the AGM is likened to a pilgrimage, valuing deep investing principles, long-term thinking, and shared wisdom. It's an experience that affirms we are not alone in our endeavors, and while there will always be intelligent people, there will never be another Buffett or Munger.

### [Industrial policy is back with a vengeance everywhere](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/industrial-policy-is-back-with-a-vengeance-everywhere-11714893099611.html)

Governments worldwide are re-engaging with industrial policies to enhance industrial competitiveness and shield domestic industries. Various factors like the 2008 financial crisis, skepticism towards free markets, China's ascent, the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, climate change, and geopolitical tensions have prompted this revival. While both developed and developing nations are involved, advanced economies are more active. The resurgence includes traditional measures like subsidies alongside newer priorities like climate action. In the US, recent legislation targets climate change mitigation and semiconductor supply chain security. India's response involves production-linked incentives (PLI) to bolster domestic manufacturing. However, despite efforts, the PLI scheme faces challenges, including private sector reluctance to invest. Addressing this issue is crucial for the success of industrial policies.

The article reflects on the Whitney Biennial, expressing disappointment in its predictability and risk-averse nature, which mirrors a broader societal trend where elite institutions stifle innovation. The exhibition aimed to explore themes of AI, gender, and authenticity, but faced criticism for not being groundbreaking. The author argues that the art world, like other industries, is dominated by a few stars due to a winner-take-all economy, making it difficult for others to succeed without institutional support. This has led to a homogenous intellectual environment and a lack of true creativity at the highest levels. The article suggests that while it's easier than ever to gain attention online, breaking into the economic upper echelon remains challenging and tends to reward conformity. The author questions the sustainability of this bifurcated system and whether establishments like the Whitney Biennial will maintain their importance if they continue to lack innovation. The erosion of establishment authority could democratize success and lead to a more productive economy if it allows for unconventional paths to success.

- **Digital Revolution**: Massive digital penetration supported by initiatives like the JAM trinity, national digital literacy mission, ONDC, and GeM, with significant public participation in financial inclusion programs.

- **Ease of Living**: Improvement in service delivery through sanitation, healthcare, pension, banking, clean cooking, water supply, technology access, and housing schemes.

### [Manu Joseph: How do noble proposals like an inheritance tax arise?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/manu-joseph-how-do-noble-proposals-like-an-inheritance-tax-arise-11714892883466.html)

Sam Pitroda, once a prominent figure in Indian telecom, recently suggested the adoption of an inheritance tax and wealth redistribution in India. Although his statement should have been insignificant, it garnered attention due to ongoing elections. Despite being potentially beneficial for the poor, Pitroda's proposal was controversial, with the BJP misrepresenting it as part of the Congress manifesto. This incident sheds light on how societal reforms often stem from conflicts between different layers of power, with the second tier challenging the first, often in the name of morality or the underprivileged. Pitroda's suggestion can be seen as a move to challenge the new elite, reminiscent of historical struggles between different social classes for reform. The article also highlights a less obvious form of inequality perpetuated by the upper middle class, who, unlike billionaires, compete directly with other societal classes in various fields, leveraging not just wealth but social connections for advantage.

The article discusses the evolution of Indian foreign policy and the United States' global position. It reflects on the mid-2000s debate in India about aligning more closely with the US, despite historical hesitations due to past US support for Pakistan and concerns over losing strategic autonomy. The author was among the few advocating for this realignment, seeing it as beneficial for India.

The piece also critiques the notion of American decline, a popular topic during the end of George W. Bush's presidency and Barack Obama's campaign. The author argues against this declinism, citing America's political resilience, educational ecosystem, and ability to attract global talent as reasons for its sustained dominance.

However, the author expresses concern over the damage the US has done to these strengths in the past 15 years, particularly due to extreme partisanship, challenges in the higher education system, and the handling of immigration. Despite these issues, the author believes the US still has the potential for self-correction.

The article concludes by referencing Paul Kennedy's analysis of the rise and fall of great powers, suggesting that the US may risk decline if it does not address its current challenges, especially in the context of international conflicts and the need for hard power. The author implies that the US must remember its historical strengths and avoid the pitfalls of military overstretch to maintain its global position.

The article discusses the proliferation of border fences in the European Union, particularly in response to migrant crises and security concerns. It highlights the significant rise in the length of border fences since the 1990s, with a sharp increase during the Syria-driven migrant crisis of 2015-16 and resurgence amid pandemic-era restrictions easing. Despite the high costs and questionable effectiveness of fences, countries like Poland and Finland are investing in them to manage illegal migration and confront Russian influence. However, critics argue that fences symbolize policy failures and shift migration patterns rather than solve underlying issues. The article also mentions the EU's tougher stance on migration, increased funding for border security, and the legal and moral dilemmas posed by migration policies and the new migration pact.

The article explores the evolving concept of leadership, emphasizing a shift towards "leading from the back" rather than traditional front-facing leadership styles. It highlights factors such as changing psychological contracts between companies and employees, the rise of hybrid work arrangements, and the democratization of innovation. Unvanguard leaders prioritize purpose-driven cultures, autonomy, and collaboration to foster innovation and drive transformative change within organizations. They prioritize a "people-first" approach, empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully while valuing diversity and collective genius. The article suggests that nurturing leaders who can harness the collective talent of their teams is crucial in today's dynamic landscape.

The article discusses the Godrej family's elegant and thoughtful family settlement, which took four years to finalize and is seen as a model for succession planning in Indian promoter-driven companies. It contrasts this with cases of value destruction due to poor succession planning, as seen in the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Thapar Group. The author suggests that for Indian companies to become globally competitive, they should focus on creating large MNCs rather than redistributing control through asset carve-ups.

The article cites examples from the US, Germany, and Sweden, where family-owned businesses have successfully combined family ownership with professional management, often backed by large institutions. This governance model has allowed families to retain wealth while delegating management responsibilities, acknowledging their limitations in expertise.

In Japan, family-owned businesses often involve meticulous grooming of family members for leadership, with professional managers sometimes brought in from outside the family. Japanese family businesses typically blend traditional values with modern management to prioritize long-term sustainability.

The author notes that most Indian companies are small by global standards and that splitting assets into smaller entities could hinder achieving global scale. The article suggests that India will need to forge its own path, balancing Eastern and Western models of family business governance. It highlights the importance of careful succession planning, as seen in the Reliance group, Wipro, and HCL, to prevent value destruction and protect the interests of minority shareholders. The author, Prabal Basu Roy, emphasizes the significance of these issues for India Inc and its stakeholders.

The article discusses the current state of rivers worldwide, highlighting alarming trends such as droughts, declining water levels, and pollution. It emphasizes the historical, cultural, and spiritual significance of rivers, noting their role in sustaining civilizations and inspiring reverence across cultures. The piece also delves into the geographical and historical context of several major rivers, underscoring their transnational nature. Additionally, it explores efforts to legally protect rivers in various countries, contrasting progress made in some places with the lack of enforceable measures in others. The author calls for greater recognition of rivers' importance and the need for their rights and protection.

The article discusses the current landscape of rapid change and uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of leveraging technology, data, and AI to thrive in the future business environment. It highlights the potential economic value of generative AI adoption and provides examples of how businesses, particularly in India, can utilize AI to drive growth and innovation. The article offers five strategies for businesses to maximize their AI investments, including embracing a bold vision, driving continuous reinvention, developing a secure digital core, reinventing talent and ways of working, and closing the gap on responsible AI. It concludes by suggesting that businesses in India have the opportunity to create AI-based solutions that enhance human creativity and productivity, ushering in a new era of innovation.

### [Biden’s take on India’s economy is both bizarre and bothersome](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/bidens-take-on-india-s-economy-is-both-bizarre-and-bothersome-11714661045849.html)

US President Joe Biden recently made remarks attributing the economic challenges of Japan, China, and India to "xenophobia," particularly in relation to immigration policies. These comments, made at a fundraising event, have sparked surprise and criticism, especially in India. While India emphasizes inclusivity, Biden's categorization of its economic growth as "stalling" alongside China and Japan is contentious. India's growth trajectory, supported by projections from institutions like the World Bank and IMF, contradicts Biden's characterization. Biden's focus on immigration policies, suggesting that welcoming immigrants fuels economic strength, contrasts with India's more restrictive visa policies, which prioritize reciprocity and can hinder foreign investment. However, India's visa regulations hardly constitute xenophobia, and its immigration challenges differ from those of other countries. Biden's comments risk inflaming tensions, particularly in light of India's advocacy for labor mobility versus US and EU emphasis on capital movement in international negotiations. These remarks could impede progress in ongoing negotiations, such as free trade agreements with the UK and US.

The article highlights the mishandling of Go First's insolvency case, emphasizing the lack of urgency and expertise within regulatory authorities. It criticizes the delay in hearings by the National Company Law Tribunal and the failure of aviation bodies to aid the struggling airline. The decision to declare insolvency is questioned, with accusations of deliberate misleading actions by the airline's promoters. Despite gaining a moratorium on payments, Go First remains grounded, echoing past failures in the aviation industry. The prolonged delay in resolving the case is deemed detrimental to India's ease of doing business campaign.

The article discusses the split of assets within the Godrej family, dividing businesses into two groups: Godrej Industries Group (GIG) and Godrej Enterprises Group (GEG). GIG will focus on sectors like fast-moving consumer goods, financial services, and pharma, while GEG will handle areas like consumer durables, construction materials, and security products. Both groups have exclusive rights to certain sectors under the Godrej brand to prevent conflicts. The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining the brand's integrity as it is split between the two groups, highlighting the need for them to remain invested in its integrity for continued success.

It argues that Biden's statement lacks credibility and understanding of India's economic situation and immigration dynamics. While praising the US for its relatively open immigration policy, the article suggests that Biden's credibility on immigration issues is undermined by his unfounded remarks. It also points out India's long tradition of openness to diversity, contrasting it with ongoing debates and crackdowns on dissent in the US.

The article discusses how many companies in India are prioritizing hiring women at junior levels to meet gender diversity targets, but this approach might lead to biased hiring and hinder long-term diversity goals. It highlights biases in recruitment processes, including reliance on demographics like gender and location. Despite the use of AI tools, human oversight is necessary to eliminate biases. The article also addresses subtle biases based on social status and accents, particularly in the IT sector. It suggests that companies should focus on retaining women and invest in training managers to overcome biases. Additionally, it calls for internal studies to understand why women drop out at mid or senior levels and recommends examining recruitment parameters for biases.

Tesla's stock surged by 15% after news broke of tentative approval for its driver-support technology in China, following a meeting with Premier Li Qiang. Despite Elon Musk's enigmatic statements, the visit signals commitment to Tesla, alleviating concerns. However, Tesla's driver-assistance system, labeled 'Full Self-Driving' (FSD), lags behind competitors like Mercedes-Benz and BMW, who are already offering more advanced autonomous driving features. Reports of a potential Tesla-Baidu collaboration highlight the necessity for Tesla to catch up on autonomous driving by partnering with rivals. Yet, the $82 billion share price increase seems unjustified given China's competitive EV market and geopolitical challenges. Concerns over data privacy and national security may hinder Tesla's ability to apply lessons learned in China globally. Moreover, the risk of accidents involving Tesla's autonomous tech raises questions about public perception and regulatory scrutiny, potentially jeopardizing Tesla's reputation.

The Lokniti pre-poll voter survey highlighted that while headlines focused on party preferences, the more valuable insights revolved around voters' concerns, such as employment and inflation. The survey emphasized the importance of understanding the nuanced language of issues, like differentiating between "rozgaari" and "naukri" for employment. The article also advocates for reforms, particularly regarding the Reverse Charge Mechanism in GST, to facilitate small enterprises and job creation. It criticizes the survey's lack of accessibility and failure to adequately represent the views of new, younger voters. Additionally, it discusses the role of electronic voting machines (EVMs), the Anti-Defection Law, and the diminishing importance of individual candidates in elections compared to party affiliations. Overall, it raises questions about voters' choices amidst the dominance of party politics and the influence of electoral trends.

The organ donation gap in India is alarming, with a significant shortage of donors compared to demand. Despite strides, the country still faces low donation rates, resulting in numerous deaths of individuals awaiting transplants. There's a call for a national debate on establishing organ donation as an opt-in by default, with an opt-out provision, aiming to save lives and align with humanitarian principles. Recent increases in cadaver donors offer hope, facilitated by legal recognition of brain-stem death. Prime Minister Modi has emphasized the importance of cadaveric donation, supported by a digital registry. Integrating organ donation preferences into Aadhaar cards could streamline the process. Making organ donation the default option would not only be humanitarian but also economically beneficial, reducing healthcare costs, enhancing productivity, and fostering a healthier society.

The article discusses the implementation of new Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations in India, effective from 1 April. These regulations require investors to verify their email IDs, in addition to phone numbers and Aadhaar-PAN linkage, causing disruption for many. Approximately 12% of investor accounts under Sebi's oversight have been put on hold due to gaps in their KYC data. While KYC rules are necessary to prevent fraud, the article suggests a gentler approach could have been taken, such as imposing extra fees for non-compliant accounts rather than outright locking them. It also calls for more proactive efforts from KYC registration agencies, companies, and fund houses to assist investors in meeting compliance requirements and ensure they are not unfairly locked out of their assets.

India's banks, after overcoming a slew of bad loans, are facing new challenges, particularly in the realm of technology. Kotak Mahindra Bank, among others, has been directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to halt new customer acquisitions and credit card issuances due to serious deficiencies in digital operations. This move follows a significant scam at UCO Bank involving fraudulent fund transfers. While digitization has brought benefits, it also presents risks such as double-spending and fraud. Other banks, like HDFC Bank, have faced similar bans from RBI in the past. The problem extends beyond India, with examples like Singapore's DBS Group experiencing tech-related issues. With a surge in digital transactions, concerns about cybersecurity and fraud are mounting, prompting regulatory action. However, there's a need for a deeper understanding and updating of technology regulations by regulators like RBI to effectively combat emerging threats.

China, with its opaque government, reportedly spends a significant portion of GDP on industrial projects, focusing on advanced technologies and youth-driven research. Meanwhile, the US has passed bills aimed at substantial industrial investment, albeit less than China proportionally. The article highlights China's lead in critical technologies but also raises concerns about its economic management, including high investment levels and suppressed household consumption. It points out challenges such as debt accumulation, a deflating housing bubble, and overcapacity in future-focused industries. Additionally, it contrasts China's strategic industrial policy with India's less effective approach, emphasizing the importance of well-designed policies and international trade agreements.

Elon Musk's abrupt decision to skip a planned visit to India in favor of an unannounced trip to China signals a potential setback for New Delhi's ambitions. India had been banking on a "China plus one" strategy to attract manufacturing investment amid global tensions. However, data suggests that India has struggled to capitalize on this opportunity, with Vietnam emerging as a more favored destination for relocating supply chains. China, meanwhile, is doubling down on its efforts to dominate future industries through massive investments in advanced manufacturing. The article highlights India's challenges in becoming a preferred manufacturing hub and the potential consequences of missing out on the "China plus one" window of opportunity.

The article discusses concerns about deepfakes spreading misinformation, particularly in the context of Indian politics. It mentions a Parliamentarian from Karnataka who claims to be the victim of a digitally-crafted fake video amid a sexual-assault controversy. Additionally, home minister Amit Shah has rejected a clip that appears to show him promising to end reservations for caste groups, leading to arrests of individuals allegedly linked to the opposition. The article emphasizes the importance of discerning truth from falsehood in a tech-driven world and highlights the need for people to become more skeptical of digital content.

### [Raise funds off intellectual property: Opportunity knocks](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/raise-funds-off-intellectual-property-opportunity-knocks-11713109984797.html)

Intellectual Property (IP) financing is emerging as a significant financial innovation, offering IP holders the means to monetize their intangible assets for capital. Beneficial for R&D-intensive ventures, it allows for quicker recovery of R&D costs, thus promoting innovation and economic growth. India, being a major startup hub, stands to gain from embracing IP financing, which could attract substantial capital given its strong global standing in trademark and patent registrations. However, challenges persist, such as financial institutions' difficulty in valuing IP assets, lack of secondary markets, and regulatory hurdles like Basel III not recognizing IP as suitable collateral. Countries like Singapore and Jamaica are advancing the industry with valuation guidelines and training, while recommendations suggest development banks and governments share IP financing risks. As traditional bank funding models falter, IP financing's potential revolution in finance beckons, with India poised to benefit by adopting policy changes that improve IP asset valuation and risk management. Shuchi Agrawal of Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy underscores the importance of this shift for India's economic progress.

### [Iran attacks Israel: Biden’s big power test](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/iran-attacks-israel-biden-s-big-power-test-11713119933703.html)

In a significant escalation, Iran launched numerous drones and missiles at Israel, with most being intercepted, resulting in minimal damage and a child's injury. This was in retaliation for Israel's attack on Iran's consulate in Syria. The UN received Iran's message that the issue is now closed. The incident presents an opportunity for de-escalation, with the US rejoining Israel's defense. However, the risk of further escalation threatens to increase regional tension and oil prices. President Biden faces the challenge of persuading Israel to refrain from retaliating to prevent a broader conflict in West Asia, which could trigger an oil crisis amid global economic recovery efforts. Biden's political standing is already affected by the war's civilian casualties and the growing anti-US sentiment in the Islamic world due to the Gaza War's toll. His task is to de-escalate the situation for the benefit of all.

### [The elderly men who run the world give us hope](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-elderly-men-who-run-the-world-give-us-hope-11713108936739.html)

The article reflects on the societal perception of elderly men, particularly those in positions of power. It questions the disdain for ageing men who don't fade into obscurity, highlighting that ageing is inevitable for everyone. The author ponders over Joe Biden's thoughts at 81, running for office again, and the mockery from Donald Trump, who is 77. The piece criticizes the world's contradictory stance of sneering at elderly men's ambition while simultaneously handing them control. It contrasts the active desire for power and respect in some elderly with others who retreat into a mundane retirement. The writer challenges the expectation for the elderly to lead uneventful lives and points out the discrimination they face solely due to age. Citing Clint Eastwood's productivity at 93, the article argues that health in old age is attainable and that the elderly's longing, including for sex, is natural. It concludes by questioning the overrated smartness of the young and suggests learning from the enduring spirit of ambitious elderly men. Manu Joseph, the author, is a journalist and creator of the Netflix series 'Decoupled'.

The article discusses the ongoing debate over the 'Basel 3 Endgame' banking regulations. It highlights the misleading rhetoric used by some politicians and bankers, who claim that these rules would limit lending and harm the poor, while in reality, the regulations aim to make banks rely more on equity rather than borrowing. The author, Anat R. Admati, criticizes the banking sector's resistance to such regulations, which are designed to reduce financial risks and improve system stability. Admati also reflects on the banking industry's influence over policy decisions and the persistence of deceptive practices that undermine democracies. The piece underscores the need for more transparent and effective banking regulations to prevent financial crises and ensure social benefits. Admati's work, including a book co-authored with Martin Hellwig, challenges the banking status quo and calls for political action to reform the system.

The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the growing influence of G20's large emerging markets (EMEs) on the global economy. Over the last two decades, EMEs have become more integrated globally, creating significant economic 'spillovers'. Contrary to the traditional view that spillovers flow only from advanced to emerging markets, recent trends show that EMEs, especially China, India, Brazil, Russia, and Mexico, are affecting their neighbors' economies just as much as the US does. This shift challenges the long-held 'exorbitant privilege' of the US dollar and suggests a more interconnected global economic landscape. The article emphasizes the need for collective action to minimize the negative impacts of such spillovers, acknowledging that in a globalized world, countries' economic policies are inevitably intertwined.

US President Joe Biden's previously unqualified support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under scrutiny amid the Gaza conflict. Criticism has grown over the US's role in supplying munitions for Gaza's bombardment, leading to political repercussions for Biden, particularly among young Americans and cease-fire advocates. Bernie Sanders has called for a halt to military aid to Israel, a sentiment echoed by 52% of US adults in a YouGov survey. Biden's political dilemma is exacerbated by opposing interests with Netanyahu, who benefits from the crisis. The Gaza situation and its impact on Biden's support from both Muslim and Jewish voters in key states add to the complexity, with potential political costs for any shift in his stance on Israel.

India's engagement with Southeast Asia, as emphasized by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's recent tour, is pivotal for its Indo-Pacific aspirations. Despite historical ties and growing economic links, such as the India-Asean Free Trade Agreement, India's influence in the region is perceived as minimal. Strategic partnerships, particularly with Vietnam and the Philippines, focus on security, counter-terrorism, and maritime surveillance. The Act East policy, initiated in 2014, aims to strengthen India's role in regional geopolitics through economic integration and cultural ties. Challenges include Asean's divided response to Chinese actions in the South China Sea. India advocates for a rules-based order, as seen in Jaishankar's support for the Philippines' sovereignty and adherence to UNCLOS. India's non-claimant stance in the South China Sea dispute underscores its commitment to maritime security and regional stability, promoting cooperation and connectivity to maintain freedom of navigation.

Elon Musk is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on April 22, possibly leading to Tesla announcing a manufacturing plant in India. Despite being overtaken briefly by China's BYD Auto as the world's largest electric carmaker, Tesla faces challenges including lower growth in sales and reduced car deliveries. India's evolving EV market presents an opportunity for Tesla, especially with the government's reduced import tariffs on EVs. With Tesla's market value decreasing and competition rising, the Indian market could be crucial for its future success.

The article reflects on the contrast between the vibrant election atmosphere in Turkey and the lack of excitement in India's upcoming general elections. It delves into the influence of money and muscle power in Indian politics, citing historical campaigns like "One note; one vote" and the rise of wealthy politicians. It highlights the prevalence of criminality among elected officials and the increasing expenditure in elections, despite attempts to regulate spending. The piece questions the motives behind election donations and the apprehension surrounding addressing this issue in the world's largest democracy.

Vodafone-Idea (VIL), India's third-largest telecom, is poised for a potential turnaround, planning to raise ₹45,000 crore. The immediate strategy includes a ₹20,000 crore raise through a follow-on public offer (FPO) and rights issue, with the FPO aiming for ₹18,000 crore at a discounted share price. The Aditya Birla Group will also invest ₹2,075 crore. These funds will boost VIL's 4G and 5G network expansion. Despite a subscriber base of 220 million, VIL trails behind Jio and Airtel, who lead with extensive 5G networks and higher average revenues per user (Arpu). VIL's growth could hinge on converting its 2G users to 4G/5G, potentially increasing its Arpu significantly. However, with a net debt of over ₹2.15 trillion, analysts suggest VIL needs to raise an additional ₹65,000 crore within two years to sustain competition. The upcoming fund infusion offers a chance for revival and to maintain a competitive market against the prevailing duopoly.

The article discusses a significant legal battle involving the Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL), owned by Anil Ambani, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). Here's a summary:

- The **Supreme Court of India** reversed its own previous decision, a Delhi High Court order, and an arbitration award, rejecting DAMEPL's ₹8,000-crore claim against DMRC.
- The dispute centers on a 22.7-km metro rail project, India's first under a public-private partnership (PPP), which was completed in 2011 without exceeding its ₹5,700 crore budget.
- DMRC handled civil works, while DAMEPL was responsible for system works. However, DAMEPL terminated the project in 2013 due to safety issues and disagreements over fares and punctuality.
- DAMEPL won an arbitration claim for ₹8,009.38 crore, but this was contested through various levels of the Indian court system, with the Supreme Court ultimately setting aside the award.
- The case highlights the complexities and risks of PPP infrastructure projects in India, with concerns about the drafting of contracts and the potential discouragement of private companies from bidding on such projects.
- The Supreme Court's decision contradicts the Finance Ministry's guidelines for state-owned companies not to contest adverse arbitration awards, aiming to create a non-adversarial climate for arbitration in India.
- The article suggests that less than 5% of PPPs are canceled worldwide, but the impact of this verdict could be significant for future infrastructure projects in India.

### [Delhi Airport Metro Express: Justice on a slow track](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/delhi-airport-metro-express-justice-on-a-slow-track-11712846304823.html)

The article discusses the challenges faced by foreign investors in India due to lengthy and often unsatisfactory judicial processes. It highlights a specific case where the Supreme Court of India reversed its own decision from 2021, which had approved an arbitration award to Reliance Infrastructure related to the Delhi Airport Metro Express. The case, which dates back 12 years, involves the private operator of the airport line service withdrawing due to the poor quality of construction by Delhi Metro, which they claimed compromised the project's viability.

In 2017, a tribunal awarded damages to Reliance Infra, but this was overturned by the Delhi High Court in 2019. The Supreme Court reinstated the award in 2021, only to reverse its decision recently, deeming the award illegal and stating it imposed an excessive liability on a public utility. This flip-flop in judicial decisions contributes to the uncertainty that deters investors, as consistent and predictable legal outcomes are generally preferred for investment decisions. The article suggests that such unpredictability in the judicial system can negatively impact India's reputation among foreign investors.

The article discusses the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation's (GCMMF) recent partnership with the Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) to introduce Amul branded milk in the US. This marks the first time Amul's fresh milk is launched outside India, signaling potential global expansion for the brand and setting a precedent for other Indian cooperatives.

The article traces the history of India's cooperative movement, highlighting its significance post-independence and the establishment of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to replicate the successful Anand pattern of milk cooperatives nationwide. Despite challenges post-economic reforms in 1991, the cooperative sector, including GCMMF and IFFCO, has thrived, with over 850,000 cooperatives in various fields.

The success of Amul, under the leadership of Verghese Kurien, is attributed to his vision and political support, which transformed India into a major milk producer. The article suggests that Indian cooperatives can learn from global counterparts like New Zealand's Fonterra and partner with organizations like Cooperative Business NZ for international growth.

It proposes selecting a group of 'champion cooperatives' for global recognition, akin to the 'navaratna' concept for public enterprises. While challenging, this strategy could foster employment, wealth generation, and national development.

The article discusses the significance of the Question Hour (QH) in the Indian Legislature, a period during which parliamentarians can question ministers on policy matters. It highlights that while QH is a critical tool for accountability and policy scrutiny, it has not received much scholarly attention.

As India nears general elections, the article examines data from the last four Lok Sabha terms to understand patterns in the 'starred' questions asked by opposition parties. The analysis reveals that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was more active in questioning the government than the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asking more questions when it was in opposition compared to the Indian National Congress (INC).

The article also presents a 'questions-per-seat' metric to assess the effectiveness of the opposition's role in QH, showing that the opposition was weakest in 2014-19. It further explores the performance of individual parties and notes that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was the most active in questioning, while other parties like the Telugu Desam Party and Shiv Sena have seen fluctuations in their questioning intensity.

Additionally, the article points out that the focus of QH queries shifts with changes in government, reflecting the policy priorities of the ruling coalition. It suggests extending this research to state-level assemblies and developing metrics to evaluate opposition performance more comprehensively.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of QH research in understanding the legislative process and its impact on policymaking, hoping it will increase political parties' awareness of their accountability to voters.

### [A four-day work week won't be on the horizon for decades](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/a-four-day-work-week-wont-be-on-the-horizon-for-decades-11712846708498.html)

The article discusses the debate around the concept of a four-day work week in the United States. It mentions that some billionaires and Senator Bernie Sanders see a shorter work week as part of America's future, with Sanders proposing legislation to reduce the standard work week to 32 hours. The article expresses skepticism about the immediate feasibility of this change, citing concerns about economic harm and questioning the efficiency of such a policy.

The term "four-day work week" can refer to either compressing 40 hours into four days or working only 32 hours across four days. While there's an argument that a shorter work week could maintain productivity due to less time wasted, this may not hold true for labor-intensive jobs. France's experiment with a 35-hour work week did not yield the expected benefits in employment or happiness.

The Sanders proposal, which would lower the threshold for overtime pay without reducing wages for fewer hours worked, could impose a significant burden on the economy. It might benefit high-skill workers in profitable companies but could lead to closures, price increases, or increased automation in firms with lower margins.

Historically, the full-time work week has been 40 hours since 1938 in the US, but work hours have been decreasing as technology and wealth increase. The article suggests that while technology has made people more productive, it doesn't always result in fewer work hours, especially for high-skill workers who have seen greater gains from working more.

The article concludes that while we may eventually work fewer hours, it will take decades before a 32-hour work week becomes the standard. Forcing this change prematurely could have negative consequences. The author expresses more confidence in the economic predictions of John Maynard Keynes than in the proposals of Bernie Sanders, implying that a natural progression towards fewer work hours is preferable to legislative enforcement.

### [Investing for absolute returns can liberate investors](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/investing-for-absolute-returns-can-liberate-investors-11712846769506.html)

The article discusses the transition from amateur equity investing to institutional investing, highlighting the importance of 'index weight' in portfolio management. Initially, the author was unfamiliar with the concept of 'weight' in the context of a stock's significance within a benchmark index. Institutional investing in India is typically relative return investing, where performance is measured against a benchmark.

The author explains that institutional investors focus on 'heavyweights' or stocks with significant index representation, like HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and Larsen & Toubro. These stocks may not offer the best returns but are crucial for the fund's relative performance. The terms 'overweight' and 'underweight' are introduced, indicating whether a stock's portfolio weight exceeds or falls short of its index weight.

The article also touches on the tendency of portfolios to mirror the benchmark, with the largest funds owning the five index heavyweights. It contrasts the goals of retail investors, who aim to beat inflation, with institutional investors, who have various financial obligations.

The benefits of absolute-return investing are discussed, such as efficient time allocation and focusing on areas of competence. Absolute-return investing requires a different approach, emphasizing risk management and the potential need to hedge against short-term market downturns.

In markets like emerging-market equities, where returns have been low, the author suggests that an absolute-return approach may be necessary to achieve significant gains. The article concludes by encouraging a shift from relative to absolute return strategies to meet the diverse objectives of investors.

India's civil aviation sector is experiencing a period of difficulty, leading to a significant increase in airfares, particularly on busy routes where prices have risen by up to 30%. This surge is attributed to a combination of factors:

- **Vistara**, a Tata-run airline, has reduced its operations by 25-30 flights daily, which is about 10% of its total capacity, due to a pilot shortage. This reduction has had a considerable impact on the market, which was already facing capacity constraints.
- **IndiGo** has had to ground several planes because of engine issues, yet there remains a strong demand for air travel, a sign of recovery following the pandemic.
- Rising oil prices have led to increased fuel costs, contributing to the higher airfares.
- The aviation market is currently dominated by a **Tata-IndiGo duopoly** after Tata Group's acquisition of Air India in 2022. This lack of competition tends to result in higher prices.

The article suggests that it is uncertain when airfares will decrease, and expresses hope that the wait will not be long. The rest of the text appears to be promotional content for the Mint app and website, encouraging readers to subscribe or log in for additional features.

Here's a summary of the article:

**India's Economic Growth:**
- The **S&P BSE Sensex** surpassed **75,000 points**, indicating a tripling of the market since the Modi government began a decade ago.
- Market capitalization reached **₹400 trillion**, reflecting a significant increase in investor participation, with demat accounts rising from 20 million to over 150 million in the past decade.
- Post-pandemic, there's been a surge in equity investment, with mutual funds investing **₹19,000 crore** monthly, a substantial increase from **₹2,000 crore** in 2014.

**Wealth Disparity and Political Implications:**
- Despite the growth, wealth disparity remains, with no reliable data on socio-economic levels.
- The stock market's capitalization suggests that the wealthy and middle-class primarily own the equity, leaving most of the population out.
- Wealth distribution has become a political issue, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi proposing a wealth survey for redistribution.

**Proposed Solutions for Inclusivity:**
- To address wealth concentration, the article suggests expanding equity ownership to every household.
- A novel privatization strategy could involve transferring PSU shares to 'Jan Dhan' demat accounts for families without equity.
- This approach aims to provide dividends and encourage broader participation in wealth creation, though it requires overcoming regulatory hurdles and the digital divide.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need for inclusive growth for sustainability and proposes innovative ways to involve more citizens in the equity market. It also touches on the political discourse around wealth distribution in India.

The article discusses the dynamic between startups and large corporations in India, highlighting the agility and innovative spirit of startups as a lesson for larger entities. Here's a summary:

**Mindset of Build, Break, Learn, and Rebuild:**
Startups are characterized by their willingness to experiment, learn, and pivot based on market changes. They embrace a 'challenger' mindset, unlike large corporations that often prefer maintaining the status quo. The article cites Netflix and Myntra as examples of successful pivots.

**Bias for Agility and Action:**
Startups excel in making swift decisions and taking action, a trait that gives them a competitive edge. In contrast, large firms are slowed down by complex processes and systems. Streamlining these processes can help larger companies become more agile.

**Obsessive Customer Focus:**
Startups maintain a close connection with the market and customer needs, which informs their decision-making. Large organizations tend to have a more distant and sanitized view of the market, which can be improved by direct engagement with customers.

**Organization-First Approach:**
Startups often have a centralized decision-making process around the founder, but as they grow, they need to balance autonomy and accountability. Large companies can learn from this by creating structures that align with overall business objectives rather than siloed interests.

**Personal Connect and Collective Purpose:**
The close-knit nature of startups fosters camaraderie and a shared purpose. Large companies can try to maintain this atmosphere by implementing mini-business structures and cross-functional teams.

**Owner’s Mindset:**
The article argues that beyond structural changes, fostering an ownership mindset among employees is crucial. This involves giving employees a stake in the company and involving them in strategic decisions, which can make them feel more invested in the company's success.

The authors suggest that while large corporations can learn much from startups, the reverse is also true, which will be explored in a subsequent article. The views expressed are personal to the authors.

### [We should bridge the AI-human trust gap on ESG reporting](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-should-bridge-the-ai-human-trust-gap-on-esg-reporting-11712749961286.html)

The article discusses the dual nature of AI in the context of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting. It highlights the **trust gap** and **blind acceptance** of AI, noting that while AI can automate data collation and analysis for ESG reports, there's debate over whether it can match human quality and trustworthiness.

**Pro-AI arguments** include AI's efficiency, accuracy, and ability to process large data sets, identify patterns, and provide predictive insights, which can enhance transparency and accountability in ESG reporting. AI is also seen as a way to eliminate human biases, standardize reports, and free up human resources for strategic tasks.

**Counterarguments** focus on AI's lack of nuanced understanding and the 'black box' nature of AI tools, which can obscure decision-making processes. Critics argue for the importance of human analysts who can interpret complex data, provide qualitative assessments, and add credibility to reports.

The article suggests that **building trust** in AI-generated information requires transparency about AI algorithms and data sources, human oversight to validate results, stakeholder engagement to co-create ESG narratives, and continuous learning to refine AI algorithms. It emphasizes that while AI offers unprecedented capabilities, the human touch remains indispensable for interpreting complex ESG issues and engaging stakeholders. Ethical considerations and adaptability are also crucial for ensuring fairness and accountability in AI-generated ESG reporting.

### [Fairness: the hidden currency of the workplace](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/fairness-the-hidden-currency-of-the-workplace-11712755409549.html)

The article discusses the concept of fairness, particularly in the workplace, and how it impacts various aspects of life. It begins with the viral story of Brittany Pietsch, who was laid off from Cloudflare in a manner that many perceived as unfair. The article then explores the human preoccupation with fairness, citing studies that show people often prioritize fair treatment over monetary gain.

It highlights that fairness is a concern not only for employees but also for managers, CEOs, and customers. For instance, a judge ruled against Elon Musk's compensation package at Tesla, and a study showed that CEOs value being rewarded fairly. The article also touches on consumer reactions to price surges during high demand, like Uber fares or essential goods during emergencies, and notes that people generally support anti-price-gouging laws.

The COVID-19 pandemic is mentioned as an example of how fairness can be subjective, with remote work being beneficial for some but highlighting inequities for others. The article concludes by suggesting that while fairness can be complex, ensuring transparent processes can help manage these challenges.

### [10-year plan: Can the Indian rupee go global without 100% convertibility?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/10year-plan-can-the-indian-rupee-go-global-without-100-convertibility-11712673405268.html)

The article discusses India's ambition to make the Indian rupee a globally recognized and accepted currency. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tasked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with developing a 10-year strategy to achieve this goal, given the projection that India's economy will be among the top three in the world soon.

**Key Points:**
- **Global Currency Advantages:** A globalized rupee could lower credit costs in India due to increased overseas demand for trade and reserves.
- **Full Convertibility:** For the rupee to become a global currency, India's economy must globalize, and the rupee must become fully convertible.
- **Past Concerns:** Historical fears of capital account convertibility and the Asian currency crisis of 1997 have kept India cautious, maintaining partial convertibility with caps and restrictions.
- **Prerequisites for Convertibility:** A fully convertible rupee requires fiscal discipline to avoid inflation, a resilient banking system, transparent financial sector, and stable external balances.
- **RBI's Role:** The RBI must ensure the rupee's external value is market-driven without distortion.

The article also highlights the potential of RBI's e-rupee, a central bank digital currency (CBDC), to gain an edge in global markets if designed for minimal cost and maximum privacy. The e-rupee could start with diaspora use for low-cost transfers and expand to other commercial uses if it remains free of geopolitical sanctions. As RBI's direct liability, the e-rupee could attract international users with features like programmability for routine payments. However, for the e-rupee to succeed globally, RBI must establish itself as a credible issuer and maintain macroeconomic stability as advised in 1997.

### [Ola’s India refocus makes sense](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/olas-india-refocus-makes-sense-11712679091239.html)

Ola Cabs, a major ride-hailing service, is exiting its markets in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand to concentrate on electrification over globalization. The company has begun notifying users of the closure, with the Australian operations ending on 12 April. Ola's strategy now focuses on premium rides and electrifying its fleet of cabs and two-wheelers, especially in the face of competition from BluSmart's electric fleet in Delhi and Bengaluru. To strengthen its position in the Indian market, Ola has also introduced subscription plans for auto-rickshaw drivers, similar to those of competitors like Namma Yatri and Rapido, which do not involve booking fees or commissions. This approach aims to improve the connection between rides and riders, indicating Ola's commitment to adapting and growing within the Indian market.

### [We need urgent global talks on the EU’s carbon adjustment import charges](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-need-urgent-global-talks-on-the-eu-s-carbon-adjustment-import-charges-11712673526485.html)

The article discusses the European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is designed to align the carbon cost of imports with that of domestic products to meet climate-action commitments. Starting from 2026, EU importers will need to purchase CBAM certificates for products in five sectors, reflecting the carbon price difference between the EU and the exporter country. This aims to address the challenges of maintaining industrial competitiveness and preventing carbon leakage.

The CBAM focuses on emissions in production and the domestic carbon pricing of the exporting countries. For instance, if the EU carbon price is $100 per tonne and Australia's is $34, Australian exporters would pay a CBAM charge of $66 per tonne. India, lacking a direct carbon pricing system, will rely on EU auditors to assess the cost of carbon based on domestic regulations.

The article also touches on the IMF's recommendation for differential carbon pricing based on economic development stages, which contrasts with the CBAM's equalization approach. Critics argue that the CBAM may not significantly reduce emissions and fails to address the need for technology transfer to decarbonize imports. The CBAM's limited initial coverage may expand, affecting the entire production cycle of traded products and potentially conflicting with UNFCCC climate targets and free trade agreements.

The authors suggest that without effective negotiations at the UNFCCC and World Trade Organization, the CBAM could adversely impact industries in developing countries due to high compliance costs and carbon price differentials. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for substantive talks to find solutions that won't burden developing nations' industries.

### [IPL cricket is a fine example of free-market capitalism](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ipl-cricket-is-a-fine-example-of-free-market-capitalism-11712673813751.html)

The article discusses the Indian Premier League (IPL) and its resemblance to free-market capitalism, as demonstrated by the high auction price of cricketer Mitchell Starc. It highlights the IPL's operation similar to a corporate sector, with team owners, audiences, and sponsors representing shareholders, consumers, and investors, respectively. Players are likened to employees who are well-compensated for their performance and travel, akin to corporate executives.

The article also compares the bidding for players to an IPO, where a player's performance can be unpredictable despite high investments. It mentions the participation of foreign players and coaches, reflecting a free-market economy's openness to international talent.

The introduction of an 'impact player' in matches is compared to MNCs customizing products for local markets. The analysis of matches by experts is paralleled with economic analyses in newspapers and business channels.

Advertising in the IPL follows the general rules of the market, with some exceptions like surrogate ads for tobacco products by former cricketers. The rise of gaming apps associated with the IPL is seen as an extension of the market, where skill-based gaming is distinguished from gambling.

In conclusion, the article asserts that the IPL exemplifies capitalism, where market forces dictate outcomes, and stakeholders can choose to participate or not. The ecosystem around the IPL, including various businesses, thrives due to the value created by the tournament. The views expressed are personal to the author.

### [China will confront the dreaded middle-income trap this decade](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/china-will-confront-the-dreaded-middle-income-trap-this-decade-11712663109975.html)

The article discusses China's economic challenges and the risk of it falling into the 'middle-income trap,' a situation where a country's growth stagnates after reaching middle-income levels and fails to transition to high-income status. Here's a summary:

- **China's Growth Slowdown**: After decades of near 10% growth, China's economy has slowed, with growth falling to 5.2% last year and projected to drop to 3.4% by 2028. This slowdown could lead to the middle-income trap.

- **Structural Issues**: The slowdown is attributed to structural factors such as an ageing population, a real estate bubble burst, high debt levels (nearly 300% of GDP), and a shift from market reforms to state capitalism.

- **De-globalization and Protectionism**: China's export-led growth model is challenged by global de-globalization trends, Western technology sanctions, and a domestic imbalance between high savings and low consumption rates.

- **Need for a New Model**: The old growth model based on manufacturing and exports is no longer viable. China is encouraged to focus on domestic services and private consumption to avoid overcapacity and deflationary pressures.

- **Policy and Leadership Challenges**: There's uncertainty whether Chinese leaders fully understand the need to shift to a more sustainable economic model. President Xi Jinping's recent actions suggest a continued preference for state capitalism, raising doubts about China's ability to implement necessary reforms.

- **Outlook**: The article concludes that China's actual policies in the coming year will indicate whether it can avoid the middle-income trap and achieve more robust growth.

This summary captures the essence of the article's analysis on China's economic situation and the critical need for policy changes to ensure sustainable growth. If you need more details or have specific questions, feel free to ask!

### [Aadhaar-based age tokens can solve a privacy problem](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/aadhaarbased-age-tokens-can-solve-a-privacy-problem-11712663231351.html)

The article discusses the challenges and potential solutions related to the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023** in India, particularly focusing on **Section 9**. This section requires data fiduciaries to obtain verifiable parental consent before processing a child's personal data. The act mandates businesses to verify whether personal data belongs to a child, which introduces significant friction and privacy concerns as it may require everyone to present identity documents for age verification.

The author expresses concern that this requirement could disrupt the seamless nature of the internet and give businesses a pretext to collect more personal information than necessary. The article also notes that while the intent is to protect children from inappropriate content online—a concern shared globally—the implementation of such age-gating measures could compromise privacy.

As a solution, the article suggests using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, a cryptographic method that can confirm age without revealing other personal details. It proposes using India's Aadhaar system to generate ZKP tokens for age verification, allowing users to prove their age without disclosing additional information. This approach could streamline the process and preserve user privacy, potentially serving as a model for other countries facing similar challenges. The article concludes by highlighting the global relevance of finding effective age-verification methods that respect privacy.

### [Five reasons why we are looking beyond the RBI’s hawkish talk](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/five-reasons-why-we-are-looking-beyond-the-rbi-s-hawkish-talk-11712639870364.html)

The article provides an analysis of India's current economic situation and the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy stance. Here's a summary:

- **India's Economy**: The country is experiencing strong GDP growth, controlled inflation, and manageable deficits. The RBI is in a favorable position regarding policy.
  
- **RBI's Decision**: The RBI has kept interest rates and its policy stance unchanged, which was expected. Despite this, the RBI has made some hawkish comments, indicating no rate cuts soon.

- **Rate Cut Speculation**: The article discusses five reasons why rate cuts might happen sooner than expected:
  1. **No Forward Guidance**: The RBI has avoided giving forward guidance to prevent market volatility, meaning any policy change could be unexpected.
  2. **Inflation Target**: The RBI aims for a 4% inflation target. With a downward revision in inflation projections and potential for an undershoot, there's room for easing.
  3. **Growth Concerns**: While headline growth is strong, concerns about its sustainability and composition persist, with rural demand and private capital expenditure remaining weak.
  4. **Policy Stance as Indicator**: Historically, the RBI's policy stance has not been a reliable indicator of future actions. A subtle policy shift towards more liquidity suggests a pivot.
  5. **Real Policy Rates**: Current real policy rates leave room for recalibration, even if neutral real rates are slightly higher than previous estimates.

- **Outlook**: The authors argue that while the RBI's rhetoric is hawkish, its inflation forecasts and actions are more dovish and neutral, respectively. They anticipate a rate cut in August, earlier than the market consensus of October or later.

Certainly! Here's a summary of the article:

**Wipro's CEO Transition:**
- **Thierry Delaporte**, CEO of Wipro Ltd, has unexpectedly left the company 15 months before his term was due to end.
- Despite the abrupt departure, the company's stock fell by only 1%, indicating that shareholders are not overly concerned.
- **Srinivas Pallia**, a long-time Wipro employee, has been appointed as the new CEO.

**Performance Under Delaporte:**
- Delaporte's tenure saw Wipro's shares increase by 116%, outperforming TCS and Infosys during the same period.
- However, despite acquisitions and operational overhauls, Wipro's profit growth was modest at 5.5%, and it faced management challenges.

**Challenges Ahead:**
- Wipro's performance has been lackluster compared to its peers, with a potential revenue drop for the fiscal year.
- The company has experienced executive discontent and issues with integrating new businesses.
- The IT sector faces threats from AI and changing market demands, which Pallia will need to navigate.

**Looking Forward:**
- Rishad Premji, Wipro’s executive chairman, had previously expressed confidence in Delaporte.
- Pallia is expected to stabilize the company and adapt to the evolving IT landscape, including the potential impact of AI on services.

The article also mentions the need for Wipro to quickly adapt to new market conditions and the strategic decisions that Pallia will have to make in order to ensure the company's success. It concludes with prompts related to the Mint app and website, encouraging readers to engage with their content.

The article discusses the rising income and wealth inequality in India, as reported by the World Inequality Lab (WIL) in their recent publication titled "Income and Wealth Inequality in India 1922-2023: Rise of the Billionaire Raj." The report indicates that the top 1% of India's population receives nearly 23% of the national income and holds 40% of the wealth, marking the worst state of inequality in 100 years. The number of dollar-billionaires in India has risen to 271, with 94 added in 2023 alone.

The report, co-authored by Thomas Piketty, utilizes data from income-tax filings, which are considered more reliable than survey responses, though it acknowledges limitations due to the small fraction of the population that files returns. Inequality in India is not limited to income and wealth but extends to access to quality education, healthcare, basic amenities, and job opportunities. The unemployment report by the International Labour Organization and Institute for Human Development highlights the challenges of youth unemployment and wage stagnation.

The article presents two contrasting views on addressing inequality. One suggests focusing on high growth to generate revenue for redistribution policies, as exemplified by India's free-food scheme. The opposing view argues that the growth process exacerbates inequality, pointing to the disparity between India and China's economic growth and its impact on their populations.

The debate also touches on the Kuznets hypothesis, which posits that inequality initially increases with economic growth due to urbanization and industrialization but eventually decreases as development reaches a certain threshold. However, the evidence in India's case over the past three decades is mixed, with a 'winner takes all' dynamic leading to persistent inequality and limited social mobility.

The article concludes by suggesting that reducing inequality could potentially enhance growth in India, not just through welfare spending but also by investing in education and human capital development. It emphasizes the need for a growth process that promotes both economic expansion and social equity.

The article discusses the contrasting attention between gold and Bitcoin, particularly when both hit record highs. While Bitcoin's surge was widely covered in UK media, gold's rise was not, despite its long history as a valuable asset. The article notes that gold is seen as old money, with a history dating back to 550 BCE, and its physical form is now more likely to be found in museums than in circulation.

Investor interest in gold can be gauged by the flow into global gold ETFs, which saw outflows for nine months until the end of February, indicating a lack of interest. However, there are signs of a shift, with reduced outflows and small inflows into Asian ETFs.

Emerging-market savers and central banks have been significant buyers of gold, particularly since the start of the Ukraine war. They purchase physical gold as a long-term investment to hedge against political risk and to support their currencies, especially as the value of the US dollar and US government bonds becomes more uncertain.

Central banks are described as volume buyers and long-term holders of gold, suggesting a potential new era where strategic buyers could limit the supply and increase demand. If retail investors in the West, who currently have little exposure to gold, begin investing, the price of gold could continue to rise.

The article suggests that investing in gold ETFs and miners could be beneficial, as the sector's market capitalization is relatively low compared to its potential, and gold remains a reliable hedge against various risks. It concludes that if gold is a suitable hedge for central banks, it should be considered for personal portfolios as well. ©bloomberg

The Congress party has faced setbacks in Himachal Pradesh with the defeat of its Rajya Sabha candidate and the resignation of a prominent member. However, the author argues that the party is still a force to be reckoned with.

Recalling past political history, the author notes that even the most powerful leaders have faced setbacks and that the Congress has shown resilience in the past. Despite its decline in vote share, the Congress remains a significant presence in several states and has a strong organizational structure.

Rahul Gandhi remains the most popular leader of the party, but the author argues that the party needs to address its weaknesses, such as its reliance on "old loyalists." The author suggests that the Congress should emulate the BJP's willingness to appoint younger and more dynamic leaders to key positions. The party may also need to consider forming flexible coalitions to remain politically relevant.

Despite the notion that farming is "unremunerative," many other professions also face financial challenges. From entrepreneurship to entertainment, most individuals struggle for success. Even among salaried employees, few earn substantial incomes. Entrepreneurship carries inherent risk, as profits cannot be guaranteed due to competition. However, entrepreneurs who achieve success create an illusion of prosperity, motivating others to pursue similar paths that often lead to disappointment. The struggles of land-holding farmers, who are entrepreneurs seeking growth, stem from their high standards for remuneration. Moreover, some professions can become more lucrative through the creation of superstars, such as in entertainment and sports.

The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23 reveals promising trends in India's economic growth. Over the past decade, monthly per capita expenditure increased significantly, with a 40% rise in rural areas and 33.5% in urban areas. Notably, the rural-urban divide has narrowed, dropping from an 83.9% gap in 2011-12 to 71.2% in 2022-23.

The survey also indicates a decline in economic inequality, with the bottom 5% of the population experiencing faster consumption growth (9.2% rural and 10% urban) than the top 5% (8% rural and 6.6% urban). This inclusive growth is further evidenced by rising MPCE/GNI ratios for lower-income groups.

The HCES attributes these positive developments to investments in infrastructure and empowerment programs, such as rural road expansion, women's collectives, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The survey highlights the impact of government-provided free-of-cost items, underscoring the improvement in living standards beyond what consumption data suggests.

While the survey provides valuable insights, the authors note that future iterations could enhance coverage of government support and update consumer baskets and poverty lines in line with evolving aspirations. Overall, the HCES 2022-23 results support the government's approach of growth through infrastructure and inclusion through empowerment.

Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks, has finally relinquished his grip on the company with the announcement of collective bargaining agreement discussions between the company and employee unions. Schultz's previous opposition to unions, compounded by labor law violations allegations during his tenure, led to sharp criticism. Despite Starbucks' progressive values, Schultz's anti-union stance alienated a younger generation prioritizing ethical consumption. Current CEO Laxman Narasimhan faces financial pressures and the risk of losing Gen-Z customers due to the union dispute. These factors suggest that Schultz's era at Starbucks is truly over, and the company is embracing a more progressive stance on labor relations.

India, the world's second-largest cotton producer, faces dwindling cotton yields due to pest resistance and unpredictable weather patterns. The decline in yield has prompted farmers to switch to other crops, threatening India's cotton production and self-sufficiency.

Revitalizing Bt Cotton: The initial success of genetically modified Bt cotton, designed to resist bollworms, has led to over-reliance. This dependency has resulted in stagnant and declining yields. To address this, the development and deployment of new Bt cotton varieties and more effective pesticides and insecticides is crucial.

Precision Agriculture: Cotton is water-intensive. Adopting precision agriculture techniques like drip irrigation can reduce water and fertilizer consumption while increasing yields. Targeted delivery of nutrients through precision agriculture is also seen as critical for yield improvement.

Embracing Digitization: Digitization holds immense potential for transforming cotton farming. Drones can scan large areas for pest infestations, while satellites can monitor weather patterns and provide farmers with essential information. AI and IoT can assist farmers in making informed decisions on crop protection and nutritional interventions.

Tried and Tested Practices: Pairing new technologies with tried and tested agricultural practices is essential. Weed infestation significantly affects yields. Implementing early-stage weed management, crop rotation, compost application, and green manuring can help minimize weed impact and support soil health.

Collective Action: Revitalizing India's cotton sector requires collective action, collaboration, and a shared commitment among stakeholders, including agricultural scientists, regulatory bodies, and the agrochemical industry. Technological advancements and sustainable farming practices are key to restoring India's position as a leading cotton producer and ensuring self-sufficiency.

On March 30th, NASA and ISRO will launch the NISAR satellite to gather data on Earth's ecosystems, ice masses, and sea level rise. The launch will utilize ISRO's GSLVF14 rocket, now nicknamed the "smart boy" after its successful launch.

The GSLVF14's cryogenic engine was developed by ISRO after US sanctions prevented technology transfers. Despite initial failures, the engine has been perfected and will significantly enhance India's aerospace industry. Its higher thrust-to-weight ratio allows for heavier payloads, paving the way for future Moon, Mars, and space station missions.

Cryogenic engines also play a role in the global satellite market and in military applications. India's mastery of this technology positions it as a major player in the aerospace sector and provides strategic comfort in a tense geopolitical climate.

DreamFolks, a key player in India's airport lounge market with a 75% share, has seen significant growth due to increasing air travel and consumer spending. The company's net profit soared 4.5 times in FY23, with revenue jumping 2.7 times.

Driven by rising domestic flights, digital payment adoption, and lounge demand, DreamFolks anticipates strong growth. Industry analysts predict a 15-fold increase in lounge visitors by 2030, with the Indian lounge market growing exponentially.

DreamFolks has launched an exclusive membership program offering premium travel and lifestyle services. The company's acquisition of Golfklik expands its premium offerings. Motilal Oswal initiates coverage with a "buy" rating and a target price of ₹650, citing the under-penetrated airline industry and DreamFolks' asset-light model.

The company's international expansion and partnerships with operators in Singapore and Russia provide growth potential. The brokerage expects the increasing adoption of bank cards to further benefit DreamFolks, as India has a low credit card penetration rate.

Delegation is crucial for effective management but can be challenging. Some managers avoid it due to mistrust, control issues, or previous startup experience. Others delegate for negative reasons like making difficult decisions or avoiding blame. Studies show that people tend to delegate when tasks are complex, affect others, or involve risk. To delegate effectively, establish a decision-making framework to clarify responsibilities. Distinguish between irreversible "type-1" and reversible "type-2" decisions. Allow subordinates some autonomy and avoid micromanaging, while maintaining involvement and decision-making authority when necessary. Like building abdominal muscles, delegation requires judgment, balance, and discipline.

The Supreme Court criticized the government for failing to enforce price controls for private hospitals, citing a 2010 law and 2012 rules that went unenforced. The court ordered a meeting between the union health secretary and state counterparts within a month to establish standard rates, using the Central Government Health Services scheme as an example.

The editorial criticizes the order as harmful to healthcare companies without benefiting citizens. It argues that India's healthcare system lacks a regulator to address price gouging and mistreatment. Instead of price controls, the editorial advocates for competition and effective enforcement of existing rules. The article also highlights the low effective tax rate for hospitals, with many claiming charitable status to avoid paying taxes.

Motion pictures, unlike cars, became widely popular in India due to their low cost of reaching a mass audience. Reliance and Disney have partnered in a joint venture (JV) to dominate the Indian entertainment market. The JV combines popular TV channels (Viacom and Star TV) with online platforms (Hotstar and JioCinema), giving them significant market share. Synergies with Reliance's retail and telecom presence are expected. The JV's success evokes a nostalgic connection to silent cinema's appeal and Disney's early animation, both of which relied on simplified storytelling and exaggerated movements.

* **Transparency and Fraud Detection:** AI can monitor election data for irregularities and identify patterns of fraudulent activity.
* **Security Enhancement:** AI algorithms can improve the security of electronic voting systems and detect potential cyber threats.
* **Personalized Voter Education:** Generative AI can create customized content on candidates and issues, empowering marginalized groups.
* **Accessibility for Disabled Voters:** AI-powered systems can assist voters with disabilities in casting their votes.
* **Social Media Analysis:** AI can analyze social media information to gauge public opinion and ensure diverse representation in political discussions.
* **Logistics Optimization:** AI can streamline voter registration and verification, reducing queues and saving costs.

The EU's recent digital policy initiatives, including the Digital Services Act (DSA) and a white-paper on infrastructure, aim to increase digital sovereignty and regulatory control. However, these initiatives conflict with the EU's goal of accelerating digital trade, particularly with India, as they impose complex compliance obligations for Indian internet companies.

The EU's strict regulatory approach, guided by legal sovereignty, limits exceptions for FTAs and creates uncertainty for trade. Additionally, the EU's ex-ante regulation approach for digital markets, echoed in India's plans, complicates negotiations due to different forecasts of future risks.

Despite these challenges, both the EU and India acknowledge the potential of digital technology for economic growth. India can leverage its software and services capabilities to support Europe's digital transformation, while Europe must find ways to reduce its reliance on foreign digital infrastructure.

To foster collaboration, India should focus on innovation-friendly regulations and advocate for liberalization of EU digital markets. The EU, in turn, should collaborate with India to decrease its dependence on foreign technology. Both parties need flexible policy strategies to remain relevant in the evolving digital landscape.

Amidst farmer unrest, there is concern about unfair fiscal treatment of states by the Union government. States receive a percentage of gross taxes collected by the Centre, as prescribed by Finance Commissions every five years. However, states allege that Central cesses and surcharges, which are excluded from the shareable revenue base, are used to reduce their statutory payments.

In 2022-23, states received 31.1% of the reported gross tax revenue, significantly below the adjusted target of 40.8%. This shortfall is attributed to the exclusion of cesses. Including statutory grants and non-statutory flows, states received a total of 57.8% of gross Central tax revenue (excluding GST cess).

The dissatisfaction arises from the statutory tax share being 8.3% below the target. The upcoming 16th Finance Commission is encouraged to incentivize the Centre to merge cesses into the basic tax structure in exchange for a lower aggregate share for states. The lesson is that the states' effective tax share can languish near its pre-ramp-up level if cesses and surcharges are excluded from the shareable revenue base.

### [Google's Gemini opens our eyes to who we really are: Guinea pigs for gen AI](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/googles-gemini-opens-our-eyes-to-who-we-really-are-guinea-pigs-for-gen-ai-11709207534655.html)

Google is facing accusations of biased AI due to its new chatbot Gemini generating images with excessive diversity, including non-Caucasian historical figures. This highlights the company's prioritization of growth over ethical considerations, as it has previously faced criticism for its photo-tagging tool labeling African-American individuals as apes. Google's focus on speed and market dominance has led to the release of faulty AI tools like Bard, despite warnings from employees. While Google claims responsible AI is a priority, its investment in AI ethics teams has been minimal, with safety testers significantly outnumbered by developers. Google's CEO advocates for regulation but acknowledges the lack of food inspectors in the AI industry. This allows the company to continue releasing problematic AI systems without immediate consequences, highlighting the need for a shift towards prioritizing safety and fairness.

### [There’s a lesson for India in the wars going on overseas](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/theres-a-lesson-for-india-in-the-wars-going-on-overseas-11709207573380.html)

War is complex and often difficult to understand, especially for those not directly involved. The ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East highlight this challenge.

Europe struggles to respond to Russian aggression against Ukraine, with no consensus on sending troops and concerns about rising costs. Despite US military aid, Putin aims to outlast Western support.

The conflict in the Middle East continues, with Israel facing pressure to avoid escalating violence in Gaza. Both Ukraine and Israel rely on external support, but waning international support and challenges in formulating coherent strategies make achieving their goals difficult. The article emphasizes the need for Indian policymakers to learn from these conflicts and prepare for such challenges.

### [The finite that hints at the infinite](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-finite-that-hints-at-the-infinite-11709201135481.html)

Visiting his college campus after many years, the author reflects on the passage of time and the difficulty in quantifying certain aspects of the campus and life in general. While some things, like student enrollment, can be easily counted, others, such as the number of trees, leaves, or bubbles in a cup of coffee, are much more challenging. Despite the apparent finiteness of these quantities, the act of counting them can be infinite due to the constant addition of new elements. The author suggests that this endlessness leads to the concept of "infinity" being applicable to seemingly finite numbers, such as grains of sand, stars, or cells in the body.

Reliance Industries and Walt Disney have merged their Indian TV and streaming businesses, creating an $8.5 billion joint venture that gives Reliance a 63.16% stake and Disney a 36.84% stake. The venture, valued at $8.5 billion, combines Viacom18's and Star India's assets, making it the largest media empire in India, capturing 40% of the market. The merger is expected to strengthen Disney's position in India's streaming market and provide access to over 750 million viewers. While the merger is likely to attract advertisers initially, concerns remain about its potential impact on consumer welfare. The Competition Commission of India will review the merger, raising questions about whether it may lead to reduced competition, higher costs, or potential data exploitation.

The BJP won 10 out of 15 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka. Notably, six Congress and three independent legislators in Himachal voted for the BJP's Harsh Mahajan, leading to a tie with Congress's Abhishek Manu Singhvi. A draw of lots resulted in Mahajan's victory. This raises questions about the Congress government's majority in Shimla. The BJP's total strength in Rajya Sabha will increase to 117, potentially giving it a majority (121) and strengthening its legislative hold and policy agenda.

The Supreme Court of India has reprimanded Patanjali Ayurved for making false claims about its products curing diseases. The court found that Patanjali had violated its orders to refrain from such advertisements. The court also criticized the government for failing to act against the company. Patanjali's products have not been scientifically validated for their claimed benefits, and the court has barred the company from making these claims. The court emphasized the importance of scientific testing and evidence-based medicine, and the dangers of quackery.

The author criticizes the use of the term "partner" for NGOs receiving funding, arguing that it misrepresents the relationship as equal. They observe that donors often profess virtues like treating grantees as equals but may act differently, a form of "fakeness" in the social sector.

The author introduces a "fake-flake" matrix to categorize organizations:

* **Fake-fake:** Intellectual and relational fakeness, without operational or ethical rigor
* **Authentic-flake:** Intellectual and relational authenticity, but operational and ethical flakiness
* **Fake-rigorous:** Intellectual and operational rigor, but relational and ethical fakeness
* **Authentic-rigorous:** Intellectual, operational, relational, and ethical authenticity and rigor

The author believes that "fake-flakes" are easily noticed, while "fake-rigorous" are subtle and insidious, but that "authentic-rigorous" organizations are effective and common. They acknowledge that some degree of fakeness and flakiness is inevitable but emphasize the importance of authenticity and rigor in the social sector.

### [Sri Lanka may be back on the tourism map but its recovery is fragile](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/sri-lanka-may-be-back-on-the-tourism-map-but-its-recovery-is-fragile-11709131361873.html)

Sri Lanka's Colombo airport is experiencing a surge in tourism, contributing significantly to the economy. The country's dependence on tourism, alongside textiles and tea, is highlighted as an example of oceanic countries' reliance on the industry.

However, Sri Lanka's economic recovery faces challenges. Despite currency devaluation, Western buyers prefer countries like Bangladesh for garment production due to efficient supply chains. The withdrawal of visa extensions for Russians and Ukrainians has raised concerns, but may be rescinded.

While there are positive indicators such as GDP growth and lower inflation, concerns remain about backsliding, arbitrary decision-making, and interest payment costs. Increased borrowing worsens the situation.

Sri Lanka faces difficulties in negotiating with private Western creditors and addressing allegations of corruption in Chinese-funded projects. The government must balance selling off public assets and cutting spending with the upcoming election. If it fails to do so, it may increase taxes, leading to comparisons with colonial-era taxation.

Despite the perception that certain sectors (newspapers, thermal power, combustion engines) are dying out, they remain prevalent in reality. Investors overly focus on the potential decline of these sectors, leading to undervalued stocks.

Using a "zero-terminal-value discounted cash flow analysis" can help assess these undervalued stocks, assuming the company will eventually cease operations. However, this approach ignores potential upside scenarios, such as demand revival.

Factors contributing to the resurgence of undervalued stocks include tempered excitement for new technologies, strategic shifts by incumbent companies, and increased cash returns to shareholders. As interest rates rise, the value of steady cash flows increases.

Unexpected demand revivals can lead to significant price increases for incumbents in these sectors. Investors should consider evaluating these "forgotten stars" for potential value, recognizing that market perceptions can be overblown.

The European Union (EU) is establishing a Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) and Green Claims Directive to regulate the carbon market.

The CRCF defines "carbon removal" as capturing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere. The Green Claims Directive requires companies to obtain approval for green marketing claims, which must include certified carbon removal offsets.

Companies can only claim to offset emissions that cannot be reduced further. Carbon credits must be certified under the CRCF, which excludes fossil-fuel emissions and temporary removals like tree planting.

The regulations set standards for certifying carbon removal credits, creating trust and distinguishing them from existing poor-quality products. Companies can still purchase non-certified credits, but they cannot make environmental claims associated with them.

Despite potential limitations, the regulations aim to prevent greenwashing and establish clear standards for carbon removal and offsetting.

Prime Minister Modi has emphasized reducing government interference in citizens' lives, particularly for the middle class. He aims to create a society with minimal state intervention, offering support only to the poor for basic needs. This reflects Rajiv Gandhi's concerns about welfare leakages. Specific areas of reform include streamlining taxation, reducing harassment of taxpayers, simplifying compliance protocols for retirement funds, and improving the efficiency of online sarkari interfaces. Additionally, Modi advocates protecting privacy by preventing government overreach into personal lives and limiting the misuse of laws like sedition to stifle dissent.

Nilesh Shah's tweet suggests that Indian households invest little in stocks. However, this is an incomplete analysis.

From 2020 to 2023, 94% of household savings went to fixed-income investments like fixed deposits and life insurance, while only 6% went to mutual funds (MFs) and stocks.

However, some insurance premiums and EPFO contributions are invested in stocks indirectly, indicating that households invest more in stocks than the data suggests.

Despite this, the majority of household savings still go to low-risk fixed-income investments. Factors such as risk aversion, tax benefits of insurance, and effective MF advertising have contributed to this trend.

However, the share of household savings held in MFs has increased significantly in recent years, indicating a gradual shift towards equity investments.

### [India’s household consumption survey captures predictable changes](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/indias-household-consumption-survey-captures-predictable-changes-11709046735551.html)

A fact sheet highlighting the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23 was released. This survey covered approximately 100,000 urban and 150,000 rural households, indicating that the urban population comprises two-fifths of the total. The data demonstrates a transition in consumption patterns, moving from cereals to non-cereals, carbohydrates to proteins, home-cooked meals to packaged food, and food to non-food items. However, the consumption spending growth pace in urban India is higher than in rural areas, leading to a divergence in spending and partly explaining the north-south divide. The survey also reveals a slowdown in consumption spending across surveys conducted from 2004-05 to 2022-23, raising questions about the alignment of consumption spending with national income growth. This comprehensive data is vital for assessing household well-being, establishing poverty measures, and updating the consumption basket used to calculate the Consumer Price Index, which plays a crucial role in guiding monetary policy.

- Researchers used AI to predict when people would die with 78% accuracy using data on thousands of people in Denmark, but the results were misrepresented and AI cannot predict the exact day of death.

- AI-based systems could have both positive and negative impacts, such as improving lifespan calculations or being used for discrimination.

- The AI technology has limitations: it cannot predict freak accidents or deaths far in advance since predicting the future becomes increasingly difficult the further ahead you go.

- There's a risk of humans trusting AI's predictions blindly due to authority bias, and AI can be influenced by bad studies and flawed data.

- The article emphasizes that our actions can change the future, and these forecasts do not seal our fate as certain events are still subject to change based on our choices.

The article discusses the issue of lack of trust in bank relationship managers (RMs) among customers. A poll conducted by the author on Twitter revealed that a majority of respondents do not trust their bank RMs. The author attributes this to the banks' aggressive push to sell unwanted financial products to customers, often driven by misaligned incentives. The author calls for banks to invest in building a solid wealth management franchise that delivers on its promises to customers. The author also suggests that regulators, particularly the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), take action to curb mis-selling and align incentives. Lastly, the author advises customers to take responsibility for their investments, conduct their own research, and seek advice from independent financial advisors if needed.

The latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) shows a moderate improvement in Indian consumption patterns over the past decade. Rural Indian households have reduced food expenditure (from 53% to 46.4%) and increased spending on non-food items. While average monthly per capita expenditure has risen in both rural and urban areas, the increase is modest. The survey also indicates a shift towards healthier diets, with increased spending on dairy, eggs, and fresh fruits. The methodology for this HCES round has been revised, but the exact changes are unclear. The survey results could become a political tool during upcoming elections, but they do not provide significant evidence of widespread prosperity or hardship.

After an 11-year wait, India has released a Fact Sheet regarding the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23. According to the World Bank's extreme poverty line, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty in India has significantly decreased from 12.2% in 2011-12 to only 2% now. This means that extreme poverty has almost been eliminated in India. Using a higher poverty line of PPP $3.2, the poverty rate reduced from 53.6% in 2011-12 to 21% in 2022-23. Additionally, inequality has declined in both rural and urban areas, with rural Gini coefficient dropping from 28.7 to 27.0 and urban Gini coefficient falling from 36.7 to 31.9. This remarkable pro-poor development is attributed to strong growth and reduced inequality under the growth policies of the Narendra Modi government.

The RBI's stance remains focused on controlling inflation, with expectations of a repo rate cut in the next fiscal year. Despite a decrease in average inflation, the RBI wants to ensure price stability and complete transmission of its past actions. The central bank is cautious due to uncertainties in food prices and external geopolitical factors. While the economy is performing well, the RBI will continue to use various tools to manage liquidity. Overall, the RBI aims to achieve low and stable inflation before making any changes.

Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that the Finance Minister made claims about the performance of the incumbent government in terms of poverty reduction and per capita income increase. However, the article questions the realism of these claims. It mentions that the claim of poverty reduction is based on extrapolated estimates using the Multi-Dimensional Poverty measure, but the conventional measure of poverty based on consumption expenditure is not available after 2011-12. As for per capita income, while it has increased by more than 50% over the past decade, there is a trend of deceleration in recent years. The article also discusses the income earned by workers, with moderate increases in rural areas but negligible rises in urban areas. It highlights a decline in real wages for regular workers and a decline in rural wages, which is the longest spell of declining wages since independence. The article also mentions a decline in cultivation income for farmers. Overall, the article suggests a decline or deceleration in the income earned by working Indians in the last five years.

The article discusses the controversy surrounding live screenings of the Ram temple consecration in Ayodhya in Tamil Nadu, India. Despite reports of cancellations, there is high demand for big-screen telecasts across the country. PVR Inox, a major multiplex company, partnered with a news channel to screen the event in over 160 theaters across 70 cities. Tickets were priced at a flat rate of ₹100 and included a popcorn-beverage combo, leading to sell-outs in many cities. The unique selling proposition of this event is the bundled refreshments, which not only attract cinema-goers but also generate goodwill for the PVR Inox brand. The successful screenings in Ayodhya could potentially be studied as a case in business schools.

Taiwan's recent presidential election resulted in Vice President Lai Ching-te being elected as the island's president, marking the third consecutive win for the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). However, the DPP lost its narrow legislative majority, limiting Lai's ability to push for Taiwan's independence from mainland China. Taiwan plays a crucial role in global technological leadership, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing. The country is home to over 60% of the world's semiconductor manufacturing and makes over 90% of the most advanced chips. Taiwan's electronics industry also extends beyond semiconductors, with Taiwanese-owned companies in China producing and exporting high-end components. Taiwan's history includes Japanese rule and subsequent control by the KMT (KuoMinTang) party, which led to an uprising and brutal suppression by the KMT in 1947. The KMT later established a dictatorship but focused on developing the economy, especially in electronics and technology. Democratization began in the late 1980s, leading to tensions with Beijing, including missile firings by China during Taiwan's first free presidential election in 1996. The KMT and DPP have different views on Taiwan's status, with the KMT agreeing with China's "One China" policy, while the DPP sees Taiwan as separate from China. In the recent election, all three candidates were native-Taiwanese, reflecting the DPP's identity politics. A stable Taiwan Strait would benefit countries like India, as Taiwanese

A recent study published in Nature suggests that people are more likely to be fooled by fake news stories after conducting an internet search. The study found that searching for information often leads people to more bad information, creating a spiral effect. Participants in the study, who predominantly used Google, showed an increase in classifying fake news as fact after conducting online research. The study also revealed that people tend to trust search engines more than mainstream media. Additionally, the study found that certain search methods and approaches, such as relying on specific phrases or trusting certain sources, can contribute to misinformation. Fact checkers, who diligently check the credibility of sources and scan search results before selecting what to read, have an advantage in identifying accurate information. However, even fact checkers do not always agree on the credibility of certain stories. This study serves as a reminder that accessing the truth through a simple online search is not always reliable.

Global public debt reached historical highs in 2023, posing a risk to the world economy's growth. The US and China have public debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 120% of GDP. Debt has become a constraint for governments unable to meet essential payments, and many low-income and emerging market countries are at high risk of debt distress. The IMF believes the risk of a systemic wave of debt defaults is low, but the outlook is grim. The lack of effective debt resolution instruments and transparency around debt contribute to the problem. A global debt reporting system and improved fiscal data are needed to address these issues.

India's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, predicts that India will become the third largest economy by FY28, which is supported by the International Monetary Fund's view. However, this alone will not significantly improve the average Indian's quality of life. To raise GDP per capita, India needs to achieve double-digit growth for a decade or more, as its current GDP per capita is much lower compared to larger economies and middle-income countries. While India has the potential for fast growth as a low-income country, sustained high growth is necessary to raise incomes like China did during its high-growth years.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos offers an opportunity for leaders to reflect on the past year and discuss challenges and opportunities. India is participating with a focus on rebuilding trust and showcasing its growth and development narrative.

India's global engagement has increased, with exports reaching $776 billion in 2022-23. Reforms such as GST and the 'Make in India' campaign have improved business operations and attracted foreign investment. India can play a critical role in the WEF's priorities, including security, growth, artificial intelligence, and climate action. The country's efforts in AI governance, job creation, and energy transformation will be highlighted. India's presence at Davos aims to showcase its economic growth, reform agenda, and industry resurgence.

The Henley Passport Index has released this year's scores, which measure travel freedom. Singapore and Japan have consistently had powerful passports, but now France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have joined them at the top. South Korea, Sweden, and Finland are ranked second. India's passport has improved by four spots, now at No. 80 with 62 visa-free destinations. The UAE has seen the most significant improvement, adding 106 places to its tally since 2014. Although travel freedom has generally increased, the gap between countries remains wide. The article suggests that India's economic growth may lead to more opportunities for Indian travelers.

Maldivian ministers' comments against India caused a diplomatic dispute and led to their removal from power in the Maldives. This incident sparked interest in developing Lakshadweep, a Union territory near Kerala, as an alternative tourist destination. While Lakshadweep and the Maldives share similar appeal as holiday destinations, replicating the high-end resort model on a smaller scale may be challenging. Nevertheless, there is a push for tourism development in Lakshadweep, with plans for a new airport and potential interest from corporations to set up five-star resorts. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit further fueled anticipation for tourism growth. However, due to limitations in terms of size and infrastructure, Lakshadweep can likely cater only to affluent travelers. It is crucial to prioritize eco-friendly development from the beginning to protect the islands' natural treasures and appeal to the rising eco-consciousness in the world. Lessons should be learned from the Maldives, where increasing tourist arrivals led to waste disposal challenges and environmental degradation. Sustainability surveys and strict adherence to regulations are necessary to prevent similar issues in Lakshadweep. Limiting construction and controlling visitor numbers, while taxing affluent tourists to cover extra expenses, can help maintain the islands' integrity.

### [Should India worry about retail loans growing furiously?](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/should-india-worry-about-retail-loans-growing-furiously-11704899420224.html)

As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. The article discusses a consumer offer that challenges the concept of present-value of money. It explains how opting for a no-cost six-month equated monthly installment (EMI) plan for purchasing a refrigerator can result in a discount, while making the full payment instantly does not offer the same discount. The article suggests that this discount is funded by the appliance manufacturer and the lender providing the EMI option. The lender benefits from customers who delay payments and can charge higher interest rates, which subsidizes customers who pay on time. The article also mentions the increase in household debt-to-GDP ratio in India and the implications of borrowing from future earnings to consume goods and services today. It highlights the importance of strong income growth for this trend to continue and raises concerns about the end use of personal loans and potential asset quality problems for lenders. The article concludes by mentioning the efforts of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to address risks in unsecured consumer lending.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the Indian government's efforts to eliminate hunger and improve nutrition in the country. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) scheme, which provides free foodgrains to the poor, has been extended for another five years. The government will spend ₹11.8 lakh crore to provide 5 kg of free foodgrains every month to approximately 810 million people. Despite these efforts, the article highlights that India still faces challenges in achieving a nutritious diet for its population. The Poshan Abhiyan scheme, aimed at eradicating malnutrition, has not met its objectives. The article emphasizes the need to focus on balancing the diet and improving the quality of intake, including higher protein consumption, particularly among children and women. This can have positive outcomes in terms of better learning outcomes, work quality, and productivity.

Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that retail lending by banks in India has crossed ₹50 trillion for the first time. Retail lending includes housing and vehicle loans, credit card receivables, loans against gold jewelry, and personal loans. Retail lending now constitutes around 32.5% of the non-food credit given by banks. This shift towards retail lending has been influenced by factors such as the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, the default on loans by corporates, and the cleaning up of balance sheets by banks. It is worth noting that the growth in retail lending has led to a decrease in household financial savings and a contraction in lending to micro, small, and medium enterprises.

### [Mutual funds have held strong](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mutual-funds-have-held-strong-11704730545944.html)

The article discusses the increasing participation of retail investors in the Indian markets, despite concerns from big investors due to high valuations. In December, investments through systematic investment plans (SIPs) reached ₹17,610 crore, surpassing the previous month's ₹17,073 crore. The total assets under management of India's mutual fund industry also surpassed ₹50 trillion, with the last ₹10 trillion added in just over a year compared to several decades for the first ₹10 trillion.

The rising involvement of retail investors contributes to the depth of India's financial markets and provides a buffer against volatile foreign inflows. However, the true test for these investors will be their response during a significant market downturn, as the stock indices have been consistently rising for a long time.

Although the country's economic fundamentals are strong, stretched valuations in certain areas could lead to profit-taking. Additionally, there is a surge in foreign investors buying Indian shares, possibly due to expectations of a pre-budget or pre-election rally, which could also involve speculation.

The rise in usage is also due to improved telecom connectivity, particularly in remote areas, where the benefits of the JAM trinity (Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar identity numbers, and mobile phones) are evident. The success of the UPI raises questions about its impact on India's e-rupee project, which requires further debate.

Professor Claudine Gay has resigned as president of Harvard University amid controversy over her alleged plagiarism and her response to a question about calling for the genocide of Jews on campus. While Harvard's board supported her, her departure was met with right-wing criticism of "diversity gone wrong" at Ivy League institutions. Gay's statement emphasized her commitment to confronting hate while preserving free expression. The article contrasts her resignation with a past controversy involving former Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who faced protests over his comments on women in math and science disciplines. The article suggests that Gay's departure is a loss for academic freedom and highlights the importance of open dialogue in higher education.

### [Elite American universities are mostly overrated](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/elite-american-universities-are-mostly-overrated-11704369997830.html)

The article criticizes Harvard University for lacking academic standards and moral clarity, which has brought unwanted attention to the institution. It argues that top universities in America, including Harvard, have taken on an unhealthy role in society and the economy. These universities have formed an oligopoly with outsized power by using their reputation for excellence to signal their students' intelligence and connections. The article discusses the concept of signaling in economic transactions and how attending an elite school has become a valuable signal for employers, despite its imperfections. This pressure to attend elite universities has led to anxiety among students and their parents. Moreover, the concentration of market power in these universities has resulted in less innovation and more waste. The article suggests that the focus should be on academic excellence, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and calls for a breakup of the oligopoly in elite higher education. It concludes that the current system of elite education in the US needs to be diminished in importance and employers should consider graduates from other impressive universities for a better and more diverse staff.

### [Climate action: India Inc needs a clear road map for our green transition](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/climate-action-india-inc-needs-a-clear-road-map-for-our-green-transition-11704370072055.html)

India's aggressive push for renewable power has made renewable electricity costs competitive with grid power. However, round-the-clock power still needs to be made competitive. A differential market approach can benefit high-paying customers like industry and the commercial sector, while demand-response programs can help deal with the intermittency of renewable power. The government's aggressive targets are also helping mature electricity markets and build capacities in related institutions. India's early action on green hydrogen and electric vehicles shows promise, but there are challenges to address, such as charging infrastructure and safety. Clarity is needed on India's evolving economic structure and the obligations of energy-consuming sectors. Responsible tourism and a sectoral approach to decarbonization are important. Long-term goal clarity is crucial for supply chains and skilled manpower adjustments. Overall, industry needs to act together to mitigate responsibly and adapt inclusively.

### [We must bust myths around the social service sector](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-must-bust-myths-around-the-social-service-sector-11704295826227.html)

The article discusses three pervasive myths in the social sector that hinder its effectiveness. The first myth is about sustainability, believing that once changes are made, they will be self-sustaining without external support. However, continuous nurturing and energy are needed to counter opposing forces. The second myth is about scale, assuming that human relationships and social ties can be easily scaled up. The article argues that the uniqueness of context and the human element make scalability unrealistic. The third myth is about system change, with many claiming to work for systemic change without fully understanding the complexity of the systems they contribute to. Lastly, the article challenges the myth that civil society organizations (CSOs) are inherently corrupt and ineffective, stating that they are no different from other enterprises in society. The responsibility lies with philanthropists, donors, academics, and policymakers to debunk these myths and face reality for a better society.

### [The Adani-Hindenburg episode has given investors lessons on market risk](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-adani-hindenburg-episode-has-given-investors-lessons-on-market-risk-11704295658441.html)

The Supreme Court verdict on the Adani Group's alleged capital-market rule violations has brought relief and triumph to the conglomerate. The court rejected demands for an independent probe and found no merit in conflict-of-interest charges against the expert panel tasked with checking the regulatory set-up. The Securities and Exchange Board of India's ongoing investigation ordered by the court will continue. The court also directed the SEBI to conclude its probe within three months. The Adani Group's shares saw a sharp recovery and its market value reached ₹15 trillion. While no direct evidence of wrongdoing has been found, the episode highlights the need to address regulatory gaps in capital markets to prevent rule-skirting scandals.

### [India's factory orders have slowed a bit](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/indias-factory-orders-have-slowed-a-bit-11704296069260.html)

India's manufacturing sector experienced a decline in its purchasing managers' index (PMI) at the end of 2023, reaching an 18-month low of 54.9, down from 56 in November. Although still within the expansion zone, new order growth, particularly from export markets, has slowed. Domestic demand becomes crucial as external orders are expected to remain weak. However, the PMI reading suggests that Indian factories are still maintaining a level of expansion and are likely to continue operating at capacity, leading to potential investments by the private sector. While some foreign industrial players may consider dumping excess output in other markets, it should not be confused with legitimate competition based on true competitiveness.

### [Trade policy: India must reverse its tariff barrier uptrend](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/trade-policy-india-must-reverse-its-tariff-barrier-uptrend-11704204996971.html)

The article discusses the decline in popularity of free trade globally, the ineffectiveness of the World Trade Organization, and the geopolitical split in globalization. It focuses on India's trade policies, particularly its rejection of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the negative impact of its free trade agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN, South Korea, and Japan. The report highlights the significant trade deficits India experienced with these partners, attributing it to asymmetry in tariff reductions. The article suggests that lower tariffs and increased competitiveness may have led to a different outcome. It also emphasizes the need to reverse tariff escalation to attract global value chains and minimize input costs.
