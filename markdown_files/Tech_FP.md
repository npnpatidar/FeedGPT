### [No iPads launched in 2023, Apple set for major overhaul in 2024 after an unprecedented year of no updates](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/apple-ipad-lineup-set-for-major-overhaul-in-2024-after-an-unprecedented-year-of-no-updates-13383602.html)

In 2023, Apple did not release any new iPad models due to production delays and scheduling challenges. This marked the first time in the company's history that they skipped an annual update for the iPad. However, in 2024, Apple plans to launch a variety of new iPads, including a 12.9-inch iPad Air.

Renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that 2024 will see a comprehensive overhaul of Apple's iPad lineup. This includes introducing a larger 12.9-inch option for the iPad Air, implementing OLED displays for the iPad Pro, updating the iPad Mini, and launching a new generation of the most affordable entry-level iPad.

Kuo remains cautious about projected unit sales, estimating that Apple will ship approximately 52-54 million iPads in 2024, a slight increase from the estimated 50 million units shipped in 2023. However, this falls short of the peak sales in 2022 during the pandemic, which reached 63 million units.

According to Kuo's timeline, the first-quarter of 2024 will see updates to the iPad Air lineup, including an updated 10.9-inch model and the introduction of a new 12.9-inch variant. In the second quarter, Apple plans to launch a new generation of iPad Pro models with a redesigned chassis, the latest M3 chip, and a shift to OLED displays.

In the second half of 2024, Apple is expected to refresh the iPad Mini and the base model iPad (11th generation). The current most affordable iPad, the iPad (9th generation), will be discontinued by the end of 2024, signaling the completion of the lighting port transition for the entire iPad lineup.

The government is reportedly contemplating a substantial reduction in these import duties, potentially bringing it down to 15% for all price ranges of electric vehicles. A meeting between Elon Musk and the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, is scheduled to discuss India's new policy on reduced tax rates for fully built EV imports. This move aims to encourage Tesla to establish its manufacturing unit in India. Talks between Tesla and the Indian government have been ongoing, with the government emphasizing local manufacturing and additional benefits as sticking points. The upcoming meeting intends to progress discussions positively and pave the way for significant developments in India's EV sector.

### [Apple to allow sideloading apps shows iOS 17.2. Here’s why they are forced to comply with this dangerous step](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/apple-to-allow-sideloading-apps-shows-ios-17-2-here-is-why-apple-is-forced-to-comply-with-this-dangerous-step-13382852.html)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple's iOS 17.2 beta update's source code reveals that the company may allow users to sideload apps on their devices. This change comes as a response to the Digital Markets Act (DMA) imposed by the European Union, which requires tech companies to open up their services and platforms to other developers. The discovery of a new public framework called "Managed App Distribution" in the beta code suggests that Apple is introducing the capability to download apps from third-party app stores. While sideloading offers flexibility, it also poses risks such as exposing users to malicious software, compatibility issues, privacy violations, and piracy concerns. Despite these drawbacks, sideloading would give iPhone users the ability to download apps from external sources and provide iOS developers with an alternative to the App Store's revenue sharing model. Failure to comply with the DMA could result in fines for Apple. Although Apple has not officially announced this feature, the source code strongly indicates its implementation.

An 86-year-old physics professor named Kenneth Ohm is sending his DNA to the Moon with hopes that aliens may find it and clone him, which has caught attention as a peculiar development in space exploration. Celestis, a Texas-based space company, has been launching cremated remains into orbit since 1997, including notable figures like Gene Roddenberry and physicist Gerard O’Neill. Ohm has chosen to send not only his cremated ashes but also his DNA to the Moon's south pole in a mission with Celestis. He envisions amusing scenarios of future civilizations encountering his DNA, but acknowledges the uncertainty with humor. While this idea may seem whimsical, preserving DNA for future inspections by terrestrial or extraterrestrial civilizations has rationality. Other individuals mentioned in the article have sentimental motivations for their space burials. Celestis' lunar plans include a memorial service on the Moon's surface, with capsules carrying remains and DNA left as a lasting tribute.

### [Smart disruption? China will mass-produce AI-powered humanoid robots by 2025 to unsettle industry](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/china-to-mass-produce-ai-powered-humanoid-robots-by-2025-to-unsettle-industry-13368592.html)

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has unveiled plans to mass-produce humanoid robots powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The goal is to disrupt industries and human interaction, similar to how smartphones revolutionized communication. The MIIT aims for the nation's humanoid robots to reach an advanced level by 2025, with mass production beginning by then. This announcement has sparked a rise in Chinese robotics companies' stock prices. China aims to compete with the United States in the semiconductor and hardware realm and wants to make breakthroughs in environmental sensing, motion control, and human-machine interaction. The government is endorsing AI integration into robotics and encouraging research into agile limbs. China intends to create humanoid robots capable of thinking, learning, and innovating by 2027, as well as establish a reliable supply chain system for large-scale production. This development could potentially revolutionize various industries, with humanoid robots replacing human tasks like grocery picking and hazardous environment operations. China's pursuit of mass-producing humanoid robots is not unique, as US companies like Agility Robotics and Boston Dynamics are also working on similar projects. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group acquired Boston Dynamics three years ago, illustrating the global push for advancements in humanoid robotics.

### [Soon, doctors may be able to diagnose Alzheimer's using just a simple blood test](https://www.firstpost.com/world/doctors-may-be-able-to-diagnose-alzheimers-using-just-a-simple-blood-test-soon-13368072.html)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Researchers are working on developing blood tests that can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease, which has traditionally been a challenging and time-consuming process. While several blood tests for Alzheimer's are already in use for research purposes, they have not yet become standard practice for doctors. A coalition of UK medical research funders is leading a project to determine the most effective blood test for real-world diagnostic use. The goal is to have at least one blood test ready for routine use within the next five years. These blood tests focus on proteins associated with Alzheimer's, and they have shown comparable accuracy to spinal fluid tests currently used for diagnosis. The need for real-world assessment is important as clinical trials often lack diversity in their participant demographics. A reliable blood test could expedite the diagnostic process and could be especially useful for confirming the presence of amyloid buildup, which is important for certain treatments. While blood tests for Alzheimer's hold promise, it is important that they are used in a clinical context and under a doctor's guidance.
