As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Huawei, in an effort to offset the effects of US-imposed sanctions, has held meetings with Audi and Mercedes, exploring a possible partnership for their electric vehicle (EV) and smart car software. The discussions revolved around the German automakers acquiring small stakes in Huawei's smart car software and components firm. Huawei aims to expand its partnerships beyond Chinese brands and mitigate the impact of US sanctions. The company recently announced its intention to spin off its Intelligent Automotive Solution (IAS) business unit, which focuses on software and components for smart EVs. Mercedes has shown little interest, while Audi's level of interest is yet to be determined. Huawei's efforts in the automotive sector reflect the challenges posed by US sanctions.

US Senator Ron Wyden has issued a warning about unidentified governments conducting surveillance on smartphone users through push notifications on various apps. In a letter to the Department of Justice, Wyden expressed concern that foreign officials were compelling Google and Apple to provide data, enabling governments to monitor smartphone activity. Push notifications, which alert users to incoming messages and updates, travel through Google and Apple's servers, giving these companies access to valuable user data. Senator Wyden called on the Department of Justice to address policies hindering public discussions on this form of spying. Both Apple and Google have acknowledged the concerns and expressed support for informing users about government requests related to push notifications. The extent and duration of this surveillance remain unclear, but privacy implications have been raised.

Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is facing scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and antitrust concerns. A San Francisco appeals court is currently reviewing the FTC's challenge to a ruling that had initially cleared the deal. During a hearing, the court questioned whether Microsoft's plan to release Activision titles on the cloud adequately addressed antitrust concerns. The court's decision could impact an ongoing in-house trial initiated by the FTC, although it cannot retroactively block the completed merger. Microsoft's dominance in subscription and cloud-based gaming was highlighted, with concerns raised about potential monopoly power. Microsoft's lawyer argued that the FTC is shifting its arguments from the summer trial. The court also discussed Microsoft's prowess in the cloud market and its intention to outcompete Sony. The FTC raised concerns about the UK settlement involving Microsoft selling the cloud rights of Activision games.

Chinese military scientists and industry engineers have claimed to develop the world's most powerful microwave weapon that can be fitted in a drone. The breakthrough, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, involves a compact microwave source with versatile capabilities. It can function as a radar while jamming enemy radar and communication systems. The weapon's design allows for customization and easy integration with different drone models. This new technology operates over an ultra-wide frequency range and competes with larger weapons used in electronic warfare aircraft. Chinese researchers believe this advancement could permanently alter the balance of military power. China aims to leverage its advancements in unmanned aircraft technology to gain a strategic advantage, particularly in regions like the South China Sea and Taiwan. They plan to integrate these microwave weapons into hypersonic aircraft and other near-space platforms, expanding their influence in electronic warfare globally.

Volkswagen has been accused of using forced Uyghur Muslim labor at its factory in Xinjiang, China. However, auditors investigating the claim found no evidence to support these allegations. The auditors acknowledged that data collection in China can be challenging, which may have affected the investigation. Volkswagen investors demanded clarification and an independent audit after documented abuses, including forced labor in detention camps, were revealed in the region. The audit conducted by a German human rights due diligence firm raised concerns as it was accompanied by local Chinese lawyers. Although no evidence of interned labor was found, the flawed methodology prompted the auditors to acknowledge the challenges of data collection in such investigations. Further investigations reveal close ties between Volkswagen's joint venture and an educational institution involved in reeducating Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. While there is no definitive proof that Volkswagen employs former inmates of internment camps, the company is closely associated with state-sponsored forced labor programs. Critics argue that Volkswagen's presence in Xinjiang could be seen as a symbol of prosperity in the region, raising concerns about the company's complicity. With Volkswagen heavily reliant on business in China, the evolving geopolitical landscape poses challenges for its operations and reputation.

### [Elon Musk made the Tesla Cybertruck so strong, it may be illegal in the EU. Here’s why](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/auto-tech/elon-musk-made-the-cybertruck-so-strong-it-may-be-illegal-in-the-eu-heres-why-13471122.html)

The European Union (EU) may not allow the sale of Tesla's Cybertruck due to safety concerns. The Cybertruck lacks proper crumple zones, which are essential for reducing the impact of crashes and protecting pedestrians. While Elon Musk has boasted about the strength of the Cybertruck, its construction and lack of a crumple zone make it illegal for road use in the EU. The car's high-grade stainless steel body ensures the safety of occupants inside but poses a greater risk to those outside the vehicle in case of an accident.

### [Apple warns India against EU-like USB-C rules for iPhones, says move will hit local production targets](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/apple-warns-india-against-eu-like-usb-c-rules-for-iphones-says-move-will-hit-local-production-targets-13470772.html)

Apple is lobbying against the Indian government's plan to adopt USB-C ports as the standard charging port for phones and devices, similar to the EU's mandate. The company has informed officials that this move could disrupt its local production targets. Discussions are ongoing, and India aims to implement the regulation by June 2025. While other manufacturers have agreed to comply, Apple is resisting due to its proprietary lightning connector port. The EU estimates that standardizing charging ports could save consumers $271 million and reduce e-waste. Apple has requested an exemption for existing iPhone models but may face challenges in meeting India's production-linked incentive targets. India is a crucial growth market for Apple, with an estimated 12-14% of iPhone production expected to come from the country by 2023. However, older generation iPhones remain popular in India's price-conscious market. The EU's charging port regulations will come into effect in December 2024, while India aims for compliance by June 2025. Apple has assured officials it can meet the deadline if existing models are exempted.

Joan Donovan, a disinformation expert and former head of Harvard's Technology and Social Change Project (TASC), has accused Harvard University of firing her after accepting a $500 million donation from the Chan Zuckerberg Institute associated with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan. Donovan filed a document with the Massachusetts attorney general's office and the US Education Department, claiming that Harvard succumbed to pressure from Meta, leading to her termination and the closure of TASC. She alleges that her treatment changed after presenting a keynote on the "Facebook Papers" to top Kennedy School donors, suggesting that Facebook was aware of the harm caused by disinformation on its platform but chose not to act. Lawyers representing Donovan argue that the large donation may have influenced Harvard's actions. The allegations are being investigated by authorities. Harvard denies the claims and says Donovan was offered a chance to continue as a part-time adjunct lecturer, which she declined.

### [Under siege: Huge network of Chinese fake accounts set up to disrupt India, US 2024 polls exposed](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/meta-exposes-huge-network-of-chinese-fake-accounts-set-up-to-disrupt-india-us-2024-polls-13462072.html)

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has reported that it took down approximately 4,700 fake Chinese accounts aimed at disrupting the 2024 elections in India and China. These accounts pretended to be Americans and Indians and were spreading false information on divisive topics. The accounts were engaged in disseminating misleading information related to US politics, US-China relations, and Indian politics. While Meta did not directly link the accounts to Chinese officials, they expressed concerns about the surge in such networks originating from China, ranking it as the third-largest source after Russia and Iran. The network utilized stolen profile pictures and names from legitimate users worldwide and copied content from X, a former Twitter platform. The accounts were found to copy posts from various US politicians without displaying any consistent ideological stance. Meta's report highlighted the intention behind such networks, which is to manipulate public opinion, sow division, and boost certain viewpoints. The company also uncovered two smaller networks: one from China focusing on India and Tibet, and another from Russia posting about the invasion of Ukraine. Notably, the US government stopped sharing information about foreign influence networks with Meta in July due to a federal ruling related to a First Amendment legal case. This decision is currently being considered by the Supreme Court, sparking the debate on collaboration between the government and tech companies and its impact on social media users' freedom of speech.

The Joe Biden-led administration has pressured Prosperity7, a tech venture capital firm backed by the Saudi government, to withdraw its support from Rain AI, a startup focused on developing an AI chip to compete with NVIDIA and AMD. The divestment was carried out after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which oversees deals with potential national security implications. The move reflects increased caution towards Middle Eastern wealth funds, particularly those with perceived ties to China. Prosperity7 sold its stake to Silicon Valley investment firm Grep VC. Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI and supporter of Rain AI, is reportedly raising funds for a new AI chip venture called Tigris.

The city of Detroit in the US has installed a wireless charging system beneath a street, allowing electric vehicle (EV) drivers to recharge their cars while driving. The technology utilizes copper inductive charging coils placed under the street surface, enabling vehicles with corresponding receivers to charge their batteries seamlessly while driving or parking above the coils. The Michigan Department of Transportation has allocated a quarter-mile stretch along 14th Street for testing and refining the technology before making it accessible to the public in the coming years. The initiative is led by Electreon, an Israel-based company specializing in wireless charging solutions for EVs. The project aims to revolutionize electric vehicle adoption, addressing issues such as limited range, grid constraints, and battery size and costs. The wireless-charging roadway has been designed to ensure the safety of pedestrians, motorists, and animals. The Michigan Department of Transportation and Electreon have committed to a five-year partnership to further develop the electric road system. This advancement positions Michigan and Detroit as leaders in electric vehicle technology.

Foxconn, a major electronics contract manufacturer, is set to invest over $1.57 billion in India, aligning with its strategic efforts to expand manufacturing capabilities in the country. Currently, Foxconn assembles smartphones and other devices in India but does not manufacture components there. This investment will support India's manufacturing goals and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make In India movement. Foxconn had previously planned a semicon manufacturing unit in partnership with Vedanta but had to abandon the venture due to lack of experience. The company aims to double its investment and workforce in India within the next twelve months.

### [New Digital Arrest cyber fraud is causing widespread terror in India: What is it and how to stay safe?](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/new-digital-arrest-cyber-fraud-is-causing-widespread-terror-in-india-what-is-it-and-how-to-stay-safe-13436202.html)

In a new type of scam, criminals are impersonating local police or customs officials to threaten victims with potential arrest for made-up charges. The victims, in a state of panic, end up paying large sums of money to settle the case. This emerging form of cybercrime, known as "digital arrest" scams, involves fraudsters posing as law enforcement officers and using digital communication methods to manipulate and deceive individuals. In a recent incident, a 23-year-old woman lost Rs 2.5 lakh when scammers pretending to be customs officers convinced her she was involved in a passport trafficking case. The perpetrators created a sense of urgency and fear, providing false evidence and demanding significant payments to avoid legal consequences. Law enforcement authorities are taking this cyber fraud seriously and urging further investigation.

### [Deorbiting Home: NASA to soon start deorbiting the ISS from space. Here’s why it will cost them billions](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/deorbiting-home-nasa-to-soon-start-dismantling-the-iss-in-space-heres-why-it-will-cost-them-billions-13435782.html)

NASA is preparing to decommission the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030 and is exploring safe ways to dispose of the spacecraft. The estimated cost for decommissioning and deorbiting the ISS is at least $1 billion, although experts believe it will be even higher. The space station, which has been hosting astronauts for 23 years, is showing signs of wear and tear and is approaching a point where it won't be safe for habitation. NASA aims to safely deorbit the ISS, either through an uncontrollable descent or a carefully orchestrated descent using a special spacecraft. The former option poses risks of debris falling on populated areas, while the latter requires a powerful custom-built vehicle. The decommissioning process is complicated by the geopolitics involved, as the ISS has relied on Russian spacecraft historically. Despite the challenges and costs, the decommissioning plan signifies the end of an era for the ISS and its significant contributions to scientific research and international collaboration in space exploration.

### [Game Over: TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to fire hundreds as it exits gaming sector in major retreat](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/game-over-tiktoks-parent-company-bytedance-to-fire-hundreds-as-it-exits-gaming-sector-in-major-retreat-13434782.html)

ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is retreating from the global gaming industry and cutting its losses. It plans to fire hundreds of employees from its gaming brand Nuverse. This move is seen as a significant withdrawal from the gaming sector and a victory for rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. ByteDance will terminate employees, discontinue projects, and explore potential sales of existing gaming titles. The company's decision reflects its struggle to gain market share from Tencent. ByteDance had previously acquired studios and distribution rights in an effort to expand into gaming but has now refocused on its core businesses of short video and e-commerce. The spokesperson for ByteDance has not commented on the shutdown of Nuverse. Tencent remains the dominant leader in the gaming industry, benefiting from extensive user traffic through WeChat and strategic acquisitions.

Several countries, including the US, Britain, Germany, Italy, and others, have signed an agreement emphasizing the importance of ensuring the security of artificial intelligence (AI). The 20-page document encourages companies to develop and deploy AI systems that prioritize customer and public safety. While the agreement is non-binding, it suggests monitoring AI systems for abuse, protecting data, and vetting software suppliers. The director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency highlights the significance of countries endorsing the idea of prioritizing security during the design phase. The guidelines address concerns related to preventing AI technology hijacking by hackers but do not cover issues regarding appropriate AI use or data gathering. Various governments have taken initiatives in shaping AI development, but enforcement has been lacking. Europe has been active in AI regulations, and the Biden administration issued an executive order to mitigate AI risks. However, limited progress has been made in enacting effective AI regulation due to a divided US Congress.

Elon Musk's social media platform, X, will donate all advertising revenue associated with the conflict in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza. X Corp, the company behind the platform, will track how the funds are spent to ensure they reach the intended recipients and not Hamas. This decision comes amidst intense fighting between the Israel Defence Force and Hamas, resulting in numerous casualties. Additionally, Musk's satellite network, Starlink, will provide connectivity to aid organizations in Gaza. However, X has faced a decline in advertiser support due to concerns about controversial content. Musk has addressed concerns about fund allocation, stating that the funds will go through the Red Cross/Crescent to prevent them from reaching Hamas. Despite these philanthropic efforts, Musk's controversial posts have led to tensions on the platform. Advertisers remain cautious, leading to legal actions against organizations reporting such issues.

The Indian government is planning to hold discussions with social media platforms and internet companies to address the issue of deepfakes.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concerns about the harm caused by deepfakes and recommended disclaimers for such content. Earlier, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology issued an advisory to take action against deepfake content according to IT Rules and the IT Act.

In the ongoing Epic vs Google trial, it was revealed that Spotify had a special deal with Google regarding Android-based payments. Spotify paid a 0% commission when users subscribed through their own system, but if users chose Google as their payment processor, Spotify paid a reduced 4% commission. This was significantly less than Google's standard 15% fee. The details of the Spotify deal were initially kept confidential by Google. The User Choice Billing program by Google reduces the Play Store commission by around 4% if developers use their own payment system. Google emphasized the program's flexibility rather than cost savings. The special arrangement with Spotify was justified by Google due to Spotify's popularity and the need for seamless integration with Android services. Both companies committed $50 million each to a "success fund" as part of the deal. While Netflix declined a discounted 10% rate offered by Google, Spotify found a less contentious and more cost-effective resolution with Google by avoiding in-app purchase fees.

Potential locations for the manufacturing plant include Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. This move aligns with India's efforts to boost domestic electric vehicle manufacturing and cleaner transportation. Despite facing challenges, such as high import tariffs, Tesla's entry into India could tap into the growing demand for electric vehicles among the middle class.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！OpenAI's board of directors made the surprising decision to remove Sam Altman from his position as CEO and from the board, citing a lack of "consistently candid communication." Greg Brockman was also ousted from the board and subsequently resigned. This led to the departure of several key OpenAI researchers. Mira Murati briefly served as interim CEO before Emmett Shear, former CEO of Twitch, was appointed as the new chief executive.
Microsoft's Satya Nadella attempted to mediate the situation and offered Altman, Brockman, and other top scientists and executives from OpenAI to join Microsoft and lead a research project. However, reports suggest that this offer may have been a ploy by Nadella to protect Microsoft's stock from plummeting.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is facing significant challenges. The removal of CEO Sam Altman and other board members has led to potential legal action from investors. These investors are concerned about the financial risks they face and are consulting legal advisors. Additionally, over 700 employees have threatened mass resignations unless the current board is replaced. The unique structure of OpenAI, with control lying with its non-profit parent company, gives employees more leverage than venture capitalists. Microsoft holds a 49% stake in OpenAI, while other investors and employees collectively control another 49%. The likelihood of an IPO in the near future seems highly improbable given the current circumstances.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is challenging the European Union's crackdown on major tech companies and their designation as "gatekeepers." Meta argues that the European Commission made a mistake by subjecting Facebook's marketplace and messenger services to the bloc's new digital antitrust regulations. The company has submitted an appeal to EU courts, positioning itself against the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb market abuses. Meta maintains its commitment to complying with the DMA's regulations despite the appeal. The DMA imposes requirements on Meta, such as obtaining user consent before sharing data and collaborating with competing online messaging platforms. It also prohibits platforms from favoring their own services and sets provisions for data usage and app downloads. The DMA covers 22 platforms, including Google, Apple, Amazon, and TikTok. Meta is already involved in a separate dispute with the EU following a complaint by the European Commission, accusing it of stifling competition.
