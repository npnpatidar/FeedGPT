This update is expected to include a new 'Battery Health' page that will show information such as the estimated percentage of charge the battery can currently hold compared to when it was new. Additionally, the Settings app may start providing users with tips when their battery capacity is getting degraded. Google is also working on tracking more battery-related information, such as past battery status and serial number. It is possible that Android may also indicate in the operating system whether the original battery has been replaced or not.

However, challenges such as limited spending propensity and a relatively less mature domestic market persist. Real-money games currently contribute the largest share of revenue in the Indian gaming industry. As the industry matures and Indian e-sports teams gain more exposure and success, the business opportunity in e-sports is expected to grow. While some gaming ventures are betting on e-sports, others are not considering diversification into this segment.

Instagram users are experiencing a glitch where audio is disappearing from their oldest videos posted on the platform, specifically affecting videos from 2014 and earlier.

In the meantime, there is no known solution to restore audio on the platform, but users can watch these videos with sound when embedded elsewhere.

### [Nov services activity rises, but at slower pace: Survey](https://www.livemint.com/technology/nov-services-activity-rises-but-at-slower-pace-survey-11701798616675.html)

India's services sector expanded in November, although at the slowest pace in a year, according to a private survey. The Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 56.9 in November from 58.4 in October, still indicating expansion. Concerns about inflation remain high among businesses. Despite the slowdown in growth, experts expect certain segments to pick up in the coming months, boosting overall sector growth. Notably, domestic air travel recorded a significant growth rate. While price pressures cooled and demand remained resilient, there was softer expansion in new work intake and output. The external sector is identified as a hindrance to economic growth. Despite the slowdown, the outlook for business activity remains positive, though optimism is fading due to rising inflation expectations. Input price inflation has receded, providing some relief to service providers. Employment rose, but at a marginal rate, and hiring caution was observed. Chief economic adviser Anantha Nageswaran predicts comfortable growth of 6.5% in India's current fiscal year.

India's real-money gaming industry is going through a phase of consolidation as larger firms seek to improve their user base and revenue by acquiring smaller startups. Companies like Games24x7 and Nazara Technologies believe that industry-wide consolidation is inevitable, though finding acquisitions with the right valuation is challenging. The chief operating officer of Nazara stated that strategic acquisitions are part of their long-term strategy, but they won't rush into them. Smaller ventures may be affected by cash constraints, making it sensible for larger firms to assist with tech infrastructure and operational costs. While some startup founders are holding out for revised tax rates, at least 20 gaming startups are considering acquisition offers. Despite projections of a potential drop in overall revenue share due to new taxation, companies and investors remain optimistic. The real-money gaming segment is seen as a behavior-building sector, which will eventually decline in revenue share as the market matures.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The messaging app called Nothing Chats, developed by the company Nothing, experienced a setback when its beta version was quickly removed from the Play Store a day after its release. The official launch of the app has been postponed due to the need for further evaluation and improvement. The app aimed to address texting challenges between Android and iPhones by supporting both RCS and iMessage. However, critics raised concerns about potential security risks associated with these solutions.

The decision to take down the app came after users shared a blog post from texts.com, which revealed that messages sent through the app lacked end-to-end encryption, making them vulnerable to compromise. Texts.com's reverse engineering team discovered that users were required to transmit their Apple ID credentials to the company's servers, raising multiple security concerns. Despite claims of ISO27001 certification, the investigation found misleading information regarding end-to-end encryption.

While messages sent to the servers were encrypted, the transmission of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) was done without encryption, exposing them to potential interception. The intercepted JWTs allowed access to the Firebase real-time database and user information with just 23 lines of code. Sunbird, the foundation of the app, explained that HTTP was used solely for the initial request from the app to the back-end to notify it of the iMessage connection.

Overall, the app faced criticism and concerns over security vulnerabilities, leading to its removal from the Play Store and the postponement of its official launch.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, was recently fired as the CEO of the company due to a lack of consistent communication with the board of directors. This news has surprised many people, considering Altman's crucial role in the development of ChatGPT, an AI language tool that sparked an artificial intelligence race among tech leaders. Some have drawn parallels between Altman's dismissal and Steve Jobs' firing from Apple in 1985. Jobs, too, was initially ousted from the company he helped build due to conflicts with the board. While Jobs' confrontational management style and interpersonal skills were speculated to be the reasons for his dismissal, it was later acknowledged that he demanded a lot from his employees. Jobs went on to start NeXT Computer before rejoining Apple in 1997 and achieving great success. In Altman's case, the specific reason behind his dismissal remains undisclosed, but it is clear that there was a loss of confidence in his leadership and a breakdown in communication.

Please provide me with the instructions or questions you have, and I'll do my best to help you.Here's how you can connect multiple computers wirelessly:

1. Check network requirements: Ensure that all computers have wireless network adapters or built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. If any computer doesn't have a wireless adapter, you may need to purchase a USB Wi-Fi adapter for it.

2. Set up a wireless router: Connect the wireless router to your internet modem using an Ethernet cable. Power on the router and follow the manufacturer's instructions to complete the setup process. This typically involves configuring the network name (SSID) and password.

3. Connect computers to the wireless network: On each computer, locate the network icon in the system tray or menu bar. Click on it and select your wireless network from the list of available networks. Enter the network password if prompted. Repeat this step for all computers.

4. Verify connectivity: Once connected, verify that each computer has internet access by opening a web browser and visiting a website. If any computer experiences issues, make sure the Wi-Fi connection is stable and troubleshoot accordingly.

5. Share files and printers (optional): To enable file and printer sharing between computers, you'll need to configure the appropriate settings. On Windows, go to the Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Advanced sharing settings. Enable network discovery, file sharing, and printer sharing. On macOS, go to System Preferences > Sharing and check the desired options.

6. Test file and printer sharing: To test file sharing, create a shared folder on one computer, then try accessing it from another computer on the same network. For printer sharing, install the printer drivers on each computer individually and try printing a test page.

By following these steps, you can establish a wireless network and connect multiple computers together. Remember to keep your network secure by using a strong password and enabling encryption on your wireless router.

A Russian court has fined Google 15 million roubles ($164,000) for refusing to store Russian users' data on servers within the country. This follows previous fines imposed on the company for the same charges in August 2021 and June 2022. These fines were given under a Russian law that requires foreign companies to localize the personal data of their Russian users. In addition to these legal issues, Google's Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after its bank account was seized by Russian authorities, leading to difficulties in paying staff and vendors. While Twitter and Facebook are banned in Russia, access to Google's services, search engine, and YouTube remains free. Apple and the Wikimedia Foundation have also faced fines from Russian courts in the past. In other news, YouTube will soon implement a policy update requiring video creators to disclose when they upload manipulated or synthetic content that appears realistic. This includes videos created using artificial intelligence tools. Starting from December 1, Google plans to delete certain personal data, including Gmail messages, Google Photos libraries, Google Calendar appointments, and Google Docs archives.

Goyal praised India's contribution to Tesla's journey and mentioned the crucial role played by Indian engineers and finance professionals within the company.

Tesla has requested an initial concession on customs duty levied on imported cars in India, where vehicles priced below $40,000 face a 70% import duty, while those priced above $40,000 attract a 100% import duty.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple recently unveiled its latest Mac devices, including the m3, m3 Pro, and m3 Max chips. The event also showcased updated MacBook Pros and the first refresh of the iMac in nearly three years. Analyst Mark Gurman from Bloomberg provided insights on whether these devices are worth choosing or if it's better to wait for the next release. Gurman commented that the new 24-inch iMac, equipped with the latest Apple M3 chip, is fast but not groundbreaking. The iMac maintained its existing color options. The MacBook Pro introduced a new space black color, but Gurman noted that the speed improvement is not revolutionary. Gurman advised waiting for another generation or two if you have a Macbook Pro with an M1 chip, and if you have an M1 iMac, patience may be rewarded with a larger release. However, for those still using an Intel-based Mac, transitioning to Apple silicon is recommended as it offers significant performance upgrades and improved battery life. Gurman also mentioned the introduction of three M3 chips during the event and noted that there was no mention of the rumored M3 Ultra chip. Historical patterns suggest the M3 Ultra chip could feature twice the CPU and GPU cores and support for up to 256GB of RAM.

Apple has released its latest operating system upgrade, iOS 17, to the public. However, the company is already working on iOS 18, which will be announced at next year's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. iOS 18 is important because Apple will not bring a hardware upgrade to the iPhone 16, instead focusing on new software upgrades to attract customers. Apple is also betting on generative AI to compete with Google and OpenAI. The upcoming operating system is described as "ambitious and compelling" and could bring improvements in features, design, security, and performance. Apple's head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, decided to freeze development work on new major software updates to debug and improve performance. This move is similar to what Apple did in 2019 when bugs and feature delays affected iPhone launches. Apple's policy, "the pact," ensures that any regressions or glitches caused by new features are fixed immediately.

Google Chrome recently celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced plans for a refreshed design. The upcoming changes will include the incorporation of the material you theme, featuring more rounded corners, updated icons, and the removal of the lock icon from the address bar. This marks the first major transformation for Chrome in five years. The redesign aims to enhance legibility, introduce new color palettes, and better integrate with operating systems. Despite these changes, the overall layout and appearance of the browser will remain familiar. Notably, there will be a new drop-down menu to display open tabs and recently closed ones, and horizontal tabs at the top will appear as small pills when hovered over. The absence of the lock icon is justified by the widespread adoption of HTTPS, and it is replaced by a settings icon for connection security and other options. Additionally, there are new outlined style icons and a range of bright material you color palettes. Quick access to bookmarks, reading lists, and history is facilitated through the side panel icon. Overall, the redesign aims to provide a fresh look and improved features for Google Chrome users.

Apple has released the iOS 17.2 public beta 2, which includes new features such as spatial video recording and a journal app for iPhones. However, a less-talked-about change suggests that Apple is taking steps to retire the dedicated iTunes movie store. Code strings indicate that iPhone users will eventually receive a notification stating that iTunes movies are moving to the Apple TV app. The TV app has been updated with a new sidebar for easier navigation, and speculation suggests that additional changes will make the iTunes movie store obsolete. The movies and TV shows tabs will be removed from the iTunes store, but users can still access them until the global release of iOS 17.2. Additionally, the update introduces spatial video recording exclusively for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and extends the sensitive contact warning feature to include contact posters in certain apps.

2. Business Plan: Develop a detailed business plan outlining your goals, strategies, financial projections, marketing plans, and operational procedures. This plan will serve as a blueprint for your airline company and help attract investors if needed.

3. Financing: Determine how you will finance your airline startup. This can involve personal funds, loans, or investments from private investors or venture capitalists. Consider the costs of acquiring aircraft, hiring staff, marketing, insurance, maintenance, and other operational expenses.

4. Legal Requirements: Understand and comply with the legal requirements for starting an airline in the country where you intend to operate. This may include obtaining licenses, permits, certifications, and adhering to aviation regulations and safety standards.

5. Fleet Acquisition: Decide what type of aircraft your airline will operate and acquire them either through purchase or lease agreements. Consider factors like the number of seats, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and compatibility with your target routes.

6. Infrastructure: Establish a physical presence for your airline, including office space, check-in counters at airports, maintenance facilities, and a reservation system.

7. Staffing: Hire employees for various roles such as pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, customer service representatives, and administrative staff. Ensure they meet the necessary qualifications and have appropriate training.

8. Route Planning: Determine the routes your airline will operate on based on market demand, profitability, and competition. Consider factors such as distance, frequency of flights, and potential partnerships with other airlines.

9. Marketing and Branding: Develop a strong brand identity and marketing strategy to attract customers. Utilize various marketing channels such as digital advertising, social media, partnerships, and promotions.

10. Launch Operations: Once all the necessary preparations are in place, start operating flights according to your planned schedule. Monitor performance, gather customer feedback, and make improvements based on the market response.

5. The brain is composed of about 75-80% water, which helps cushion and protect it from injury.
6. Despite popular belief, humans do not use only 10% of their brains. Every part of the brain has a specific function, and even small-scale damage can have significant effects on the body.
7. The brain is capable of generating approximately 23 watts of power, enough to power a dim light bulb.
8. The human brain comprises several areas responsible for different functions, such as the frontal lobe (decision-making and problem-solving), parietal lobe (sensory information processing), occipital lobe (visual processing), and temporal lobe (hearing and memory).
9. Neurons in the brain can transmit electrical signals at speeds of up to 268 miles per hour (432 kilometers per hour).
10. The brain contains an estimated storage capacity of 2.5 petabytes, which is equivalent to three million hours of television shows.

The rumored launch date for the Samsung headset is late 2024, and it may be codenamed "Infinite." Samsung is said to be collaborating with Google and Qualcomm on this project, and there are rumors that the headset could operate on an Android version and be powered by a Snapdragon chipset. It is speculated that Samsung may use Samsung Display's OLEDs for the display of the headset. However, all information surrounding the Samsung mixed reality headset is based on rumors and speculation, and official details have yet to be released.

### [Apple's iMessage should be a 'core' service, Google tells EU. Here's what it means](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apples-imessage-should-be-a-core-service-google-tells-eu-heres-what-it-means-11699446745280.html)

Google, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, and Orange have written a letter to the European Commission urging them to regulate Apple's iMessage as a 'core' platform service under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA). They argue that designating iMessage as a 'core' service would benefit consumers by allowing enriched messaging features to be available across different platforms. The companies also highlight that currently, only Apple users can send enriched messages through iMessage, while others must rely on traditional SMS. Apple has responded by claiming that iMessage should not fall under the new rules because users do not directly pay for the service and Apple devices can be used without it. However, the Commission notes that iMessage indirectly contributes to increasing Apple's revenue and plays an important role in expanding its ecosystem. If iMessage is designated as a 'core' platform service, Apple will be required to make it interoperable with other similar messaging apps.

While details about GTA VI have been scarce, it is rumored to be set in a fictional version of Miami and will include both male and female protagonists. The developers are also said to be mindful of avoiding jokes that marginalize communities. Leaks suggest that the game could feature a modern-day Vice City-like setting with improved gameplay mechanics and AI.
