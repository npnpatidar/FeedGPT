Rockstar Games has provided some information about the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6), including that the game's trailer will be released next month as part of the company's 25th anniversary celebrations. Although details about characters and gameplay remain a secret, a leaked document from last year has hinted at potential features. The leaked information suggests that players can expect a range of weapons and tools, including an auto-dialer, various golf clubs, a crowbar, and a cut-off tool for unlocking doors and containers. There may also be a slim jim for opening older cars and an immobilizer bypass for accessing modern vehicles. The game might also include a tracker jammer device to avoid being detected by law enforcement. In terms of health recovery, players could potentially use items like food, drinks, painkillers, and trauma kits, with cigarettes potentially providing an adrenaline or stamina boost. Other potential items in the game could include a torch, USB drive, and binoculars, while characters might carry duffle bags or backpacks to store valuables. The leaked information also suggests that GTA 6 could feature a lineup of weapons similar to those seen in GTA 5, including guns, grenades, and melee weapons. However, it's important to note that all the information is based on leaks and rumors and should be taken with caution until there is official confirmation from Rockstar Games.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Apple recently unveiled its latest Mac devices, including the m3, m3 Pro, and m3 Max chips. The event also showcased updated MacBook Pros and the first refresh of the iMac in nearly three years. Analyst Mark Gurman from Bloomberg provided insights on whether these devices are worth choosing or if it's better to wait for the next release. Gurman commented that the new 24-inch iMac, equipped with the latest Apple M3 chip, is fast but not groundbreaking. The iMac maintained its existing color options. The MacBook Pro introduced a new space black color, but Gurman noted that the speed improvement is not revolutionary. Gurman advised waiting for another generation or two if you have a Macbook Pro with an M1 chip, and if you have an M1 iMac, patience may be rewarded with a larger release. However, for those still using an Intel-based Mac, transitioning to Apple silicon is recommended as it offers significant performance upgrades and improved battery life. Gurman also mentioned the introduction of three M3 chips during the event and noted that there was no mention of the rumored M3 Ultra chip. Historical patterns suggest the M3 Ultra chip could feature twice the CPU and GPU cores and support for up to 256GB of RAM.

### ['Ambitious and compelling': Apple plans to bring Gen AI and other key features to iOS 18](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/ambitious-and-compelling-apple-plans-to-bring-gen-ai-and-other-key-features-to-ios-18-11699848427018.html)

Apple has released its latest operating system upgrade, iOS 17, to the public. However, the company is already working on iOS 18, which will be announced at next year's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event. iOS 18 is important because Apple will not bring a hardware upgrade to the iPhone 16, instead focusing on new software upgrades to attract customers. Apple is also betting on generative AI to compete with Google and OpenAI. The upcoming operating system is described as "ambitious and compelling" and could bring improvements in features, design, security, and performance. Apple's head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, decided to freeze development work on new major software updates to debug and improve performance. This move is similar to what Apple did in 2019 when bugs and feature delays affected iPhone launches. Apple's policy, "the pact," ensures that any regressions or glitches caused by new features are fixed immediately.

Google Chrome recently celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced plans for a refreshed design. The upcoming changes will include the incorporation of the material you theme, featuring more rounded corners, updated icons, and the removal of the lock icon from the address bar. This marks the first major transformation for Chrome in five years. The redesign aims to enhance legibility, introduce new color palettes, and better integrate with operating systems. Despite these changes, the overall layout and appearance of the browser will remain familiar. Notably, there will be a new drop-down menu to display open tabs and recently closed ones, and horizontal tabs at the top will appear as small pills when hovered over. The absence of the lock icon is justified by the widespread adoption of HTTPS, and it is replaced by a settings icon for connection security and other options.

Overall, the redesign aims to provide a fresh look and improved features for Google Chrome users.

The movies and TV shows tabs will be removed from the iTunes store, but users can still access them until the global release of iOS 17.2. Additionally, the update introduces spatial video recording exclusively for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and extends the sensitive contact warning feature to include contact posters in certain apps.

2. Business Plan: Develop a detailed business plan outlining your goals, strategies, financial projections, marketing plans, and operational procedures. This plan will serve as a blueprint for your airline company and help attract investors if needed.

3. Financing: Determine how you will finance your airline startup. This can involve personal funds, loans, or investments from private investors or venture capitalists. Consider the costs of acquiring aircraft, hiring staff, marketing, insurance, maintenance, and other operational expenses.

4. Legal Requirements: Understand and comply with the legal requirements for starting an airline in the country where you intend to operate. This may include obtaining licenses, permits, certifications, and adhering to aviation regulations and safety standards.

5. Fleet Acquisition: Decide what type of aircraft your airline will operate and acquire them either through purchase or lease agreements. Consider factors like the number of seats, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and compatibility with your target routes.

6. Infrastructure: Establish a physical presence for your airline, including office space, check-in counters at airports, maintenance facilities, and a reservation system.

7. Staffing: Hire employees for various roles such as pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, customer service representatives, and administrative staff. Ensure they meet the necessary qualifications and have appropriate training.

8. Route Planning: Determine the routes your airline will operate on based on market demand, profitability, and competition. Consider factors such as distance, frequency of flights, and potential partnerships with other airlines.

9. Marketing and Branding: Develop a strong brand identity and marketing strategy to attract customers. Utilize various marketing channels such as digital advertising, social media, partnerships, and promotions.

10. Launch Operations: Once all the necessary preparations are in place, start operating flights according to your planned schedule. Monitor performance, gather customer feedback, and make improvements based on the market response.

Sure, I'm here to help! How can I assist you today?Here are some interesting facts about the human brain:

1. The human brain weighs approximately 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms) and is made up of about 100 billion neurons.
2. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right, which are responsible for different functions. The left hemisphere is often associated with logic, language, and analytical thinking, while the right hemisphere is linked to creativity, intuition, and emotions.
3. The brain is one of the most energy-consuming organs in the body, accounting for about 20% of the body's total energy usage.
4. The brain has no pain receptors, so it cannot feel pain. However, it can perceive pain signals from other parts of the body.
5. The brain is composed of about 75-80% water, which helps cushion and protect it from injury.
6. Despite popular belief, humans do not use only 10% of their brains. Every part of the brain has a specific function, and even small-scale damage can have significant effects on the body.
7. The brain is capable of generating approximately 23 watts of power, enough to power a dim light bulb.
8. The human brain comprises several areas responsible for different functions, such as the frontal lobe (decision-making and problem-solving), parietal lobe (sensory information processing), occipital lobe (visual processing), and temporal lobe (hearing and memory).
9. Neurons in the brain can transmit electrical signals at speeds of up to 268 miles per hour (432 kilometers per hour).
10. The brain contains an estimated storage capacity of 2.5 petabytes, which is equivalent to three million hours of television shows.

### [Apple's iMessage should be a 'core' service, Google tells EU. Here's what it means](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/apples-imessage-should-be-a-core-service-google-tells-eu-heres-what-it-means-11699446745280.html)

Google, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, and Orange have written a letter to the European Commission urging them to regulate Apple's iMessage as a 'core' platform service under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA). They argue that designating iMessage as a 'core' service would benefit consumers by allowing enriched messaging features to be available across different platforms. The companies also highlight that currently, only Apple users can send enriched messages through iMessage, while others must rely on traditional SMS. Apple has responded by claiming that iMessage should not fall under the new rules because users do not directly pay for the service and Apple devices can be used without it. However, the Commission notes that iMessage indirectly contributes to increasing Apple's revenue and plays an important role in expanding its ecosystem. If iMessage is designated as a 'core' platform service, Apple will be required to make it interoperable with other similar messaging apps.
