### [Why September 12 is observed as Saragarhi Day](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/september-12-saragarhi-day-9563646/)

The Battle of Saragarhi took place on September 12, 1897, where 21 soldiers from the 36th Sikh regiment bravely defended Saragarhi, a communication tower, against an overwhelming force of 8,000 to 15,000 tribal militants. Despite knowing they faced certain death, the soldiers held their ground for seven hours, killing 200 militants and injuring 600. Led by Havildar Ishar Singh, they communicated their valiant stand through a heliograph, reporting the enemy advance and their dwindling ammunition. 

Though outnumbered and facing a hopeless situation, their courage and sacrifice remain a testament to their unwavering loyalty and bravery. The soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, recognizing their extraordinary bravery. The Battle of Saragarhi is remembered today as a symbol of unparalleled gallantry and is commemorated in India and Pakistan.

### [Controversy over Mumbai’s salt pans: why do these lands matter?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/controversy-over-mumbais-salt-pans-why-do-these-lands-matter-9551821/)

The Indian government approved the transfer of salt pan land in Mumbai to a company for building rental housing. This decision, while aimed at addressing Mumbai's slum housing crisis, sparked controversy due to the potential damage to the fragile ecosystem. Salt pans act as natural flood defenses for Mumbai, as low-lying areas where seawater flows in, leaving behind salt and minerals.  Environmentalists argue that development on these lands will exacerbate flooding risks in densely populated areas like Vikhroli and Kanjurmarg. They also highlight the ecological importance of salt pans for various bird and insect species  and question the sustainability of constructing housing on land prone to inundation, raising concerns about the quality of life for the relocated slum-dwellers.

### [Why did Trump say immigrants were eating pet cats in the US?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-immigrants-pets-cats-us-9562585/)

During the 2024 presidential debate, Donald Trump falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's pets. This claim, lacking credible evidence, was contradicted by the city manager.  

Social media posts and videos from local residents, captured by figures like Elon Musk and JD Vance, perpetuated the narrative. These amplified the idea of Haitian immigrants posing a threat to public safety and fueled anti-immigration sentiment already present in Trump's campaign rhetoric. 

This narrative aligns with Trump's and Vance's positions on immigration, advocating for stricter border control and deportation, and echoes the messaging of the Republican platform.  The campaign has attempted to link Kamala Harris, Biden's Vice President and Democratic nominee, to the issue, criticizing her handling of border security.

Tamil Nadu argues that the NEP infringes on their constitutional autonomy in education and emphasizes their commitment to the two-language policy. The state maintains it is open to implementing other aspects of the NEP through its own initiatives and is even drafting a State Education Policy.

### [GNSS: How the new satellite-based highway toll collection system will work](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gnss-new-satellite-based-highway-toll-collection-9562340/)

The Indian government is implementing a new satellite-based toll collection system called GNSS, intended to replace FASTag.  

GNSS  allows vehicles to travel through designated lanes without stopping, tracking distance traveled and charging accordingly. Vehicles will be equipped with a non-transferable "on-board unit" (OBU) to facilitate this. 

To encourage adoption, users will enjoy a daily free travel allowance of 20 km in each direction on national highways and expressways. The new system aims to reduce congestion at toll plazas, which currently experience significant delays due to FASTag barcode reading. 

While GNSS will initially run alongside the existing FASTag system, the government plans to eventually convert all lanes to GNSS.

### [Why did EU court order Apple to pay 13 billion euros as taxes in Ireland?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/apple-ireland-european-commission-taxes-9560684/)

The EU's Court of Justice has ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in unpaid taxes to Ireland. This decision overturns a 2020 ruling that sided with Apple. The European Commission initiated the case in 2016, concluding that Ireland had provided Apple with illegal tax advantages. The Commission’s investigation found that Ireland's tax rulings significantly lowered Apple's tax burden, resulting in an effective tax rate as low as 0.05% in 2014. Apple and the Irish government contested the Commission's order, arguing that it lacked factual and legal basis. However, the ECJ upheld the Commission's position, stating that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid.

### [23 years since 9/11 attacks: How Osama bin Laden became the world’s most dreaded terrorist](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/9-11-osama-bin-laden-9562266/)

Osama bin Laden evolved from an ally of the U.S. in the fight against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan to its most wanted enemy. Initially supported by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia in his efforts against Soviet forces, bin Laden grew increasingly disillusioned with the U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War. He criticized the Saudi Royal Family and the American military, relocated to Sudan, and continued to oppose American influence in the Middle East. 

Bin Laden intensified his attacks on the U.S., orchestrating bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa and taking responsibility for the deaths of American servicemen in Somalia. His association with the Taliban in Afghanistan,  the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, and further global attacks solidified his status as a global terrorist threat, leading to a prolonged war against him by the U.S.

### [What was the impact of 9/11 on flying?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/9-11-flying-9562113/)

The September 11 attacks dramatically changed the landscape of air travel.  Pre-9/11 air travel was relatively relaxed, but after the attacks, security measures were drastically increased. Baggage screening became mandatory, with 100% of bags in the US subsequently being inspected.  Passenger identification check processes were strengthened, moving beyond government-issued IDs to include fingerprint and biometric scanners, eventually incorporating facial recognition. Full-body scanners were later introduced, and passenger pat-downs became standardized.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to oversee airport security, replacing the previous practice of outsourcing to private firms. The cockpit access policy changed, with standardized bullet-proof doors and protocols limiting entry to enhance security.  The increase in security measures had a significant impact on the aviation industry, leading to financial losses for airlines and a period of adjustment for passengers.

### [How India and the world changed in the years after 9/11](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/india-world-9-11-9562051/)

Following the 9/11 attacks, India positioned itself as a strong ally against terrorism,  a stance that deepened its relationship with the United States. The Indo-US relationship saw significant growth, culminating in the nuclear deal, despite challenges posed by the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and subsequent distrust towards Pakistan. India's concerns regarding Pakistan-sponsored terrorism gained global attention after 9/11, leading to increased US pressure on Islamabad. 

The US's war on terror in Afghanistan further complicated the situation, making Pakistan a key player in peace negotiations, a development that worried India. Amidst this evolving landscape, China's rise has presented a new geopolitical challenge for India,  especially as Beijing expands its influence in the region, further straining ties.

### [Teen girls’ brains aged rapidly during pandemic, study finds](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/teen-girls-brains-aged-rapidly-during-pandemic-study-finds-9561142/)

A study revealed that girls' brains aged faster than expected during the COVID-19 lockdowns. 

Researchers at the University of Washington observed accelerated cortical thinning in both boys and girls, but the effect was significantly more pronounced in girls. This accelerated thinning, on average, was equivalent to 4.2 years of accelerated development for girls, compared to 1.4 years for boys.

The researchers attributed this difference to social isolation, which they believe disproportionately affected girls due to their reliance on social interaction for stress management. While accelerated cortical thinning can be linked to depression and anxiety, experts caution against assuming it necessarily signifies damage, as thinning is a natural part of brain maturation.

Vietnam and the Philippines agreed to strengthen their defense ties and maritime security cooperation. The announcement followed a visit by Vietnam’s Defense Minister to Manila, where both sides signed letters of intent to increase collaboration.  

An official security agreement is expected later this year. While the move is seen as mainly symbolic for now, experts believe it could be significant in the long term if ASEAN claimants seek a united front against China’s assertive actions in the South China Sea. 

China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, disputed by Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan, have led to tensions, particularly between China and the Philippines.  Tensions have escalated this year with confrontations between Philippine and Chinese coast guard vessels. The US has pledged to defend the Philippines should an attack occur in the South China Sea.

### [Why foreigners can no longer adopt children from China](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-foreign-adoption-policy-change-9560296/)

China has ended its international adoption policy, marking a change from a system that saw tens of thousands of Chinese children adopted by families globally, with the US being the largest recipient.  The new policy restricts adoptions to children of blood relatives. While China expresses appreciation for the intentions of international families, the move has drawn mixed reactions, with some American families left in limbo and concerns raised about the impact on vulnerable children in China. The policy shift aligns with international trends and China's increasing focus on domestic adoptions, which now account for nearly 90% of adoptions in the country.  Several factors are believed to have contributed to the change, including China's declining birth rate, a desire to avoid negative international perceptions associated with some past adoption practices, and a strengthening emphasis on national interest.

The upcoming debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is crucial as the race for the US presidency is extremely tight. Polls show them neck-and-neck, with the winner potentially gaining a significant advantage.  Harris, lacking specific policy details in her campaign, needs to define herself in contrast to Trump and capitalize on his perceived vulnerabilities.

Trump, while maintaining a loyal base, needs to avoid his past debate mistakes of rambling and aggression. 

Key issues likely to be debated include abortion rights, immigration, and the economy.  Despite the format changes, like muted microphones, both candidates will aim to make their chosen issues paramount in voters' minds. This debate, being the only televised one, holds immense weight as both campaigns have limited time to sway undecided voters.

A new study published in Nature reveals that India contributes significantly to global plastic pollution, accounting for nearly a fifth of the world's total. The study estimates that India burns approximately 5.8 million tonnes of plastic annually and releases another 3.5 million tonnes as debris, totaling 9.3 million tonnes of plastic pollution. The researchers define "managed" waste as that collected by municipal bodies and either recycled or sent to landfills, while "Unmanaged" waste, the study's focus, is what ends up in the environment either as debris or through open burning. The study highlights a stark divide between the Global North and Global South in terms of plastic pollution. While high-income countries, generally located in the Global North, have high rates of plastic waste generation but manage their waste effectively, countries in the Global South often lack adequate waste management infrastructure, leading to significant amounts of plastic being burned or left as debris.  The study's findings are significant as they coincide with ongoing negotiations for a global treaty to address plastic pollution.

The move is aimed at increasing land value for construction, including residential and commercial projects. However, critics argue that it leads to the destruction of natural habitats and promotes an unsustainable real estate market. Concerns are also raised about conflicts of interest as politicians, including those involved in the approval process, have applied for "corrections" themselves.

### [Slowdown in auto sales: 5 reasons why cars are not selling (as much)](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/slowdown-in-auto-car-sales-5-reasons-9554982/)

The Indian automobile industry is experiencing a slowdown after a period of strong growth. Several factors contribute to this, including a cyclical downturn in demand,  easing of chip shortages which had led to pent-up demand, increased competition from new launches, and affordability challenges  in the entry-level segment. 

Additionally, there's a slowdown in sales for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and  climate change, with extreme weather events impacting buyer sentiment. Dealerships are grappling with rising inventory levels, prompting carmakers to offer discounts to clear stock. This downturn comes after record discounts and  the Indian auto sector's initial resilience against the broader economic slowdown.

### [The law and the ground realities of passive euthanasia](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/passive-euthanasia-law-realities-9554679/)

The Delhi High Court and Supreme Court recently rejected a plea for passive euthanasia for Harish Rana, who has been in a permanent vegetative state since 2013.  This case has renewed the discussion surrounding passive euthanasia, which the Supreme Court first recognized as legally permissible in the Aruna Shanbaug case in 2011. The court clarified that passive euthanasia could only be undertaken with a High Court's approval and that the patient must not require life support.  Further, the 2018 ruling stated the 'right to die with dignity' is part of the right to life. The court established guidelines for passive euthanasia, including the requirement of an advance directive or living will for withdrawal of life support in such cases. The guidelines also involve approval from multiple medical boards and, in the absence of a living will, consent from the family.

### [Formalised ‘gender apartheid’: What Taliban’s new law means for women](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/formalised-gender-apartheid-what-talibans-new-law-means-for-women-9554386/)

The Taliban supreme leader has ordered the implementation of Afghanistan's "morality law," a 114-page code formalizing restrictions on women, LGBTQ individuals, and religious minorities. The code mandates full-body veiling for women, deems their voices "intimate" and forbids singing or reading aloud in public or even within homes. It bans music, mixing of unrelated genders, and eye contact between unrelated men and women.  

The law also sanctions persecution of LGBTQ people and religious minorities. Men are forbidden from wearing clothing above the knee and closely trimming their beards.  

UN experts describe the code as "gender apartheid" and "disturbingly similar" to the previous Taliban regime. They warn that the code empowers Taliban morality inspectors with authority to arbitrarily detain and punish individuals, creating a climate of fear. While the US has made support to the Taliban contingent on the withdrawal of these measures, several Muslim-majority countries and China have recognized the regime.

A new study published in Frontiers in Neuroscience suggests that exposure to artificial light at night may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Researchers from Rush University Medical Center analyzed satellite data on light pollution and Medicare reports on Alzheimer's prevalence, finding a correlation between the two, even stronger than for some established risk factors like obesity and alcohol abuse. They believe the disruption of natural circadian rhythms and sleep patterns caused by light pollution may contribute to the disease's development.  This finding is significant as up to 80% of the global population is exposed to light pollution.

### [Why global models went wrong with their La Niña predictions — and what its delay means](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-global-models-went-wrong-with-their-la-nina-predictions-and-what-its-delay-means-9554393/)

La Niña, a climate phenomenon that influences global weather patterns, was predicted to begin in July but has been delayed.  This has implications for India's rainfall, as La Niña typically enhances monsoon activity. 

Despite initially predicting a La Niña onset during the latter half of  the monsoon season, forecasters were inaccurate about its timing. While the delay might impact the northeast monsoon (October-December), India has already received surplus rainfall overall during the southwest monsoon. 

La Niña's delayed onset could still influence cyclone activity in the north Indian Ocean basin, potentially leading to more frequent and intense storms. The phenomenon may also result in colder winters.

The Supreme Court reserved its decision on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's bail plea in the Delhi excise policy case. Kejriwal's lawyer argued that he had been granted bail in the related money laundering case and that his arrest by the CBI under the Prevention of Corruption Act was not justified, particularly as he was already in custody. The prosecution, however, argued that Kejriwal should have first approached the trial court for bail and that his arrest fulfilled the conditions under Section 41 of the CrPC, citing his alleged attempts to influence witnesses and derail the investigation.

A new global review of over 5,000 studies has confirmed that there is no link between mobile phone use and cancer. 
The research, commissioned by the World Health Organization, analyzed  studies from 22 countries and focused on cancers of the brain, pituitary gland, salivary glands, and leukemias. 
None of the studies showed an increased risk of cancer from mobile phone use, and there was no evidence of risk from broadcasting transmitters or base stations. 

The study's authors emphasize that radiofrequency waves, used by mobile phones and wireless technologies, are a form of non-ionising radiation with insufficient energy to damage DNA or cause cancer. 
 
Despite the strong scientific consensus, some organizations haven't officially weighed in on the issue, highlighting the difficulty of proving a negative.  
 Nonetheless, the overwhelming evidence indicates that using mobile phones and wireless technologies is safe.

The Indian government is auctioning land in Uttar Pradesh, previously owned by the family of former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, under the Enemy Property Act.  This act allows the government to take control of properties belonging to individuals who acquired Pakistani nationality after the 1965 and 1971 wars.  The Tashkent Declaration aimed to discuss the return of such properties, but Pakistan disposed of theirs in 1971.  The Enemy Property Act of 1968 solidified the government's ownership of these properties. Amendments in 2017 expanded the definition of "enemy property" to include legal heirs and successors, regardless of their nationality. These amendments aimed to prevent claims to properties left by those who migrated to Pakistan after the wars.

Saturn's rings will appear to disappear for a brief period in March 2025 due to an optical illusion. Saturn's tilt causes its rings to appear differently from Earth's perspective, and every 13 to 15 years, the rings' edge aligns with Earth, making them appear faint and almost invisible. This phenomenon last occurred in 2009.  

However, despite their breathtaking appearance, Saturn's rings are constantly being pulled inward by the planet's gravity and magnetic field, a process scientists call "ring rain".  At this rate, Saturn will lose its rings completely in about 300 million years.

Michel Barnier, a seasoned politician with a long career in French and European politics, has been appointed as the new prime minister of France. Barnier, renowned for his role as the EU's Brexit negotiator, replaces Gabriel Attal, who served as caretaker prime minister.  The appointment came after a lengthy transition period, exceeding 50 days, the longest since the establishment of the Fifth Republic.  

France's parliamentary elections resulted in a hung parliament, with no single party securing a majority. President Macron sought to unite "republican forces" and after extensive consultations,  eventually chose Barnier, relying on input from the far-right National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen. The appointment marked a strategic move to prevent a left-wing coalition from forming the government.

### [Why the US jobs report could be the most pivotal one in years](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-economy-jobs-report-employment-9552173/)

The upcoming U.S. jobs report holds significant weight as it could indicate whether the recent rise in unemployment is a temporary blip or the start of a recession. Economists will scrutinize the data to gauge the health of the labor market, which will influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts in September.  Recent months have seen a cooling job market with increased unemployment and declining job openings. While some analysts view this as a normal correction, others worry about the rapid rise in unemployment and its potential to signal an economic downturn. Factors like temporary layoffs and summer weather may have contributed to July's weak numbers, but the report's outcome will be closely watched for clues about the future direction of the economy.

### [Why Haryana’s agriculture is different from Punjab’s](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/haryana-agriculture-different-punjab-9551911/)

Punjab and Haryana, while often grouped together, differ significantly in their agricultural practices. While Punjab is dominated by rice and wheat monoculture, leading to surplus production and groundwater depletion, Haryana shows a more diversified cropping pattern.  Haryana farmers cultivate a variety of crops like cotton, bajra, and guar, and a higher proportion of basmati rice, which is less water-intensive and not subject to government procurement policies. 

Haryana's canal network plays a role in this diversity, irrigating the northern and central regions while the southern districts, with limited irrigation, rely on drought-resistant crops like bajra and cotton. The Haryana government promotes crop diversification through MSP procurement and price deficiency payments.  However, recent trends show a rise in rice acreage in both states, prompting a need to address price and yield risks in alternative crops.

China's trade with Africa is substantial, focusing on primary commodities from Africa and manufactured goods from China. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) further strengthens economic ties, but concerns regarding "debt trap diplomacy" remain. 



The current economic slowdown in China might influence its approach to investment, potentially shifting towards smaller projects and green technologies. However, African nations seek increased lending to initiate infrastructure projects.  China emphasizes its position as a developing nation alongside Africa, highlighting shared experiences with Western imperialism.

### [Why banks are witnessing a slowdown in bank deposit growth](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/banks-slow-deposit-growth-markets-9551518/)

Indian banks are facing challenges with slower deposit growth compared to credit. High credit growth paired with slowing deposits has created an asset-liability mismatch, raising concerns for the government and RBI. Several factors are contributing to this trend, including increased household investment in capital markets, driven by higher returns and ease of access offered by digital platforms. 

To address this issue, banks are focusing on deposit mobilization through innovative schemes and special deposit products that offer higher interest rates to incentivize savings. Despite these efforts, deposit tightness is expected to persist, potentially leading to an increase in the cost of funds for banks. The RBI and government are urging banks to prioritize deposit growth and maintain a balance between credit expansion and stable funding sources.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is set to issue bonus shares to its shareholders in a 1:1 ratio, meaning one free share for every share held. The bonus issue, approved by the board on September 5th,  will increase the equity capital by Rs 6,770 crore.  

The move is expected to boost liquidity and affordability for investors, potentially driving retail buying. However, RIL's share price is likely to decline proportionally to the increase in shares. 

Analysts highlight that the bonus issue, while increasing shares, does not intrinsically improve the company's financial performance. Investors will benefit only if RIL registers better financial results in the future. 


Despite the positive implications for liquidity, RIL shares have underperformed since January 2024, mirroring a sluggish market performance for the company.  The bonus issue might be considered a precursor to future capital expenditure plans by RIL,  a company with a history of bonus issuances.

Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, recently suggested that engaging with the United States on nuclear cooperation might be beneficial, despite past tensions. 

This comes after the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which had seen Iran agree to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The agreement fell apart when the United States withdrew under President Trump in 2018.

Relations between the two countries have been fraught for decades, marked by events like the 1953 coup in Iran, the Iran Hostage Crisis, and sanctions imposed by the US. 

The recent suggestion of dialogue follows a period of heightened tensions in the Middle East, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. While Iran has criticized US support for Israel, Khamenei's statement indicates a potential willingness to engage with Washington on nuclear issues.

### [New study suggests existence of a dockyard at Lothal, Gujarat, during Harappan Civilisation: What are the findings?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/dockyard-lothal-gujarat-9548119/)

A new study suggests that a dockyard may have existed at the ancient Harappan site of Lothal in Gujarat. Researchers from IIT Gandhinagar analyzed satellite imagery and topographic maps, revealing that the Sabarmati River once flowed near Lothal, connecting it to trade routes via the Nal Sarovar wetland and the Little Rann to Dholavira. This finding supports the theory that Lothal served as a major port for trade during the Indus Valley Civilization.  

The study also suggests that traders likely traveled from the Gulf of Khambhat to Lothal,  procured materials, and then transported them to Mesopotamia. This supports previous evidence suggesting foreign trade from Lothal.  The research utilized advanced technology, enabling the researchers to study ancient river channels and understand geomorphic changes over time.

Germany's Alternative for Democracy (AfD) party achieved a historic victory in the Thuringia regional elections, becoming the first far-right party to win a regional election since World War II. The AfD's success can be attributed to several factors, including its  xenophobic and anti-Muslim messaging, which resonates with some voters, particularly in economically disadvantaged regions of east Germany.  The party has also capitalized on regional economic disparities and discontent with the central government's handling of issues like inflation and fuel costs. The AfD's rise has raised concerns about the growth of extremism in Germany and its potential impact on the political landscape.

The Supreme Court is questioning the AYUSH ministry's July 1 notification instructing state licensing authorities to ignore Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. This rule, introduced in 2018, aims to prevent misleading advertisements of AYUSH products by requiring manufacturers to submit details about their products and obtain approval before advertising. The ministry's justification is based on amendments being considered in the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, which also addresses misleading advertisements. 

Rule 170 mandates that manufacturers provide evidence of safety, effectiveness, and quality, and prohibits certain types of advertisements, such as those using testimonials from celebrities or government officials or making exaggerated claims. However, the ministry's action has been criticized for potentially weakening regulations on AYUSH drug advertising.

The Supreme Court has issued several rulings impacting the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), particularly regarding arrests, bail, and confession rights. 

The court has clarified that the grounds for arrest under PMLA must be provided in writing to the accused. It has also emphasized the application of Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for bail in PMLA cases, considering the length of pre-trial detention.

In recent judgments, the court has relaxed the stringent "twin conditions" for bail in PMLA cases for individuals facing prolonged pre-trial incarceration. It has also affirmed the exception for women under Section 45 of the PMLA, granting bail to BRS leader Kavitha while rejecting the High Court's reasoning based on her social standing.

Finally, the court has addressed the admissibility of confessions made to ED officers, ruling that such confessions, obtained under custodial interrogation, may violate the right against self-incrimination. Furthermore, the court has referred the issue of "need and necessity to arrest" under PMLA to a larger bench for consideration.

### [Why rice-wheat need to be de-hyphenated](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-rice-wheat-need-to-be-de-hyphenated-9545216/)

While India typically considers wheat and rice as a combined surplus issue, their current situations differ greatly. Rice production exceeds domestic consumption, with record exports and mounting stockpiles.  

Conversely, wheat faces export decline due to reduced production and a government ban. This shortage is attributed to climate change impacting wheat cultivation, coupled with rising consumption, particularly in processed forms.

### [How Indians stand little chance of asylum but still manage to stay on](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-indians-stand-little-chance-of-asylum-but-still-manage-to-stay-on-9545276/)

The increasing number of Indian asylum seekers and walk-ins in the US and UK is straining immigration systems already burdened with backlogs. While the success rate for Indian asylum seekers is low in both countries, lengthy legal processes often allow them to remain.

In the UK, Indians have the lowest chance of securing asylum compared to other nationalities. Even when denied, appeals can take years, further delaying removals. The US, on the other hand, sees a rise in defensive asylum applications from Indians, though the success rate remains below 15%. Backlogs in immigration courts contribute to lengthy processing times, offering a window for migrants to work and potentially become eligible for amnesty programs.  Several factors contribute to this trend, including perceived religious and political persecution in India, along with the allure of economic opportunities in Western countries.

The arrest of Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, in France has significant implications for the tech industry. This unprecedented action against a high-ranking tech executive, alleging his platform facilitates illicit activities, challenges the legal concept of "safe harbour" which protects platforms from liability for user-generated content.

Durov’s case, however, raises questions about the boundaries of this protection, particularly when platforms are accused of failing to adequately moderate harmful content.  Analysts view this as a warning to other tech companies regarding potential liability for content hosted on their platforms.

The northern bald ibis, hunted to near extinction, is being revived in central Europe through reintroduction efforts.  Conservationists at Waldrappteam have successfully bred the birds and are teaching them to migrate using ultralight aircraft.  Young birds are raised by foster parents and then guided along historic migratory routes.  Climate change has forced the team to extend the migratory path from Italy to Spain to ensure the birds fly in safer weather conditions and can conserve energy.  The success of this project is seen as a model for conserving other migratory bird species threatened by climate change.

### [What Assam’s new Muslim marriage law says, why it was introduced](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-assams-new-muslim-marriage-law-says-why-it-was-introduced-9540507/)

The Assam Legislative Assembly passed the Assam Compulsory Registration of Muslim Marriages and Divorces Bill, 2024, which aims to prevent child marriages and marriages without consent, as well as check polygamy.  This new law repeals the 89-year-old Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935.  The government argues the new law is needed to address child marriages, citing the previous Act's allowance for registration of marriages involving minors.  Under the new law, registration will be handled by government officers, not kazis, and several conditions must be met, including the bride being 18 years old and the groom 21.  The government emphasizes increased accountability through government registration. However, opposition members argue that simpler amendments to the old Act could have achieved the goal of preventing child marriages and criticize the complexity of the new process.

Australia will limit new international student admissions to 270,000 in 2025, the lowest in five years.

Concerns have been raised, with the Group of Eight universities calling the cap "bad policy" and immigration consultants in India noting its potential impact on the business sector.

The Himachal Pradesh Assembly passed a Bill to raise the minimum marriage age for women from 18 to 21 years. The Bill amends the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act by,  removing the distinction of age between male and female "child" as defined in the Act and defining both as those who have not completed 21 years of age. It also gives overriding effect to the Act over any other law, custom, or practice, ensuring that the new marriage age applies to everyone. 

 Additionally, the Bill increases the time to file a petition to annul a child marriage from two to five years.  Since the Bill contradicts a central law, it needs the President's assent to come into force.

Bangladesh’s interim government has lifted the ban on the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, allowing its return to active politics.  Previously, the party was labeled as a "militant and terrorist" organization and faced criminal charges for war crimes committed during the 1971 Liberation War. 


The Jamaat, which advocates for the implementation of Islamic law in Bangladesh, traces its roots back to a larger Islamic group established in Lahore in 1941. While it actively opposed the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, it played a significant role in supporting the Pakistani government during the Bangladesh Liberation War. 

The party was actively involved with organizations that carried out atrocities against the Bengali population. After Bangladesh's independence in 1971, the Jamaat was banned and its leaders faced prosecution. 

While the party was rehabilitated in later years, it was once again cracked down on by the Sheikh Hasina government, which used the International Crimes Tribunal Act to prosecute alleged war criminals. Several high-ranking Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned.

### [How Canada’s policy of ‘reducing low-wage, temporary workers’ may impact Indians](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canada-policy-low-wage-temporary-workers-indians-9537877/)

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a reduction in low-wage, temporary foreign workers in the country. This policy shift aims to decrease the proportion of such workers to 5% of the population in the next three years. 

The move is likely to impact various groups, including those on temporary work visas, international students, spouses of international students, and workers under Labour Market Impact Assessment contracts.  This policy could particularly affect Indians, who constitute a significant portion of Canada's temporary worker population.  

The Canadian government's intention is to encourage businesses to invest in Canadian workers. While the policy shift may limit opportunities for temporary workers, there is a possibility that it could also create pathways to permanent residency, integrating them more fully into the Canadian economy.  The ultimate direction of this policy will likely depend on political and economic considerations leading up to the next Canadian election.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) initially issued an advisory asking food businesses to stop marketing milk and milk products as A1 or A2. This decision was subsequently withdrawn after facing criticism. 

The FSSAI stated that its existing standards don't recognize A1 and A2 differentiation, despite growing consumer interest and global trends of marketing these types separately.

The Indian government has banned 156 fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs, marking the most significant crackdown since 2018. This brings the total number of banned FDCs to 499 since 2014. The government deemed these combinations irrational and lacking therapeutic benefits. 

The banned drugs include various combinations for gastrointestinal problems, skin conditions, migraines, and erectile dysfunction.  The move aims to address concerns about the overuse of antibiotics, the potential for harmful interactions between ingredients, and companies circumventing pricing controls by creating FDCs. 
 
While manufacturers have been ordered to halt production and sales, existing stock may remain available. The government hopes this action will contribute to a healthier and safer pharmaceutical market.

Australia implemented a “right to disconnect” law, allowing employees to refuse work-related contact outside working hours. This follows similar laws in countries like France, Italy, and Belgium, aimed at addressing the blurring of work-life boundaries due to technology and remote work. 

The Australian law requires companies with more than 15 employees to comply immediately, while smaller firms have until 2025.  Employers can still contact employees outside work hours under certain circumstances, such as emergencies or when reasonable compensation is provided.  The law aims to prevent employees from being penalized for not being constantly available and encourages a healthier work-life balance.

The Supreme Court granted bail to BRS leader K Kavitha in the Delhi Excise policy case.  The court criticized the Delhi High Court's decision to deny Kavitha bail, stating the high court's reasoning could prevent any educated woman from receiving bail.  The  Supreme Court highlighted the exception for women under Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which allows for bail in certain circumstances. The Delhi High Court had earlier denied bail to Kavitha, arguing that she was not a "vulnerable" woman as she was educated and well-placed in society.  However, the Supreme Court emphasized that the law does not make distinctions based on a woman's profession or social status when considering bail applications under the exception for women.

This decision stems from the court's ongoing monitoring of prison conditions and recognizing the BNSS provision's potential to alleviate overcrowding. The court directed jail superintendents to process applications from eligible undertrial prisoners within three months.

The South China Sea dispute centers around competing territorial claims in a strategically vital region. China asserts its claims based on historical maritime rights, encompassing 90% of the sea with its "nine-dash line," which has been contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.  

China has physically escalated its claim through island building and military installations, prompting US intervention with increased military presence and aid to opposing nations. The dispute carries immense economic significance due to oil and gas reserves, rich fishing grounds, and crucial trade routes. 

An international tribunal in 2016 largely rejected China's claims, but Beijing, which boycotted the proceedings, has refused to abide by the ruling.  


Despite attempts by ASEAN, a regional grouping, to resolve the conflict diplomatically, a peaceful solution remains elusive, raising fears of a potential global crisis.

In Balochistan, armed men attacked vehicles, killing 23 individuals from Punjab after checking their identities. This attack is part of a pattern of violence against Punjabis in the region, attributed to Baloch militant groups. 

Balochistan has a long history of conflict with the Pakistani state, marked by insurrections and accusations of human rights abuses.  The targeting of Punjabis stems from a complex interplay of ethnic tensions and a sense of economic alienation felt by the Baloch people. Balochistan, despite its natural wealth, remains relatively impoverished, and many Baloch feel that the Punjabi-dominated Pakistani government exploits the province's resources without providing equitable benefits.

The regulator found that RHFL deviated from standard credit due diligence processes and that these loans were likely motivated by personal benefit for Anil Ambani and his associates. Sebi has imposed a total penalty of over Rs 625 crore on Ambani and the involved entities.

### [Badlapur sexual abuse case: Can political parties exercise their right to protest to call for a bandh?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-badlapur-case-right-to-protest-bandh-9532741/)

The Bombay High Court revoked the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance's call for a state-wide 'bandh' in Maharashtra to protest sexual assault allegations against minors in Badlapur. The court cited the potential crippling impact on the economy, public services, and emergency services, particularly the vital Mumbai local trains. 

The High Court emphasized that bandhs, by their very nature, aim to bring all activities to a standstill, disrupting the rights of individuals and businesses. It relied on past Supreme Court and High Court rulings that deem bandhs unconstitutional and illegal, prioritizing the public order over the right to call for a state-wide shutdown.  

Despite arguments from legal experts that the right to call for a bandh falls under the ambit of freedom of speech and expression, the High Court maintained its stance, arguing that maintaining public order and upholding individual rights takes precedence.

### [What is Hezbollah and what do we know about its military capabilities?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/hezbollah-israel-military-capabilities-rockets-9532446/)

There was  recent exchange of fire between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah. The attack, which involved hundreds of rockets and drones launched by Hezbollah, was in retaliation for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander by Israel in July.

### [In UPS, extra burden, but no pushing back of the reform needle](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-ups-extra-burden-but-no-pushing-back-of-the-reform-needle-9531518/)

The Union Government has introduced a new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) to address concerns among employees regarding lower pensions under the existing National Pension System. The UPS combines elements of both the old pension scheme (OPS) and NPS, offering an assured pension while maintaining a contributory, funded scheme structure.

Key features of the UPS include a minimum guaranteed pension, inflation indexation, family pension benefits, and an increased government contribution to 18.5% of the basic pay. The government anticipates increased expenditure, including arrears for retired employees, due to these enhancements. 


The move is seen as a political response to employee grievances and may influence state governments to adopt the UPS, potentially increasing their financial burden. Despite concerns raised by the Reserve Bank of India about the strain OPS can put on state finances, the government emphasizes the UPS as a fiscally prudent alternative.

The Indian government has approved a new pension scheme called the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for its employees. This comes after widespread criticism of the New Pension Scheme (NPS), which was introduced in 2004 to replace the older, unfunded Old Pension Scheme (OPS).  The UPS, effective from April 1, 2025, provides a guaranteed pension amount to retirees, 50% of their average last 12 months' basic pay, with a minimum of Rs 10,000 per month for those with 10 years of service. It also includes inflation indexation and a lumpsum payment at retirement. 
 
The implementation of the UPS is seen as a significant move ahead of upcoming assembly elections in several states. It is intended to address concerns raised by government employees regarding the lack of guaranteed returns under the NPS and the need for an unfunded pension scheme. 
 
The UPS combines aspects of both OPS and NPS, offering a guaranteed pension while maintaining a contributory funded scheme structure.  It is expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 6,250 crores in its first year of implementation.

### [Why do doctors want a central law to protect themselves from attacks and violence?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/doctors-central-law-protect-violence-9530964/)

Doctors in India have been protesting against violence, demanding a central law with stricter punishments. While a draft law was prepared in 2019, it was rejected by the Home Ministry. The government argues that existing state laws are sufficient and that systemic issues like security measures need to be addressed. Doctors point to the frequency of attacks and argue that the proposed central law would act as a stronger deterrent.  The 2019 draft law suggested prison sentences of up to five years and fines of up to Rs 5 lakh for violence against healthcare professionals.  Several private MPs have tried to introduce similar bills in recent years, but none have been passed.  Incidents of violence against doctors are widespread, with over 75% of medical professionals reporting some form of aggression.

Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, a dystopian novel about a society where books are banned, remains relevant today as censorship persists. The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman tasked with burning books, as he begins to question his role and the society he lives in. Bradbury's work critiques the dangers of mass conformity and the suppression of free thought. 

Throughout history, book burnings and censorship have been used by regimes to control information and silence dissent. From the Nazi book burnings of the 1930s to contemporary instances of banning books in schools and libraries, the threat to freedom of expression continues.  Bradbury's novel serves as a warning against the dangers of intellectual suppression and the importance of safeguarding the right to read and think critically.

India has expanded its network of Ramsar sites, designated wetlands of international importance, to 85. The three newest additions are Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary and Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu, and Tawa Reservoir in Madhya Pradesh. These sites were chosen based on criteria like supporting critical habitats for plant and animal species, providing refuge during adverse conditions, and contributing to water management and biodiversity. 

Wetlands are crucial ecosystems that regulate climate conditions through carbon sequestration, purify water, and act as buffers against extreme weather events.  However, they face threats from human activities like encroachment, pollution, and urbanization. 

India has implemented policies and initiatives to protect its wetlands, but ongoing efforts are needed to conserve these valuable resources.

Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk Oblast two weeks ago has resulted in the capture of significant territory by Ukrainian forces. Russia claims to have thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to seize land in the neighboring Bryansk Oblast. Ukraine’s objectives are believed to be multifaceted, including using the captured territory as a bargaining chip in future negotiations, boosting morale after recent setbacks, and forcing Russia to divert troops from other fronts. The incursion has resulted in the displacement of civilians and the capture of Russian soldiers by Ukrainian forces. 

While Ukraine has made notable gains, it remains uncertain if they can sustain them. The Ukrainian army faces a manpower shortage and has pulled troops from other battlefields, potentially leaving them vulnerable in the long term. Russia, meanwhile, has not yet significantly diverted forces from its eastern offensive, raising concerns about Ukraine’s ability to hold onto its gains.

The data reveals a surprisingly uniform surface near the landing site, unlike Earth's tectonically active terrain.  Additionally, APXS detected a higher-than-expected amount of minerals typically found in deeper crustal layers, possibly due to mixing caused by the ancient South Pole Aitken basin impact. This ground truth data is crucial for understanding the Moon's evolution and will aid in planning future missions.

Hillary Clinton believes Vice President Kamala Harris's potential confirmation as the Democratic presidential nominee will help break the "glass ceiling," signifying the barriers women face in achieving high-level positions.  Clinton, who herself was the first woman presidential nominee from a major political party in 2016, has frequently used the term.  

The term "glass ceiling," coined by management consultant Marilyn Loden in the 1970s, describes invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing despite their qualifications. While laws have been implemented to combat gender discrimination, women remain underrepresented in leadership roles across various sectors. 
Efforts to address the issue have included investigations, like the Glass Ceiling Commission in 1991, and  books like Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean In," which suggested women need to be more assertive. Critics argue that the term focuses primarily on the experiences of affluent white women and overlooks the unique challenges faced by women of color and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Economist Claudia Goldin has proposed that the real barrier lies in the inflexibility of demanding senior-level jobs and the lack of supportive policies for both men and women.

A new study suggests that the catastrophic ice cliff collapse scenario for West Antarctica's ice sheet may be less likely than previously thought. While the Antarctic ice sheet is still vulnerable to destruction, computer simulations indicate that the ice cliffs, even when exposed, may not become steep enough to trigger a runaway breakdown.  This slower disintegration would give coastal communities and ecosystems more time to adapt to rising sea levels. However, scientists emphasize the need for more research to understand the complexities of ice fracture and refine projections of sea-level rise.

The activists allege that Siddaramaiah's wife received housing sites in exchange for a piece of land illegally acquired by MUDA.  Siddaramaiah's legal team argues that the Governor should have withdrawn the show-cause notice based on the Council of Ministers' resolution. They contend that the Governor's decision to grant sanction was not justified and overlooked the potential conflict of interest. 



The court will assess key issues: whether sanction can be given based on private complaints and whether Siddaramaiah was performing official duties when the alleged offenses occurred.

The allegations involve a land exchange scheme where Siddaramaiah's wife received 14 plots in exchange for 3.16 acres of land that the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) allegedly acquired illegally. Siddaramaiah and the Congress party have denied the allegations, stating that the land dealings predate their time in power. Activists contend that the CM's brother-in-law acquired the land even though MUDA had ostensibly taken it over, and that the land exchange scheme yielded significant financial benefit for the CM's wife compared to the official valuation.  The Karnataka High Court has temporarily halted any "precipitative action" based on the Governor's sanction pending a further hearing.

Following strong criticism from wildlife conservationists, Malaysia's Plantation and Commodities Minister Johari Ghani revised his "orangutan diplomacy" proposal.  The original plan aimed to gift critically endangered orangutans to countries importing Malaysian palm oil, drawing comparisons to China's panda diplomacy.  

The plan faced backlash as it was seen as hypocritical,  considering the palm oil industry's role in orangutan habitat destruction. Critics argued that protecting forests, not gifting orangutans, was the critical step needed. 

The revised proposal offers importers the opportunity to "sponsor" orangutans, with funds directed towards conservation programs within Malaysia, ensuring the primates remain in their natural habitats.

### [Why has an international astronomical group joined calls for creating time standard for the Moon?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/time-standard-moon-9525462/)

The International Astronomical Union is proposing a time standard for the Moon.  Currently, each lunar mission uses its own timescale, which can lead to complications, especially as more spacecraft operate in lunar space. 

A unified lunar time standard is necessary due to the Moon's distinct gravitational pull, which affects the flow of time compared to Earth. This discrepancy, while small, can cause issues in spacecraft docking, data transfer, and navigation.

Similar to Earth, atomic clocks placed at various locations on the Moon could be used to establish a lunar time standard. These clocks would account for the Moon's rotation and local gravitational variations, ensuring accuracy. The standard would be linked to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for seamless communication with Earth.

### [How will the upcoming US Presidential election impact climate change?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/us-election-and-climate-change-9524502/)

The selection of Tim Walz as the Democratic nominee for Vice President is being celebrated by the climate change community. His experience as Governor of Minnesota, where he enacted ambitious climate policies, suggests a continued commitment to environmental issues if the Democratic ticket wins.  Walz's record is seen as a strong contrast to the previous administration's stance on climate change.

While the choice of Walz signals a positive step, analysts remain cautious about expecting drastic changes in US climate policy. The US has historically lagged behind in addressing climate change, and even with Walz's involvement, it's unlikely the country will surpass the goals set by the Biden administration.

### [Long before ‘lateral entry’, how Nehru government recruited bureaucrats from ‘open market’](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/long-before-todays-lateral-entry-nehru-govt-recruited-from-open-market-9524505/)

A previous government in 1948 and 1956, under Jawaharlal Nehru, made appointments to the IAS and IPS from outside the civil service examinations.  This was done to address a shortage of officers after independence, and to bring in specialized skills. Open market recruitments were made from individuals over 25 years old who had the required qualifications. 

These recruitments involved open applications, exams, and interviews, and quotas were implemented for SC and ST candidates. These open market recruitments were controversial, with some critics arguing they favored the wealthy and skilled, while others supported the need to find experienced personnel quickly. They resulted in hundreds of officers joining the IAS and IPS, helping to build the foundations of India's administrative system.

### [What is a waterspout, which may have sunk the luxury yacht off Sicily?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/waterspout-luxury-yacht-sicily-9524129/)

A luxury yacht carrying 22 people sank off the coast of Sicily after being struck by a storm that is believed to have been a tornadic waterspout. One man has been confirmed dead, and six people, including tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter, are still missing.  Waterspouts are weaker cousins of tornadoes, forming over water when there are high levels of humidity and warm water temperatures compared to the overlying air. They can last for several minutes and have wind speeds of around 100 kilometers per hour.  Experts suggest that, due to rising ocean temperatures, the frequency of waterspouts may be increasing.

### [Who are the Dhangars of Maharashtra and why are they asking for ‘grazing corridors’ in forests?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dhangars-maharashtra-elections-caste-9524048/)

The Dhangars, a nomadic shepherd community in Maharashtra, are demanding "grazing corridors" to allow them to traverse their traditional routes with their livestock.  The community, which includes populations in several other states, has faced challenges as forest department restrictions have come into conflict with their ancestral grazing patterns. They argue that grazing by their small ruminants benefits the land and that they are essential stakeholders in forest ecosystems. The Dhangars also seek Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, a demand that faces opposition from existing ST communities. While the community has political clout and influence, there isn't a single issue currently uniting them politically.  They hope that the upcoming Assembly elections will offer an opportunity to gain traction on their demand for grazing rights.

### [Before Siddaramiah, 4 alleged corruption cases where Karnataka Governor’s prosecution sanction was sought](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/siddaramiah-governor-corruption-sanction-9523838/)

The Karnataka Governor has granted sanction for the prosecution of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption allegations. The Congress party views this as a political move, highlighting pending sanction requests against other political figures, including former CM HD Kumaraswamy and BJP leaders Murugesh Nirani, Gali Janardhan Reddy, and Shashikala Jolle. 

The cases against these individuals involve alleged corruption related to illegal mining, inflated contracts, and bribery. 
Kumaraswamy maintains that a Supreme Court-appointed SIT was directed to complete its investigation years ago and questions the delay. The governor's sanction against  Nirani concerns a contract for an animated video, while Reddy faces allegations of amassing disproportionate assets during his ministerial tenure. Jolle is accused of seeking bribes for ensuring egg supply under a government scheme.

### [Hayflick limit: Why immortality remains out of humans’ reach](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/hayflick-limit-why-immortality-remains-out-of-humans-reach-9522701/)

Leonard Hayflick's discovery that normal somatic cells have a limited number of divisions before they stop (senesce) revolutionized our understanding of aging.  He proposed this "Hayflick limit" is a built-in cellular clock determining lifespan, estimated to be around 125 years for humans. Support for this came with the discovery of telomeres, DNA sequences that shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to senescence. However,  the exact relationship between telomere length and lifespan remains complex. Some argue that telomere shortening is a symptom, not a cause, of aging.  The discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that can produce new telomeres, suggests the possibility of overcoming the Hayflick limit, but practical applications are still far off.

### [Scientists discover liquid water on Mars for the first time: What a new study says](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/liquid-water-mars-9522348/)

A new study suggests the presence of vast quantities of liquid water deep within the Martian crust.  Researchers analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, discovering waves that indicated the presence of a water-filled layer between 10 to 20 kilometers below the surface.  

This discovery, if representative of the entire planet, could equate to an ocean worth of water.  

The study authors believe this water likely seeped into the crust billions of years ago when Mars had a warmer, wetter climate. While the presence of water doesn't confirm life on Mars, it highlights the potential for habitable environments deep underground and fuels the search for evidence of past or present Martian life.

### [Why the selection of 69,000 assistant teachers in Uttar Pradesh has been ordered afresh](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/up-69000-assistant-teachers-exam-hc-9522223/)

The Allahabad High Court has ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to prepare a new list of 69,000 assistant teachers following a legal challenge concerning the 2019 recruitment process. 

The court determined that the previous lists, issued in October 2020, did not adhere to reservation rules stipulated by the Indian constitution.  The initial lists came under scrutiny due to allegations of disproportionate representation of reserved category candidates and the misplacement of  "Meritorious Reserved Candidates".  The High Court directed authorities to rectify these issues within three months, ensuring proper adherence to reservation laws.  This decision has significant political implications as OBC reservation is a sensitive issue in Uttar Pradesh. The state government has affirmed its commitment to upholding reservation rights and has pledged to comply with the court's orders. Opposition parties, meanwhile, have criticized the government's handling of the recruitment process, accusing it of irregularities and injustice.

A recent US court ruling declared Google a monopoly in online search, finding the company acted illegally to maintain its dominance. This landmark judgment could significantly impact the way digital businesses operate and has implications for India as well.  

Google faces similar antitrust challenges globally, accused of stifling competition and controlling a vast portion of the online market.  In India, concerns have been raised about Google's billing policies, commissions on its app store, and alleged dominance in online advertising. India is proposing a new digital competition law modelled after the EU's Digital Markets Act, aiming to curb anti-competitive practices by big tech companies. 
The proposed law includes provisions to prevent self-preferencing, use of data to benefit affiliated companies, and sets presumptive norms to address anti-competitive behavior.  The law aims to create a fairer digital landscape by enabling competition and preventing dominance by a few large tech giants.

### [How Starbucks’ leadership change could impact customer experience in 3 ways](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/starbucks-leadership-change-india-9521891/)

Starbucks' leadership transition is unlikely to significantly impact its Indian partnership, Tata Starbucks. However, there are potential changes in customer experience, such as streamlining operations and improving the mobile app due to issues with accuracy and long wait times. 

The new CEO, Brian Niccol, may prioritize these improvements based on his experience at Chipotle and  feedback from former CEO Howard Schultz.  

Another focus area could be expanding into growing segments like cold brew and energy drinks to better compete with other cafes and fast-food chains. 

Starbucks also faces the challenge of balancing its premium image with increasing price sensitivity among consumers.  A strategy shift towards value-driven offerings, similar to Chipotle, might be considered. The extent to which these strategy changes affect the Indian market remains to be seen.

### [Super Blue Moon on Raksha Bandhan: What is it and how will it be different?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/super-blue-moon-raksha-bandhan-2024-9521732/)

Raksha Bandhan, celebrated on the full moon day in the month of Shravan, is unique this year as it coincides with a 'super blue moon'. This rare event, where the full moon is both a 'blue moon' and a 'super moon', happens due to the moon being closer to Earth in its elliptical orbit (perigee) and the occurrence of two full moons in a single month. The super blue moon will be visible in Delhi at 6:57 pm on August 19th, slightly later in Mumbai and an hour earlier in Kolkata. The term 'blue moon' doesn't refer to the moon's colour but is used to describe a second full moon in a calendar month or the third full moon in a season with four.

### [Why Elon Musk’ X announced it will shut down operations in Brazil](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/elon-musk-x-brazil-shut-operations-9520939/)

Elon Musk's X platform has abruptly ceased operations in Brazil following a dispute with Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes. X alleges that Judge Moraes threatened their representative with arrest if they didn't comply with censorship orders, claiming these demands were overly strict and violated the law. 

The judge, known for his crackdown on disinformation and online threats, had ordered the blocking of certain X accounts and launched an investigation into Musk for allegedly obstructing Brazilian justice.  This stems from  X's resistance to obey court orders to remove content deemed harmful, contradicting Musk's self-proclaimed stance as a free speech advocate.

### [Can Sheikh Hasina be extradited to Bangladesh? What are India’s options?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/india-options-sheikh-hasina-extradition-bangladesh-9520855/)

Bangladesh's de facto foreign minister has stated that the country may seek the extradition of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina  due to criminal charges filed against her.  A 2013 extradition treaty between India and Bangladesh, amended in 2016, facilitates the process. The treaty allows for extradition based on offenses carrying a minimum punishment of one year, including financial crimes.  Hasina faces charges including murder, enforced disappearance, and torture, some of which fall under the treaty's definition.  However, India has grounds to refuse extradition based on "good faith" or non-political motivations.  The decision is complex as it involves balancing India's strategic interests in Bangladesh, its relationship with the new government, and its historical ties with Hasina. Diplomatic engagement and factors like the political landscape and ongoing investigations will likely influence the final outcome.

The Indian government has withdrawn an advertisement for lateral recruitment of senior bureaucrats. The advertisement, which sought candidates from various sectors, including public and private, had excluded reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. 

Opposition parties and some NDA allies criticized the move, arguing it goes against constitutional provisions and weakens representational diversity. They pointed out that reservations are mandatory for appointments in the bureaucracy, stating that lateral entries circumvented this policy.

Proponents of lateral recruitment argue it allows the government to tap into specialized expertise, which career bureaucrats might lack.  They cite the need for fresh talent and the increase in manpower as reasons for lateral entry.

The mysterious 1988 air crash that killed Pakistani president Zia ul-Haq remains unsolved.  Several theories abound, pointing to potential involvement from various parties. Murtaza Bhutto, son of Zia's predecessor, was a prime suspect due to his anti-Zia affiliations and previous assassination attempts.

Another theory implicated Zia's then vice-chief, General Aslam Beg,  who allegedly  manipulated the investigation. The Soviet Union was also considered a potential suspect given Zia's role in supporting Afghan mujahideen against them.  

The US, specifically the CIA, was suspected by some due to Zia's policies that arguably challenged US interests. Israeli involvement was also suggested, with some believing Mossad aimed to prevent Pakistan's nuclear development. Despite various investigations, no conclusive evidence has emerged, leaving the true cause of the crash and responsible parties a matter of speculation.

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has recently changed the color of the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag, from kesri (saffron) to basanti (a bright yellow). This move follows a yearlong debate and an order from the Akal Takht, the highest temporal authority in Sikhism. 

The change is rooted in historical arguments about the appropriate color, referencing the Sikh Code of Conduct that prescribes either basanti or greyish blue. While kesri gained popularity, some believe its association with Hindu symbolism and its rise during the militancy period in Punjab necessitates a return to basanti.  The SGPC's decision is being seen as a significant step towards clarifying the symbolism of the Nishan Sahib and potentially influencing other Sikh institutions and individuals to adopt the historical color.

### [An Expert Explains: How James Webb Space Telescope has raised questions in cosmology](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/expert-explains-how-james-webb-space-telescope-has-raised-questions-in-cosmology-9518351/)

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided stunning images of the early universe but has also raised perplexing questions for astronomers.  Observations show fully formed galaxies in the universe's early stages, contradicting expectations of smaller, younger galaxies during that time.  Additionally, JWST's measurements of the universe's expansion rate differ from previous data, further challenging existing models.

This discrepancy has reignited debate about the reliability of different methods used to measure expansion. One method relies on early universe radiation, while the other uses local celestial objects like variable stars. JWST's findings seem to support the local method, suggesting a faster expansion rate. 

These surprises have led some astronomers to question the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of the universe.  The need for "dark matter" and "dark energy" to explain discrepancies between observations and predictions may indicate a deeper need for revision, much like the shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric model of the solar system. Only time will tell if the JWST's findings will lead to refinements or a complete overhaul of our understanding of cosmic history.

### [Why national consumer commission directed Goibibo, not Jet Airways, to issued refund after flight cancellation](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/national-consumer-commission-goibibo-jet-airways-refund-9518049/)

A family booked tickets to Canada through Goibibo for a Jet Airways flight. When Jet Airways went bankrupt, the family sought a refund from Goibibo. Goibibo argued they were just a facilitator and not responsible for the refund. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, however, ruled in favor of the family.  

The commission cited Goibibo's booking policy, which states that refunds should be processed through them, and Jet Airways' circular directing customers to contact their booking agents for refunds.  The commission concluded that while Goibibo might be an intermediary, they are also commission agents who bear responsibility for refunds in case of cancellations.

Two years after the Nord Stream pipeline explosions, the culprit remains unknown. The Wall Street Journal alleges a small team of Ukrainian operatives, defying President Zelenskyy's orders, carried out the attack. The operation, funded by businessmen and overseen by a general, involved divers planting explosives on the pipelines. This account contradicts Seymour Hersh's reporting that the CIA, under White House direction, orchestrated the sabotage with help from Norway. 

German investigations suggest Ukrainian involvement, citing a yacht found near the site along with traces of underwater explosives.  An arrest warrant has been issued for a Ukrainian diver instructor suspected of planting the explosives, but he remains at large.

Designed for low-cost launches with shorter turnaround times, the SSLV can carry up to 500kg of payload and accommodates multiple satellites. This addresses the need for dedicated launch options for smaller payloads, previously reliant on larger launch vehicles with limited availability. 


Compared to ISRO's other launch vehicles, the PSLV and GSLV, the SSLV is smaller and more cost-effective. The PSLV, a workhorse for low earth orbit launches, excels at delivering various satellites.  GSLVs, with their higher capacity, are primarily used to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbits.

### [Remembering the ‘Great Calcutta Killings’: When Jinnah’s ‘direct action’ caused a bloodbath](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/remembering-great-calcutta-killings-jinnah-direct-action-9517614/)

The Great Calcutta Killings of August 1946 were the deadliest outbreak of communal violence preceding India's independence.  Political tensions between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, coupled with existing communal strife in the city, created a volatile atmosphere.  Huseyn Suhrawardy, the Chief Minister of Bengal,  is widely criticized for his inflammatory rhetoric and inaction in quelling the violence. His alleged tacit support for the mob, along with his reported restraint of police forces, fueled the bloodshed. The exact number of casualties remains uncertain but estimates range from 5,000 to 10,000 deaths, with thousands more injured. The savagery of the violence, including grotesque mutilation and the use of rape as a weapon, served as a grim foreshadowing of the horrors that would punctuate the Partition.

### [Why the worst of food inflation may be over](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-the-worst-of-food-inflation-may-be-over-9516601/)

Although retail food inflation fell to 5.4% in July 2024, this decline is misleading, with a high base effect contributing to a statistically lower figure. The real story is a persisting food inflation problem, impacting households and hindering the RBI's ability to lower interest rates.

There are reasons for cautious optimism. The monsoon has been good, exceeding expectations in key areas and leading to a rise in the cultivation of crops like arhar and maize. This could ease inflation in pulses and animal proteins.  Low global food prices, particularly for wheat, make imports more feasible, which could further help control domestic prices. 

However, uncertainty remains as the harvest is still some time away.  Wheat stocks are low, and the full impact of the monsoon on food inflation is yet to be seen.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to a surge in cases, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries.  The spread of a new, more contagious clade of the virus, primarily transmitted through sexual contact, has raised global concerns.  

While mpox is usually a self-limiting disease, it can be fatal, especially for children and those with weakened immune systems. This new clade has spread to countries not previously affected by mpox, highlighting  the need for international cooperation to prevent further outbreaks. 

The WHO has urged countries to increase testing and vaccination efforts, and has called for equitable access to vaccines and treatment.

### [The improbable 800 km journey of Stonehenge’s centre stone, and why that matters](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/800-km-journey-stonehenge-altar-stone-scotland-9516755/)

Stonehenge's Altar Stone, a six-tonne sandstone slab in the monument's center, has been traced to the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, over 800km away. This discovery, through geochemical analysis, reveals a far more extensive collaborative effort in Stonehenge's construction than previously known. Prior to this, most of Stonehenge's stones were known to originate from Marlborough Downs and the Mynydd Preseli mountains in Wales, revealing the vast network and interconnectedness of Neolithic Britain. While the transportation method and the specific reason for bringing the Altar Stone to Stonehenge remain mysteries, the scale of the journey and its origins suggest a highly significant purpose and a level of social integration exceeding previous understanding.

### [Why 44 and 60 could be two key ages in human aging, according to a new study](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/aging-44-and-60-new-study-9516477/)

A new study analyzing data from 108 participants has revealed substantial molecular changes linked to human aging at ages 44 and 60. The research, published in Nature Aging,  tracked participants over 1.7 years, collecting various bodily samples to analyze proteins, lipids, and microbiomes.  Key findings include shifts in immune regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and cardiovascular disease risks around these ages. Notably, the study also found alterations in caffeine metabolism at both 40 and 60.  While the study provides valuable insight into the non-linear nature of disease risk and points to potential therapeutic targets for age-related diseases, it acknowledges limitations such as a small sample size and short duration. Further research is needed to understand the underlying factors driving these changes.

### [Right to abortion in US: which states will vote, what are the proposed measures?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/arizona-missouri-states-abortion-amendments-explained-9516155/)

At least seven states will have ballot measures regarding abortion rights in the upcoming November elections. This follows the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, leading to a wave of citizen-led initiatives.  

Arizona and Missouri recently qualified measures for their ballots, joining five other states that already announced similar ballot measures. These initiatives generally aim to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions, often allowing for abortions up to the point of fetal viability or later to safeguard a woman's health.  


The results from previous states where abortion rights were on the ballot since 2022 have consistently favored pro-abortion rights positions.

### [Why is Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida resigning?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-japan-pm-fumio-kishida-resigns-9516199/)

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation, citing a need for a change in leadership following a series of scandals that have eroded public trust. Kishida's approval rating plummeted to 20%, largely due to revelations of slush funds and the LDP's ties to the controversial Unification Church.  

Kishida, who previously served as Japan's longest tenured foreign minister, led the push for a "new capitalism" to stimulate economic growth. However, his initiatives were largely overshadowed by economic challenges, including a weakening yen and rising inflation. Despite the LDP's historic control over Japanese politics, Kishida's departure signals a shift within the party as it searches for a new leader to address public concerns and revitalize their agenda.

### [Why climate change poses an existential threat to Panama Canal](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-existential-threat-panama-canal-9516055/)

The Panama Canal, a remarkable feat of engineering, is facing a significant threat from climate change. Its operation relies heavily on Lake Gatun, a large artificial reservoir. However, prolonged droughts, exacerbated by climate change, have led to  declining water levels in the lake, disrupting canal traffic. 

The canal necessitates vast amounts of fresh water to operate its intricate lock system, which lifts ships between the differing elevations of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Last year saw severe water shortages, forcing ships to reduce cargo and significantly impacting the canal's efficiency. While recent rainfall has alleviated the immediate crisis, experts warn that such droughts are becoming more frequent and could pose a long-term challenge.  

To address this issue, authorities propose constructing a new dam on the Rio Indio to provide a backup water source.  However, this plan faces opposition due to its potential to displace thousands of people. The Panama Canal, a crucial global shipping route, is caught in a complex dilemma between environmental challenges and socio-economic concerns.

The Supreme Court has appointed 39 lawyers as senior advocates, including 10 women. This follows new guidelines established in May 2023, which aim to create a more transparent and objective process for granting the designation. The guidelines, which were introduced in response to concerns about nepotism and arbitrariness in the previous system, include a point-based evaluation system and a committee responsible for reviewing applications.  Applicants are assessed based on criteria such as years of legal practice, reported judgments, and legal publications,  with the new guidelines reducing the emphasis on publications. The designation of a senior advocate is considered a mark of excellence and comes with certain restrictions, including limitations on representing clients and engaging in drafting work.

Kamala Harris's bid for presidency continues a trend of US Vice Presidents seeking the top job.  Of the 49 individuals who have served as Vice President, 29 have run for president, with 10 ultimately succeeding. This trend has intensified since 1933, with 15 out of 18 Vice Presidents launching presidential campaigns in that period. Five of these ultimately won, including Harry Truman, Lyndon B Johnson, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and Joe Biden.  Several Vice Presidents have won their party's nomination but lost the general election, while others have failed to secure the nomination altogether.

A new study reveals that microwave ovens, despite containing radiation, harbor diverse communities of bacteria.  Researchers sampled 30 microwaves from homes, labs, and shared spaces and identified 747 genera of bacteria, including some potentially harmful to humans.  Though human skin bacteria were prevalent, lab microwaves contained more diverse species, including "extremophiles" capable of withstanding high radiation and temperatures. This study emphasizes the need to clean microwaves regularly with disinfectants, as they are not sterile environments.

### [What is the role of campaign cash in the US presidential election?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-the-role-of-campaign-cash-in-the-us-presidential-election-9514338/)

US presidential campaigns are unbelievably expensive, with the 2020 election reaching a record $5.7 billion.  Both major party candidates this year, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, have already raised hundreds of millions of dollars. These funds come mainly from wealthy individuals and corporations, raising concerns about undue influence on policy.  Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations, are a major source of funding, adding to the already substantial sums. While donations can help with campaign operations and voter mobilization, there is debate over their actual impact on election outcomes.  

However, the high cost of campaigning raises concerns about the influence of big donors on politics, as they often secure access and influence after elections through appointments or other means. Public opinion favors campaign finance reform, but current legal frameworks and the nature of US political parties make such changes unlikely.

Following the fall of the Awami League government in Bangladesh, Hindu communities have faced over 200 attacks. This has resulted in at least five deaths and heightened fears within the minority group.  Bangladesh's Hindu population, estimated at 13.1 million according to the 2022 census, has historically been a significant portion of the country's demographics. However,  centuries-old demographic shifts have resulted in a steady decline in the Hindu population, particularly after the Partition of India in 1947. The reasons for this decline are multifaceted, including higher fertility rates among Muslims, historical socio-economic disparities, and periods of communal violence.

### [Why Pakistan celebrates Independence Day on August 14, and India on August 15](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/explained-pakistan-independence-day-9514028/)

The split of British India into India and Pakistan in 1947 was orchestrated by Lord Mountbatten, who set the independence date as August 15th. This decision was influenced by a desire for a quick transfer of power and a personal preference for a date marking a victory in World War II. 

While the Pakistani government initially recognized August 15th as Independence Day, a change to August 14th was made in 1948. This change coincided with the date of the official transfer of power ceremony held in Karachi and the significance of the 27th day of Ramadan.

India's first commemorative stamp was issued on November 21, 1947, depicting the Indian flag. Three stamps were released, all featuring "Jai Hind" and the date of independence. They were priced at 3.5 annas, 1.5 annas, and 12 annas, and depicted the national flag, the Lion Capital of Ashoka, and a Douglas DC-4 aircraft respectively. 

A formal postal system in India was established with the East India Company, starting with internal communication in the 1720s.  The first GPO was opened in Calcutta in 1774. In 1852, India became the first Asian country to issue its own postage stamps, the "Scinde Dawk," in Sindh district.  Uniform postage rates were introduced across India in 1854, along with Queen Victoria's portrait on stamps and the railway mail service.

### [What is the drug Captagon, and how is it linked to Germany?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/drug-captagon-germany-link-explained-9513706/)

A recent trial in Germany involves four men accused of selling over €58 million worth of Captagon tablets. This bust highlights the growing concern that Captagon, known as the "poor man's cocaine", is more prevalent in Europe than previously believed.

Originally a prescription medication for attention deficit disorders, Captagon became illicitly manufactured in the early 2000s, particularly in Syria, which now produces an estimated 80% of the world's supply. The drug is highly addictive and can have serious negative health effects. 

 While Captagon's popularity soared in the Middle East, particularly among young people and in militias during the Syrian conflict, its reach is now expanding to Europe. This has sparked concerns over its increasing availability and potential for abuse across the continent. Europe faces the challenge of  tackling its production within its borders and preventing its use as a transshipment zone for Middle Eastern Captagon.

The Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to clarify its stance on non-consensual sexual offences against LGBTQIA+ individuals and men following the removal of Section 377 from the new Indian penal code, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.  Petitioners argue that while Section 377 was struck down for criminalising consensual homosexual acts, its removal leaves a gap in protecting men from such offences. The Centre, however, maintains that the court cannot direct the legislature on lawmaking.

The BNS, which replaced the Indian Penal Code, defines rape under Section 63 but in gendered terms, focusing on offences by men against women. Concerns have been raised that the lack of a specific provision addressing non-consensual sexual acts against men in the BNS risks leaving them vulnerable. 
 
While the BNS offers some protection under Sections 36 and 38 relating to the right of private defence, and Section 140 addressing kidnapping with the intention of "unnatural lust," the lack of clarity around "unnatural lust" raises further questions. The Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to respond by August 28th.

Sajeeb Wazed, son of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, refuted a fabricated news report claiming Hasina had allegedly stated she could have remained in power if she had ceded St. Martin's Island and the Bay of Bengal to the United States. Wazed clarified that the statement was a distortion of a 2023 speech where Hasina accused the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of wanting to sell the island. Hasina did not mention any specific country in her speech. 


St. Martin's Island, Bangladesh's only coral island, is a popular tourist destination and a breeding ground for sea turtles.  Its history dates back thousands of years, with early settlements by Arab merchants. The island was annexed by British India in 1900 and  became part of Bangladesh after the 1971 Liberation War.

The Indian government withdrew a draft broadcast bill that sparked controversy due to concerns about increased control over online content.  The draft, circulated privately, proposed regulating independent creators on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and X,  raising fears of government overreach.  

The government cited differing opinions within its bureaucracy about the Bill's scope as a reason for its withdrawal. They announced consultations on a previous version of the bill, released in 2023, while omitting mention of the  withdrawn 2024 draft. 

This has caused confusion among stakeholders as the 2024 draft  significantly expanded the Bill's remit to include social media accounts and online video creators, requiring prior registration and adherence to program codes. Large tech companies and independent content creators voiced concerns about the 2024 draft, prompting the government's  decision to withdraw it and revert to public consultations on the 2023 version.

One of the 33 crest gates at the Tungabhadra dam in Karnataka was washed away on August 10, 2024, due to high water flow. The gate's chain link broke, leading to it being swept away by the force of the water. Repairs are contingent on reducing the reservoir water level by 60-65%, a process that is expected to take some time.  This situation has raised concerns among both upstream and downstream communities regarding irrigation and potential flooding. Heavy rains could exacerbate the situation. The water level is currently dropping, and the Tungabhadra Board plans to expedite the repair process.

Queenie Hallegua, the last woman of Kerala's Paradesi Jewish community, passed away recently, leaving her nephew Keith as the last remaining member of that group in Kerala.  Kerala has two main Jewish communities: the Malabar Jews, whose history dates back nearly 3,000 years, and the Paradesi Jews, who arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries from the Iberian Peninsula. The Paradesi Jews largely integrated into Malayalam culture, but eventually separated from the older Malabar Jews.  

In the mid-20th century, Kerala Jews began migrating to Israel, leaving only 14 Malabar Jews and one Paradesi Jew in Kerala today.  The community's decline is evidenced by the state's remaining "Jew Streets" and synagogues, now mostly empty relics of a vibrant past.

Hindenburg Research has accused Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch of having stakes in offshore funds allegedly used in the Adani money siphoning scandal. Hindenburg claims these funds were linked to Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani. 

The Buchs deny the allegations, stating their investment in the offshore funds predates Madhabi's appointment at Sebi. They claim it was based on the expertise of the fund's Chief Investment Officer, a childhood friend of Dhaval. Sebi defends Buch, emphasizing her disclosures and recusals in potential conflict-of-interest situations. 

Hindenburg also raises concerns about Sebi's inaction against other suspect Adani shareholders. Sebi, however, highlights the extensive probe conducted in the Hindenburg matter, including communication with various regulators and examination of numerous documents.

Ukraine launched a surprise attack on August 6th, advancing approximately 30 kilometers into Russia's Kursk region.  This marks Kyiv's largest incursion into Russian territory since the war began in 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the attack aims to "restore justice" and "push the war into the aggressor's territory." While details remain unclear, experts believe the incursion may serve multiple purposes, including strengthening Ukraine's negotiation position, potentially seizing the Kursk nuclear power plant, and diverting Russian troops from the east.  The success of the operation, however, remains uncertain, as maintaining control of captured territory would require significant resources.  Ukraine's eastern defensive operations could be impacted depending on the success or failure of the incursion.

Hindenburg Research accused Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson of India’s Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), of conflict of interest, linking her to allegations against the Adani Group. The report claims Buch's husband may have used funds linked to the Adani Group, raising concerns about Sebi's impartiality in investigating the conglomerate. 

The Indian government has declined to comment, leaving questions about whether Buch disclosed potential conflicts and recused herself from relevant investigations. 

In contrast, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have strict ethical codes to prevent conflicts of interest. These codes require employees to disclose financial interests, avoid participating in matters where they have a direct or indirect interest, and pre-approve securities transactions. Violations can lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal.

Hindenburg Research recently accused SEBI chairperson Madhavi Puri Buch of having stakes in offshore entities linked to the Adani Group money laundering scandal.  Buch and her husband refuted these claims, stating that the investment in question predated her SEBI appointment and that all necessary disclosures and recusal measures were followed.  

SEBI's 'Code on Conflict of Interests for Members of Board' mandates board members to disclose personal interests and associations that could influence board decisions. This includes financial holdings, substantial transactions,  and relationships with regulated entities.  Board members are prohibited from holding other profit-bearing positions and from accepting gifts from regulated entities. Furthermore, they are required to recuse themselves from matters where a conflict of interest exists.  The code emphasizes confidentiality, although disclosures can be made under certain circumstances, including  suspicions of conflict of interest raised by the public.  A dedicated secretary manages these disclosures, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are facing an extended stay on the International Space Station (ISS) due to technical issues with their Starliner spacecraft.  Initially planned to return after a week, their departure date is now uncertain, potentially pushing back to February 2025.  While not in danger, the extended stay presents health challenges common to long-duration spaceflights, including bone density reduction and vision issues. 

The ISS can accommodate them, as it regularly hosts seven astronauts and has room for more during crew changes and visits.  Williams and Wilmore have experience in prolonged space stays, each having spent significant time aboard the station previously.  NASA is studying the long-term effects of space travel and encourages astronauts to participate in these experiments, contributing to our understanding of human adaptation to space environments.

### [How China increased its medal haul at the Olympics and why the Games matter to it](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-olympics-medals-gold-cpc-9508413/)

The People's Republic of China's participation in the Olympics began in 1984, coinciding with economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping.  The government's focus on sports, aimed at national rejuvenation and a positive global image, saw successful medal hauls but also raised concerns about athlete pressure and state-sanctioned doping. 

China's hosting of the 2008 and 2022 Olympics was seen as a strategic move to enhance its international standing. However, the more restrictive atmosphere during the 2022 Games highlighted concerns about growing authoritarianism in China.

### [After breaking free, why the world’s largest iceberg is stuck spinning in circles](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/a23a-largest-iceberg-antartica-9508012/)

For over 30 years, the world's largest iceberg, A23a, was trapped in the Antarctic. After breaking free in 2020, it began drifting northward. However, A23a  became caught in a vortex over a seamount, spinning slowly but steadily. 

This unusual occurrence is attributed to a Taylor column, a current that forms around seamounts, causing a stagnant cylinder of rotating water. While the exact duration of A23a's rotation is unknown, experts believe it could remain in the vortex for an extended period. Though the iceberg won't contribute to sea level rise, its prolonged presence may impact marine life in the area.

### [How a knife attack triggered a wave of far-right protests across the UK](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uk-riots-asylum-immigration-protests-9507777/)

Following a knife attack in Southport that killed three young girls, the UK experienced widespread violence and riots, described as the worst in over a decade. The perpetrator, a British citizen born to Rwandan parents, was charged with murder and attempted murder. However, social media was flooded with misinformation falsely claiming that the suspect was an asylum seeker and "radical Muslim migrant."

This led to far-right groups and individuals exploiting the tragedy to incite anti-immigration and racist sentiments, culminating in attacks on mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers. Despite the perpetrator's identity being revealed, the spread of misinformation fueled extremist reactions, highlighting the UK's growing anti-immigration sentiment heightened by political rhetoric and perceived societal issues.

### [Why Odisha is facing a potato crisis, with prices as high as Rs 60 per kg](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odisha-potato-crisis-price-rise-9507693/)

Odisha is facing a severe potato shortage due to a ban imposed by the West Bengal government, its primary supplier. The ban, aimed at stabilizing prices in West Bengal, has led to a surge in potato prices in Odisha to Rs 55-60/kg. Odisha heavily relies on imports, as its own production falls significantly short of demand.  A previous mission to make Odisha self-sufficient in potato production failed due to inadequate cold storage and market linkages. 

To address the current crisis, Odisha is procuring potatoes from Uttar Pradesh and has initiated sales at subsidized rates through government shops. The state government has also appealed to West Bengal to lift the ban.

### [Japan issues its first-ever ‘megaquake advisory’: What does it mean?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/japan-megaquake-advisory-9506703/)

Japan's meteorological agency issued its first-ever "megaquake advisory" following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake on August 8th. The advisory warns of a heightened likelihood of strong shaking and large tsunamis along the Nankai Trough, a subduction zone off Japan's southwest coast. 

While the advisory doesn't predict a specific earthquake, the Nankai Trough historically experiences large earthquakes every 100 to 150 years, often in pairs. The most recent pair occurred in 1944 and 1946. Experts fear the next tremor could be devastating, given that a magnitude 8-9 earthquake along this trough has a 70% probability of striking within the next 30 years. Such an event could impact a third of Japan and cause widespread economic damage.  The advisory urges residents to prepare for potential future warnings.

### [What is behind Ukraine’s Kursk operation in Russia?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukraine-kursk-operation-russia-9506353/)

Ukrainian troops have advanced into Russian territory in the Kursk region, reportedly reaching a depth of 35 kilometers. 

While the extent of Ukrainian control remains unclear, experts believe this advance is strategically motivated.  Ukraine aims to gain territory, exert pressure on Russia in potential peace negotiations, create a buffer zone for Ukrainian residents, and weaken the Russian military by diverting troops to the border. 

The operation, potentially planned for months and supported by Western military aid, carries risks for Ukraine, including potential troop losses.  However, it also presents a political victory, demonstrating Ukrainian strength and pressuring Russian leadership.  The duration of the operation depends on Western support and Russia's ability to counter. Notably, the incursion occurred near a vital gas transit station, though Russia's gas exports to Europe have declined since the war's outset.

### [Ocean temperatures in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef now hottest in 400 years: What a new study says](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ocean-temperatures-australia-great-barrier-reef-9506296/)

A new study reveals that water temperatures surrounding Australia's Great Barrier Reef have reached their highest level in 400 years over the past decade. This alarming warming trend, linked to human-induced climate change, is severely threatening the world's largest coral reef.

### [Why are Rajasthan’s sanitation workers protesting?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-sanitation-workers-in-rajasthan-are-protesting-9506252/)

The Rajasthan government's decision to recruit 24,000 sanitation workers has sparked protests from existing Valmiki sanitation workers.  They demand preference in the recruitment, arguing that workers from other communities often sub-let sanitation work to Valmiki workers, increasing their burden. Traditionally,  Valmiki community members were hired directly as sanitation workers. However, recent recruitment processes have included other communities, leading to the appointment of non-Valmiki sanitation workers for the first time.  After the government issued a corrigendum to prioritize experience in municipal sanitation work, non-Valmiki workers challenged it in court, leading to the High Court's order to recruit as per existing rules.  The government has halted the process and is working on amending the rules to ensure Valmiki worker preference.

### [Explained: The US antitrust ruling against Google and its implications for India](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/us-antitrust-ruling-against-google-and-its-implications-for-india-9505459/)

A US court ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by leveraging its position as the default search engine on smartphones and browsers to maintain a monopoly. The judge cited Google's "default distribution" as a significant advantage, as most users stick to the pre-set search engine.  While the ruling specifically addresses the US market, it raises questions about Google's practices in other countries, including India.  The Indian Competition Commission has already penalized Google for similar practices and forced it to allow users to choose default search engines.  The outcome of the US case could influence ongoing litigation in India and the implementation of India's new Competition Bill, which aims to regulate anti-competitive practices by large tech companies.

### [From pioneering microfinance to heading Bangladesh’s interim govt: Story of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/from-pioneering-microfinance-to-heading-bangladeshs-interim-govt-story-of-nobel-laureate-muhammad-yunus-9505433/)

Muhammad Yunus, known as the "father of microfinance," recently took oath as Chief Adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh. His journey from academia to social activism began after witnessing the poverty and hunger in Bangladesh following its independence in 1971. He developed the Grameen Bank model, which provides collateral-free microloans to the poor, predominantly women, empowering them to overcome economic challenges. 

Grameen Bank, launched in 1976, has grown significantly, serving millions of people and dispersing billions in loans. Yunus's advocacy for social businesses has gained international recognition, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. However, he faced political opposition from then-PM Sheikh Hasina, who accused him of various wrongdoings and launched numerous legal cases against him.  With Hasina's removal from power, Yunus now leads the interim government, facing the daunting task of rebuilding national unity and addressing the complex issues that led to the recent political turmoil.

The Supreme Court granted bail to Manish Sisodia, the former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister, citing the prolonged delay in trial and pre-trial incarceration as grounds to bypass stringent bail conditions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 

The court emphasized that the constitutional right to a speedy trial supersedes the PMLA's strict bail requirements, especially when the trial's conclusion is unlikely in the near future. Although the court acknowledged the prior rejection of Sisodia's bail application, it focused on the exceptional circumstances presented by the inordinate delay in the trial process.

An interim government has been established in Bangladesh following weeks of violent protests.  Mohammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate economist, is the Chief Advisor, a role similar to Prime Minister.  The government was formed after the  flight of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday. Yunus' selection was a result of negotiations between military leaders, the President, and student protesters. At least 300 people have died during the demonstrations, which began with students demanding changes to a quota system for public jobs but escalated into wider opposition to Hasina's government.

### [Most tree planting campaigns fail. What has to change?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/most-tree-planting-campaigns-9504990/)

Many tree planting campaigns fail to deliver on their climate change mitigation goals. 

Reasons for failure include planting the wrong tree species in unsuitable locations, inadequate post-planting care and a lack of long-term monitoring. 

Successful campaigns, such as the Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project in China, prioritize native species, drought-resistance, and local climate conditions.  

Involving local communities in planting and care is crucial for long-term success. Focusing on planting a smaller number of trees that are more likely to thrive is also more effective than large-scale plantings with high mortality rates.

### [Why silica dust could become the ‘new asbestos’ health risk](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/silica-dust-asbestos-health-risk-silicosis-9504526/)

Researchers recommend lowering the daily exposure limit to silica dust in various industries to 0.05 mg/m3 from the current 0.1 mg/m3. This change is expected to save an estimated 13,000 lives globally by reducing the risk of silicosis, a potentially fatal lung disease.  

The study, published in the British Medical Journal Thorax, highlights a need for more data on silicosis risks, especially in developing countries.  Silicosis is caused by inhaling silica dust found in materials like concrete, sand, and granite, and it can take years to develop. 

The researchers found that halving silica dust exposure over a 40-year working lifetime could reduce silicosis cases by 77%. They suggest implementing stricter workplace safety measures like water suppression, improved ventilation, and personal protective equipment to mitigate silica dust exposure.

Manish Sisodia, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, has been granted bail by the Supreme Court in the Delhi excise policy case. The court noted that Sisodia had spent approximately 17 months in jail without trial, violating his right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution. While acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations, the court emphasized that bail is the rule and jail is the exception, particularly in cases where the accused has deep roots in the country and is not a flight risk.  
 
The court also noted the delays in the trial and the reversed burden of proof under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, prompting the release of Sisodia on bail with certain conditions, such as surrendering his passport and reporting to the police regularly.

### [What’s causing Antarctica’s deep-winter heatwave, what could be its fallout?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/whats-causing-antarcticas-deep-winter-heatwave-what-could-be-its-fallout-9503603/)

Antarctica is experiencing a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures 10 degrees Celsius higher than average since mid-July.  The primary cause is the weakening of the polar vortex, a band of cold air that usually keeps Antarctica frigid. This weakening, caused by large-scale atmospheric waves, allowed warmer air to enter the region. 
 
  Reduced Antarctic sea ice is also likely contributing to the higher temperatures.  Sea ice reflects sunlight and acts as a barrier between cold air and warmer water, helping to regulate temperatures. A smaller sea ice extent could lead to warmer air temperatures.  These extreme temperatures are a significant concern as they contribute to melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, which could raise global sea levels and disrupt the global ocean circulation system.

### [Explained: The proposed changes to Waqf law](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/proposed-changes-to-waqf-law-9503596/)

The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, seeks to significantly alter India's existing Waqf law. Key changes include shifting power from Muslim-run Boards and Tribunals to state governments, clarifying the definition of Waqf property, and giving the central government power to audit Waqfs. 

The Bill aims to address concerns about government land being mistakenly designated as Waqf, and proposes changes to how a property is deemed to be Waqf property, potentially impacting mosques and graveyards.  It also allows for non-Muslim representation on Waqf Boards and under CEO positions. These proposed changes have been met with criticism from Opposition parties who view them as "unconstitutional," "anti-minority," and "divisive."

### [Sheikh Hasina in India amid UK asylum roadblock: What is India’s policy on refugees?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sheikh-hasina-refugee-india-policy-bangladesh-9503287/)

Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, is currently in India. Originally planning to seek asylum in the UK, she encountered difficulties due to visa restrictions and immigration rules.  India, while lacking a formal refugee policy, is allowing her to stay. This situation highlights India's inconsistent approach to refugees, exemplified by the Rohingya crisis. Although India offers refuge to some, like Tibetans and Chakmas, it has treated the Rohingya as illegal immigrants, leading to calls for deportation. This stance contradicts India's international commitments to protect refugees, raising concerns about the principle of non-refoulement. 

India's approach to refugees varies depending on the country of origin.  For instance, Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are allowed to live in Tamil Nadu with certain rights, while the Rohingya face a precarious situation. This underscores the need for a clear and consistent refugee policy in India.

Expert opinions diverge regarding the implications of each candidate. While some view both as detrimental to US-China relations, others believe Harris' potential inexperience could present opportunities for China. However, concerns remain about the potential for increased anti-China policies under both candidates.  Chinese online discussions reflect these tensions, highlighting the significance of the US elections for China's strategic planning and demonstrating deep-seated ideological divisions within the country's intellectual circles.

India's Vinesh Phogat was disqualified from her scheduled gold medal bout at the Paris Olympics after failing to make the weight limit on Wednesday morning. Despite clearing the weigh-in the previous day, she was found to be "a few grams over 50 kg" 

Weight cutting is common in combat sports, but it can be detrimental to an athlete's health and performance.  Vinesh had cut significant weight prior to the first weigh-in but regained some of it during the day, making the subsequent weigh-in a challenge. She ultimately failed to make the weight, resulting in her elimination from the competition. 

UWW President Nenad Lalovic emphasized the organization's desire for athletes to compete at their natural weight, citing concerns about the damaging effects of extreme weight cutting.

### [Why has the RBI policy panel kept interest rates unchanged for the 9th time in a row?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-mpc-interest-rates-unchanged-reason-9502138/)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained the repo rate at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive time, citing persistent food inflation as a concern. Despite this, the RBI has kept the GDP growth projection for FY2025 unchanged at 7.2% and the retail inflation forecast at 4.5%.  

The RBI Governor emphasized the importance of price stability and the committee's vigilance to prevent spillovers from food inflation. While headline inflation edged up in June, core inflation has moderated. However, food prices remain volatile, influenced by factors like the uneven monsoon and geopolitical uncertainties.  

Experts anticipate the RBI's first repo rate cut potentially in December 2024, contingent on favorable food inflation trends and absence of major shocks.  
The decision to hold the repo rate steady will likely keep EMIs unchanged, offering relief to borrowers with home and personal loans linked to external benchmark lending rates (EBLRs).  

Global monetary policy developments, particularly expectations of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, could also influence the RBI's future decisions.

Namal Rajapaksa, son of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, will contest the upcoming presidential election in September. This election follows the 2022 uprising that forced his uncle, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, from power. Namal's candidacy presents both hope and scepticism. While some see him as a fresh face, others recall the controversies surrounding the Rajapaksa family during their previous time in power. 

Namal has attempted to distance himself from cultural extremism while emphasizing cultural identity, and has focused on expanding his party's influence beyond its traditional strongholds, particularly engaging with the Tamil community. His family legacy is a double-edged sword, offering both the popularity gained from ending the civil war and criticism related to economic mismanagement and human rights allegations.  The election takes place amidst a difficult economic climate, with the winning candidate facing the task of steering Sri Lanka towards recovery.

Recently in Bangladesh,  long-serving Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following widespread student protests against quotas in government jobs. The protests, initially focused on economic inequality, escalated after police violence against demonstrators. The government's response, including Hasina's controversial remarks about protesters, fueled public anger and accusations of authoritarianism.

An interim government under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been established, with a focus on restoring order and public trust. 

While the future of Bangladesh's politics remains uncertain, the protests demonstrated the power of young voices and the complexities of the country's political landscape. The Awami League, Bangladesh's oldest political party, will likely remain influential, but it faces challenges rebuilding its image after its perceived missteps.

### [Why has the draft Broadcast Services Bill 2024 raised concerns of freedom of speech?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-broadcast-draft-services-bill-freedom-speech-9500124/)

The Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has proposed new regulations for independent news creators on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. The Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024, expands the scope of the ministry's remit to include social media accounts and online video creators, requiring prior registration and content evaluation committees. These regulations define "digital news broadcasters" broadly, potentially encompassing individual creators who publish news and current affairs content systematically.  

The bill mandates that such creators inform the government about their operations and activities, along with details about their content evaluation committees. Non-compliance could result in hefty fines. 

The government cites the role of independent creators in the lead-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections as a reason for these stricter regulations, aiming to establish "accountability" and a "level playing field" between mainstream press and independent creators.

Punjab aims to construct the 149.53-km Malwa Canal, a new irrigation channel costing Rs 2,300 crore.  The canal will originate at Harike Headworks and irrigate 2 lakh acres across seven districts. The project aims to address water scarcity in the Malwa region, particularly during the paddy sowing season.  

It seeks to provide supplemental water to the left side of the Rajasthan Feeder canal and alleviate the burden on the existing Sirhind Feeder canal, which often requires rotational operation. The canal is expected to benefit 28 villages in Ferozepur, 10 in Faridkot, and 24 in Muktsar. 

However, funding constraints and technical concerns regarding the canal's viability have been raised by experts. Land acquisition, environmental clearances, and water availability remain significant challenges for the project.

The Disaster Management Act, 2005, is being amended to improve operational efficiency in disaster response. The amendment expands the role of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and mandates the creation of state-level disaster relief forces.

It also designates the National Crisis Management Committee as the nodal body for national emergencies and disasters. The NDMA will be responsible for creating national disaster databases and recommending guidelines for relief and compensation. The amendment clarifies that man-made disasters exclude law-and-order situations. Despite these changes, concerns remain regarding the NDMA's lack of institutional strengthening and the continued vacancy of the vice-Chairperson position.

### [Explained: The debate over GST on health insurance](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goods-and-services-tax-gst-on-health-insurance-gst-withdrawal-life-insurance-rahul-mamata-9499214/)

Opposition parties are demanding the withdrawal of GST on health and life insurance premiums, citing the impact of increased premiums on the affordability of insurance for the general population. 

They argue that the 18% GST, coupled with rising medical inflation, is making it difficult for people to access essential insurance coverage.  The government acknowledges the representations received but maintains that GST rates are determined by the GST Council.

Insurance companies cite rising costs and medical inflation as reasons for the premium hikes. While some experts are skeptical about whether reducing GST will benefit policyholders, the Confederation of General Insurance Agents’ Associations of India and industry CEOs have called for a reduction in the GST rate to make insurance more affordable and accessible.  India's insurance penetration remains low, highlighting the need for measures to encourage wider coverage.

Walz's record in Minnesota, including championing abortion rights and common-sense gun control, aligns with the Democratic platform. His selection is also seen as a strategic move to appeal to crucial swing states in the Midwest.

### [Before Bangladesh and Sheikh Hasina, how leaders of Sri Lanka and Afghanistan fled amid turmoil](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-south-asian-leaders-fled-turmoil-9498845/)

In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country amidst widespread protests triggered by a Supreme Court ruling on job reservations for descendants of freedom fighters. These protests, fueled by economic hardship, evolved into a movement against Hasina's authoritarian rule, leading to her departure and a military takeover of the country.  Sri Lanka faced a similar situation in 2022 when an economic crisis led to massive public protests.  President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his government were forced to resign as protesters stormed government buildings. The country has since been attempting to recover and hold elections.  Afghanistan experienced a dramatic collapse in 2021 when the Taliban rapidly gained control of the country after the withdrawal of US and NATO forces.  President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan as the Taliban took over, leading to widespread chaos and uncertainty.

Major stock markets globally plunged sharply, driven by a phenomenon known as the unwinding of the yen carry trade.  This trade involved borrowing yen at Japan's historically low interest rates and investing in higher-yielding assets in other countries.  The Bank of Japan's recent decision to raise interest rates has made this strategy less profitable, prompting investors to sell their holdings in foreign assets, leading to a decline in global markets.

An Indian startup group has filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India against Google, alleging anti-competitive practices in online advertising. The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF) claims Google's dominance in online platforms and its 97% revenue reliance on advertising stifle competition and harm Indian businesses.  ADIF criticizes Google's ad-ranking system, trademark usage in keyword bidding, and self-preferencing of its own services. It also expresses concern about Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to phase out third-party cookies, potentially impacting non-Google advertising platforms.  This complaint comes amidst India's ongoing discussion of a comprehensive digital competition law that could significantly impact large tech companies like Google.

The relationship between India and Bangladesh has strengthened significantly since Sheikh Hasina came to power in 2009. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in the subcontinent, and India is Bangladesh's second largest partner in Asia.  Bilateral trade reached $13 billion in the financial year 2023-24. Both countries are discussing a potential free trade agreement (FTA) which could dramatically increase trade.

India has also invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, including rail and port development.  This has improved connectivity between the two countries and eased trade. Disruptions to this relationship could negatively impact trade,  investment, and India's access to its northeastern states.

Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, who secured India's trust after her father's assassination in 1975, faced challenges to her legitimacy but received steadfast support from India.  Her government prioritized stability and economic growth, collaborating with India on issues like maritime boundaries, security, and infrastructure.  However, her crackdown on opposition groups raised concerns, and as she exits power, India faces the task of navigating a potentially volatile political landscape in Bangladesh, balancing its security interests with the need to foster democratic values. The relationship between India and Bangladesh's new leadership will be crucial in determining the future of the region.

### [How India needs to deal with the new Bangladesh: 5 challenges beyond 1971](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/new-delhi-dhaka-challenges-9496876/)

The fall of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh poses significant challenges for India, forcing it to navigate complex geopolitical ramifications. India must balance its longstanding support for Hasina  with the need to engage with her opponents and prevent a widening rift. Delhi will face pressure from Pakistan and China to exploit the instability, requiring a concerted effort with international partners to ensure a peaceful transition. India must also move beyond romanticizing the 1971 liberation narrative and engage with diverse perspectives within Bangladesh.  Ultimately, India needs strategic patience and a commitment to transcending historical baggage to build enduring relations with the evolving landscape of Bangladesh.

### [Why Hasina’s fall was not a surprise — and what India must prepare for now](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hasina-bangladesh-india-9496783/)

Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure from Bangladesh follows weeks of violent protests and a government refusal to meet the protesters' demands.  Hasina's alleged rigging of multiple elections, coupled with her autocratic rule characterized by arrests, disappearances, and crackdowns on dissent, led to widespread discontent. 

Economic woes, including a depreciating currency, depleted foreign reserves, and high inflation, further fueled the unrest.  The protests that ultimately forced her out stemmed from a Supreme Court ruling reinstating a quota system for government jobs that favored descendants of freedom fighters. 

Hasina's legacy is complex: while she promoted secularism and modernization, her harsh tactics alienated opposition groups and potentially empowered Islamist and anti-Hindu sentiments.  India now faces a diplomatic challenge in navigating this shift in Bangladesh's leadership.

### [Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, Jamaat-e-Islami: What to know about 5 key figures in Bangladesh politics](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/sheikh-hasina-jamaat-awami-bnp-bangladesh-9496706/)

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India following widespread protests against her government. The demonstrations, sparked by student opposition to expanded government job quotas for descendants of freedom fighters, represent a broader discontent with Hasina's 15-year rule. Many opposition parties, including Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), boycotted the recent January elections. 

Hasina, the leader of the Awami League and daughter of Bangladesh's "Father of the Nation," Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has maintained a strong relationship with India and overseen Bangladesh's economic growth. However, her rule has been criticized by some international actors for political crackdowns and alleged election irregularities. 

The BNP, once a formidable force in Bangladesh politics, has seen a decline in popularity and faced internal turmoil led by Khaleda Zia, who has been convicted of corruption charges. The Jamaat-e-Islami, a banned Islamist party, has been accused of fueling the protests and exploiting the situation.

Following widespread protests fueled by  government job quotas, Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country.  Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman announced the formation of an interim government, assuming responsibility and urging calm.   

Protesters attacked the statue of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, symbolizing the simmering tension between civil and military power. This marked a significant moment given the army's historical involvement in Bangladesh's politics.  The Bangladesh Liberation War saw the army directly involved in the fight for independence from Pakistan,  and subsequent coups in 1975 and beyond cemented the military's role.  The historical pattern demonstrates the army's influence in shaping Bangladesh's political landscape, wielding power both during and after periods of civilian rule.

### [As Sheikh Hasina flees, what does it mean for India? Six preliminary takeaways from Bangladesh’s crisis](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-coup-protests-9496240/)

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned, moving to India. This follows a month of large-scale protests over the country's job quota system, escalating a situation that had seen Hasina's popularity decline after years of economic growth and a crackdown on opposition groups, media, and civil society. The Bangladesh Army will form an interim government with political party support. 

Hasina's departure, following a 17-year tenure, creates uncertainty for India, which had a close partnership with her on counter-terrorism and development initiatives. India's continued support for Hasina, despite concerns about democracy in Bangladesh, has been a point of contention with Western nations.  

The new situation in Bangladesh raises questions about the future direction of India-Bangladesh relations, particularly given the history of instability under opposition rule. The role of the Bangladeshi Army Chief will be critical in shaping the country's future.

The Indian Sensex saw a significant drop of 2.5% on Monday, driven by global factors such as fears of a US recession, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and economic weakness in Japan. Experts reassured investors that this correction is not a reflection of India's economic fundamentals but rather a response to global uncertainties. They advised investors to remain calm and avoid panic-selling, recommending a cautious approach to investments and a focus on large-cap companies.  Market participants also cautioned against speculative trading in volatile times. While long-term investors are advised to hold their positions, experts suggest toning down return expectations for equity investments in the coming months.

### [SC rules Delhi L-G can directly nominate Municipal Corporation ‘aldermen’: What was the case?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-mcd-delhi-lg-aldermen-9495832/)

The Supreme Court ruled that the Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) has the power to appoint aldermen to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) without consulting the Delhi government's Council of Ministers.  The court based its decision on the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, which explicitly grants the L-G this authority.  

The case stemmed from the L-G's January 2023 nomination of 10 aldermen, which the Delhi government challenged in court, arguing that it required the L-G to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  The Supreme Court disagreed, citing its 2023 ruling that Parliament has the power to legislate on State List subjects, including local government, in the context of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. 


This ruling means the aldermen nomination was valid and the MCD can now proceed with its functions, including the formation of the Standing Committee, which requires alderman participation.

### [Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification: How CJI underlined substantive equality](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-cji-substantive-equality-9495522/)

In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court recognized the concept of “substantive equality” when it comes to reservations for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).  The court’s interpretation highlights the need to go beyond a formal understanding of equality and consider historical injustices and the diverse needs of different groups. 

The judgement traces the evolution of the court's stance on reservations, from an initial focus on equal opportunity to a more nuanced approach that acknowledges the need for affirmative action. It cites various rulings, including  M R Balaji v State of Mysore (1962), State of Kerala v. N M Thomas (1975), and   the Indra Sawhney judgment (1992).

The Court addressed the "efficiency" argument often used against reservations, emphasizing that securing minimum qualifying marks, rather than the highest, is sufficient to ensure efficient administration.  It ultimately concluded that reservation is not a concessionary exception to equality but a reflection of the Constitution's commitment to substantive equality.

### [RBI policy: Why Monetary Policy Committee is likely to keep repo rate steady](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rbi-policy-monetary-policy-committee-repo-rate-steady-9495243/)

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee is predicted to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent during its August meeting. This decision is attributed to concerns surrounding elevated food inflation, which could hinder the disinflation process.  

While headline inflation has edged up, experts anticipate it will gradually decline towards the RBI's 4 percent target in the third quarter.  However, risks remain, particularly from an uneven monsoon season potentially impacting food prices.

The RBI is expected to maintain its GDP growth forecast for FY25 at 7.2 percent.  Economic forecasts suggest a possible repo rate cut in late 2024 or early 2025, contingent on factors such as the monsoon's progress and global economic conditions.

### [Are deep-sea metals a vital resource or an environmental disaster in the making?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/deep-sea-metals-vital-resource-environmental-disaster-9494429/)

Discussions at the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Jamaica regarding regulations for deep-sea mining have revealed deep divisions. While countries like China and Norway push for quick agreements to allow mining operations, others, including Germany, Brazil, and Palau, insist on thorough environmental impact assessments first. Many nations and environmental groups oppose deep-sea mining altogether, citing concerns about fragile marine ecosystems and the irreversible damage mining robots could inflict. 

Manganese nodules, rich in metals crucial for electric vehicles, are the primary target of mining companies. These nodules, found in vast quantities on the ocean floor, are home to thousands of unique species adapted to extreme deep-sea conditions.  Critics argue that the potential environmental and ecological costs far outweigh any economic benefits. Some experts suggest that the technology for deep-sea mining is not yet mature and the risks are significant. Major corporations are increasingly pledging to avoid using seafloor-extracted materials, citing ethical concerns and the potential for contamination.  The ISA is expected to finalize regulations by 2025.

Ukraine recently sanctioned Russian oil company Lukoil, halting its pipeline crude oil deliveries to Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. These countries, heavily reliant on Russian oil, have protested and requested EU mediation. While the EU has worked to reduce its overall dependence on Russian oil and gas, it has allowed pipeline imports for certain members. The EU has particularly relied on pipeline gas from Russia, with some member states like Hungary increasing their reliance. However, Ukraine's transit contract for Russian gas is set to expire in December 2024, potentially leading to further escalation.

US politics has been shaken up in July.  A potential assassination attempt on Donald Trump, his choice of younger Senator JD Vance as his running mate, President Biden's withdrawal from the race, and Vice President Kamala Harris stepping in as the Democratic nominee have made the upcoming election unpredictable.  
Trump's choice of Vance mirrors his own agenda, while Harris faces the decision of balancing her ticket or  doubling down on her own political stance.  Biden's withdrawal was prompted by concerns he would lose to Trump, and Harris has energized the Democratic party with her candidacy.  Her VP pick will be a key strategic decision, potentially impacting Indo-US relations, given India's interest in strengthening ties with the US.

New rice and wheat varieties offer a more sustainable approach to farming. Developed using traditional breeding methods, these crops tolerate a specific herbicide, Imazethapyr, allowing for weed control without the need for intensive water usage or tilling. Farmers can now use direct seeding techniques for rice, eliminating the need for flooded nurseries and transplanting, and zero-tillage for wheat, reducing the reliance on fallow land preparation. This shift towards herbicide-tolerant crops offers significant benefits in terms of water conservation, reduced fuel consumption, and diminished environmental impact.

The recent prisoner swap between Russia and the West involved the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan, who had been convicted of espionage, in exchange for eight individuals, including a convicted hitman.  Prisoner swaps, governed by neither treaties nor a codified doctrine, are based on the  principle of sovereign equality and a negotiation of value between nations.  The price of a prisoner’s freedom can vary depending on factors such as their nationality, the public pressure on their home government, and the perceived value of the information they possess.  

Past examples, like the 1962 Powers-Abel exchange or the 2022 release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, highlight the complexities and potential consequences of these exchanges, often involving significant political and financial costs. The recent swap has drawn criticism for the differing profiles of those released, raising questions about the precedent it sets for future negotiations.

Rahul Gandhi's statement about a potential raid by the Enforcement Directorate stemmed from his Parliament speech criticizing the Budget. He compared the government's policies to the Kauravas' "chakravyuh" formation in the Mahabharata, entrapping India's people.

In the epic, the chakravyuh was a formidable military formation that only a select few, like Abhimanyu, knew how to penetrate. Abhimanyu, though skilled, only knew the entrance strategy and not the exit, ultimately falling prey to the Kauravas trapped within.

The article discusses the controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's victory at the Paris Olympics. After defeating Italy's Angela Carini, Khelif faced online abuse, accused of being a man competing unfairly. 

This incident highlights the ongoing debate about transgender women and athletes with certain biological characteristics competing in women's sports. The issue centers around testosterone levels and potential advantages.  While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allows athletes to compete based on their passport gender, the International Boxing Association (IBA) previously banned Khelif and another boxer based on "gender eligibility" tests. 

The article explores different perspectives on the matter, including arguments for inclusion and fairness. It also examines the IOC's evolving stance on transgender athletes and the varying regulations across different sports federations. The debate remains complex, with uncertainties regarding testosterone's precise impact on athletic performance.

Israel has assassinated three key leaders of militant groups: Fuad Shukr of Hezbollah, Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas, and Mohammed Deif, also of Hamas. These strikes are seen as a major victory for Israel in retaliation for the October 7 attacks by Hamas. 

Targeting these leaders, particularly Haniyeh in Tehran and Shukr in Beirut, sends a strong message to Iran and its proxies, raising the risk of a wider conflict.  

Iran, vowing revenge, could retaliate through attacks on Israeli targets, coordination with its allies, or targeting Israeli officials abroad. These potential actions pose significant concerns for India, considering the presence of a large Indian diaspora in the region and its reliance on West Asian oil imports.


The situation has escalated significantly, jeopardizing efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza.  International efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation, but the outcome remains uncertain, hinging largely on Iran's response.

Controversy surrounds two boxers, Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, who are competing at the Paris Olympics despite failing gender eligibility tests by the International Boxing Association (IBA). The IBA stated they didn't meet criteria based on tests conducted at World Championships. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), having derecognised the IBA, says the boxers are eligible under IOC rules which prioritize passport-stated gender. The IOC has defended their participation, but criticized the IBA's decision-making process.

Other sports have varying regulations. Athletics has testosterone limits for athletes with differences in sex development (DSD), while swimming and cycling have restrictions on transgender women competing in women's events.

### [Explained: Legal challenges to the Great Nicobar infrastructure project](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/legal-cases-greater-nicobar-infra-project-9490929/)

The Great Nicobar Island infrastructure project, a Rs 72,000 crore development encompassing an airport, a transshipment terminal, and a township, has faced legal challenges citing environmental concerns and potential harm to indigenous communities. Environmental activist Ashish Kothari and the Conservation Action Trust (CAT) challenged the project's clearances, arguing that it would damage biodiversity, inadequate environmental impact assessments and raise concerns about tribal communities. 

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) formed a high-powered committee to revisit the project's environmental clearance, particularly focusing on coral conservation and the port's location in a prohibited area. While the NGT acknowledged the need for development and national security, it also highlighted “unanswered deficiencies” related to the project's environmental impact.  Petitions are still pending before the NGT and Calcutta High Court regarding the project's legality and compliance with environmental regulations.

### [Why the Odisha government will plant palm trees to combat lightning strikes](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/lightning-strikes-palm-trees-odisha-9490868/)

Odisha, grappling with high lightning strike fatalities, has approved a plan to plant 19 lakh palm trees as lightning conductors. The state has witnessed 3,790 deaths from lightning strikes in the last 11 years, with a significant increase in recent years. Palm trees are believed to absorb lightning due to their height and moisture content. However, experts have raised concerns about the efficacy of this plan, citing the time it takes for trees to reach maturity and the potential for fire hazards. They advocate for a data-driven, comprehensive strategy coupled with public awareness campaigns on lightning safety.  
 
  The state's early warning system, while helpful, faces limitations in accurately predicting lightning strikes.

### [Sub-classification of SCs, STs: Could OBC model for ‘creamy layer’ be a blueprint?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/identifying-the-creamy-layer-model-of-obc-reservation-9489999/)

The Supreme Court has allowed for the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to implement separate quotas for those considered more backward. This follows the precedent set by the OBC reservation, which excludes a "creamy layer" of more advantaged individuals.

The Court suggests adapting the OBC creamy layer model, acknowledging that criteria for excluding this layer within SC and ST communities may differ.   Justice Pankaj Mithal hinted at using educational background as a potential criterion. The decision leaves it to states to determine if and how to implement this sub-classification for SC and ST communities.

### [Explained: Supreme Court’s verdict on sub-classification of SCs and STs](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-sub-classification-of-sc-st-9489996/)

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can create sub-classifications within the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) categories for reservation purposes. This overturns a previous 2004 ruling that viewed SC/ST as a homogenous group. 

The court, in a 6-1 decision, emphasized that while the Constitution recognizes SCs and STs collectively, it does not preclude states from addressing internal disparities within these groups.  States can create sub-quotas to provide wider protections to the most backward communities, but they must do so based on demonstrable need, empirical evidence, and a clear rationale.  The court stressed that representation, while numerical, should also be effective, meaning these communities should have opportunities for advancement to higher positions.  Justice Gavai, in a concurring opinion, advocated for a 'creamy layer' exception within SC/ST reservations, similar to the one in place for Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

The Supreme Court allowed sub-classification within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes quotas, but with several safeguards. The court emphasized that the principle behind any sub-classification must be reasonable and rational, subject to judicial scrutiny. States cannot micro-classify in a way that undermines equality or replaces it with a "doctrine of classification." 

To justify sub-classification, states must show that the group receiving preferential treatment is inadequately represented compared to other castes within the listed category.  The court also warned against reserving 100% seats for one sub-class, excluding others. Justice Gavai, in his concurring opinion, suggested adopting a "creamy layer" framework for SC/ST quotas to ensure benefits reach those who genuinely need them.

Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on espionage charges, was released in a prisoner exchange. Gershkovich, who reported for various outlets from Moscow before joining the WSJ, was arrested in March 2023 while dining in Yekaterinburg. He denied the charges, and the trial was widely criticized by the West. Russian authorities accused him of gathering information on a tank-making company for the CIA. The exchange, which involved 24 individuals, was facilitated by Turkish intelligence. It is believed that the arrest was part of Russia's strategy to pressure Western countries into releasing Russian prisoners.  Russia may also release former US marine Paul Whelan in the deal.

### [SUV driver gets bail in Delhi UPSC aspirants’ death case: What is the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/driver-upsc-aspirants-death-culpable-homicide-murder-9489509/)

A Delhi court granted bail to businessman Manoj Kathuria who was arrested in connection with the deaths of three UPSC aspirants at Rau’s IAS Study Circle. Kathuria was charged under Section 105 BNS (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) after his SUV allegedly drove through a flooded road, causing water to enter the center’s basement where the aspirants were trapped. 

The prosecution argued that Kathuria could have slowed down his vehicle, while the defense claimed he was driving within the speed limit. The Delhi Police later dropped the charge of culpable homicide against him, leading to the court granting bail. 
 
Culpable homicide not amounting to murder typically arises when man-made disasters or inactions result in deaths, and the accused is believed to have had knowledge of the potential consequences of their actions. Punishments can range from five years to life imprisonment. 




  Previous cases involving culpable homicide not amounting to murder include building collapses, railway accidents, and drunken driving incidents. The courts often emphasize the accused’s knowledge of potential harm in deciding the severity of the charge.

After nearly 40 years, the Madhya Pradesh government will finally incinerate 337 MT of toxic waste from the Union Carbide facility in Bhopal. This decision comes after years of legal battles and public protests. The Supreme Court authorized the incineration in 2010, but the project faced numerous delays and challenges.  A 2022 CPCB report revealed high levels of harmful Dioxins and Furans were released during trial runs, raising concerns about public health. The incineration process, expected to cost Rs 126 crore, is scheduled to be completed in 180 days.

Vietnam's new leadership, while expected to maintain the country's balancing act in foreign relations, may face challenges due to its limited experience in international diplomacy.  Concerns arise regarding potential escalation of human rights violations under the leadership of President To Lam, who is facing scrutiny for his alleged role in a 2017 kidnapping. This could lead to increased European criticism of Vietnam's human rights record, potentially triggering calls for targeted sanctions and trade pressure. Despite this, the EU is likely to proceed cautiously, given its strong economic ties with Vietnam, particularly in light of the country's rapid economic growth and its role as a production hub for businesses seeking alternatives to China.

### [Why do landslides occur, and what triggered the tragedy in Wayanad?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/explained-landslides-causes-wayanad-tragedy-9488385/)

Landslides are becoming increasingly common due to climate change, causing significant loss of life and property. India is particularly vulnerable, accounting for 8% of global landslide fatalities.  Recent landslides in Wayanad, Kerala, highlight the severity of the issue.  

A new India Landslide Susceptibility Map developed by IIT-Madras shows 13.17% of the country is prone to landslides, with Sikkim and Kerala being the most vulnerable.  Factors contributing to landslides include steep slopes, heavy rainfall, and human activities like deforestation and unsustainable land use. Research suggests that monocropping, replacing native trees with shallow-rooted crops, increases vulnerability. The recent Wayanad landslides were triggered by heavy rainfall following prolonged periods of high temperatures. This highlights the need for better understanding and mitigation strategies for landslides in a changing climate.

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing sub-categorization within scheduled castes, a decision that will have significant implications for reservations. 

The court acknowledged that Scheduled Castes are not a homogenous group and historical and empirical evidence supports the need for sub-categorization.  This ruling overturns a 2004 judgment which had previously prohibited sub-classification. 

The decision stems from a long-standing legal battle regarding the distribution of reservation benefits within Scheduled Castes. States argued that sub-classification is necessary to address the disparity in social and economic conditions among different sub-groups within the SC community. 


  The implications of this ruling extend to various states and communities, including the Balmiki and Mazhabi Sikh communities in Punjab, and the Madiga community in Andhra Pradesh.

### [Was the recent Kathmandu plane crash caused by a ‘wing stall’?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/was-the-recent-kathmandu-plane-crash-caused-by-a-wing-stall-9487656/)

A Bombardier CRJ200 crashed shortly after takeoff in Kathmandu, killing all passengers except the pilot. Video footage shows the aircraft banking steeply to the right before impact, possibly due to a wing stall. This resulted in an "unusual attitude," an aerodynamic situation where the plane's orientation deviates from normal flight patterns.  

A wing stall can lead to a rapid loss of lift and control, making recovery difficult, especially at low altitudes.  In this case, the pilot likely didn't have enough time and space to recover from the stall, given the aircraft's low altitude. Pushing the nose down, as is the standard recovery technique for a stall, would have resulted in a loss of altitude, further complicating the situation.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an airstrike in Tehran, with Hamas and Iran blaming Israel. Experts predict Iran might retaliate through its allies, forming the ‘axis of resistance’. This coalition, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, originated after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.  Iran, aiming to expand its influence in a Sunni-majority region, supports these non-state actors as a deterrent against Israel and the US.  The coalition's name is a response to former US President George W Bush's 'axis of evil' designation of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.

The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran has significant implications for the region and the world. Considered a major victory for Israel in its ongoing campaign against Hamas, the killing is a grave act of escalation, particularly as it occurred on Iranian soil. 

This assassination will likely anger Hamas and Iran, potentially triggering retaliatory strikes. The event also puts pressure on Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who faces a difficult balancing act between hardliners demanding retribution and his own desire for diplomatic engagement with the West.  

For Israel, the assassination props up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership amid pressure over the hostage situation. The US, amidst its own elections, will also need to carefully assess its response. 

The wider Middle East is on high alert as this incident risks a broader conflict. India, concerned about regional stability and the safety of its citizens and its oil supply, is carefully analyzing the situation before formulating a response.

The opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics 2024 featured a tableau depicting a variety of performers, including drag queens, a transgender model, and a blue-painted singer. The tableau drew criticism from groups like the Catholic church and the far right who claimed it was a parody of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” and an insult to Christianity. 

Organizers denied the comparison, stating it was inspired by Greek god Dionysus and a pagan feast. They emphasized the performance’s message of embracing diversity and individual rights.  Others suggested the scene represented the Festival of Dionysus or artworks like Jan van Bijlert’s “The Feast of the Gods.”

Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran, Iran.  This event is considered a major escalation in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Israel views this as a victory in its efforts to neutralize Hamas leadership, while Hamas sees it as a severe provocation. 

The assassination complicates peace negotiations and puts pressure on Iran's new president to respond, potentially leading to further conflict. For Israel, the assassination may bolster Prime Minister Netanyahu's position, prolonging the war in Gaza. The incident also adds complexity to the US presidential campaign, particularly for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been critical of Netanyahu's policies.  The wider region is on high alert, with countries like Qatar, Turkey, and the Houthis condemning the assassination. Global impact is significant, given the region's importance for energy and the large number of expatriates living there.

Hezbollah confirmed the death of its senior commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Israel claimed Shukr was responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israeli civilians and troops. This comes days after a rocket attack in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 Israeli teenagers and children.  Israel considers Hezbollah responsible for the attack, and the death of Shukr is viewed as retaliation. 

Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has a significant arsenal and has been involved in clashes with Israel, most notably in the 2006 war. This latest incident fuels concerns about a wider escalation in the already tense Middle Eastern region.

Concerns over water quality in the River Seine have led to the postponement of the men's triathlon swimming leg at the Paris Olympics.  The Seine, historically polluted, faced a challenge from outdated sewage systems that overflow during heavy rains, releasing untreated wastewater and wildlife into the water.  High levels of E. coli, a bacteria originating from animal and human waste, frequently exceed the safe limits for competition even after significant investment in water treatment and infrastructure improvements.  The Triathlon swimming events were initially scheduled for July 30 and 31, and August 5, with reserve days planned. If the Seine's water quality doesn't improve, the swimming leg might be canceled. Marathon swimming events, also planned for the Seine, have a backup venue near Paris.

Lithium mining in India’s Reasi district faced setbacks as auctions for the mineral block were cancelled twice. Initial optimism surrounding the discovery of a large inferred lithium deposit has waned. Concerns about extraction complexities, underdeveloped reporting standards, and falling lithium prices deterred investors.  The first auction attempt was unsuccessful due to inadequate bidder participation, even after lowering the minimum requirement. The second attempt also failed to attract qualified bidders. 

Mining experts highlight the need for resource classification aligned with internationally recognized standards, such as CRIRSCO, for greater transparency and investor confidence.  They also suggest allocating unbid blocks to government companies for development and mining.

Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of Venezuela's presidential election, securing 51% of the vote against opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia. The opposition alleges electoral fraud and questions the credibility of the results due to the lack of transparency in the vote counting process.  Maduro's long-standing rule is characterized by a centralized power structure with limitations on democratic freedoms and accusations of government interference in institutions like the courts and media. 

Venezuela's economy, largely reliant on oil exports, has been in crisis since the 2014 oil price crash, experiencing hyperinflation and shortages of essential goods.  U.S. sanctions imposed on Venezuela have exacerbated the economic situation, while Russia and China have supported Maduro's government. International reactions to the election have been mixed, with some countries condemning the alleged fraud and calling for a transparent process, while others have accepted the results.

Flight cancellations in Leh, Ladakh, were caused by unusually high temperatures. Hot weather thins the air, reducing its density. This makes it harder for aircraft wings to generate enough lift for takeoff, as there are fewer air molecules to provide the necessary pressure difference.  Additionally, thin air negatively impacts engine performance, reducing thrust and requiring longer runways. Higher altitudes naturally have thinner air, exacerbating these issues. Global warming is contributing to these extreme temperatures, leading to disruptions in air travel.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned athletes from Russia and Belarus from participating in the Paris Olympics under their national flags due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. This decision stems from the IOC's view that Russia's actions violate the Olympic Truce, a principle of non-aggression during the Games. 

The IOC officially suspended the Russian Olympic Committee due to its assertion of authority over Ukrainian sports organizations in contested regions. Russia's creation of the "International Friendship Games" and its diplomatic efforts to promote them were also deemed politically motivated violations of the IOC charter. 

As a compromise, athletes from Russia and Belarus can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs), subject to several conditions. They cannot represent their countries officially, nor can they actively support the war in Ukraine. They compete under a neutral flag, wear a neutral uniform, and a neutral song plays if they win medals.

Following a deadly rocket attack on an Israeli-occupied Golan Heights football field that killed 12 children and teenagers, Israel vowed to retaliate severely against Hezbollah.  Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, the deadliest since the start of Hamas' war in Gaza, an accusation Hezbollah denies. 

Hezbollah, which considers Israel an illegitimate state, and sees its conflict with Israel as a religious duty, has been involved in hostilities since October 8th, supporting Palestinians in Gaza.  Israel views Hezbollah as its greatest border threat due to its growing arsenal and presence in Syria. While linked to the Gaza war, the Lebanon-Israel conflict has its own history. 

The current situation has caused significant displacement and casualties on both sides, escalating tensions without fully escalating into a full-scale war.  Both sides have indicated a desire to avoid a large-scale conflict but have also prepared for it.  A ceasefire in Gaza could help de-escalate tensions in Lebanon, but diplomatic solutions are proving difficult.

A new study published in Science Advances estimates that 11.9 lakh excess deaths occurred in India in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This figure has been contested by the Indian government, which called it a "gross and misleading overestimate" and cited methodological flaws.  

The official death toll for 2020 stands at 1.49 lakh, but previous studies and the World Health Organisation have suggested the actual number could be five to ten times higher. The debate stems from the methods used to estimate deaths, relying primarily on the Sample Registration Survey (SRS) which provides estimates rather than definitive counts. 

The government's claim of 99% death registration in 2020 is also disputed due to the lack of supporting data in the relevant reports. Despite the controversy, the study highlights the importance of accurate data on Covid-19 deaths for informing health and policy decisions.

A Mumbai Special Court recently ruled that a businessman, Purushottam Mandhana, be released on bail in a money laundering case. The court cited a lack of justification for the arrest, emphasizing that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) did not provide Mandhana with the "reasons to believe" that he was guilty, as required by Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This ruling follows a similar case involving Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, where the Supreme Court also questioned the ED's justification for his arrest.  

These developments highlight the importance of procedural safeguards, ensuring due process and preventing arbitrary action by authorities. The PMLA, known for its stringent bail provisions, requires the ED to have concrete grounds for arrest, which must be communicated to the accused. Courts are increasingly scrutinizing these grounds, emphasizing the need for transparency and adherence to legal procedures in arrests made under this law.

The Centre has significantly increased annual ground rent for several five-star hotels in New Delhi leased land. These hotels, including The Imperial and The Claridges, are challenging the move in court. 

The hotels received perpetual leases in the 1930s with ground rent based on the land's letting value, subject to revision after 30 years.  The government now argues previous revisions were ad-hoc and asserts the right to apply a new 5% land value calculation retroactively. 

The hotels contest this, claiming the increased rent is illegal and should only apply prospectively. The Delhi High Court has ordered the L&DO to hear the hotels before revising the rent.

### [Criticism for India contingent’s Olympics outfit: How it was chosen, what the designer said](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/india-olympic-contingent-outfit-9483090/)

The design of the Indian contingent's uniforms at the Olympics sparked debate, prompting discussions on representing "brand India" effectively.  The selection process involves a bid from designers/design houses,  considering both creative and financial capabilities. This year, Tarun Tahiliani's Tasva label was chosen. Although the uniform incorporated contemporary silhouettes and cotton for comfort, some criticized the absence of traditional Indian weaves and embroideries, comparing it to more culturally representative designs from smaller nations like Mongolia and Sri Lanka. Tailhanian defended his choices, citing time constraints, weather conditions, and the need for functionality over purely aesthetics. He emphasized the importance of representing India while prioritizing athlete comfort and adhering to the Indian Olympic Committee's guidelines.

### [Why passing Class 9 is a major hurdle for Delhi government school students](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-govt-school-class-9-fail-9482970/)

The Delhi government's schooling system faces a persistent challenge: a high failure rate in Class 9. While the government boasts about its successes, data shows that around 30-40% of students fail this grade each year. This failure rate has dipped below pre-pandemic levels,  with the 2022 pass percentage falling to 65.52%. Several factors contribute to this issue, including the  implementation of the Right to Education Act's no-detention policy until Class 8 and increased academic pressure as students prepare for their board exams. The switch to a more challenging examination pattern with multiple-choice questions is another contributing factor. 

To address this, the government has implemented remedial classes, teacher training, and initiatives like Mission Buniyaad. However, concerns remain about the quality of open schooling options like NIOS as a fallback for struggling students.

### [SC to examine acquitted man’s ‘right to be forgotten’: What is the right, and how have courts ruled earlier?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/european-information-privacy-regulation-supreme-court-fundamental-rights-constitution-of-india-cji-d-y-chandrachud-9481662/)

The Supreme Court of India will decide whether the "right to be forgotten" exists as a fundamental right in the country. This right, recognized in European law, allows individuals to remove their digital footprint from online searches when it violates their privacy.  While India has no specific law on this right, the 2017 Puttaswamy judgment, recognizing privacy as a fundamental right, paved the way for its consideration. 

Courts have issued conflicting rulings on the matter, with some allowing removal of information from public records in certain cases, while others have upheld the principle of public access to court judgments.

The outcome of the current case will be crucial in shaping India's stance on the "right to be forgotten" and its implications for online privacy.

### [NASA did not say it found life on Mars but is very excited about the discovery of a rock. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/nasa-life-on-mars-rover-biosignature-9480951/)

NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered a rock named Cheyava Falls that shows signs potentially indicative of past microbial life on Mars. 

The rock contains organic compounds, veins of calcium sulfate likely formed by water, and peculiar "leopard spots" which might have been created by chemical reactions that could have provided energy for microbes. While not conclusive evidence of life, these findings make Cheyava Falls the most promising rock studied by Perseverance so far.

### [President Droupadi Murmu appoints new Governors for nine states: All about the post and its procedures](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/new-governors-appointment-procedure-9480630/)

The President of India appoints state Governors, who act as the Centre's representatives.  The Governor's role is largely defined by the Constitution, requiring them to be a citizen of India, at least 35 years old, and not a member of any legislature.  They must act on the advice of the state's Council of Ministers, except in specific situations where they have discretionary powers.
      Despite being envisioned as apolitical figures, Governors have increasingly been seen as acting on behalf of the central government, leading to friction with state governments, especially those from opposing parties. This tension arises from the Governor's appointment and removal being dependent on the central government's will, leaving them potentially susceptible to political influence.   
      Constitutional experts argue that this lack of independence and the potential for political bias undermines the Governor's role and creates an imbalance of power.

### [14 Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, sign China-brokered deal: Why it matters](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-fatah-china-deal-9480445/)

The article discusses a declaration signed by Hamas and Fatah, two major Palestinian groups, in Beijing, aimed at ending division and strengthening unity. 

This declaration, which calls for an international conference and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, signifies a potential shift in Palestinian politics. Hamas and Fatah have historically competed for leadership, with differences in approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  

China, a long-time supporter of Palestine, mediated this agreement and seeks to position itself as a mediator in the region, offering an alternative to U.S. involvement.  

The declaration's success in achieving lasting peace remains uncertain, given past failed attempts at unity between the two groups. The  significance highlights China's growing influence in the Middle East.

### [What is indexation in calculating LTCG tax? Does the removal of indexation benefit in the Budget mean you will pay more tax?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/indexation-capital-gains-tax-9479405/)

The Union Budget for 2024-25 removed the indexation benefit for long-term capital gains (LTCG) on property, gold, and other unlisted assets. This change means that the cost basis for calculating capital gains will not be adjusted for inflation. The government maintains that the LTCG tax rate reduction to 12.5% from 20% offsets the impact of losing indexation.  

However, concerns have been raised that this could lead to higher tax burdens for those holding assets for extended periods. Critics also point out the absence of grandfathering for purchases made prior to the new regime. The government argues the new regime simplifies the tax structure and benefits most taxpayers. They claim that the lower tax rate coupled with the existing rollover benefits will mitigate the impact of the indexation removal.

### [Why Australia has banned mining in one of the world’s largest uranium deposits](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australia-banned-mining-uranium-deposits-9479330/)

The Australian government has announced plans to extend Kakadu National Park to encompass the Jabiluka site, a region rich in uranium deposits.  This decision, made in accordance with the wishes of the Mirarr people, the Indigenous custodians of the land, ensures that uranium mining will never take place at Jabiluka. The extension comes after the 2017 discovery of ancient artifacts near the site, highlighting the deep historical and cultural significance of the area. This move aligns with the government's commitment to protecting Indigenous heritage and follows the global condemnation of Rio Tinto's destruction of ancient rock shelters in 2020. The Jabiluka site has been a focal point of controversy for decades, with the Mirarr people long opposing mining activities there.

### [How is the rainfall performance during the ongoing monsoon season?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/rainfall-performance-monsoon-9479264/)

While the overall monsoon rainfall in India has been good, its distribution has been uneven. Some regions, particularly central and peninsular India, have received normal to excess rainfall, while others, especially in the northwest, east, and northeast, have experienced significant deficits. 

This disparity in rainfall has been attributed to the position of the monsoon trough and the occurrence of rain-bearing weather systems. The trough's southward tilt has favored central and peninsular India, while weaker systems and less frequent rainfall have affected other regions.

The uneven rainfall distribution is a concern for Kharif crops, as excessive rainfall in some areas can damage crops, while deficits in others can lead to lower yields.

### [What are puberty blockers and why are they prescribed for transgender and gender-diverse teens?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-and-when-are-puberty-blockers-prescribed-9478061/)

Elon Musk has made controversial statements about his transgender child, claiming they were "killed by the woke mind virus" due to  puberty blockers. His child, Vivian Jenna Wilson, has refuted these claims, stating Musk is a neglectful parent. 

Puberty blockers are medications that delay puberty's physical changes, used for both transgender youth experiencing gender dysphoria and children with precocious puberty.  These medications help alleviate anxiety and mental distress caused by the disconnect between a child's gender identity and their physical development. 


 Doctors prescribe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, which suppress sex hormone production.  
 Administered through monthly injections, every quarter injections, or a yearly implant, they temporarily halt biological changes associated with puberty. 


  Possible side effects include insomnia, weight gain, mood swings, and potential mental health challenges.

### [Kargil Vijay Diwas: How India conquered Kargil’s inclement conditions, 25 years ago](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kargil-vijay-diwas-india-war-pakistan-9476104/)

The Kargil War, which ended 25 years ago on July 26, 1999, commemorated as Kargil Vijay Diwas, saw India triumph over Pakistan's infiltration of its Ladakh region. Pakistani forces occupied strategic heights in Kargil, triggering a conflict that lasted from May to July. 

The Indian Army, facing heavy casualties, recaptured these positions despite challenging conditions. The high altitude of Kargil posed significant obstacles, with freezing temperatures, thin air, and rugged terrain impacting both soldiers and equipment.

### [Why is there a move to split the Bengaluru municipal corporation into smaller bodies with a 3-tier structure?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/move-to-split-the-bengaluru-municipal-corporation-explained-9475593/)

A proposed bill to restructure the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and split it into smaller city corporations is facing scrutiny.  The bill, drafted by the BBMP Restructuring Committee, aims to create up to ten city corporations within the Greater Bengaluru area.  The governance structure would have a three-tier system with the Greater Bengaluru Authority at the top, followed by the city corporations and ward committees. 

The proposed legislation has drawn opposition from BJP lawmakers who claim it is "unscientific" and will harm the city's cultural identity. They advocate for a committee of Bengaluru MLAs to thoroughly review the bill. The Deputy Chief Minister contends that the bill is necessary to address Bengaluru's haphazard growth and the influx of population from outside Karnataka.  The bill will be discussed in detail by lawmakers on July 27.

### [How the modern Olympics came to be](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/modern-olympics-history-9475330/)

The idea for the modern Olympics predates Pierre de Coubertin. Following Greek independence in the 1820s, intellectuals sought to revive national pride by recalling ancient Greece. Poet Panagiotis Soutsos penned "Dialogues of the Dead," posing the question of absent Olympic Games. 

Entrepreneur Evangelos Zappas then funded the first modern Olympic revival in 1859, which continued with various iterations in Athens.  Across the English Channel, W.P. Brookes organized the Wenlock and later National Olympic Games, promoting open participation while facing resistance from British aristocracy who favored amateurism. Brookes later proposed international competitions, an idea Coubertin took and realized, leading to the first modern International Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.
