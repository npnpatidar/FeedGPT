### [Hospitals have special protection under the rules of war. Why are they in the crosshairs in Gaza?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hospitals-war-gaza-srael-rules-conflict-9024380/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the impact on hospitals in the region. Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest and most advanced hospital, has become a battleground as Israeli tanks move through Gaza City. Israel claims that Hamas militants are using hospitals as shields, but Palestinians and rights groups accuse Israel of recklessly harming civilians seeking shelter.

The Israeli military alleges that Hamas operates its command headquarters beneath Shifa Hospital, while Hamas and the hospital director deny these claims. The Israeli army states that if Hamas fighters use hospitals to fire at them, they will respond accordingly. However, there is no evidence provided by Israel to support these allegations.

Many Palestinian families seek refuge in medical compounds, believing them to be safer than other alternatives. Shifa Hospital has become overcrowded with patients, medical workers, and displaced people. The hospital experienced a blackout, leading to the deaths of several patients, including a newborn in an incubator. Palestinian medical workers accuse Israel of targeting infrastructure to punish the population.

The article also explores the implications of international humanitarian law. Hospitals have special protections during war, but they can lose this status if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons. However, there must be sufficient warning before attacks to allow for the safe evacuation of patients and medical workers. Even if Shifa Hospital conceals a Hamas command center, international law still requires steps to protect innocent civilians.

International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan warns combatants that claiming hospitals have lost their protected status due to military use carries a high burden of proof. If there is doubt about a civilian object's protective status, attackers must assume it is protected until proven otherwise.

### [Airfares are sky-high in Europe and much of the world. Is that a good thing?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/airfares-high-europe-world-explained-9023265/)

GPT-3.5: The article discusses the significant increase in airfare prices since the COVID-19 pandemic. It mentions that average airfares across Europe in summer 2023 were between 20% and 30% higher compared to 2019. The rise in prices can be attributed to increased demand for travel and disrupted supply chains. Airlines have experienced record profits due to the surge in demand, but their lack of capacity has led to higher prices. Supply chain issues, including delays in aircraft production and parts, have contributed to the price increase. Additionally, staffing problems at airports have also impacted costs. While some accuse airlines of price-gouging, airlines argue that prices reflect the current state of the industry. The article suggests that prices are unlikely to fall soon due to ongoing supply chain challenges and the industry's transition to more sustainable aviation fuels, which are more expensive. Some governments have considered interventions, such as capping airfares or setting minimum prices, to address the environmental impact of air travel.

### [How a 500-year-old collection of pressed flowers sheds light on demography, human movements](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/herbarium-italy-discovery-history-plants-flowers-study-9023264/)

A recent article published by the Royal Society delves into the historical significance of a 500-year-old herbarium, a collection of pressed flowers and plant parts, created by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi between 1551 and 1586. The herbarium contains 5,000 carefully preserved specimens and provides insights into the history of Italy, particularly Bologna. Researchers studying the herbarium discovered evidence of human disturbance, habitat loss and transformation, climate change, and the invasion of alien species over the past five centuries. The paper highlights the impact of events like the discovery of America on floristic patterns in Europe and identifies extinct or unknown species. Ulisse Aldrovandi, who hailed from a noble family and demonstrated great curiosity, created the herbarium while tending to Bologna's botanical garden until his death. The herbarium also contains the oldest known specimens of various plant species introduced from the Americas, Africa, and Asia, providing a glimpse into the transformation of European flora and habitats over time.

### [What WHOâ€™s report has said on reduction in deaths due to TB in India, coverage of its treatments](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/indias-tb-mortality-report-2023-explained-9023266/)

India has made positive strides towards eliminating tuberculosis (TB) by 2025, but still has the highest incidence of the infection globally. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global TB Report 2023, India accounts for 27% of total TB cases worldwide. However, the report also highlights two positive trends in India. Firstly, there has been an increase in the reporting of TB cases, surpassing pre-pandemic levels with 24.2 lakh cases reported in 2022. Secondly, the coverage of treatment for TB has increased to 80%. 

A significant drop in TB mortality was also noted in the report due to the WHO accepting India's Sample Registration System dataset for calculations, resulting in a reduction of TB deaths from 4.94 lakhs in 2021 to 3.31 lakhs in 2022. This lowered India's contribution to global mortality from 36% in previous years to 26% in 2022.

The Indian government presented newer evidence and data, including in-country mathematical modeling and information from the government's ni-kshay portal, to support these revised estimates. The WHO reviewed and appreciated these efforts, leading to the publication of revised estimates in the global TB report.

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, India's reporting of TB cases has improved and exceeded pre-pandemic levels. India reported 24.2 lakh cases in 2022, similar to the number in 2019. It is worth noting that there is often a gap between the estimated number of TB cases based on mathematical models and the actual number of diagnosed individuals receiving treatment in a country.

Additionally, India was the only country to have completed a national TB prevalence survey since 2019, which informed the estimates of TB incidence in the country. The report also highlighted India's achievements in increasing TB treatment coverage by 19% compared to the previous year, with over 80% treatment coverage achieved, which is higher than the global pre-pandemic level of 70%.

The Indian government has undertaken several initiatives towards TB elimination, including active case finding, scaling up molecular testing, and engaging the private sector. The ni-kshay mitra program, which provides nutritional support to TB patients, has resulted in the adoption of over 11 lakh TB patients. India has set a target of no more than 44 new TB cases per lakh population by 2025 and aims to reduce mortality to 3 deaths per lakh population by the same year.

Achieving these targets will be challenging, as the current estimates indicate a higher number of cases and mortality than initially anticipated in the national strategic plan. However, India remains committed to its goal of eliminating TB and has made significant progress in increasing reporting and treatment coverage.

### [The iconography of Goddess Lakshmi, from the Vedas to the modern masters of Indian painting](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/diwali-goddess-lakshmi-artists-paintings-culture-explained-9023269/)

The article discusses the various interpretations and visual representations of Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth and prosperity, across different regions and time periods in India. Lakshmi is commonly depicted resting on a lotus, accompanied by elephants. The Rig Veda mentions Lakshmi as a symbol of good fortune, while the Atharva Veda further develops her personality. One legend associates her with Vishnu's 'Kurma' avatar, where she emerges from the churning of the primeval ocean along with divine treasures. Coins from different periods depict Lakshmi standing on a lotus or flanked by elephants.

Portrayals from the second century at the Sanchi stupa show Lakshmi adorned with jewelry and seated on a lotus. At the Ellora caves, she is seen with her husband Vishnu and his mount Garuda. During the Gupta period, Lakshmi was highly revered and appeared on numerous coins, sometimes seated on a lion. The lotus is a significant symbol associated with Lakshmi, representing purity and enlightenment.

Today, the most common representation of Lakshmi is as Gaja Lakshmi, either seated or standing on a lotus, holding the flower in her hand, and accompanied by elephants. In North India, coins often flow from her hands, symbolizing material and spiritual wealth. In West Bengal, she is associated with a snowy owl, while in Eastern India, she bestows eight specific blessings known as Ashta Lakshmi. South Indian Tanjore paintings frequently depict her on a golden couch surrounded by lotuses and elephants.

The advent of the printing press made Lakshmi's imagery more accessible through affordable prints. Raja Ravi Varma's popular oleograph print portrays Lakshmi standing on a lotus in a stream, wearing a pink saree, and moderately adorned. Over time, artists like M.F. Husain and Atul Dodiya incorporated Lakshmi into their works, offering different interpretations and styles.

### [As thousands of earthquakes rock Iceland, a volcanic eruption to follow?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/earthquake-swarm-iceland-volcanic-eruption-9023297/)

Iceland has declared a state of emergency after experiencing a swarm of 800 earthquakes in under 14 hours on the Reykjanes peninsula. Over 24,000 earthquakes have been recorded in the area since late October. The most powerful quake had a magnitude of 5.2 and occurred about 40 km from the capital city, ReykjavÃ­k. Iceland is located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, making it prone to seismic activity. Scientists from the Iceland Met Office believe that the recent seismic activity is a precursor to a volcanic eruption. The movement of magma close to the Earth's surface exerts force on the surrounding rock, causing earthquake swarms. The Fagradalsfjall volcanic system, located southwest of ReykjavÃ­k, is the likely site of the eruption. The magma is currently about 800 meters below the Earth's surface, and an eruption could occur within days. The town of GrindavÃ­k has been evacuated as a precaution. Iceland is home to 33 active volcanoes, and eruptions are a common occurrence in the country.

### [Moodyâ€™s lowers US credit rating outlook to â€˜negativeâ€™: What does it mean?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/moodys-us-credit-rating-outlook-negative-9023051/)

Moody's, a credit rating firm, has changed the US credit outlook from "stable" to "negative," indicating an increased chance of downgrading America's creditworthiness. This change could worsen fiscal concerns as it may make borrowing money more costly for investors and increase the government's debt repayment expenses. Moody's cites three main reasons for this decision: the threat of rising interest rates, a mounting debt burden, and a polarized Congress that is unable to agree on addressing the budget deficit. The firm believes that without effective fiscal policy measures, the US will continue to have large deficits, significantly weakening debt affordability. Political polarization further raises the risk of governments failing to reach consensus on a fiscal plan. The Biden administration blames the Republican Party for this outlook change, while the Republicans criticize President Biden's spending agenda. Other rating firms, such as Fitch, have also downgraded their outlook on the US. Credit ratings agencies analyze financials, business models, and economic management to rate companies and governments. These ratings help investors assess the risk associated with bonds and other debt instruments.

### [Tonight, the spirits descend on earth: Ahead of Diwali, celebrating Bhoot Chaturdashi in India](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/diwali-bhoot-chaturdashi-narakasura-9022815/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Diwali, the festival of lights and the celebration of Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya, is associated with various traditions and rituals across India. The day before Diwali, known as Chhoti Diwali or Bhoot/Naraka Chaturdashi, holds significance in different regions. In Goa, effigies of the demon king Narakasura are burned to symbolize his defeat by Lord Krishna. This tradition gained prominence after Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule.

In West Bengal, on the day before Diwali, people observe Bhoot Chaturdashi, where it is believed that the souls of deceased ancestors visit their living relatives. To welcome them and ward off evil spirits, 14 oil lamps are placed in houses, and 14 different types of leafy vegetables are consumed.

In some places, Aghoris, Shaivite ascetics, perform puja and Tantric rituals on Bhoot Chaturdashi, often in cremation grounds. They may collect bones for use in their rituals. 

In Gujarat, on Kali Chaudash (the day before Diwali), a ritual called "kaklat kadhvo" takes place. Women offer fried snacks made from black gram flour to the souls of those who died unnatural deaths. The belief is that by performing this ritual, clamor and troubles will be eliminated.

On Bestu Varsh, the Gujarati New Year celebrated after Diwali, women perform Alas Kadhvi. They clean the house and dispose of household garbage outside the village while clanking an earthen pot, symbolizing the arrival of Goddess Lakshmi.

Gujarati businesses close their financial year and perform Chopda Poojan, worshipping traditional account books on Diwali. No business transactions occur until Labh Paacham, the fifth day of the new year, which is considered auspicious for opening new account books and launching new businesses.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is working on restoring and improving the road to the Amarnath cave shrine in Kashmir's Lidder Valley. The BRO recently announced that motor vehicles were able to drive all the way to the holy cave for the first time after the upgradation of the Baltal road. The shrine, located at an altitude of 13,000 feet, can be reached through Pahalgam or Sonamarg. While the initial 16 km from Pahalgam to Chandanwari is motorable, the rest of the way is usually covered by trekking or riding a pony. The route from Sonamarg via Baltal is shorter and takes around eight hours on foot or less than six hours on a pony. Pilgrims can also reach the shrine by helicopter, although these services were stopped due to ecological concerns. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari announced a plan to improve access to the shrine, including the development of a motorable road and a tunnel. The project is expected to be tendered by the end of the year. The BRO has taken over the maintenance and improvement of the pedestrian tracks leading to the shrine.

### [Baler: a machine for off-site management of farm stubble](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/baler-a-machine-for-off-site-management-of-farm-stubble-9022266/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The problem of farm fires in Punjab has led to a demand for machines that facilitate off-site stubble management. The use of baler machines, which compress agricultural residue into manageable bales, has become popular among farmers. These machines allow farmers to immediately plough the field and sow the next crop, effectively managing the stubble without resorting to burning it. Currently, there are around 2,000 baler machines operating in Punjab, with 1,268 of them highly subsidized under the crop residue management scheme. However, the number of balers is still inadequate to cover a significant portion of the rice fields in the state. Despite the initial lack of sales in the first two years, the last three years have seen an increase in the number of balers sold under subsidy.

### [How baler machines help manage stubble?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/baler-a-machine-for-off-site-management-of-farm-stubble-9022266/)

The Supreme Court is addressing the issue of farm fires in Punjab, leading to a demand for machines that facilitate off-site stubble management. One such machine is the baler, of which there are currently around 2,000 operating in Punjab. The Centre's Crop Residue Management scheme subsidizes 1,268 of these machines. Farmers burn the stubble left behind after harvesting, causing significant air pollution. Environmentally-friendly methods, such as incorporating the stubble into the soil, have their drawbacks, including increased vulnerability to insect attacks. Baler machines compress the agricultural residue into bales, which can be transported to factories or dumping sites. This allows farmers to immediately plough the field and sow the next crop. However, the number of available balers in Punjab can only cover 15-18% of the rice fields. Despite being included under the Crop Residue Management scheme, no balers were sold in the first two years, but there has been an increase in sales in recent years, with 500 balers added this year.

### [How rains in Delhi helped improve its air quality](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/rains-delhi-improve-air-quality-aqi-pollution-9021912/)

Light showers of rain in Delhi on Tuesday night and Wednesday led to clearer skies and improved air quality after days of high levels of pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in early November reached a severe level of 471, but improved to 376 on Friday morning, still classified as very poor. Rain can help reduce air pollution by washing away certain pollutants, particularly PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles. These particles, which are smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter respectively, come from sources such as vehicular pollution, factory emissions, construction activities, and road dust. After the rain, PM 2.5 levels decreased from 310 to 174, and PM 10 levels dropped from 400-480 to 291. However, the impact of rain on air pollution is temporary, and significant rainfall is needed to effectively wash away pollutants.

### [Why will Saturnâ€™s rings briefly â€˜disappearâ€™ from view in 2025?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/saturn-rings-disappear-2025-9021942/)

The article discusses the upcoming temporary disappearance of Saturn's rings from view in 2025. The reason for this phenomenon is due to Saturn's tilt and an optical illusion. Just like Earth, Saturn's axis of rotation is tilted, causing its ring system to also be tilted to the plane of Saturn's orbit. As Saturn revolves around the Sun, its rings appear to nod up and down when observed from Earth, resulting in a changing view of the rings.

Saturn takes 29.5 years to complete an orbit around the Sun, and every 13 to 15 years, the edge of its rings aligns directly with Earth. At this position, the rings reflect very little light and become essentially invisible. In March 2025, Saturn's rings will not be visible from Earth because they will be perfectly aligned with our line of sight. However, the rings will gradually reappear as Saturn continues its revolution around the Sun.

According to a 2018 report by NASA, Saturn may eventually lose its rings completely within the next 300 million years or even sooner. This would occur as the rings are being pulled into the planet by its gravity, causing ice particles to rain down under the influence of Saturn's magnetic field. The report estimates that an amount of water products equivalent to filling an Olympic-sized swimming pool could be drained from Saturn's rings in just half an hour.

Saturn acquired its rings relatively late in its four-billion-year lifespan, and the rings are not older than 100 million years. The report suggests that we are fortunate to witness Saturn's ring system during its middle lifetime, but it raises the possibility that we may have missed out on seeing giant ring systems around Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, which currently only have thin ringlets.

### [A plan to join the Red Sea with Mediterranean â€” an alternative to the Suez Canal](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ben-gurion-canal-suez-israel-9021520/)

Israel's desire to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza Strip and control the Palestinian enclave may be driven by the opportunity to create an alternative to the Suez Canal. The proposed Ben Gurion Canal Project would cut through the Negev Desert, connecting the Gulf of Aqaba to the Eastern Mediterranean coast. This would challenge Egypt's monopoly over the shortest route between Europe and Asia. The Suez Canal is currently congested and has been a source of conflict for decades. However, the Ben Gurion Canal Project faces logistical, political, and funding challenges, making it unlikely to be realized. The project would be complex, expensive, and longer than the Suez Canal. Additionally, the constant military threat in the region poses a risk to the operation of the canal.

### [Delhi govt plans â€˜cloud seedingâ€™ to induce rains amid pollution: What is this process?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/delhi-rain-cloud-seeding-pollution-explained-9021286/)

The Delhi government is considering cloud seeding, also known as "artificial rain," to address the high levels of pollution in the city. Cloud seeding involves injecting clouds with salts like silver iodide, potassium iodide, or sodium chloride, which act as nuclei for the formation of cloud droplets. These droplets grow and eventually fall as rain, taking pollutants down with them. However, cloud seeding requires specific cloud conditions, such as a sufficient number of clouds and certain depths, which are more commonly present during the monsoon season. The success of cloud seeding in reducing pollution levels is uncertain, and further research is needed to understand its effectiveness in India's unique climate and complex cloud systems. While cloud seeding has been attempted in India before to combat drought conditions, it has never been specifically used to mitigate pollution. If successful, cloud seeding could provide temporary relief from pollution by washing away pollutants with rainfall.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.#### Summary:

The state of Madhya Pradesh was created in 1956 through the merger of five different regions in central India. These regions included Central Provinces and Berar, Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, the princely state of Bhopal, and the Sironj tehsil of Rajasthan's Kota district. The States Reorganisation Commission advocated for the creation of a "compact, strong, and prosperous unit in Central India" [[1]](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1957-01-01_3_page002.html). The first Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh was Ravishankar Shukla, a Congress leader from Raipur. Since then, Madhya Pradesh has had several Chief Ministers from different political parties, including Kailash Nath Katju, Bhagwant Rao Mandloi, D P Mishra, and Shyama Charan Shukla.

In 2000, Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh as a separate state. Currently, Madhya Pradesh has a unicameral legislature with 230 seats and 29 Lok Sabha and 11 Rajya Sabha seats.

#### Historical Background:

Madhya Pradesh has a complex political history with various political parties vying for power. The Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), the precursor of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was active in the state from the beginning. The Congress party dominated the political landscape, but the BJS gained strength over time. The Congress suffered setbacks in the 1962 Assembly polls, and the BJS won 78 seats in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. The Congress split in 1967, leading to the formation of the first non-Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, the Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD) government, led by Govind Narain Singh. However, the Congress returned to power in the state after a short period [[2]](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_01.pdf).

#### Chief Ministers and Political Shifts:

Madhya Pradesh has seen several Chief Ministers from different political parties. Notable Chief Ministers include Ravishankar Shukla, Kailash Nath Katju, Bhagwant Rao Mandloi, D P Mishra, Arjun Singh, Motilal Vora, Digvijaya Singh, Uma Bharti, and Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The Congress party and the BJP have been the main contenders for power in the state. The BJP formed its own government in Madhya Pradesh in 1990, but it was dismissed after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. The Congress returned to power in 1993, but the BJP regained power in 2003 and held it until 2018. In 2018, the Congress won the state elections, but due to political developments, Shivraj Singh Chouhan returned as Chief Minister in 2020 [[2]](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_01.pdf).

#### Current Political Scenario:

Currently, Madhya Pradesh is led by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who returned to power in March 2020 after the collapse of the Congress government led by Kamal Nath. The Congress party, led by veterans Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, is aiming to challenge the BJP's dominance in the upcoming 2023 Assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections [[2]](https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/attach/amb/Volume_01.pdf).

Overall, Madhya Pradesh has witnessed political shifts, party dominance, and changes in leadership over the years, reflecting the dynamic nature of Indian politics.

### [Expert Explains | Regulating political funding: Rules around the world, Indiaâ€™s challenges](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/expert-explains-political-funding-india-electoral-bonds-9020575/)

The recent Supreme Court hearing in India regarding the constitutionality of electoral bonds has brought attention to the issue of funding political parties, which is crucial to Indian democracy. Unlike the United States, where elections focus on individual candidates' campaigns, India's parliamentary system centers around parties. A comprehensive campaign finance framework for India should consider four key aspects: regulation of donations, expenditure limits, public financing, and disclosure requirements.

Donation limits aim to prevent a party from being influenced by a few large donors, including foreign citizens or companies. Various countries impose contribution limits on different types of donors, whereas others rely on expenditure limits. Expenditure limits ensure that political parties are not engaged in a financial arms race, freeing them from the pressure to compete for money instead of votes.

Public financing of political parties can be implemented through predetermined criteria based on their importance in the political system. For example, Germany provides public funds to parties based on past election performance, membership fees, and private donations. Another approach is the use of "democracy vouchers," as seen in Seattle, where eligible voters receive publicly funded vouchers they can donate to their preferred candidates. However, public funding alone does not address the challenge of regulating private money unless private funding is entirely banned.

Disclosure requirements serve as a less intrusive form of regulation, nudging voters against electing politicians involved in quid pro quo arrangements. Disclosures assume that providing information and subjecting it to public scrutiny can influence politicians' decisions and voters' choices. Striking a balance between transparency and donor anonymity is critical. Anonymity protects donors from potential retribution or extortion by those in power. Some jurisdictions allow anonymity for small donors while requiring disclosures for larger donations to address this concern.

India faces challenges in its campaign finance framework. Currently, individuals and organizations can donate unlimited amounts to political parties without any donation limits. There are no legal expenditure limits for parties, allowing them to spend as much as they want on campaigns. Parties only need to disclose donations above Rs 20,000, except when made through electoral bonds. This creates a loophole as parties can split large donations into smaller ones to avoid disclosure requirements.

Electoral bonds introduced in 2017 enable large donors to hide their contributions if they use official banking channels, undermining public scrutiny. The scheme also allows the party in power to access information about donors from other parties, contradicting the purpose of electoral bonds. Furthermore, the rise of political consultancies, campaign groups, and civil society organizations involved in online and offline political campaigns necessitates rethinking the assumptions underlying India's political funding framework.

In conclusion, a robust campaign finance framework for India should address donation regulation, expenditure limits, public financing, and disclosure requirements. Striking the right balance between transparency and anonymity is crucial, considering the challenges of private funding and the changing landscape of political campaigns.

### [Hollywood actors and writersâ€™ strike called off: What we know about the deal so far](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hollywood-actors-writers-strike-deal-explained-9020526/)

GPT-3.5: The strike in Hollywood involving the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has finally reached a tentative deal with film studios and streaming platforms. The strike, which lasted for about four months, caused a halt in the production of new films, TV shows, and other related activities. The deal aims to address issues related to workers' rights in the entertainment industry, particularly in the context of the growing influence of streaming platforms and the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. While the full details of the deal are yet to be released, it is expected to include compensation increases, provisions to protect members from AI threats, and improvements in pension and health benefits. The deal will undergo review by the SAG-AFTRA National Board and will be subject to a ratification vote by the members. Once approved, production is expected to resume, with projects like 'Deadpool 3' and a 'Gladiator' sequel among the first to restart.

### [Speedy disposal of cases against lawmakers: What SC guidelines on the matter say](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/speedy-disposal-cases-lawmakers-sc-guidelines-9020398/)

The Supreme Court has issued guidelines to monitor the speedy disposal of criminal cases against Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs). The court called for the setting up of a "special bench" to monitor such cases and for the suo motu registration of cases by high courts. The directions were given in response to a plea filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, which sought speedy disposal of cases involving lawmakers and a lifetime ban on convicted politicians from contesting elections. The court ruled that priority should be given to cases punishable with death or life imprisonment, as well as cases punishable with 5 years imprisonment or more. The court also stated that high courts can issue similar orders and directions for effective disposal of such cases.

### [How political funding influences electoral outcomes: what studies say](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/how-political-funding-influences-electoral-outcomes-what-studies-say-9020392/)

The Supreme Court is currently reviewing petitions challenging the validity of electoral bonds, with the ruling government claiming that they were introduced to make political funding more transparent. However, opposition parties argue that the system is transparent only for the ruling party. Available data shows that from 2017 to 2022, the BJP received 57% of all electoral bonds, amounting to over Rs 5,200 crore, while the Congress received only 10% of the funds (Rs 950 crore).

A study by the Centre for Media Studies revealed that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the most expensive ever, costing around Rs 55-60,000 crore, with the BJP accounting for 45% of the expenditure. Research suggests a linear relationship between political funding and electoral outcomes. Candidates from competitive parties were found to be approximately 20 times wealthier than candidates from non-competitive parties. Wealthier candidates had a higher likelihood of winning elections.

Similar correlations between electoral funding and election outcomes have been observed in studies conducted outside of India, including in US congressional elections and legislative elections in Taiwan.

The Supreme Court raised concerns about selective anonymity in the electoral bonds scheme, where the ruling party could identify donors while the opposition could not. The Election Commission of India and the Reserve Bank of India also expressed objections to the scheme, citing the potential for misuse and the involvement of shell companies to channel black money into politics. However, the ECI later supported electoral bonds.

In addition to the electoral bonds scheme, several other laws were amended, including the Reserve Bank of India Act, Companies Act, Income Tax Act 1961, Representation of the People Act, and Foreign Contribution Regulations Act. These amendments increased the role of political funding in electoral outcomes by removing restrictions on the percentage of profits a company could donate and eliminating the requirement for companies to have three years of profits before making political donations.

### [Why Mumbai will not host the Indo-Pak semi final (if it happens)](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/mumbai-wankhede-india-pakistan-cricket-shiv-sena-9020286/)

India and Pakistan may have a chance to face each other in the World Cup semifinals. India is currently at the top of the leaderboard, while Pakistan needs to secure the fourth spot to set up a clash with India. However, if this match does happen, it will be played in Kolkata instead of Mumbai due to security concerns. Pakistan is currently tied with New Zealand in terms of points but behind in net run rate. If New Zealand loses their final game, Pakistan can simply defeat England to qualify for the semis. Otherwise, they would need to win by a significant margin to overtake New Zealand. In any case, Pakistan can only qualify as the fourth-placed team, leading them to face India in the semifinal. As per an arrangement with the Pakistan Cricket Board, any semifinal featuring Pakistan will be played in Kolkata instead of Mumbai due to previous security concerns. The Shiv Sena, a political party in Maharashtra, has been strongly opposed to Pakistan and Indo-Pak cricket matches due to historical reasons. They have previously disrupted matches and expressed their disagreement with playing against Pakistan. Due to these security concerns and past incidents, Pakistan's matches have been scheduled in venues other than Mumbai.

### [Why Keralaâ€™s contributory pension scheme was under review, and what a govt committee has said on retaining it](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-govt-committee-nps-pension-scheme-report-9019907/)

A report from a committee appointed by the Kerala government to review the state's contributory pension scheme has been made public following a Supreme Court ruling. The committee was formed in 2018 to examine the legal and financial implications of revoking the scheme, which was implemented in Kerala in 2013. The report, submitted in April 2021 but only recently disclosed, suggests increasing the state government's contribution to the scheme from 10% to 14%. It also recommends allowing death-cum-retirement gratuity for employees enrolled in the contributory pension scheme. The report highlights that continuing the scheme would reduce pension expenditure as a percentage of total revenue receipts by 2040. However, if the government decides to revoke the scheme, pension expenditure will remain above 20% of total revenue receipts until at least 2060. The article mentions concerns about low annuities received by those retired under the scheme and the potential risks associated with investment in assets. Some states in India have reintroduced a statutory pension scheme in response to demands from government employees to return to the old system.

### [1 year of Project Cheetah: Hits, misses and paradigm shift ahead](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-year-of-project-cheetah-9019478/)

India's Project Cheetah, which aims to introduce African cheetahs into the wild in India, has reported short-term successes. These include a 50% survival rate for introduced cheetahs, the establishment of home ranges, the birth of cubs in Kuno, and revenue generation for local communities. However, there are concerns about the project's long-term success. Many cheetahs have spent limited time in the wild, falling short of the expected months. The project has lost 40% of its adult population due to deaths and unfit individuals. Only three cheetahs have spent an extended period in the wild, while others have been kept in enclosures. Reproduction has occurred, but one female was captive-raised and her cubs were born in captivity. The project has boosted local livelihoods but faces challenges in maintaining genetic diversity and establishing a self-sustaining population. The solution may lie in creating a meta-population scattered across central and western India, aided by periodic translocations to maintain genetic viability. However, this approach could weaken the case for natural wildlife dispersal and forest connectivity.

### [Possible answer to farm fires: New rice variety can replace Pusa-44](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/possible-answer-to-farm-fires-new-rice-variety-can-replace-pusa-44-9019491/)

The Supreme Court has ordered the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to immediately stop the burning of crop stubble in order to reduce pollution. The court specifically mentioned a paddy variety grown mostly in Punjab as a major cause of stubble burning. Although the article doesn't name the variety, it is likely referring to Pusa-44, which is a long-duration variety that takes 155-160 days to mature. Due to the limited time for field preparation before sowing the next wheat crop, farmers resort to burning the remaining stubble after harvesting.

Pusa-44 is attractive to farmers because it is a high-yielding variety, producing 35-36 quintals per acre. However, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) has developed an improved version called Pusa-2090 that matures in just 120-125 days while maintaining high yields. Pusa-2090 is a cross between Pusa-44 and CB-501, an early-maturing Japonica rice line obtained from the International Rice Research Institute. The new variety combines the benefits of higher yields and shorter maturation period.

Pusa-2090 has been tested in various trials and farmer fields in the Delhi-NCR region, and it has been officially approved for cultivation in Delhi and Odisha. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are also advocating for its release, as it can provide the same yields as Pusa-44 but with a shorter duration. One farmer in Punjab has already test-planted Pusa-2090 and reported good yield results.

In the current season, Punjab farmers have planted over 5 lakh hectares with Pusa-44, accounting for more than 17% of the state's total paddy area. The problem of stubble burning is less prevalent in basmati varieties, which produce softer straw and have been grown in a smaller area this year. The only variety cultivated in a larger area than Pusa-44 is PR-126, bred by the Punjab Agricultural University. However, it has lower yields compared to Pusa-44.

Overall, the development of the Pusa-2090 variety provides a potential solution to stubble burning and its associated pollution problems.

### [Whatâ€™s Gazaâ€™s Ministry of Health â€” and how does it calculate the death toll?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gaza-ministry-of-health-9019316/)

The article discusses the death toll in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel's bombings and the role of Gaza's Ministry of Health in providing casualty estimates. The ministry, controlled by the Hamas government, is responsible for supervising health services in Gaza. Its casualty estimates are widely cited by news organizations, human rights groups, and international entities like the United Nations.

While Gaza's Hamas government controls the health ministry, it operates separately from its political and security agencies. The Palestinian Authority (PA) retains power over health and education services in Gaza, even though Hamas defeated it in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections. The PA administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has its own health ministry in Ramallah. It still provides medical equipment, pays salaries to the ministry's employees, and handles patient transfers from Gaza to Israeli hospitals.

The ministry calculates the death toll by collecting data from hospital administrators who record every wounded person and dead body. This information is entered into a computerized system shared with the health ministry's spokesperson. The ministry also receives data from other sources such as the Palestinian Red Crescent. It releases casualty updates every few hours, providing the number of dead and wounded categorized by gender but without disclosing names, ages, or locations. However, in response to doubts raised by the US, they released a detailed report listing every Palestinian killed in the war so far.

According to Human Rights Watch, the ministry's figures are generally accurate based on their past investigations of Gazan casualties. In previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas, UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Palestinian Red Crescent have also relied on these numbers.

### [How climate change is displacing animals](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-displacing-animals-9019249/)

A new analysis suggests that extreme weather events linked to climate change have a more detrimental impact on native species compared to non-native species. The study, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, analyzed 443 studies on the responses of native and non-native species to extreme weather. It found that non-native species tended to show more positive responses or fewer negative responses to extreme weather, while native species suffered population decline, loss of geographic distribution, and struggled to recover. The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of global warming on biodiversity. However, some researchers caution that the study's conclusions may be biased due to the limited representation of regions and species in the analyzed studies. Nonetheless, the study underscores the need to protect native species and focus on their recovery in areas affected by extreme weather events.

### [Mobile phones might cause lower sperm count: what new research shows](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/mobile-phones-lower-sperm-count-research-9019250/)

A recent study from Switzerland suggests that there may be a link between mobile phone use and declining sperm counts. After analyzing semen samples from over 2,800 young men, researchers found that those who reported higher mobile phone usage had lower sperm concentration. However, there was no difference in sperm motility or morphology between different types of phone users, nor did the storage location of the phone affect sperm concentration. The study was conducted between 2005 and 2018, and the association between high phone use and low sperm count was more significant during the earlier years of the study. The researchers believe this may be due to the transition from older to newer technologies with lower phone output power.

This study adds mobile phones to a growing list of factors that have been found to potentially impact fertility, including smoking, obesity, alcohol, stress, and certain chemicals. Previous research on this topic has mainly been conducted on mice or sperm in vitro, making this study particularly valuable as it was carried out in real-world conditions. However, some experts caution that other factors related to lifestyle or occupation may be influencing these results and that there is currently no confirmed explanation for the observed decline in sperm quality among frequent phone users.

While the findings may cause concern for men planning to have children, researchers advise against making any drastic changes based solely on this study. Keeping phones in a bag and reducing usage can be relatively easy steps to take, but there is no evidence yet that these actions improve sperm quality. Further research, such as randomized controlled trials, is needed to better understand the biology and mechanisms behind this potential association. In the meantime, individuals are encouraged to make informed decisions regarding their phone use while keeping in mind that the current evidence is inconclusive.

### [SC says cracker order applies to country, not just NCR: What types of fireworks are allowed, and where](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/diwali-fireworks-sc-green-crackers-9019216/)

The Supreme Court has clarified that its ban on the use of barium and other banned chemicals in firecrackers applies to the entire country, not just the National Capital Region. The court's order, which was reiterated in October 2021, bans the production and sale of all crackers except "green crackers" and those with reduced emissions. It also prohibits the use of barium salts in fireworks and sets limits on noise levels. Barium and other chemicals are banned due to their harmful impact on human health, including respiratory irritation, skin allergies, breathing difficulties, and cancer. Green crackers, which emit less-harmful chemicals and release water vapor as a dust suppressant, were developed by a network of CSIR labs. These crackers fall into three categories: SWAS, which releases water vapor when burst; STAR, which emits reduced particulate matter and sound intensity; and SAFAL, which minimizes the use of aluminum and emits less noise.

### [Indiaâ€™s Energy Conservation Building Code, 2017: Why the IEA called it a â€˜notable exceptionâ€™ among developing countries](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/energy-conservation-building-code-2017-iea-9018786/)

India has been recognized as a standout among developing economies for its energy efficiency building codes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The agency's World Energy Outlook 2023 report highlighted India's Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), which sets minimum energy standards for commercial buildings. Currently, 23 states in India have rules in place to enforce ECBC compliance, while larger states like Maharashtra and Gujarat are still in the process of drafting rules. Buildings in India account for 30% of total electricity consumption, a figure expected to rise to 50% by 2042. The ECBC aims to enable energy savings of 25-50% in compliant buildings and covers components such as building design, lighting systems, HVAC systems, and electrical power systems. The updated 2017 code includes priorities such as renewable energy integration and passive building design strategies. While ECBC acts as a national standard, states have the flexibility to modify the code to suit regional needs. However, not all states have fully implemented the code, with five states yet to notify ECBC rules. The IEA recognizes India's efforts in building codes and highlights the potential for significant energy savings in the sector. The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022 expands the scope of building codes in India and makes the residential building energy code mandatory. The government is expected to update the residential building code in the coming months.

### [Electoral Bonds and Electoral Trusts: What are they, and how do they differ?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/electoral-bonds-electoral-trusts-9018591/)

The Supreme Court has reserved its judgment on the challenge to the Indian government's Electoral Bonds Scheme after a three-day hearing. The controversial scheme, introduced in 2018, replaced the previous Electoral Trusts Scheme. Under the new scheme, donor anonymity is ensured, whereas under the previous scheme, electoral trusts were required to submit reports on contributions and donations to political parties. The number of registered trusts has ranged from three to 17, but only a few make donations each year.

The Electoral Trusts Scheme requires trusts to donate 95% of contributions received to registered political parties. The scheme provides transparency regarding contributors and beneficiaries when there is only one contributor and one beneficiary. However, when multiple contributors and recipients are involved, it is difficult to determine which company is funding which party.

On the other hand, Electoral Bonds are exempt from disclosure requirements, providing privacy for donors. Political funding through both schemes increased after the introduction of Electoral Bonds, with the majority of donations coming through this newer scheme. From 2017-18 to 2021-22, parties received a total of Rs 1,631 crore through Electoral Trusts, while Rs 9,208 crore was donated through Electoral Bonds.

Between March 2018 and October 2023, electoral bonds worth over Rs 14,000 crore were sold by the State Bank of India. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) received 72% of the total funds donated through electoral trusts, higher than its share of funding through electoral bonds (57%). The Congress received 10% of the total funding from electoral bonds and 9.7% from electoral trusts. The Trinamool Congress received 8.3% of electoral bond funds, while the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) received about 1% of total funds given by trusts.

According to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms, more than 55% of political party funding comes through electoral bonds. For some parties, these bonds have become the sole source of contributions, as seen with the BJD declaring that its entire income in 2021-22 came from electoral bonds.

The Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project in India experienced another setback after a portion of the hill next to the dam collapsed into the reservoir. This blocked the only functional diversion tunnel and halted the flow of water downstream. Construction of the project, which began in 2005, has faced delays due to local opposition and design changes. The deadline for commissioning the first two units has been extended multiple times, with the current deadline set for March 2024. The project authority is now focusing on slope stabilization and may build a temporary barrier to isolate the under-construction spillway gates. The potential impact on the riverine ecosystem and aquatic life forms remains uncertain.

### [Indiaâ€™s hypertension map: How different states, regions fare](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/india-hypertension-state-district-wise-break-up-9018281/)

A recent analysis of data from the National Family Health Survey in India, published in the journal JAMA, reveals significant variations in the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension within Indian states and districts. The study indicates that national mean values of hypertension mask substantial variation at the district level. The researchers recommend implementing targeted and decentralized solutions to address this issue.

The study highlights the existing knowledge among doctors that a large number of individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed. Even among those diagnosed, many do not initiate treatment, and among those who do, few are able to effectively control their blood pressure. The data shows that only one in three individuals receive a diagnosis, one in five receive treatment, and one in twelve achieve blood pressure control.

At the state level, the prevalence of hypertension in southern states was higher than the national average, with 29.9% of the population affected compared to 26.8% across India. However, the proportion of people diagnosed, treated, and under control in these states was higher than the rest of the country.

There were also significant variations within states at the district level. For instance, in Meghalaya, the prevalence of hypertension was similar across districts, but the proportion of those diagnosed varied significantly. Similarly, in Karnataka, different districts demonstrated varying levels of treatment and control despite similar prevalence rates.

The study also examined the impact of age, gender, socio-economic conditions, and education level on hypertension. While men are more likely to have hypertension, the data surprisingly showed that women are more likely to be diagnosed, receive treatment, and have their blood pressure under control. Older individuals had higher rates of prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control compared to younger individuals. Among socio-economic conditions, the wealthiest fifth of the population had the highest rates of prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control. Additionally, while the prevalence was similar between those with no schooling and those who completed Class 11, the latter group had higher rates of diagnosis, treatment, and control.

The district-level breakdown of data can assist state governments in allocating resources for healthcare. By identifying districts with higher prevalence or lacking screening and diagnostic facilities, local governments can plan interventions accordingly. The paper emphasizes the importance of continuum of care rather than just screening and diagnosis for managing chronic conditions like hypertension. It suggests that regular availability of medicines, closer healthcare centers, digitization of records, and follow-ups are crucial aspects of hypertension management.

According to a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO), India could prevent nearly 4.6 million deaths by 2040 if half of all hypertensive individuals achieve blood pressure control. In line with this, the Indian government has launched an initiative to provide treatment to 75 million people with hypertension or diabetes by 2025. Successfully controlling hypertension will require not only increased infrastructure but also active screening, timely treatment, accessible medicines, and regular follow-ups.

### [Jharkhand launches drive to grant land titles under FRA: Why now, challenges](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-land-titles-fra-9017751/)

The Jharkhand government has launched a special drive called Abua Bir Dishom Abhiyan to provide land title certificates to individuals and communities under the Forests Rights Act. The act grants self-cultivation and habitation rights to Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers. The drive comes after nine years and aims to address the low number of titles distributed compared to other states like Chhattisgarh. The government is setting up a dedicated website and mobile application for stakeholders to track the application process. It has also instructed the formation of Forest Rights Committees at the village level and monitoring committees at higher levels. However, challenges include changing the mindset of forest officials who view forest dwellers as encroachers, as well as hierarchical issues in the verification process. The government is working with partners such as the Foundation of Ecological Security and the Indian School of Business to overcome these challenges.

A recent survey conducted by Siena College and The New York Times found that former US President Donald Trump is leading current President Joe Biden as the preferred choice for voters in five out of six swing states. These swing states, which are crucial for securing a victory, were all won by Biden in the 2020 election. The survey included over 3,662 voters from these states and revealed that 48% would vote for Trump in the next election, while 44% supported Biden's re-election bid. Additionally, 59% of respondents disapproved of Biden's handling of his job as president, and 67% believed the country is headed in the wrong direction. Despite this, 56% of voters held an unfavorable view of Trump. The survey also found that economic issues were the most important factor for voters when deciding on a candidate, with 57% citing jobs, taxes, or the cost of living as their top concern. Furthermore, 52% of voters described the current state of the US economy as "poor," despite its attempts to recover from the pandemic. The survey also highlighted that while many voters had concerns about Trump's impact on democracy, they believed he would do a better job than Biden on the economy, immigration, national security, and the Israel-Palestine issue. The article also noted that Biden's traditional voting base, including women, younger people, and people of color, seemed to be less supportive in these swing states. The article concludes by mentioning that pre-election polling has often been inaccurate, and despite the current polls, the results could still turn out differently. It also highlights the decline in Biden's approval rating since taking office, which currently stands at around 38%. However, Democrats have defended their record, pointing out that they performed better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections.

### [Ten things Delhi-NCR needs to do to tackle air pollution: What an IIT Kanpur study said](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ten-things-delhi-ncr-needs-tackle-air-pollution-9017406/)

The Supreme Court has criticized the governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan for not stopping farmers from burning stubble, as poor air quality continues to affect the Delhi-NCR region. The court also directed the Delhi government to prevent the burning of municipal solid waste. These measures, along with the implementation of the odd-even car scheme, may help reduce pollution levels, but a comprehensive approach is needed to address the problem. A report by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur suggests ten steps that should be taken to control air pollution in the region. These include stopping the use of coal in hotels and restaurants, promoting the use of LPG for cooking, ending municipal solid waste burning, and covering construction materials at construction sites. The report also recommends the use of windbreakers and telescopic chutes during concrete batching, promoting the use of electric and BS-VI vehicles, installing de-sox-ing and de-nox-ing systems at power plants, and installing vapour recovery systems at petrol pumps. Additionally, biomass burning should be limited, and measures should be taken to tackle fly ash.

### [A daily glass of goat milk? Hereâ€™s what you need to know.](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/goat-milk-gujarat-9017201/)

The Agriculture Minister of Gujarat, Raghavji Patel, has requested a proposal on branding and marketing goat milk, which is currently sold informally. A meeting was held with representatives from various organizations on October 26 to discuss the potential for goat milk in the state. A survey estimated Gujarat's goat population at 50.55 lakh in 2021-22, with goat milk production accounting for 2% of the state's total milk production. The Gujarat State Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which owns Amul, expressed interest in processing and marketing goat milk if the Surendranagar District Co-operative Milk Producersâ€™ Union agrees to collect it. Procurement by Amul could benefit goat and sheep herders by providing a formal mechanism for selling their produce. Pastoralists currently sell goat milk to tea stalls and hotels or use it to make mava, an ingredient for sweets. The involvement of large dairy federations like Amul could spur the establishment of organized goat farms and create a potentially large market for goat milk. However, it is unlikely that goats will become primarily milk-producing animals due to the limited quantity of milk they produce daily. Goats are traditionally reared for both milk and meat. Despite the separate branding and marketing of goat milk increasing pastoralists' earnings, some goats will still end up in slaughterhouses to maintain the viability of the herd. Goat meat is in high demand, with thousands of goats being traded every week in Ahmedabad's goat market. Additionally, goat milk has health benefits such as being easily digestible and suitable for neonates and lactose-intolerant individuals.

### [PM 2.5, Sulphur Dioxide, and more: What are the pollutants in our air, and how they impact health](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/air-pollution-aqi-source-health-impact-explained-9016879/)

Air pollution levels in North India have raised concerns about the air quality index (AQI), with Delhi recording an AQI score of over 400, categorizing the air as 'severe' pollution. The AQI is a measure that simplifies complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number for better understanding. The pollutants measured in the AQI include PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, carbon, etc. Fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 can easily enter the circulatory system and cause chronic diseases like asthma, heart attacks, and respiratory problems. Nitrogen dioxide is emitted from fuel burning sources like vehicles and power plants, and short-term exposure to high levels can worsen respiratory diseases such as asthma. Ozone, usually present in the upper atmosphere, becomes a significant air pollutant at surface levels and increases the risk of hospital admissions for certain pulmonary diseases. Sulphur dioxide, mainly emitted by burning fossil fuels, can harm the cardiovascular system and cause respiratory illnesses. Ammonia, largely released by fertilizer use and livestock waste in India, contributes to aerosol pollution that is damaging to human health and also harms plants and water quality. Lead, a toxic metal, can cause intellectual disability and behavioral disorders, particularly in children. Carbon monoxide, a dangerous gas released by the burning of carbon-containing fuels, can lead to unconsciousness or death in high levels and long-term exposure increases the risk of heart disease.

### [Can Delhiâ€™s odd-even policy help in preventing health issues? Hereâ€™s what experts, studies say](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/delhi-odd-even-policy-health-impact-pollution-explained-9016616/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Experts argue that implementing an odd-even vehicle restriction policy may not effectively address health-related impacts of pollution. While there is some evidence suggesting that this policy can reduce pollutant levels during daytime hours, the available evidence lacks consistency. Dr. Sagnik Dey, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, states that odd-even is not a long-term solution as it does not significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the road and the reduction in emissions does not always translate to a reduction in air concentrations. Dr. Karan Madan, from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Delhi, adds that even a 20% decrease in PM2.5 levels is still harmful to health. Long-term exposure to pollution is associated with various health risks. Studies have shown a decrease in particulate matter levels when odd-even schemes are implemented, but the reduction is typically only around 5 to 10%. The reduction in PM levels could be due to reduced car numbers, faster traffic, and reduced engine idling time. The highest reductions are observed during mid-day, not early morning when cold temperatures keep pollutants close to the ground. Measures such as phasing out vehicles and promoting electric vehicles are expected to show results in the future. In the meantime, regional implementation of pollution control measures and the use of air purifiers at schools are suggested.

### [Odd-even scheme back in Delhi: Has it helped bring down air pollution in the past?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/odd-even-scheme-delhi-pollution-impact-explained-9016587/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi government has announced the return of the odd-even road apportioning scheme for a week after Diwali to combat severe air pollution. The average air quality index (AQI) reading in Delhi was 421 on Monday, with PM 2.5 being the prominent pollutant. The odd-even scheme allows cars to ply on alternate days based on their registration number, aiming to reduce the number of cars on the road by roughly half. The scheme was previously implemented in 2016 and 2019. Several categories of vehicles are exempt from the scheme. The details of the new scheme have not been announced yet.

### [Delhi odd-even scheme: Its impact on vehicular pollution levels, and why it is not a silver bullet](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-pollution-odd-even-scheme-no-silver-bullet-given-the-exemptions-but-cuts-toxic-emissions-9016425/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the limitations of reducing the number of vehicles on the road as a solution to air pollution. While this action can help reduce peak pollution levels, it is not a comprehensive solution because two-wheelers and taxis, which contribute significantly to emissions, are exempted. Transport is the top contributor to pollutants, so it cannot be ignored when air quality is severe. However, experts find it difficult to estimate exactly how much pollution would come down with this scheme due to various factors such as emissions from outside Delhi and exemptions within the subset of vehicles affected by the restrictions. A study on a previous odd-even scheme implemented in Delhi showed that it had failed to mitigate air pollution effectively. The article emphasizes that emergency actions like reducing vehicle numbers are not a silver bullet and should be seen as part of a larger set of measures to address air pollution.

### [Sri Lankaâ€™s batter Angelo Mathews timed out: What is the rule?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sports/sri-lanka-angelo-mathews-timed-out-9015903/)

GPT-3.5: In the recent World Cup clash between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews faced a unique situation. He was timed out, which is a first in international cricket. Mathews was not ready to face his first delivery after coming in at No 6 for Sri Lanka due to an issue with the strap on his helmet. According to the playing conditions of the men's cricket World Cup 2023, a batsman must be ready to receive the ball within 2 minutes of a dismissal or retirement. Failure to do so results in being considered out. It's worth noting that the bowler does not receive credit for the dismissal in such cases. This incident brings back memories of a similar situation involving Sourav Ganguly during a test match between South Africa and India in 2007. Ganguly was close to being timed out due to a delay in entering the field after the fall of early wickets. The Indian team was not aware of the situation, leading to confusion. However, the South Africa team decided not to appeal, considering the exceptional circumstances.

### [GRAP Stage 4 implemented in Delhi-NCR amid severe air pollution: What does it mean?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/grap-stage-4-delhi-pollution-9015845/)

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has invoked measures under Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India due to the severe air pollution. GRAP is a set of emergency measures that are implemented when air quality reaches a certain threshold. Stage 4 is activated when the Air Quality Index (AQI) rises to the 'Severe+' category, which is above 450. As part of these measures, diesel four-wheelers that are not BS-VI compliant and trucks are prohibited from entering Delhi, while petrol cars can continue to operate. Construction and demolition activities are also banned, and state governments have the option to discontinue physical classes and implement work-from-home policies. The Delhi government has directed schools to suspend physical classes, except for classes 10 and 12, until November 10, and will reintroduce the odd-even scheme from November 13-20.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk of Bhutan will be meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after completing a three-day visit to Assam, marking the first-ever visit by a Bhutanese monarch to the state. The visit is significant as it comes after a tense period in which the relationship between Assam and Bhutan became complicated due to the presence of insurgent groups from Assam in Bhutanese territory. Bhutan launched its first military operation in 140 years, called "Operation All Clear," in 2003 to flush out the militants. During the operation, the Royal Bhutan Army dealt a crippling blow to the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, and the Kamatapur Liberation Organization (KLO). The presence of these groups had strained diplomatic relations between Bhutan and India, as well as impacted development and economic activities in Bhutan. The crackdown was prompted by the direct threat to Bhutan's sovereignty and national security posed by the insurgents. Additionally, there were fears that the insurgent groups would supply arms to the ethnic Nepalese Lhotshampas, potentially fueling an ethnic insurgency in southern Bhutan. The operation resulted in the capture or killing of at least 650 insurgents, including top leaders of ULFA, KLO, and NDFB. The Indian army provided logistical and medical assistance during the operation and sealed the Indo-Bhutan border to prevent militants from escaping into India.

### [The double-whammy from Indiaâ€™s falling farm exports](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-double-whammy-from-falling-farm-exports-9015094/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India's agricultural exports have declined by 11.6% year-on-year in April-September, partly due to the government's restrictions on shipments of various commodities and a decrease in global prices. The value of farm commodity exports was $23.6 billion in April-September 2023, compared to $26.7 billion in the same period last year. Imports also decreased from $19.3 billion to $16.2 billion, resulting in a slight dip in the agricultural trade surplus. India's farm exports reached record highs in 2021-22 and 2022-23 but are expected to decline in 2023-24 due to lower global prices and improved supply situations. The government's bans and restrictions on exports, driven by domestic availability and inflation concerns, have also contributed to the decline in agricultural exports. The effects of these measures can be seen in the significant drop in wheat, rice, and sugar exports. Declining international prices not only affect the competitiveness of India's agricultural exports but also make farmers more vulnerable to imports, as seen in cotton and edible oils. The focus on controlling food inflation ahead of national elections has led to continued imports of edible oil and pulses while restricting exports of cereals, sugar, and onions, which negatively impacts farmers.

The King of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, visited New Delhi, India, receiving a warm welcome from the External Affairs Minister. This visit comes at a time when Bhutan is engaged in border talks with China, causing some concern in New Delhi. Bhutan's Foreign Minister recently made declarations in Beijing expressing a desire to settle the border dispute quickly and establish diplomatic relations with China. This has caught India off guard. Talks between Bhutan and China were suspended after the Doklam standoff in 2017, but engagement continued during this period. Bhutan sees several benefits in normalizing relations with China, including the opportunity to establish diplomatic ties with a P5 country. India's main concern is the strategic implications of Bhutan normalizing relations with China, particularly the potential loss of control over the Doklam plateau. Experts in China celebrate the perceived success in their relationship with Bhutan and view it as a diplomatic breakthrough in South Asia.

India has started the process of developing a national security strategy, which is being compiled by the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) with inputs from various central ministries and departments. The exact timeline for completion is unknown, but multiple ministries have already submitted their inputs. This is the first time India is creating such a strategy, which will outline the country's security objectives, including traditional and non-traditional threats, and the measures to address them. The strategy will likely cover a range of challenges, such as financial and economic security, information warfare, and vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure. Developed countries like the US, the UK, and Russia already have national security strategies, and China and Pakistan have also established their own. The need for a national security strategy in India has been discussed for years, and it is hoped that this strategy will provide a framework for military and security reforms. The lack of a strategy in the past may have been due to hesitation at the political level and concerns about accountability in defense management.

### [Despite govtâ€™s efforts, why onion prices remain high](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/despite-govts-efforts-why-onion-prices-remain-high-9014412/)

The Indian government has been taking measures to control the rising prices of onions, including imposing an export duty of 40% and a minimum export price of $800/tonne. Additionally, the government has formed a buffer stock of 5 lakh tonnes of onions. However, these interventions have had limited success in reducing prices. The delay in the monsoon and extensive damage to the harvested crop earlier in the year have caused higher than usual onion prices. The late arrival and delayed transplanting of the kharif crop have further worsened the supply chain mismatch. As a result, onion prices are expected to remain high until the new crop arrives at the end of the month.

### [Pakistanâ€™s complicated relationship with the two Talibans](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/pakistans-relationship-taliban-ttp-9014085/)

Pakistani forces have successfully thwarted a terrorist attack on the Mianwali Training Air Base of the Pakistan Air Force. The Tehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan (TJP), an affiliate of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed responsibility for the attack. This comes at a time when Pakistan is forcibly expelling Afghan refugees, drawing criticism from the UN and rights groups. Militant and terrorist activity in Pakistan has surged in recent years, with the TTP becoming the largest militant organization fighting against the Pakistani state. The rise of the TTP can be traced back to Pakistan's support of Islamic fundamentalism and its delicate balancing act between supporting the Taliban and appeasing the US. Despite friendly relations with the Afghan Taliban, they have not helped Pakistan deal with the TTP, leading to increased attacks on military installations.

The Supreme Court has agreed to examine whether a transgender woman who underwent sex-reassignment surgery can be considered an "aggrieved person" under the Domestic Violence Act. The case involves a trans woman who filed for interim maintenance under the Act, claiming to fall under the definition of an aggrieved person. The husband appealed against this, arguing that the trans person did not fall within the definition of "aggrieved person" as it was conferred on women in domestic relationships. The court will now consider whether the trans woman can be recognized as a woman under the Act.

### [Hypertension: How its prevalence, diagnosis, control, and treatment varies across India](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hypertension-care-india-9013493/)

A recent study analyzing national family health survey data in India has revealed significant variation in the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension among different states and districts. The study emphasizes the need for localized decision-making to ensure continuous care and control of hypertension. The national data shows that a large proportion of individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed, and among those diagnosed, many do not initiate treatment or fail to control their blood pressure effectively. The study also highlights the variability of hypertension care at the state and district levels. The prevalence of hypertension in southern states was higher than the national average, but the proportion of people on treatment and with controlled blood pressure was higher in these states. The study also found considerable variability within districts. Factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic conditions, and education level also play a role in the continuum of care for hypertension. The study suggests that analyzing inter-state and inter-district variability can help state governments allocate resources more effectively. Local governments need to ensure that medicines are readily available, improve access to screening and diagnostic facilities, and implement regular follow-ups. The study underscores the importance of a continuum of care for hypertension, beyond just diagnosis and screening, and calls for active screening, availability of medicines, and proper follow-up to control hypertension effectively in India.

Reality television show Bigg Boss OTT winner and YouTuber Elvish Yadav has been booked by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police for allegedly selling snake venom at rave parties in the National Capital Region. The police recovered a significant amount of snake venom, as well as various snakes, from the accused. Snake venom is commonly used as a recreational drug and is part of a multimillion-dollar illicit industry. The smuggling of snake venom was highlighted in November 2022 when the Border Security Force in West Bengal seized a large quantity of venom. However, there is a lack of scientific study on the recreational use of snake venom. In previous cases, snake bites were deliberately inflicted on consumers, resulting in effects such as jerky movements, blurring of vision, and blackouts, followed by a heightened sense of well-being that lasted weeks. The venom's neurotoxic properties are believed to cause analgesia and bind with receptors in the brain associated with euphoric experiences. Using snake venom as a recreational drug is not only addictive but also potentially dangerous, as the fatal dosage for humans is not well understood.

The city of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and Kozikodhe from Kerala have been added to UNESCOâ€™s Creative Cities Network (UCCN). Gwalior was recognized for its commitment to culture and creativity, particularly its contribution to Indian classical music. Gwalior has a rich musical history and is known for the Gwalior Gharana, the oldest musical gharana in Hindustani classical music. The gharana flourished under Raja Man Singh Tomar in the 15th century and is credited with the invention of dhrupad and the development of khayal singing. Gwalior's musical tradition has produced many notable names, including Mian Tansen, Bade Inayat Hussain Khan, and Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, among others. The inclusion of Gwalior in the UCCN recognizes its cultural significance and contribution to the world of music.

### [What is the Advocate-on-Record system in the Supreme Court?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/advocate-on-record-supreme-court-9013055/)

The Supreme Court recently dismissed a public interest litigation and reprimanded an advocate-on-record (AOR) for filing a frivolous case. The court emphasized that an AOR should not just be a signing authority. The Supreme Court also called for a comprehensive plan to reform and improve the AOR system, involving collaboration with the bar.

An AOR is a special category of advocates who are eligible to file cases before the Supreme Court. They act as a link between the litigants and the highest court of the country. AORs are elite Delhi-based lawyers who primarily practice before the Supreme Court but can also appear before other courts. The Supreme Court has specific eligibility criteria, including clearing an examination and training with a court-approved AOR for at least a year.

To become an AOR, an advocate needs to score at least 60% in the exam, with a minimum of 50% in each subject. The exam covers subjects such as practice and procedure, drafting, professional ethics, and leading cases. Approximately 200-250 lawyers clear the exam to become AORs. Additionally, an AOR must have an office in Delhi within a 16-kilometer radius of the Supreme Court and employ a registered clerk within one month of registration.

The AOR system is influenced by the British practice of barristers and solicitors. Barristers argue cases while solicitors take up cases from clients. In the federal court, agents would take up cases, and in high courts, the arguing counsels were referred to as pleaders. Senior advocates in India are designated by the court and wear a distinct gown. They are only briefed by other lawyers, such as AORs, and cannot solicit clients.

The Supreme Court has the power to make rules and regulate its own procedures for hearing cases under Article 145 of the Constitution. The AOR system was established when the Supreme Court was inaugurated, taking into account the rules of the court and the names of all advocates and agents of the previous federal court.

### [Operation Cactus: When India prevented a coup in Maldives](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/operation-cactus-india-prevented-coup-maldives-9012435/)

The article discusses the 1988 coup attempt in the Maldives and India's intervention to prevent it. The coup was led by Maldivian businessman Abdullah Luthufee and supported by Uma Maheswaran, the leader of a militant Sri Lankan Tamil organization. On November 3, 1988, 80 fighters, including members of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), arrived in MalÃ©, armed with heavy weapons. They successfully captured key infrastructure in the city, while President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom escaped to a safe house.

As the coup unfolded, SOS messages were sent to countries around the world, leading to Indian intervention. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi chaired a crisis committee meeting, and the Indian army was mobilized. Indian paratroopers, led by Colonel Subhash C Joshi, were deployed to MalÃ©. They landed at the main airport on HulhulÃ©, which caused the rebels to overestimate Indian troop numbers and subsequently flee. The paratroopers secured the airport and proceeded to rescue President Gayoom on the adjacent island of MalÃ©. Some rebels escaped on a hijacked merchant vessel and were pursued by the Indian Navy. After negotiations and the firing of warning shots, the rebels surrendered and were taken aboard an Indian ship.

The coup attempt resulted in the deaths of 19 people. The captured rebels were arrested, interrogated, and put on trial in the Maldives. Four, including Luthufee, were initially sentenced to death but had their sentences commuted at the request of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Indian paratroopers remained in MalÃ© for over two weeks.

Despite rising anti-India sentiments in recent years, the Maldives continues to remember and appreciate India's intervention in the 1988 coup. The article concludes by noting that even the newly elected President Mohamed Muizzu has sought to enhance bilateral relations with India.

### [Israel-Hamas war: Is Russia benefiting from the conflict?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-hamas-russia-benefit-9012443/)

Russia has officially blamed the US for the recent Hamas-Israel conflict and tensions in the wider Middle East, but experts suggest that Russia actually benefits from the conflict and is interested in seeing it continue. Russia's close ties with the Islamic world could be demonstrated through the conflict, despite not having significant influence in the region. However, some experts argue that the conflict could harm Russia politically, especially considering recent anti-Semitic attacks in Muslim-majority Russian regions. Additionally, Russia may not benefit economically from the conflict as rising oil prices have not occurred. While Russia's contact with Hamas may not have a significant impact on peace in the region, it may serve other goals, such as sending a message to Israel. However, this behavior could harm Russia's standing in Israel, especially among Russian-speaking Israelis who are growing concerned.

### [Experts Explain: How to fix Mumbaiâ€™sÂ air](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/experts-explain-how-to-fix-mumbais-air-9012581/)

The article discusses the poor air quality in Mumbai and the factors contributing to it. Between October 1 and 30, there were 66 instances of poor Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded in 16 areas of the city. Sion had bad air for 10 days, followed by Andheri and Mazagaon for nine days each. Some days, the overall AQI readings in Mumbai were worse than Delhi's. Last winter, from November 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, the AQI in Mumbai was poor or worse for 66 days.

Despite being surrounded by the sea, strong winds that would typically sweep away pollutants, a combination of natural and man-made factors is affecting Mumbai's AQI. The city has been experiencing calm air since the retreat of the southwest monsoon in October, which has contributed to delayed wind reversal. Experts believe this is a temporary problem and that the AQI will improve once construction projects are completed.

The article also suggests the need for better monitoring systems to address the issue. All 21 monitoring stations in Mumbai use Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Systems (CAAQMS), but sensor-based AQI monitoring units should also be considered to provide hyperlocal data. These units would empower authorities to take immediate action, such as penalizing violators who don't follow pollution norms. However, the article highlights the challenge of jurisdictions, as the municipal commissioner of Mumbai may not be able to take action against pollution sources in nearby areas.

To address this issue, experts suggest setting up an independent commission for AQI management, similar to what has been done in Delhi. This commission should have the power to take action against violators regardless of geographical borders. The article also emphasizes the importance of involving engineers, scientists, health experts, and legal advisers in finding solutions, as well as conducting emissions studies and implementing emissions-based policies.

The article mentions examples from other cities, such as Delhi and London, where more monitoring stations and research institutions have been involved in addressing air pollution issues. It also highlights the implementation of sensor-based monitoring stations in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which have significantly improved data collection in those regions.

Dr. Gufran Beig and Dr. Sachchida Nand Tripathi, both renowned air pollution experts, share their insights and recommendations throughout the article.

### [Farm fires and weather behind choke; respite likely in 4 days](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/farm-fires-and-weather-behind-choke-respite-likely-in-4-days-9012568/)

The article discusses the increase in incidents of agricultural waste burning in Punjab, which is contributing to the smog and haze situation in Delhi. This annual practice typically lasts for about two weeks, but this year the burning events started on October 31. With a significant amount of land still left to be harvested, the burning is expected to continue. The current meteorological conditions are exacerbating the situation by trapping pollutants near the surface of the atmosphere. However, a western disturbance event expected around November 7 could potentially improve the air quality. The article also highlights the role of winds in transporting pollutants from Punjab and Haryana to Delhi. The boundary layer, which affects the dispersion of pollutants, has become shallower, further worsening the situation. While rainfall or better wind speed could provide relief, both remain unlikely in the near future. The article suggests that the best-case scenario would be a change in wind systems during the western disturbance event, which could lead to the dispersion of pollutants and potential relief. The air quality is expected to remain in the severe category until at least Monday, with no significant improvement expected until the fire counts in Punjab decrease.

### [Delhi chokes on pollution: Will masks protect you?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/masks-protect-delhi-air-pollution-9012318/)

Air pollution in India has become a recurring problem, especially during the winter months, leading to the widespread use of masks. However, most cloth and surgical masks cannot effectively protect against the small pollution particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. According to a report in The Lancet, around 1.67 million deaths in India in 2019 were attributed to air pollution, accounting for 17.8% of total deaths. While deaths due to household air pollution have decreased, deaths due to ambient air pollution have increased significantly.

Doctors say that N-95 masks, when worn properly, can offer some protection against small particulate matter. However, the high pollution levels in India make it practically impossible to wear an N-95 mask 24/7. The World Health Organization advises that face masks are generally not seen as a suitable measure for health protection, but they may be useful in certain circumstances, such as prolonged commuting or outdoor activities in hazardous air quality conditions. Studies from the USA and Vietnam have shown that N-95 masks can reduce exposure to particulate matter.

However, masks cannot protect against gaseous pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Activated carbon filters have been developed, but they are difficult to maintain. A recent study from AIIMS, Delhi found that even short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide led to a significant increase in emergency room visits. Surgical and cloth masks are not effective against pollutants, so N-95 or N-99 masks with a good fit and a proper seal over the nose are recommended.

To ensure the effectiveness of a mask, it should be properly worn, covering the nose and mouth, and the metal pin on the nose should be pinched to create a seal. Masks should be changed frequently, and cracked or wet masks should be avoided. N-95 masks can be reused as long as they are not cracked, but frequent removal can lead to faster deterioration.

### [Delhiâ€™s air pollution steadily worsening since 2021: Four key findings of a new air quality study](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/delhi-air-pollution-pm-level-study-9012253/)

According to a new study by Respirer Reports, Delhi, the capital of India, had the highest level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in October for the past five years among eight major state capitals that face an air pollution crisis. The analysis revealed a consistent rise in PM 2.5 levels in Delhi since 2021, with an increase of 4.4% in October 2023 compared to the previous year. The study also examined air quality in cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Bengaluru, and Chennai. 

The study's release coincides with Delhi experiencing severe air quality, with its Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 476, classified as "severe", which is a significant cause for concern. Mumbai has also witnessed very poor or severe air quality in October, with areas like Vile Parle being highly affected. 

PM 2.5 is a harmful atmospheric pollutant that can easily enter the human circulatory system, potentially causing chronic diseases like asthma, heart attacks, bronchitis, and respiratory problems. 

Here are four key findings from the study: 

1. Delhi's air pollution has been worsening over the past two years, with PM 2.5 levels increasing by about 54% from October 2021 to October 2023, which is well above safety limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board and the World Health Organisation. 

2. Mumbai's air quality has steadily deteriorated from 2019 to 2023, with PM 2.5 levels increasing by 110% over the past four years. 

3. Hyderabad and Kolkata have also experienced a rise in PM 2.5 levels. Hyderabad witnessed an 18.6% spike in October 2023 compared to the previous year, while Kolkata's pollution levels rose by 40.2% this October. 

4. Lucknow, Patna, Bengaluru, and Chennai saw a decrease in PM 2.5 levels in October 2023 compared to the previous year. Among these cities, Chennai had the least pollution, with a reduction of over 23%. 

It is important to note that this study highlights the concerning trend of increasing air pollution in major Indian cities and the potential health risks associated with it.

### [Direct listing on foreign exchanges: What does it mean for Indian companies?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/direct-listing-foreign-exchanges-indian-companies-9012238/)

The Indian government has announced that certain Indian companies will now be allowed to directly list on select foreign stock exchanges. This move aims to enable these companies to access global capital and boost capital outflows. The provision, which came into effect on October 30, allows listed and unlisted domestic companies to directly list their equity shares on the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Ahmedabad. The government has the power to exempt such listings from certain procedural requirements. Domestic companies can use depository receipts, such as American Depository Receipts (ADR) or Global Depository Receipts (GDR), to list in the overseas market. This new provision will allow domestic companies to raise funds, offer better valuation and exposure to trade in foreign currency, benefit startups and unicorns, and add to India's foreign exchange reserves. However, more details are needed regarding which classes of public companies can use this route, the classes of securities that can be listed, the foreign jurisdictions and permitted stock exchanges, and the exemptions provided to these companies in terms of procedural compliances.

### [What is the impact of air pollution on economic growth?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/impact-air-pollution-economic-growth-9012092/)

Hmm, based on the provided article, air pollution in India has a direct and detrimental impact on GDP growth and per-capita income levels. It affects worker output, consumer footfall in consumption-led services, asset productivity, and leads to increased health expenses and welfare allocations. The Reserve Bank of India's Department of Economic and Policy Research suggests that up to 4.5% of India's GDP could be at risk by 2030 due to lost labor hours from climate change issues. Additionally, a study estimates that air pollution costs Indian businesses about $95 billion annually, which is approximately 3% of India's GDP. The costs of poor air quality manifest in lower labor productivity, lower consumer footfall, lower asset productivity, increased health expenses, welfare losses, and premature mortality. It is crucial for India to address air pollution urgently, as many of the world's most polluted cities are located in the country. Delhi, in particular, experiences severe air pollution, leading to significant economic losses. The impact of air pollution is not limited to outdoor work sectors but also affects indoor jobs, such as call center workers, where productivity is negatively impacted.

### [Delhi chokes on pollution: What is AQI â€” and how is it measured?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-aqi-9011917/)

The air pollution in Delhi-NCR and surrounding areas has worsened for the second day, bringing attention to the Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI is a measure of air quality, with higher numbers indicating worse air quality. On Friday morning, the AQI in Delhi averaged at 471, while the previous day it had reached the "severe" category, surpassing a score of 400. The color-coded AQI index, launched in India in 2014, helps both the public and the government understand the severity of the air quality and take appropriate actions. The AQI is calculated by the Central Pollution Control Board, using data on various pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon. The impact of these pollutants, especially PM2.5, can lead to serious respiratory problems and chronic diseases. The government responds to the AQI levels by implementing measures, such as the Graded Response Action Plan, which restricts the use of certain vehicles in order to prevent further deterioration of air quality.

### [What happens if you ignore a summons by the ED?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/ignore-ed-summons-arvind-kejriwal-9011774/)

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has declined to appear before the enforcement directorate for questioning, stating that the summons were unclear and seemed to be a fishing expedition. He had been summoned in connection with the investigations into the Delhi excise policy case. The enforcement directorate had filed a preliminary complaint alleging that Kejriwal had spoken in a video call with one of the main accused, Sameer Mahendru, and asked him to continue working with another accused, Vijay Nair. Kejriwal has asked the investigation officer to recall the summons, but the enforcement directorate is likely to issue a fresh notice. If Kejriwal continues to refuse to appear, the enforcement directorate can either seek a non-bailable warrant or question him at his residence and proceed with an arrest if concrete evidence is found.

### [8 Indian Navy veterans sentenced to death in Qatar: 3 options India could explore](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/8-indian-navy-veterans-sentenced-to-death-in-qatar-3-options-india-could-explore-9011311/)

In a shocking turn of events, a Qatari court has sentenced eight Indian nationals to death on charges of espionage. This comes as a surprise to the Indian government, as Qatar rarely imposes death sentences. The accused individuals were employees of Doha-based Dahra Global and were working privately to oversee the induction of Italian submarines for the company. Two Qatari nationals, including the CEO of Dahra Global, were also charged in connection with the case. The charges against the Indians were reportedly related to spying for Israel, although no official confirmation was provided by the Indian side.

The arrested individuals had been working at Dahra Global for several years, providing defense services to the Qatari Emiri Naval Force. The Indian Embassy in Doha was informed about the arrests in mid-September, and consular access was granted shortly after. The last bail plea was rejected, and on October 26, 2023, Qatar's court announced the verdict of death sentence for all eight Indians.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs expressed shock at the verdict and stated that it is exploring all legal options while providing assistance to the families and the detainees. India has previously supported its citizens facing the death penalty overseas, and it plans to challenge the sentence in higher courts and seek reprieve from the Emir of Qatar through a mercy petition.

India's diplomatic efforts in this matter will test its relationship with Qatar, with whom it shares strong economic ties, substantial investments, and robust defense cooperation. The Indian community in Qatar is generally seen as law-abiding, which may help leverage support within the Qatar establishment. However, the allegation of spying for Israel adds geopolitical sensitivities to the case, making negotiations challenging for India.

In the past six years, multiple petitions challenging the electoral bonds scheme have been filed in the Supreme Court of India. Despite this, the legislation has not been stayed, with the court stating that the weighty issues raised by the petitioners require a thorough hearing. However, when the case was finally heard by a constitution bench, it only took three days to conclude the hearing and reserve the verdict. The court emphasized that repeated applications seeking the same relief should not be entertained, especially if they concern matters that occur periodically. Critics argue that the delay in hearing such crucial cases involving the government indirectly benefits the government. This case is also linked with the question of whether the law could be introduced as a money bill, which is pending before another constitution bench. Delays in setting up constitution benches are common, as they require five-judge benches to sit for extended periods, putting other regular cases on hold.

### [Why Pakistan is forcing lakhs of Afghan migrants to leave](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-pakistan-is-forcing-lakhs-of-afghan-migrants-to-leave-9010945/)

Pakistan has ordered undocumented migrants, primarily Afghan refugees, to leave the country. The government had set a deadline of October 31 for them to leave, and those without documents have been rounded up and faced expulsion. Over 4 million Afghans live in Pakistan, with an estimated 1.7 million being undocumented. Many have fled Afghanistan due to the Soviet war and have limited ties and opportunities in their home country. Pakistan argues that it needs to prioritize its own economic affairs and security, and accuses Afghan migrants of involvement in terror attacks and organized crimes. The deportation order has faced criticism, and the Taliban has asked for more time to prepare for the return of Afghans. The timing of the deportations is problematic due to the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and the approaching winter.

The world's first global summit on artificial intelligence (AI) is being held at Bletchley Park, an English country house known as the birthplace of modern computing. During World War II, Bletchley Park played a significant role in breaking the "unbreakable" Enigma code used by the Nazis. The Turing bombe, an electro-mechanical device invented by British mathematician Alan Turing, expedited the code-breaking process. Another machine called the Colossus was built at Bletchley Park to break the German Lorenz cipher. Bletchley Park's contributions shortened the war by two years and left a technological legacy that continues to inform modern computing and AI. The role of women in Bletchley Park's operations, who made up over 70% of the staff, is often overlooked. They operated the machines and formed the backbone of the organization. The article also mentions that Facebook donated 1 million pounds to support the upkeep of Bletchley Park during the pandemic.

### [AI Summit: Why new global pact on tackling Artificial Intelligence risks is a big deal](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/new-global-pact-artificial-intelligence-risks-9010265/)

The world's first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Summit took place at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, known for being the top-secret base of codebreakers during World War II. The summit involved global leaders, computer scientists, and tech executives who agreed to establish a shared understanding of the opportunities and risks posed by frontier AI. Twenty-eight major countries, including the United States, China, Japan, France, and India, signed a declaration acknowledging the potential risks of AI and the need for global action.

The Bletchley Park Declaration highlighted the risks of intentional misuse or unintended control issues related to frontier AI, such as cybersecurity, biotechnology, and disinformation. It emphasized that international cooperation is essential to address these risks. South Korea will co-host a virtual AI summit, and France will host an in-person summit as part of the agreement on international collaboration.

The summit followed US President Joe Biden's executive order aimed at safeguarding against AI threats and exerting oversight over safety benchmarks used by AI companies. The order requires companies to share test results with the federal government before releasing new AI capabilities to the public. The government can enforce changes or abandonment of products deemed unsafe. Watermarks and precautions for biotechnology firms using AI were also included in the order.

Different countries have varying approaches to regulating AI. The EU proposed a new AI Act to classify AI based on invasiveness and risk, while the UK aims to foster innovation with a lighter-touch approach. The US is somewhere in between, working on defining an AI regulation rulebook. China has released its own set of measures to regulate AI.

Tech leaders, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, called for a pause in AI development due to concerns about systems that are difficult to control. Musk warned of AI being one of the biggest threats and an existential risk.

India has shifted its stance on AI regulation, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling for a global framework on ethical AI tools. The country is actively formulating regulations based on a risk-based approach and seeking collaborations with international agencies. TRAI, the apex telecommunications regulator, has recommended setting up a domestic statutory authority to regulate AI in India.

Overall, this summit and related developments highlight the growing recognition of the risks associated with AI and the need for international cooperation to mitigate them. Different countries are taking varied approaches to AI regulation, and India is actively working on formulating regulations based on a risk-based framework.

### [A â€˜land bridgeâ€™ across Thailandâ€™s Kra Isthmus: What is this centuries-old idea, resurrected again?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/land-bridge-thailand-kra-isthmus-9009594/)

The Prime Minister of Thailand, Srettha Thavisin, has proposed a land bridge project known as the Thai Land Bridge. This project aims to reduce the sailing distance between the Indian Ocean and East Asia by cutting across the Isthmus of Kra in Thailand. Unlike a canal, the land bridge would consist of road and rail networks connecting deep sea ports on each coast. The project is expected to save transport costs, reduce piracy risks, and alleviate congestion in the busy Strait of Malacca. It could also create jobs and boost Thailand's economic growth. However, the project faces challenges such as securing funding, as it is estimated to cost around $27.44 billion. The Prime Minister hopes to attract investments from China, although this could potentially impact Thailand's relationships with other countries. Concerns have also been raised about the project's viability and potential negative impacts on the environment and tourism.

### [In Tripura-Bangladesh railway link, new opportunities and old connect](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-tripura-bangladesh-railway-link-new-opportunities-and-old-connect-9009936/)

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina virtually inaugurated a rail link connecting northeast India with Bangladesh. The Agartala-Akhaura project will significantly reduce travel time between Agartala and Kolkata, from 31 hours to 10 hours. This project is expected to boost tourism, trade, and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

The railway line spans 12.24 km, with 5.46 km on the Indian side in Tripura and 6.78 km in the Akhaura Upazila in the Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh. The train will start from Agartala and move to Nischintapur, where immigration checks will take place at the Indian-Bangladesh border. Gangasagar will be the first station on the Bangladesh side.

A trial run of goods trains was successful, and discussions between the governments of both countries will determine the start of passenger trains. Following the completion of the trial run, full-fledged train services between Agartala-Akhaura and Agartala-Chittagong are expected to commence. The project's budget was revised due to cost escalation, and the final project cost is estimated at Rs 1255.10 crore, funded entirely by India.

The project faced delays due to land acquisition issues and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it holds great practical and emotional significance for Tripura, as the state shares an 856-km international border with Bangladesh and played a significant role in sheltering refugees during the Indo-Pakistan war and the creation of Bangladesh.

This rail link is part of ongoing efforts to strengthen connectivity between India and Bangladesh. The Bandhan Express, Maitree Express, and Mitali Express are already running between West Bengal and Bangladesh. The Bandhan Express reconnects Kolkata and Khulna, the third-largest city in Bangladesh. The Maitree Express has been operating between Kolkata and Dhaka Cantonment since 2008, and the Mitali Express was announced during Prime Minister Modi's visit to Dhaka in 2021, connecting Siliguri with the Bangladesh capital.

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has granted market authorization for Nexcar19, India's first indigenous CAR-T cell therapy, developed by ImmunoAct. This approval allows for the commercial launch of the therapy in India at a much lower cost compared to other countries. CAR-T therapy is a groundbreaking treatment that modifies T-cells into cancer-fighting cells. Unlike chemotherapy and immunotherapy, CAR-T therapy aims to cure cancer and provide lifelong benefits. Nexcar19 specifically targets cancer cells carrying the CD19 protein, and it has shown promising results in patients with B-cell lymphomas who did not respond to standard treatments. The therapy involves a patient's blood being genetically modified in the lab before being reintroduced into the body. Early results have shown a 70% response rate, with approximately 50% of patients achieving a complete response. Clinical trials for pediatric patients are currently underway, and the therapy has received approval for patients aged 15 years and older. Nexcar19 has demonstrated lower toxicity levels and minimal cytokine release syndrome compared to other CAR-T therapies. ImmunoAct is in the process of obtaining licenses and partnerships with hospitals to make the therapy available to more patients. The cost of treatment is currently around Rs 30-40 lakh, but efforts are being made to reduce it to Rs 10-20 lakh in the future. Discussions will also be held with insurers and the government to clarify the extent of insurance coverage for the therapy.

Yemen's Houthi rebels have launched drones and missiles at Israel, declaring their support for Palestine. While the attacks pose little actual danger to Israel, they have raised concerns in the region. The Houthis, backed by Iran, are part of an anti-Israel and anti-West coalition called "The Axis of Resistance." The civil war in Yemen is seen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Houthi attack is the latest in a series of attacks by groups in the Axis on Israel and the US. The attacks could potentially lead to all-out war in the Middle East, putting Saudi Arabia in a difficult position as it tries to navigate its relationships with the US, Israel, and Iran. If Saudi Arabia enters the conflict, it could escalate tensions and lead to a wider war in the region.

### [Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt partially opens: What is the crossing and why is it significant?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/rafah-border-crossing-egypt-gaza-9009527/)

The Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt has reopened for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in early October. The crossing, controlled by Egypt, is the main entrance and exit point to Gaza and has been the focus of international negotiations due to being the only entry point for relief supplies. Under a Qatar-mediated deal, Egypt will allow the entry of 88 critically injured Palestinians and around 500 foreign nationals. Israel and Egypt have also agreed on a list of people with foreign passports who can leave Gaza. The reopening of the crossing is significant as it is the only way into and out of the strip for people seeking to flee and is also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid. Egypt has historically restricted access across Rafah due to concerns over insecurity near the border in northeastern Sinai. Arab countries are reluctant to take in Palestinians out of fear of sparking a new wave of permanent displacements.

### [Why GST collections surged sharply in October](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-gst-collections-surged-sharply-in-october-9009407/)

Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in India rose by 13.4% in October compared to the previous year, reaching INR 1.72 lakh crore. This is the second-highest level since the implementation of GST in July 2017. The increase in consumption, economic activity, and settlement of disputes by businesses contributed to the surge in revenue. Overall, the total GST collections in October were the highest in 10 months. Central GST, State GST, Integrated GST, and cess all contributed to the revenue. Domestic transactions accounted for a 13% increase in revenue compared to the same month last year. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu were among the states with the highest growth in GST revenue. The government settled amounts to both the central and state GST after which the revenue for October stood at INR 72,934 crore for the center and INR 74,785 crore for the state GST. The surge in GST revenue is attributed to settlement of disputes and increased compliance, and with the ongoing festive season, further growth is expected. The boost in revenue supports the government's fiscal position, especially considering the expected shortfall in disinvestment receipts and slower growth in direct tax revenue.

Bihar has seen a significant increase in dengue cases and deaths this year, with over 15,000 cases and 59 deaths recorded so far. This marks the highest numbers in at least five years, with a 608% increase in cases compared to 2018. Doctors predict that there may be further increases in dengue cases in the state over the next two weeks.

The main reason for the rise in dengue cases and deaths is the delayed monsoon season, which lasted until mid-October instead of mid-September. This led to the creation of stagnant pools of water, ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Additionally, the continued use of water coolers, which also attract mosquitoes, has contributed to the problem. Lack of sanitation and proper defogging by the municipal corporations has also been blamed for the increase in cases.

Doctors have observed new symptoms among dengue patients, including liver and lung infections, recurrence of fever in shorter intervals, body itching, and liver swelling. The demand for platelets has also increased, with doctors administering them as a precautionary measure even when the platelet count is around 25,000, higher than the standard protocol of 15,000.

In the past five years, Bihar experienced a sudden surge in dengue cases in 2019, with 6,712 cases compared to 2,142 the previous year. However, no deaths were reported in either of those years. The number of cases decreased in 2020 and 2021, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2022, there was a resurgence of dengue in Bihar, with 13,972 cases and 32 deaths reported, with the city of Patna being the most affected. These figures do not include cases and deaths in private hospitals and clinics.

### [Hamas: Its conflict with Fatah, and the role Israel played in strengthening it](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-fatah-israel-9008780/)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to "crush and destroy" Hamas, the political and militant organization in charge of the Gaza Strip, following the worst-ever attack on Israel's territory. However, there are claims that the Israeli government helped strengthen Hamas to undermine Fatah, the internationally accepted Palestinian political party. The split between Hamas and Fatah in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank occurred because of their differing ideologies and approaches to dealing with Israel. Fatah is a more secular and moderate party that focused on negotiations, while Hamas believes in armed resistance. The claim that Israel boosted Hamas at the expense of Fatah is based on the argument that a divided Palestinian leadership would hinder progress in peace talks. Experts have cited evidence of Israel not following agreements with Fatah, allowing money to go to Hamas, and making comments that suggest a preference for a divided Palestinian leadership. The article also mentions Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, which some view as a peace step while others question its genuine intentions.

### [Story of Mamata and Nano: Why Tata can claim Rs 766 crore plus interest from Bengal Govt](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/story-of-mamata-and-nano-why-tata-can-claim-rs-766-crore-9007996/)

Tata Motors has been awarded a sum of Rs 765.78 crore by an arbitration tribunal as compensation for capital investment losses in the Singur manufacturing plant. The plant was set up to manufacture the Tata Nano, but protests from the TMC party forced Tata to leave. The acquisition of land for the plant ran into trouble due to protests from local people and small parties. Mamata Banerjee, who was then in opposition, led a movement against the government and went on a hunger strike. Tata Motors eventually decided to move the production of the Nano to Gujarat. Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011 and returned 400 acres of land to farmers. Tata Motors went to court and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of returning the land to its owners. After the Supreme Court order, Tata Motors entered into arbitration proceedings with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to claim compensation for their losses. The arbitration tribunal has now awarded Tata Motors a sum of Rs 765.78 crore with interest.

### [What a â€˜normalâ€™ monsoon hides](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-a-normal-monsoon-hides-9008385/)

The monsoon season in India this year had an overall rainfall of 94 percent, marking the eighth consecutive year of normal rainfall. However, there have been significant variations in the distribution of rainfall both in space and time, with some days experiencing heavy downpours and prolonged dry spells. Only 6 percent of district rain-days were found to have normal rainfall, while over 60 percent had deficits of over 60 percent or no rain at all. Additionally, climate change is believed to be increasing rainfall variability. The northeast region of India has consistently received below-normal rainfall, and this year the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal experienced significant rainfall deficits. Kerala, one of the rainiest states in the country, had the largest deficit at 34 percent. The erratic behavior of monsoon rainfall is attributed to climate change, but there are other factors at play. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the unpredictability of monsoon rainfall is expected to continue. The article suggests that preparedness for extreme weather events and strengthening climate resilience in infrastructure are necessary coping mechanisms.

### [Maratha quota protest heats up: What SC, Bombay HC have ruled on it, what steps state govt is taking](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/maratha-quota-what-sc-bombay-hc-have-said-9007855/)

The state government of Maharashtra has created a panel of three former high court judges to provide advice on the legal battle over the Maratha quota in the Supreme Court. Activist Manoj Jarange-Patil has launched a fast-unto-death protest for Maratha reservation, putting pressure on the government. The Marathas, constituting roughly 33% of the state's population, have been demanding reservation for several years. In 2018, the BJP government proposed a 16% quota, which was challenged in court. The Bombay High Court upheld the constitutional validity of the reservation but reduced it to 12% in education and 13% in government jobs. The high court relied on the findings of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, which highlighted the social and educational backwardness of the Maratha community. However, in May 2021, the Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota, as it exceeded the 50% reservation ceiling set in the court's 1992 judgment. The court stated that there were no extraordinary circumstances to justify crossing the 50% mark. The Maharashtra government has formed a new committee to study the procedure for granting Kunbi (OBC) certificates to Marathas. The state cabinet has accepted the first report of the committee and plans to file a curative petition in the apex court. Currently, the total reservation in Maharashtra is 52%, including quotas for various communities.

A 22-year-old politician from the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) named Daniel Halemba was arrested on charges of incitement and the use of symbols associated with the Nazi Party. Halemba, who was recently elected to the Bavarian state parliament, was the youngest member to be elected. He was also a member of a student fraternity that was raided by authorities last month due to suspicions of Nazi symbols and objects being present. Four other members of the fraternity are also under investigation. The AfD has been criticized for its opposition to the European Union and its stance against immigration, with some accusing the party of having neo-Nazi ideologies. However, the party has denied these claims. Despite the controversies, the AfD has seen a surge in popularity in Germany, particularly due to concerns about immigration and the economy.

### [Recalling Pegasus, the last time phones of Oppn leaders were allegedly targeted by spyware](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/recalling-pegasus-oppn-leaders-targeted-9007516/)

Several opposition leaders in India, including Shashi Tharoor and Pawan Khera of the Congress party, have received a "threat notification" from Apple warning them of a potential state-sponsored spyware attack on their iPhones. The leaders compared this alleged attack to the Pegasus malware attack that targeted activists and politicians in multiple countries two years ago. In July 2021, a global investigative project reported that the Israeli spyware called Pegasus, developed by NSO Group, may have been used to target individuals' mobile phones in India and other countries. The Indian government denied the allegations but refused to provide any evidence or explicitly deny the use of Pegasus. In October 2021, the Supreme Court appointed an Expert Committee to investigate the allegations in the Pegasus spyware case. The committee was tasked with determining who procured Pegasus, whether the petitioners were targeted, and what laws justified its use against Indian citizens. The committee's report found no conclusive evidence of Pegasus being used in the phones it examined and noted that the government did not cooperate with the panel. The court has yet to hold further hearings on the matter.

### [Why the Goa government is in the dock over notifying a tiger reserve](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/goa-mhadei-tiger-reserve-wildlife-notification-explained-9005598/)

The Goa bench of the Bombay High Court has directed the Goa government to establish a tiger reserve in Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and surrounding areas within three months. This decision came in response to a public interest litigation filed by the environmental NGO, Goa Foundation, which sought the formation of a tiger reserve as recommended by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The court also instructed the state to settle the rights and claims of Scheduled Tribes and forest dwellers within a year.

The NTCA had previously advised the state government to create a tiger reserve in the Cotigao-Mhadei forest complex, which is known for its tiger population and potential as a habitat. The proposed reserve would enhance protection and security measures, including the establishment of a Special Tiger Protection Force.

Efforts to establish the tiger reserve have faced obstacles, with local politicians encouraging encroachment and cultivation in the sanctuary. In 2022, Goa's Forest Minister stated that there were no resident tigers in Goa, raising doubts about the necessity of a tiger reserve. However, the deaths of a tigress and its cubs in 2020 led to an investigation that recommended upgrading the legal status of Mhadei WLS to that of a tiger reserve.

The Goa government argued before the court that further studies and the settlement of rights of forest dwellers were necessary before establishing the tiger reserve. They also claimed that the existing protected areas already provided sufficient protection for all wildlife, including tigers.

Despite these arguments, the court found the state's contentions inadequate, citing their failure to settle the rights and claims of forest dwellers and their non-compliance with the Supreme Court's directive. The court emphasized the need to notify the tiger reserve and ensure its conservation for the larger public interest and to reduce conflicts between humans and tigers.

As of now, the Goa government has filed an application seeking more time to implement the court's order. The Goa Foundation has also filed a contempt petition against the government for not complying with the High Court's directions.

Apple has been sending notifications to individuals in 150 countries when it suspects they are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers. The notifications advise users on how to protect themselves, including activating the 'Lockdown Mode' feature on their iPhones. Apple clarified that it does not attribute the threat notifications to any specific attacker and that false alarms are possible. State-sponsored attacks are costly, sophisticated, and designed to evade detection. Apple's system detects activity that matches certain patterns but acknowledges that its threat intelligence signals are not always perfect. The company sends out threat notifications via email and iMessage and provides additional steps for users to protect their devices and privacy. Apple recommends updating software, setting a passcode, enabling two-factor authentication, using strong passwords, downloading apps only from the App Store, and avoiding unknown sources. Lockdown Mode, available on certain devices, restricts functions to prevent attackers from accessing personal information. Apple urges users to take threat notifications seriously and follow recommended steps to secure their devices and accounts.

This article discusses the assassination of Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984. Two of her bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, fired multiple bullets at her to avenge the humiliation of Sikhs and the desecration of the Golden Temple during Operation Blue Star earlier that year. Indira's assassination led to widespread violence in India, with approximately 3,350 Sikh deaths, and 2,800 in the national capital alone. Indira had a sense of foreboding about her life being in danger following Operation Blue Star. Despite increased security measures, she insisted on keeping Sikh guards. On the day of her assassination, Beant Singh shot her in her own home while Satwant Singh fired more shots at close range. Both assassins were apprehended, and Indira's body was rushed to a hospital but she was declared dead after surgery. Following the assassination, violent communal tensions erupted in India, with mobs targeting innocent Sikhs. Indira's son, Rajiv Gandhi, became the next Prime Minister, but the violence continued for three days before the army was called in to restore peace. The article highlights that little accountability was achieved for the violence, and revenge remained a significant issue.

### [What are electoral bonds, how has govt defended them, what Supreme Court has to decide](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-electoral-bonds-hearing-explained-9006289/)

The Supreme Court of India is set to hear a group of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the country's electoral bonds scheme. The scheme, introduced in 2017, allows individuals and organizations to anonymously donate money to political parties through interest-free "bearer instruments." These bonds can only be purchased during specific periods and are intended to bring transparency to political funding. However, critics argue that they undermine transparency and enable corruption. The court has previously ordered some safeguards, but the larger constitutional challenge is still pending. The case will now be heard by a five-judge bench. The petitioners not only challenge the electoral bonds scheme but also seek to declare political parties as public offices and subject them to the Right to Information Act. The Election Commission of India has raised concerns about the amendment exempting political parties from disclosing donations received through electoral bonds. The Attorney General, representing the government, argues that the scheme promotes clean money and confidentiality for contributors while adhering to tax obligations.

### [What the rapid ice melt in West Antarctica means](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ice-sheet-melt-west-antarctica-9006179/)

A new study published in the journal Nature has found that the rapid melting of West Antarctica's ice sheet is now inevitable, regardless of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The melting of the ice sheet would raise global sea levels by 5.3 meters or 17.4 feet, posing a significant threat to coastal cities worldwide, including those in India. Even under the best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the water around West Antarctica will continue to warm three times faster than in the 20th century, leading to increased melting of the ice sheet. The study highlights the importance of mitigating the impacts of climate change, as the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet is just one contributor to rising sea levels.

During his keynote address at the Goa Maritime Conclave, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh highlighted the importance of collaboration and trust between countries in international relations. He referred to the concept of "Prisoner's Dilemma" to explain the strategic decision-making challenges faced by countries. The Prisoner's Dilemma is a game in Game Theory that demonstrates how individuals or entities behave under different circumstances and aims to achieve the best outcome. Singh emphasized the need to find solutions that promote cooperation, build trust, and mitigate the risks associated with the Prisoner's Dilemma situations. The article provides examples of how this concept applies to scenarios such as an arms race between countries or competition between companies in the market. It concludes by suggesting that countries should establish ground rules in geopolitics to avoid detrimental consequences for their economies and people.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh spoke about the concept of "Prisoner's Dilemma" during his keynote address at the Goa Maritime Conclave. He explained that this concept can be applied to international relations to understand situations where countries face strategic decision-making challenges. Singh emphasized the need for countries to collaborate and build trust instead of engaging in an arms race out of fear and mistrust. Prisoner's Dilemma is a popular game in Game Theory that helps understand how people or entities behave under different circumstances. It highlights the paradox of whether to confess or stay silent in a situation where two prisoners are questioned about a crime. The best outcome lies in cooperation, but the dilemma has real-life applications in international law and business, such as setting ground rules to avoid an arms race or agreeing on prices to ensure healthy profits.

Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the age of the moon, finding that it is older than previously thought. A new study used a technology called atom probe tomography to analyze crystals from a lunar sample collected 51 years ago. They found that the moon formed about 4.46 billion years ago, within the first 110 million years of the birth of our solar system. This research challenges previous estimates and provides valuable information about the formation of the earth-moon system. The study highlights the importance of nanoscale spatial resolution in understanding big-picture questions about the universe. The age of the moon, at 4.46 billion years, puts it only slightly younger than the estimated age of the earth.

The article discusses the concept of industrialization in underdeveloped countries with surplus labor populations, as proposed by economist William Arthur Lewis. Lewis argued that a growing manufacturing sector could absorb the surplus labor from agriculture and other subsistence sectors by offering higher wages. However, the model has not played out as expected in India. While the share of employment in agriculture has decreased, it has not been replaced by significant growth in manufacturing. Instead, most new jobs have been created in low-paid services and construction. The movement of labor has mainly occurred within subsistence sectors rather than a shift to capitalist sectors. The exception is Gujarat, where a significant proportion of the workforce is employed in manufacturing. However, even in Gujarat, the proportion of workers in agriculture is still high compared to other states. The article suggests that the traditional model of labor transition from agriculture to industry needs to be rethought due to increasing capital-intensive manufacturing and technological advancements. NITI Aayog, an Indian government think tank, is exploring new economic development models that focus on creating remunerative jobs related to agriculture but outside the farm, such as in processing, packaging, transportation, and retailing of agricultural produce or supplying inputs and services to farmers.

Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has urged Patil to prioritize his health and trust in the government's commitment to reservation. The Maratha reservation issue gained momentum in 2016 after the alleged rape and killing of a teenage girl from the community. The MKM's demands also include action against the perpetrators of the crime, higher remuneration for farmers, and loan waivers. The MKM emphasizes peaceful protests and aims to achieve justice for the Maratha community.

Former head of Hamas, Khaled Mashal, virtually addressed a pro-Palestine rally in Kerala's Malappuram, calling for unity for Gaza. He spoke about the ongoing conflict in the region and criticized Israel for demolishing houses, churches, temples, universities, and UN institutions. Mashal was born in the West Bank town of Silwad in 1956 and became a member of Hamas, a militant organization that used violence for the cause of Palestine. He headed Hamas's Politburo from 1996 to 2017 and currently leads the group's 'external' politburo based in Qatar. Mashal echoed Hamas's opposition to Israel but stated in a 2017 document that they accepted the idea of a Palestinian state within the territories occupied by Israel in the Six-day War of 1967. He also discussed the possibility of negotiating with Israel when they are strong enough to create a reality that forces Israel to reconsider its positions. Mashal has called for unity against Israel following recent attacks and counter-attacks between Hamas and Israel. He was targeted in an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997, which led to a crisis between Jordan and Israel.

### [India bans exports of some rice varieties: How this has impacted prices globally, in the country](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-bans-exports-of-some-rice-explained-9004685/)

According to an article from The Indian Express, India banned the export of non-basmati white rice in July 2023 due to depleting public stock, elevated cereal prices, and the threat of an uneven monsoon. The First Advance Estimates of major Kharif crops for 2023-24, released by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmersâ€™ Welfare, showed a 3.7% decrease in rice production compared to the previous year [[SOURCE 1]].

The ban on non-basmati white rice exports led to a sharp increase in rice prices across markets. Although prices have come down since then, they are still higher than the pre-ban period. The impact of India's export restrictions on rice supply, availability, and prices has been felt both domestically and globally [[SOURCE 1]].

Despite the export ban, there has been no respite from the increase in domestic rice prices. The daily average wholesale price of rice on October 24, 2023, was 27.43% higher than a month ago. The daily average retail price of rice on the same day was 12.59% higher than a year ago [[SOURCE 1]].

India is the largest exporter of rice in the world, accounting for about 40% of total rice exports in 2022. Rice exports from India are broadly categorized into basmati and non-basmati rice. While the ban applies to non-basmati white rice and broken rice, there is no ban on other sub-categories of rice [[SOURCE 1]].

In the financial year 2022-23, India exported 45.61 lakh metric tonnes of basmati rice to various countries, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, and Yemen being the top destinations. For non-basmati rice, India exported 177.91 lakh metric tonnes, with Benin, Madagascar, and Kenya being the top buyers. The ban on non-basmati white rice and broken rice exports has significantly affected the quantity of rice shipped out and the number of countries importing from India [[SOURCE 1]].

The article also provides information on other categories of rice exports, such as par-boiled rice, husked (brown) rice, rice in husk of seed quality, and other rice in husk. It mentions the quantities exported and the top importing countries for each category [[SOURCE 1]].

In terms of rice procurement and requirement, the total production of rice during 2022-23 is estimated to be 1357.55 lakh tonnes, which is higher than the previous year's production. The government has been procuring paddy from various states for the Kharif marketing season. The total rice stock in the Central Pool as of October 1, 2023, is 221.87 lakh metric tonnes [[SOURCE 1]].

In summary, India's ban on the export of non-basmati white rice has had a significant impact on rice prices both domestically and globally. Despite the ban, domestic rice prices have continued to rise. India remains a major player in the global rice market, with significant exports of basmati and non-basmati rice.

### [Why new tax filing data shows better compliance, upward mobility in higher-income slabs](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-new-tax-filing-data-shows-9004515/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.According to the latest income tax returns statistics released by the Income Tax Department, there has been wider compliance and a shift in taxpayers towards higher-income slabs from lower-income slabs. In the assessment year 2021-22, a total of 6.75 crore taxpayers filed income tax returns, which is a rise of 5.6% from the previous year. Additionally, around 2.1 crore taxpayers paid taxes but did not file returns. The data also shows that the share of taxpayers paying nil tax has increased over the years, reaching 66% in the assessment year 2021-22. However, the proportionate contribution of gross total income of the top 1% individual taxpayers has decreased from 15.9% in the assessment year 2013-14 to 14.6% in the assessment year 2021-22.

The income tax statistics also reveal that the highest rate of growth for salaried individual taxpayers was seen in the income slabs of Rs 15-20 lakh and Rs 20-25 lakh in the financial year 2020-21. On the other hand, the lower-income slabs of Rs 10-15 lakh and Rs 5-10 lakh recorded lower growth rates. It is worth noting that the financial year 2020-21 was affected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The data further shows that around 67,970 individuals in India disclosed salary income over Rs 1 crore in the assessment year 2021-22, which is an increase of 3.9% from the previous year. Out of these individuals, 16 had a salary between Rs 100-500 crore.

Overall, the income tax returns statistics indicate a positive trend of migration to higher ranges of gross total income among individual taxpayers. However, concerns remain about the significant number of taxpayers who pay taxes but do not file returns

### [An Expert Explains | 10 years of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative: The project, its aims and where it stands now](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/expert-explains-10-years-chinas-bri-xi-jinping-status-explained-9004356/)

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a decade-old infrastructure funding project initiated by China's President Xi Jinping. It aims to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through investments worth billions of dollars. The BRI initially consisted of the Silk Road Economic 'Belt' and the sea trade infrastructure called 'Road'. Over time, it expanded to include six international Economic Corridors.

Criticism has been raised regarding the sustainability of the debts incurred by BRI projects. Some countries, such as India and the United States, have accused China of engaging in 'debt trap diplomacy' by aiming to acquire assets if loan repayment becomes impossible.

Despite the criticism, the BRI has attracted significant participation from over 150 countries and 30 international organizations. Currently, more than 3,000 BRI projects valued at $1 trillion are underway globally.

The article highlights concerns about transparency, debt traps, and sustainability of BRI projects. It also discusses the evolving perceptions of the European Union (EU) and the United States towards the initiative. While the EU initially viewed the BRI positively, growing apprehensions have led to a reassessment of the relationship with China.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship BRI project, strengthening the strategic partnership between China and Pakistan. Despite concerns about its long-term impact on Pakistan's economy, it is unlikely that Pakistan will abandon the CPEC.

India has consistently expressed reservations about the BRI due to sovereignty-related issues and geopolitical implications. China's expanding economic presence in South Asia, including investments in ports, has concerned Indian policymakers.

Geopolitical tensions, particularly the measures taken by the US and Europe to reduce economic dependence on China, could impact the Chinese economy and the expansion of the BRI. Consequently, China may need to re-strategize some of its BRI projects.

Despite criticism, the BRI has given China diplomatic and geopolitical leverage within the Global South. Western countries are still searching for alternatives to BRI in terms of infrastructure investments.

In response to the challenging geopolitical and economic landscape, China is adjusting its ambitions and focusing on green and smaller-scale development projects. The success of other China-led initiatives, such as the Global Security Initiative and the Global Development Initiative, largely depends on the BRI's success.

### [Kerala blast: Who are Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/kerala-blast-kills-one-who-are-jehovahs-witnesses-9004346/)

Two people were killed and several others injured in a series of blasts at a Jehovah's Witnesses prayer convention near Kochi. The incident occurred at the Zamra International Convention and Exhibition Centre, where around 2,500 faithful had gathered for a prayer session. A man named Dominic Martin, an estranged member of Jehovah's Witnesses, claimed responsibility for the attack in a video posted on social media. He stated that he believed the sect's teachings were anti-national and wanted them to change their ideology. Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian sect that does not believe in the Holy Trinity and worships Jehovah as the one true God. They base their beliefs solely on the Bible and do not celebrate Christmas or Easter. The sect is known for its evangelical work and believes that the end of the world is near. In India, Jehovah's Witnesses have faced legal challenges regarding their refusal to sing the national anthem or participate in certain activities due to their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has granted protection to members of the sect in cases involving their right to freedom of religion.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are expanding their ground activity in the Gaza Strip as part of their plan to destroy Hamas. However, it remains unclear how Israel will handle the post-conflict phase if they succeed in eliminating Hamas. General David Petraeus, a former CIA director and top US general, warned Israel against making mistakes in planning for the post-conflict phase, citing the US's own mistakes in Iraq. He emphasized the importance of having a vision for the future of Gaza and the Palestinian people after Hamas is destroyed. Petraeus also cautioned that Israel's bombing campaign and land invasion could lead to a situation similar to the battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993. The military engagement between Israel and Hamas could have serious economic consequences for the region and the world, particularly if it escalates into a full-scale war involving regional powers like Iran. A direct conflict between Iran and Israel could push crude oil prices above $150 per barrel, leading to global inflation and slower economic growth. Even a regional conflict confined to the Gaza Strip could have negative impacts on the global economy as it emerges from multiple shocks.

India's abstention at the UN General Assembly on the resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza reflects its attempt to address competing priorities in the ongoing conflict. India joined Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom in abstaining. The resolution, proposed by Jordan and supported by Arab countries, called for a humanitarian truce and unhindered humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip. France voted in favor of the resolution but expressed regret that it did not address terrorist attacks by Hamas. Israel, the United States, and four Eastern European countries voted against the resolution. Canada proposed an amendment to hold Hamas responsible, but it was not adopted. UN General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but the resolution carries moral authority. India's stance aligns with its approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, using diplomatic tools to maintain a balancing act. India's explanation of vote emphasizes its support for Israel regarding attacks on its civilians and concern for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The SIM swap scam is a growing problem in Delhi, India, where fraudsters steal personal information and use it to obtain duplicate SIM cards. The scam involves fraudsters taking personal details through phishing or vishing techniques, then posing as the victim at a mobile operator's retail outlet to report a fake theft of the victim's SIM card. With a duplicate SIM, the fraudsters can receive banking authorization messages and OTPs (one-time passwords) to initiate transactions and steal money from victims' bank accounts. Victims often receive multiple missed calls from the fraudsters to distract them and make them ignore their phones. The stolen money is typically routed through different channels, including conversion to cryptocurrency, making it difficult for police to track. To protect against this scam, individuals should be cautious about sharing personal information and regularly check their bank alerts and messages.

The article discusses the murder of a Swiss national named Nina Berger in West Delhi. Berger's body was found decomposing behind a school, with her hands and legs chained and bruises all over. A businessman named Gurpreet, who was reportedly Berger's scorned lover, has been arrested for the crime. However, Berger's family in Zurich has not physically identified the body, putting the burden of evidence solely on Gurpreet. The family has given consent for a postmortem to be carried out in their absence. The article explores the complications that arise when dealing with the murder of foreign nationals and how the police handle such cases. It explains the process of verifying the victim's identity and informing their next of kin through the embassy. In cases where the body remains unidentified, the police generally wait for a few weeks before disposing of it as per the standard procedure. Berger's family has provided circumstantial evidence but has refused to come to Delhi to physically identify the body and cooperate with the investigation. One possible option to identify the body is through DNA testing or by seeking information from the family in Switzerland. The article emphasizes the importance of physical identification in building a case but also highlights the role of circumstantial evidence in proving the case before courts. The police will rely on other material collected to confirm the deceased's identity and states that if the family wants to join the investigation or take Berger's remains back home, they will be given a piece of cloth or ashes, depending on the chosen method of disposal.

The Jammu & Kashmir administration is facing a power crisis as its power projects are generating less electricity due to a dry spell in summer. Currently, J&K only generates 3,263 MW of electricity from 21 power projects, compared to its identified power generation potential of 16,475 MW. The deficit in power supply is about 500 MW, with a requirement of about 2,600 MW of electricity. The administration is taking steps to address the issue, such as purchasing an additional 700 MW of electricity at a higher cost and promoting the use of ad cables to prevent theft. Efforts are also being made to install meters in all areas to minimize power cuts. The administration has approved a green energy corridor project that will reduce J&K's dependence on hydropower.

### [Why Jharkhand govt has approved a new Rs 1,600 crore housing scheme](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/jharkhand-govt-abua-awas-yojana-housing-9003294/)

The Jharkhand Cabinet has approved the 'Abua Awas Yojna' (AAY), a housing scheme for the poor in the state. The scheme aims to provide eight lakh pucca houses to the homeless with a budget of Rs 1,6320 crore. It will be implemented in three phases, targeting two lakh houses in the current financial year, 3.5 lakh houses in FY 2024-25, and 2.5 lakh houses in FY 2025-26. The scheme was needed because existing government schemes have been unable to cover all eligible beneficiaries. The state government found that around eight lakh eligible beneficiaries had been left out of housing schemes due to discrepancies in the database. Despite repeated requests to the central government, these beneficiaries were not added to the list. Therefore, the state decided to create its own housing scheme. Under the AAY, beneficiaries will receive a three-room and one kitchen house with a total area of 31 sq m. The government has allocated Rs 2 lakh per beneficiary, to be disbursed in four installments. There is also a provision for beneficiaries to work under the MGNREGS and receive wages for building the house. Additionally, a toilet can be added to the house using funds from the Swaccha Bharat Mission or other available schemes. All houses built under the AAY will be registered in the name of women in the beneficiary families. The scheme will benefit people belonging to six categories, and a list of beneficiaries will be prepared based on specific criteria.

Eight retired veterans of the Indian Navy, who were working for an Omani private defense consultancy called Dahra Global, have been sentenced to death by a Qatari court. The reasons for their arrest and death penalty have not been made public, but there is speculation that they may have been involved in espionage for a foreign state. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has expressed shock at the verdict and is exploring all legal options. The article provides some background information on each of the eight men, including their previous positions and accomplishments in the Indian Navy. One of them is the son of a retired army officer and served on India's second aircraft carrier. Another received commendations from the commander-in-chief twice and worked briefly at Hindustan Shipyard after retiring. Another veteran, who was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award, trained Singapore naval personnel before moving to Qatar. Two of the veterans specialized in navigation, one in communications, and one in gunnery, while one was a sailor.

### [Why is Qatar playing mediator between the US and Hamas?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/qatars-unique-position-middle-east-9002487/)

Qatar has played a crucial role in facilitating the release of hostages held by Hamas, including the recent release of an American-Israeli mother-daughter pair. The United States has expressed gratitude to Qatar for its involvement in these efforts. Qatar is a small country in the Persian Gulf and is both a close ally of the United States and known to have ties with Hamas. This unique position allows Qatar to act as a mediator in conflicts and as a proxy for the US and other Western countries when direct engagement is not possible. Qatar's geopolitical dynamics have changed significantly over the years due to factors such as its booming economy fueled by natural gas reserves, its increasing closeness with the US, and the ascension of Sheikh Hamad to power. Qatar has also asserted its independence in the international arena, maintaining relations with Iran and providing support to actors opposed to certain Arab governments during the Arab Spring. However, Qatar's actions have led to tensions with neighboring Arab states, resulting in a trade and diplomatic embargo in 2017. Despite this, Qatar remains a significant player in the region due to its natural gas reserves and its hosting of the largest American base in the Middle East.

### [The centrality of natural gas in ties between India and Qatar](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/natural-gas-lng-india-qatar-relations-9002396/)

The article discusses the death sentence given to eight former personnel of the Indian Navy by a court in Qatar and its implications on the India-Qatar relationship. It highlights the significant trade imbalance between the two countries, with imports from Qatar outweighing India's exports. The trade between India and Qatar is heavily dominated by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which accounts for over half of India's overall import volumes of the fuel. India's import dependency on natural gas is around 50%, and with the government's aim to increase natural gas consumption, imports are expected to rise in the future. Qatar holds a significant leverage in the trade relationship due to its dominance in the LNG market.

India's largest LNG importer, Petronet LNG, has a long-term contract with Qatar for the import of 8.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG. India has set an ambitious target to increase the share of natural gas in its primary energy mix, which will result in further growth in LNG imports. Natural gas is seen as a cleaner alternative to conventional petroleum fuels and is cheaper than crude oil. Given India's energy security concerns and ambitions, the case of the retired navy personnel presents a sensitive challenge for Indian diplomacy.

In FY2022-23, India's total imports from Qatar were valued at $16.81 billion, with LNG imports accounting for 49.5% of the total. India's other major imports from Qatar include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), plastics, and petrochemicals. On the other hand, India's exports to Qatar were valued at just $1.97 billion in the same period. India imported 10.74 million tonnes of LNG from Qatar, representing 54% of the total LNG imports. Despite efforts to diversify sourcing, it may take several years to reduce the reliance on Qatar for LNG imports.

The global LNG market has become a seller's market due to disruptions in Russian natural gas supplies to Europe. The spot LNG market is prone to price volatility, while term contracts provide a more stable and reasonable price. Qatar, as the world's largest exporter of LNG, holds a strong position in the market. Many countries, including India, are looking to secure long-term contracts with major suppliers like Qatar. The article also mentions that the global LNG market may eventually turn into a buyer's market due to new LNG export projects, but this is still years away.

Overall, the article highlights the significance of the India-Qatar trade relationship, especially in terms of LNG imports, and the challenges India faces in diversifying its energy sources and reducing reliance on Qatar.

West Bengal Forest Minister Jyotipriya Mallick has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his alleged involvement in the state's Public Distribution System (PDS) scam. The scam involves the illegal distribution of rice and wheat, where Mallick and businessman Bakibur Rahman are said to be involved. Rahman would supply lesser quantities of grains to distributors, who would then sell them at lower prices to the poor. The remaining balance would be sold in the open market for profit. The ED had previously arrested Rahman and conducted search operations at various locations connected to him. This PDS scam is one of several alleged scams involving the Trinamool Congress (TMC) party in West Bengal, including cases related to recruitment, smuggling, and coal. The ED document reveals details about the scam, stating that mill owners collected money from the government for selling grains but supplied lesser quantities. The profit from this mismatch in distribution was divided between suppliers, mill owners, government officials, and the Minister's office. Irregularities in the PDS distribution were first flagged during the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020, leading to protests and criticism from both the Central government and West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. The West Bengal government denied these allegations but faced mounting troubles as evidence emerged.

Former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has died at the age of 68 after suffering a heart attack. Li was a longtime member of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) standing committee of the politburo, the highest policy-making body in the country. He served as premier for a decade before being ousted from the politburo in 2022. Despite his ouster and reduced role in recent years, Li was involved in major aspects of Chinese policy and had a unique position among other Chinese leaders due to his academic background and ability to communicate in English. Li was known for championing the opening up of the Chinese economy and was involved in economic policy. However, his influence and power declined under President Xi Jinping, who consolidated power and sidelined Li's faction within the CCP. Li's tenure also saw criticism, including questions about his performance during his provincial governorships and a public perception of "bad luck." Despite his efforts, the concentration of power under Xi limited Li's ability to enact economic reforms. Li will likely be remembered for his concern for the welfare of ordinary people, but also for what could have been.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has instructed credit information companies (CICs) to notify customers via SMS or email when their Credit Information Report (CIR) is accessed by banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Additionally, banks and NBFCs must send alerts to customers when they submit information on default or Days Past Due (DPD) on existing credit. These new rules will be implemented within six months. CICs collect and analyze credit information from banks and NBFCs to calculate credit scores for individuals and credit ranks for companies. A high credit score increases the chances of obtaining a loan at a favorable rate, while a low score may result in loan denial. The RBI has also mandated that CICs provide individuals with a free full credit report, including credit score, once a year. Customers can apply for data correction if they believe their information is incorrect, and CICs must inform customers of the reasons for data correction rejections. CICs should conduct periodic reviews of their search and match logic algorithm and disclose complaint details on their websites.

It mentions the potential impact on regional dynamics, including the normalisation process between Saudi Arabia and Israel. India's position in the conflict is discussed, as it has relationships with both Israel and Arab countries in the region. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of India's diplomatic efforts in maintaining its relationships and ensuring the well-being of its diaspora and energy security.

The Indian Hospice in Jerusalem has a long history dating back to the 12th century.

The lodge within the hospice, known as Zawiya Al-Hindiya, has retained its association with India despite changing rulers. In the early 20th century, the lodge underwent renovations and repairs with the help of Muslim patrons from India. After India gained independence, the lodge sought official recognition from the Indian embassy in Egypt. Today, the Indian Hospice continues to serve as a sanctuary for travelers and pilgrims from India and hosts various organizations within its premises. The property is owned by the Waqf Board of India and is accessible only to individuals of Indian citizenship or heritage.

Eight former Indian Navy personnel have been sentenced to death by a court in Qatar. The reasons for their arrest and the awarding of the death penalty are not known, and their families were not informed of the charges against them. The case poses a significant diplomatic challenge for the Indian government. The veterans were working at a defense services provider company owned by an Omani national, who was also arrested but later released. The company had connections to the Qatari Emiri Naval Force, but its new website does not mention this or the former Navy officers who held leadership roles. The arrested men had been working at the company for several years before their arrests. The charges against them were never made public, but they were put in solitary confinement, leading to speculation of a security-related offense. India and Qatar have had friendly relations for many years, with strong trade and defense cooperation ties. This incident is the second major challenge to the relationship in recent years, following a controversy over derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad made by a BJP spokesperson. The news of the death penalty comes at a time when tensions are high in the Middle East due to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, and Qatar is playing a role as a mediator in the crisis.

Dozens of US states have filed a lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, alleging that the tech giant has contributed to the youth mental health crisis. The attorneys general of 33 states, including California and New York, claim that Meta repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of its platforms and intentionally encouraged young people to engage in addictive and compulsive social media use. The lawsuit comes two years after former Meta employee Frances Haugen blew the whistle on the company, revealing an internal study that showed many young girls on Instagram suffering from depression and anxiety related to body image issues. The lawsuit specifically mentions features such as likes, alerts, and filters, which are known to promote body dysmorphia in young users. Meta has denied the allegations and expressed disappointment that the attorneys general chose to pursue legal action instead of collaborating with the industry to establish clearer standards for apps used by teens. Haugen's testimony to Congress and internal documents she released have also been cited in the lawsuit, which highlights the negative impact of Instagram on teenagers' mental health. The research on social media's adverse effects, including increased levels of anxiety and depression, has been well-documented.

### [Three reasons why Israel has still not launched its ground offensive into Gaza](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/reasons-israel-not-launched-ground-offensive-gaza-9000202/)

Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has stated that the country will launch a ground offensive into Gaza following an air offensive by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). However, there are several reasons why Israel has not yet initiated a full-scale ground invasion. Firstly, the US administration under President Joe Biden has reportedly advised Israel to delay the invasion in order to strategize and prevent excessive loss of civilian lives. The US has requested time to complete preparations for a broader conflict, including deploying air defense systems in the Gulf and sending an aircraft carrier and marines. Additionally, there are over 200 hostages being held in unknown locations in Gaza, making it unlikely that Israel could rescue all of them by force. The delay in the ground offensive may be an attempt to negotiate for more hostage releases before launching a military operation. Furthermore, Gaza's extensive network of underground tunnels poses a challenge for Israeli forces. These tunnels house Hamas command centers, stockpile weapons, and potentially hold hostages. Previous attempts to bomb the tunnels have been unsuccessful. The IDF is concerned about endangering the safety of hostages if they strike the tunnel network. The complexity of eliminating Hamas' infrastructure in Gaza is another factor holding Israel back. Former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter suggests that many of the reservists called up by Israel are not combat-ready and may not be prepared for a conventional ground battle against Hamas. There is also concern about Hezbollah opening a front in southern Lebanon simultaneously with a conflict in Gaza, which would strain Israel's resources and manpower. Iran has warned that it could get involved if the situation worsens in Gaza. Reports of civilian casualties could also escalate Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, requiring Israel to allocate additional forces and resources to contain it. Finally, even if Israel were successful in eliminating Hamas from Gaza, it would be challenging to administer the territory long-term as successors to Hamas may be even more radical and extremist.

The Indian government has introduced the Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR), a special ID system for all students in India. Under this initiative, each student will receive a lifelong APAAR ID, which will track their academic progress from pre-primary education to higher education. APAAR will also serve as a gateway to Digilocker, a digital system where students can store important documents and achievements. The goal of APAAR is to make education hassle-free and reduce the need for physical documents. It aims to reduce fraud and duplicate certificates by providing a single, trusted reference for educational institutions. Every individual will have a unique APAAR ID linked to the Academic Bank Credit (ABC), which stores information about the credits earned by students. When a student changes schools, their data in the ABC will be transferred to the new school using the APAAR ID, eliminating the need for physical documents. To sign up for APAAR, students will need to provide basic information and their Aadhar number for verification. The government assures that the information shared will be kept confidential and only used for educational purposes. Registration for APAAR is voluntary, not mandatory.

BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai will appear before the ethics committee of Lok Sabha on Thursday in connection with Dubey's accusation against Trinamool Congress member Mahua Moitra. Dubey alleged that Moitra accepted bribes to ask questions in parliament that targeted the Adani group. The allegations were based on information provided by Dehadrai and confirmed by real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani. Hiranandani issued a sworn affidavit stating that Moitra gave him her parliament login and password to post questions on her behalf. The question at hand is whether Moitra asked questions in return for consideration and if there is illegal gratification involved. If established, this could be a serious breach of privilege and contempt of the house. The matter should have been referred to the privileges committee, which is responsible for addressing breaches of privilege and contempt of the house. The ethics committee typically deals with questions of propriety but not alleged breaches of privilege. The committee will call the parties involved, including the complainant, witnesses, and Moitra, who has the right to cross-examine the complainant. The committee can recommend suspension, but it does not have executive powers. Its recommendations will go before the house for a decision, which can accept or modify the punishment. If a member is expelled, they can challenge it based on unconstitutionality, gross illegality, or denial of natural justice. The court's intervention in such cases is limited.

### [LS Ethics Committee: its constitution, members](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ls-ethics-committee-its-constitution-members-8999613/)

The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee, responsible for handling complaints against members of parliament, last met on July 27, 2021. The committee, which was established over twenty years ago, mostly deals with relatively minor offenses. The members of the committee are appointed by the Speaker for a one-year term, and it is currently headed by Vinod Kumar Sonkar from the BJP. Other members include representatives from various political parties. The idea of ethics panels for both houses was proposed in 1996, and the Rajya Sabha ethics committee was formed in 1997. The Lok Sabha ethics committee was recommended during the 13th Lok Sabha and became a permanent part of the house in 2015. In 2005, motions were adopted to expel several MPs accused of accepting money for asking questions in parliament. The BJP demanded that the report be sent to the privileges committee so that the MPs could defend themselves. Any person can file a complaint against an MP, accompanied by evidence and an affidavit. The committee only entertains complaints that involve misconduct by MPs and conducts a preliminary inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. After evaluating a complaint, the committee presents its report to the Speaker for consideration. The work of the ethics committee and privileges committee often overlap, with more serious accusations typically going to the privileges committee. The privileges committee's role is to protect the freedom, authority, and dignity of parliament. The ethics committee specifically addresses cases of misconduct by MPs.

### [What is Cubism â€” and how Braque and Picasso invented it](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/what-is-cubism-braque-picasso-8999424/)

Pablo Picasso, a renowned Spanish artist, was born on October 25, 1881. He is known for his extensive body of work, which includes paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics. Picasso, along with French painter George Braque, invented Cubism, a revolutionary art movement that emerged in 1907 and lasted until 1914. Cubism rejected traditional approaches to art and instead focused on depicting objects from multiple viewpoints. It was not about creating cubes, despite its name. The movement had a significant impact on the art world, inspiring other non-representational art movements like Surrealism. Picasso and Braque drew inspiration from French artist Paul CÃ©zanne, who represented nature using geometric shapes. Cubism also reflected the scientific and technological advancements of the early 20th century, with artists discussing concepts like the fourth dimension. Cubism developed in two phases: analytical cubism, characterized by muted tones and multiple viewpoints, and synthetic cubism, which incorporated real-life objects and brighter colors.

### [The story of the Osage Indiansâ€™ murders, subject of Scorseseâ€™s Killers of the Flower Moon](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/osage-indians-murders-killers-of-the-flower-moon-8999410/)

The article discusses the historical events surrounding the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe in Oklahoma, during the 1920s. After oil was discovered on their land, members of the tribe were murdered, leading to the formation of the FBI. The killings exposed the exploitation of Native American resources by white settlers. The upcoming film "Killers of the Flower Moon" tells this story based on David Grann's book. The Osage were forced to give up their territory and move to Kansas before being allocated a reservation in northeastern Oklahoma. The land they moved to had significant oil deposits, which made the Osage wealthy. However, they were not fully in control of their finances due to a system of financial guardians mandated by law. The article focuses on Mollie Burkhart's family, whose members were targeted for their headrights to the oil deposits. Investigations into the murders were initially unsuccessful until an FBI agent named Tom White connected them to William K Hale. Eventually, a law was passed to prevent non-Osage individuals from inheriting headrights. Many believe that the death toll among the Osage was much higher than officially reported.

The 2022 Social Science committee of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in India has suggested that the country should be called "Bharat" in all Social Science textbooks up to Class 12. The committee's chairman, Prof CI Issac, hopes that this change will be implemented in the next academic year, pending approval from the NCERT. The debate about the nation's name has been ongoing, and it gained attention during the G20 Summit when the invitation for the dinner hosted by the President mentioned "The President of Bharat" instead of "President of India." The name "Bharat" has roots in ancient literature and is associated with the land between the sea in the south and the abode of snow in the north. The name "Hindustan" also has historical significance, derived from the Persian cognate form of the Sanskrit word "Sindhu." Over time, the name "India" became more commonly used, especially during British colonial rule. The adoption of "India" as the primary name for the country in the Constitution of India was not without debate, with some arguing for "Bharat" or "Bharatvarsha" instead. Ultimately, the committee adopted the name "India, that is, Bharat."

The alleged suicide of Balwinder Kaur, an unemployed assistant professor in Punjab, has sparked a political controversy. Kaur blamed disputes at home and state education minister Harjot Singh Bains for the stress caused by not getting a job despite being selected as an assistant professor. Kaur was a member of a union of unemployed teachers who have been protesting against the government. Farmer unions and opposition parties have joined their cause, demanding Bains's arrest. The police have booked Kaur's husband and father-in-law for mental cruelty and abetment to suicide. The controversy stems from 1,158 appointments made under the previous government that were later struck down by the High Court as unconstitutional. The recruitment process was challenged in court, with petitioners alleging that it was done hastily for political reasons and violated guidelines. The court ultimately quashed the entire recruitment process. Protesters are demanding justice for Kaur and immediate postings, while the government has challenged the High Court order. The next hearing is scheduled for November 29.

### [The benefits that Agniveers get, compared with those of regular soldiers](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/agniveers-regular-soldiers-benefits-agnipath-8999008/)

The death of a 22-year-old Agniveer deployed on the Siachen glacier has raised concerns about the Agnipath scheme, a contractual recruitment program for the armed forces in India. The scheme, introduced last year, allows recruits to serve for four years with the possibility of joining the services on a regular basis afterward. However, there are criticisms regarding the lack of benefits provided under the scheme, such as gratuity and pensionary benefits. The government introduced the scheme to address the suspension of recruitments due to the Covid-19 pandemic and to bring down defense pension bills. Agniveers receive a monthly remuneration of Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 and are entitled to risk and hardship allowances. They also contribute to a Seva Nidhi package, which provides financial support upon completion of four years. However, unlike regular soldiers, Agniveers do not receive a pension post-retirement and have limited benefits for their families in case of death or disability. The article highlights the disparities between regular soldiers and Agniveers in terms of salary, insurance coverage, gratuity, and education allowances.

### [Why the IDF will struggle to â€˜neutraliseâ€™ Gazaâ€™s tunnels](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/idf-neutralise-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-8998837/)

The article discusses the challenge that Israeli forces would face in a ground invasion of Gaza due to the extensive network of tunnels controlled by Hamas. The tunnels, which are approximately 500 km in length and up to 70 m underground, serve various purposes such as smuggling essential items into Gaza and transporting weaponry for Hamas. The tunnels also function as defensive and offensive structures for military operations against Israel. Locating and eliminating these tunnels is a difficult task, as they are often found through human detective work rather than surveillance technology. Additionally, fighting inside the tunnels poses risks for Israeli soldiers, and using bunker-buster bombs could result in collateral damage due to Gaza's dense population. Despite Israel's efforts, it is unlikely that the entire tunnel network would be destroyed.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has approved a new AC and DC combined charging connector standard for light electric vehicles (LEVs) in India. This standard, called ISI7017 (Part 2 / Sec 7): 2023, is the first in the world to combine AC and DC charging for LEVs. It was developed through collaboration among NITI Aayog, the Department of Science and Technology, Ather Energy, and other government and industry stakeholders. The new standard aims to address the issue of multiple charging standards used by different EV makers in India, which makes it difficult for public charging stations to cater to all types of EVs. While the new standard is a step towards interoperability and addressing range anxiety, it does not mandate EV makers to use a uniform standard. In comparison, countries like China have a national standard (GB/T) for EV charging connectors, while Europe uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) as its predominant standard. The US does not have a national standard but some collaboration between EV makers has taken place. Japan uses the CHAdeMO charging standard.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has approved a new charging connector standard for light electric vehicles (LEVs) in India. The standard, called ISI7017 (Part 2 / Sec 7): 2023, is the first in the world to combine alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) charging for LEVs.

The new standard aims to address the issue of multiple charging standards used by different EV makers in India, which makes it difficult for public charging stations to cater to all types of EVs. However, the standard is not mandatory for EV makers to use, which means that different charging standards may still be used, contributing to range anxiety and hindering the adoption of EVs. In contrast, countries like China, the United States, Europe, and Japan have their own national or regional charging connector standards in place.

The Telangana government's use of its stringent preventive detention law is being questioned by the Supreme Court ahead of the Assembly polls next month. The law allows for the detention of individuals by the state without trial or conviction, based solely on suspicion. Preventive detention can last up to a year unless extended. Unlike pre-trial detention, preventive detention can be used as a measure even if no crime has been committed. India's constitution allows for preventive detention under Article 22, despite its emphasis on individual liberty. Several states in India also have similar preventive detention laws. The article explains the provisions and safeguards under Article 22 for preventive detention, including the role of advisory boards and the right of the detainee to challenge the detention order in court. However, the scope of judicial review for preventive detention is limited, as the constitution prioritizes the state's subjective satisfaction over fundamental rights. Courts often strike down detention orders on technical grounds.

### [Why Mumbai is witnessing more poor air quality days](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-mumbai-is-witnessing-more-poor-air-quality-days-8998070/)

The air quality in Mumbai during the winter months is deteriorating, similar to what has been happening in Delhi for the past decade. Previously, Mumbai was considered immune to air pollution due to its coastal location and strong sea breezes that would blow away dust and particles. However, in the last two years, this geographical advantage no longer offers reliable protection. Last year, Mumbai experienced a long period of poor air quality from November to January, with some days being more polluted than Delhi. This trend continued last week when the air quality index (AQI) exceeded 300 in certain parts of the city. Adverse meteorological conditions have contributed to these particularly bad spells, but overall, Mumbai's air quality has been consistently declining. The direction and strength of winds play a crucial role in determining air quality in Mumbai. While the city generates pollutants at a similar rate to Delhi and other urban centers, strong winds usually help sweep away dust particles. However, disruptions in wind patterns can impact air quality, as seen last year when winds changed directions less frequently than usual. This disruption may have been influenced by La Nina conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean. La Nina is a large-scale phenomenon that affects weather events worldwide. Last year's prolonged and strong La Nina event likely played a role in Mumbai's poor winter air quality. However, La Nina has ended and been replaced by El Nino, whose effects are not yet known. Last week's dip in air quality was caused by different factors, including calmer winds as the monsoon retreated and a temperature gradient between Mumbai and nearby hilly regions that brought dust from construction projects into the city. While unfavorable local weather conditions contribute to poor air quality, the main cause is high levels of pollution exceeding the city's carrying capacity due to increased economic activity, vehicles, construction, consumption, and emissions. Experts warn that Mumbai's air quality has been steadily declining over the past decade and efforts to mitigate the impacts are insufficient.

Women in Iceland, known as the world's most gender-equal country, went on a one-day strike to protest against gender discrimination. Despite Iceland's reputation as an equality paradise, issues such as the gender pay gap and gender-based violence persist. The strike, inspired by a similar action in 1975, saw women refusing all kinds of work, paid and unpaid. Sectors dominated by women, such as healthcare and education, were heavily affected. The Prime Minister, Katrin JakobsdÃ³ttir, also participated in the strike. Activists aim to highlight the connection between underpaid work and gender-based violence, both stemming from the view of women as lesser. The strike aims to challenge societal mindsets and demand urgent action for gender equality in Iceland.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In his Vijaydashami speech in Nagpur, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat criticized "cultural Marxists or woke" individuals, referring to them as deceitful and destructive forces in India. He claimed that these individuals, despite claiming lofty goals, have ulterior motives of taking control of media and academia to create confusion and corruption in education, culture, politics, and society. The term "woke" originated in the United States within Black communities, symbolizing awareness and vigilance against violence and social injustice. Over time, it gained prominence through civil rights movements and Black artists' music. Following incidents like the shooting of Michael Brown and George Floyd's death, "woke" became associated with discussions on police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. The term has now gone global, with conservative politicians mocking inclusivity as "woke" and using it to criticize causes like gender equality and environmental conservation. However, there is concern among progressive groups that the true activism-heavy history of the term is being diluted as powerful individuals co-opt it for political correctness without meaningful action. Additionally, companies often use the term in advertising campaigns for marketing purposes. While conservatives view "woke" as identity-driven change at odds with liberalism and capitalism, some argue that its message should be stronger, while others question the need for it altogether.

### [Bhagwat praises Ambedkar: How the RSS came to embrace the father of Indiaâ€™s constitution](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bhagwat-ambedkar-rss-8997717/)

RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has called on his audience to read B.R. Ambedkar's last two speeches in the same way as they read K.B. Hedgewar, the founder of the RSS. This is part of the RSS's practice of praising Ambedkar, particularly since the BJP came to power in 2014. Historically, the RSS criticized Ambedkar and his work, but their position has since evolved. The RSS's initial opposition to Ambedkar was due to his advocacy of reforming Hindu personal laws and his support of the Hindu Code Bill, which aimed to give Hindu women rights. However, since the Meenakshipuram incident in 1981 and the mass conversion of lower-caste Hindus to Islam, the RSS has sought to invoke Ambedkar and Dalits. They have organized gatherings and events to promote Hindu unity and have celebrated Ambedkar's birthday alongside that of Hedgewar. The RSS has also established education centers and sewa vibhags to engage with Dalit communities. In recent years, Bhagwat has emphasized the need for Hindu unity and condemned discrimination. The RSS's shift in position is reflected in the publication of articles praising Ambedkar and featuring his picture on the cover of their journal.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Nations (UN) was founded on October 24, 1945, after the end of World War II. It was created to maintain world peace and prevent future wars. The UN replaced the League of Nations, which had failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. The idea for the UN was first discussed by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1941, and it was officially established with the signing of the UN Declaration by representatives of 51 nations in 1945. The UN has since grown to include 193 member states and has expanded its scope to address various global issues such as health, environment, and human rights. It has achieved significant milestones, including the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948 and the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002. However, it has also faced criticism for its failures, such as its inability to prevent genocides in Rwanda and sexual misconduct allegations against its peacekeeping missions. The UN aims to address these challenges and work towards sustainable development goals in the next decade.

House Republicans have been struggling to find a replacement for the Speaker after a series of failed attempts. The divisions within the party have made it virtually impossible to unite behind a single candidate. The factions within the party, including the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, the Main Street Caucus, the Mainstream Republican Governance Group, and the Problem Solvers Caucus, each have their own ideologies and interests. Personal vendettas and bad blood among members further complicate the situation. The recent ousting of California Rep. Kevin McCarthy as Speaker was due in part to conflicts with other members, including Rep. Matt Gaetz. Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the current front-runner for the nomination, is facing similar hurdles, with some allies of former President Donald Trump viewing him as disloyal. To become Speaker, a Republican must secure 217 votes, which is a challenging task given the party's current circumstances. The article highlights the difficulty of finding a unifying figure within a deeply divided party.

### [US bond yield hits 16-year high of 5 pc: Why is it rising and what does it signal?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-bond-yield-why-rising-explained-8997263/)

The yield on 10-year government bonds in the US rose to its highest level since July 2007, reaching 5.02%. This increase in bond yields is due to concerns over inflation and the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high for longer. In India, the yield on 10-year government bonds is already at a high of 7.38%. Factors such as rising crude oil prices, inflation risks, and the US government's borrowing plans have contributed to the rise in bond yields. The increase in yields indicates that the cost of funds in the financial system is rising, leading to higher interest rates. This can have an impact on the overall financial system and put upward pressure on interest rates in the banking system. Rising yields can also lead to a decline in bond prices and impact debt funds and corporate bonds.

China is constructing a large telescope in the western Pacific Ocean to detect neutrinos, also known as "ghost particles". Neutrinos are tiny, chargeless particles that are abundant in the universe but difficult to observe due to their weak interactions with other particles. The new telescope, called "Trident", will be the largest of its kind and will be located in the South China Sea. It is expected to be 10,000 times more sensitive than existing underwater telescopes and will help scientists study the energy and source of neutrinos. Neutrinos are still not fully understood, and their behavior defies established rules of physics. However, understanding them could help solve scientific mysteries such as the origin of cosmic rays. The construction of Trident will bring scientists closer to unraveling the secrets of neutrinos and the origins of our universe.

Nagaland recently opened its first medical college, called the Nagaland Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (NIMSR). The college will have 100 seats available for MBBS students in the upcoming academic session. The government aims to distribute medical colleges evenly across the country. However, a new regulation issued by the National Medical Commission (NMC) in August has put a hold on the establishment of new medical colleges and the expansion of existing ones in states that already have more than 100 medical education seats per million population. This has caused frustration among southern states, as they are now ineligible for additional medical education seats. The NMC argues that these guidelines will reduce regional disparities and ensure quality education for all. They estimate that the country could potentially add 40,000 more MBBS seats if colleges are distributed evenly. The distribution of medical college seats currently varies among states, with Tamil Nadu having the most seats followed by Karnataka and Maharashtra. Meghalaya, Bihar, and Jharkhand have the most acute deficiencies in medical college seats relative to their populations. Despite the government's efforts to increase seats, there is still a shortage of faculty in hospitals even in major cities like Delhi. The NMC's decision will only apply to new colleges or increased seats from the 2024-25 academic year onwards. Many experts agree that there is a need to rationalize the distribution of medical colleges, given the increasing number of private colleges. They believe that the NMC's ratio is necessary to ensure a fair distribution of colleges across the country and to avoid an oversupply of healthcare professionals in certain areas.

Ramleela, a traditional folk theatre performance in India, has made its way to Trinidad through the Indian diaspora. In the early 19th century, Trinidad turned to indentured labor from India after slavery was abolished. The first boatload of indentured Indians arrived in Trinidad in 1845, bringing with them their culture and the Ramcharitmanas, a Hindu text. Ramleela became popular among the Indian community in Trinidad, but its popularity declined as formal education spread and younger generations became less familiar with the Manas. Migration to urban areas and exposure to other cultural influences also contributed to the decline. However, Ramleela has undergone innovation and adaptation to appeal to younger audiences, with increased financial backing leading to higher production values. Despite these changes, the essence of the story and performance remains the same, serving as an anchor for the Indian community in Trinidad and representing their Indianness.

The Supreme Court in India has rejected a petition filed by the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) party in Telangana, which challenged the allotment of election symbols to two other parties. BRS argued that the symbols of 'road roller' and 'chapatti roller' given to the Yuga Thulasi Party and Alliance of Democratic Reforms Party respectively, were too similar to BRS's symbol of a car and could confuse voters. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, stating that voters were intelligent enough to differentiate between the symbols. The article goes on to explain how symbols are allotted to political parties in India and whether parties have a say in choosing them. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for the allotment of symbols, which can be either reserved or free. Recognized parties get exclusive symbols, while unregistered parties can choose from free symbols. The ECI publishes lists specifying parties and their symbols through a notification in the Gazette of India. The article also mentions that the late MS Sethi, a former draughtsman for the ECI, sketched many of the symbols used by political parties. Parties are allowed to state their preferences for symbols, but they must not resemble existing symbols or have any religious or communal connotations. When a recognized party splits, the Election Commission decides on the symbol assignment.

Many people in northern Gaza are unable to flee due to the high cost and lack of safety guarantees. The Israeli military has intensified its bombardment of the area and urged civilians to move south, warning that those who don't may be considered terrorists. However, the danger of Israeli airstrikes on the road has made travel expensive, with drivers charging between $200 and $300 per family. The dire situation in Gaza, with shortages of food, water, and supplies, has led to over half of the population being displaced. The United Nations has condemned the labeling of civilians as accomplices in terrorism and warned that deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime. The Israeli military claims it treats civilians as such and does not target them. Despite the evacuation warnings, airstrikes continue to hit the south, and some families choose to stay in the north due to the lack of familiarity and fear of ending up on the streets. One family's attempt to seek shelter in the south resulted in an airstrike that killed several members.

### [Why VFS clarification brings some relief to Indiaâ€™s Canada visa applicants](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/vfs-canada-visa-applicants-services-centres-8995815/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Canada has announced the suspension of in-person services at its consulates in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and the withdrawal of 41 diplomats in India. However, visa services provider VFS Global clarified that its visa application centers in India will continue to operate normally. This assurance brings relief to many Canada visa seekers, particularly students, as a significant number of Indian students go to Canada for educational purposes. VFS Global is authorized to accept applications for visitor visas, study visas, work permits, and travel document applications. It is important to note that while VFS Global helps with the application process, the decision to issue or refuse a visa is made by immigration officers of the IRCC.

### [ExplainSpeaking | Bidenomics: What is it? Has it worked? What is its significance?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/us-joe-biden-economics-explained-8995387/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In an article by Udit Misra, it is highlighted that the year 2024 will be significant for the global economy due to elections in major economies such as India, Russia, the UK, the EU, and the US. These countries collectively contribute to more than 50% of the global GDP in 2023, with a combined GDP of over $54 trillion. The US election is particularly important, as President Joe Biden is expected to run for re-election, facing a challenge from former President Donald Trump. Bidenomics, the economic policies introduced by President Biden, is a key focus of the article [[SOURCE 1]].

Bidenomics is a term used to refer to the economic policies implemented by the Biden administration. It is a reaction to the economic structure that has been in place since the Reagan presidency in 1981. Reaganomics, which aimed to stimulate economic activity through tax cuts for businesses and reduced government intervention, has been criticized for exacerbating income and wealth inequality. Bidenomics seeks to address these inequalities and promote inclusive growth by investing in infrastructure, reducing trade dependence on countries like China, and raising living standards for the middle and lower-income groups [[SOURCE 1]].

The article discusses two main concerns regarding Bidenomics. First, there is a question of whether it is working effectively. While macro indicators such as GDP growth and unemployment rates show positive trends, there are concerns about income and wealth inequality. Real income growth for the middle 40% of the working population has remained negative for most of the Biden presidency, indicating that the benefits of economic growth may not be reaching everyone [[SOURCE 1]].

The second concern is the ideological disagreement with Bidenomics. Critics argue that the policies implemented, such as providing subsidies to domestic companies, may distort markets and lead to a global subsidy war. This could harm poorer nations and increase inefficiency and corruption within the US. However, proponents of Bidenomics argue that it is necessary to address inequality and counter global rivals like China [[SOURCE 1]].

In conclusion, Bidenomics is an economic approach aimed at reducing inequality and promoting inclusive growth. While it has shown positive macroeconomic indicators, there are concerns about income and wealth inequality and ideological disagreements with the policies implemented. The impact of Bidenomics will continue to be debated as the Biden administration moves forward with its economic agenda [[SOURCE 1]].

### [Why Israel attacked Syriaâ€™s airports, amid its ongoing war with Hamas](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-israel-attacked-syria-war-hamas-8995086/)

Israeli warplanes launched strikes on parts of Gaza and two airports in Syria, approximately two weeks after Hamas carried out the largest attack on Israel since its founding. Israel has not explicitly stated its motives for the latest attack but has previously expressed the need to prevent another front opening towards its north. The strikes are believed to be targeting the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, which has threatened attacks on Israel's north. Hezbollah has historically opposed Israel and received support from Iran. Syria, which has long opposed Israel, has also been involved due to its alliance with Hezbollah. Israel has carried out previous strikes in Syria during the war. Concerns arise from the sizeable force and weaponry of Hezbollah, potentially leading to a ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces and spillover effects in West Asia.

### [Canada recalls 41 diplomats from India: What is the 1961 Vienna Convention, why it was invoked](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/canda-recalls-diplomats-india-why-the-1961-vienna-convention-explained-8994999/)

The Canadian government has recalled 41 diplomats and their family members from India due to concerns that their diplomatic immunity could be revoked. This move comes after India sought "parity" with Canada, asking it to reduce its diplomatic staff in the country. The dispute stems from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's remarks linking the Indian government to the killing of a pro-Khalistan separatist leader in Canada, which India rejected as baseless. The US and UK have backed Canada's diplomats, stating that they should be allowed to resolve differences on the ground. India has rejected Canada's claims and stated that its actions are consistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

### [Israel-Hamas war: Gazaâ€™s humanitarian situation explained](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/gaza-humanitatian-aid-israel-hamas-palestine-conflict-8994765/)

Trucks carrying humanitarian aid have entered Gaza for the first time since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, which led to a blockade. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the aid supplies, including medicines and medical supplies, will only address a fraction of the escalating health needs in the area. The Gaza Strip, home to 2.2 million people, has been facing shortages of medicine, fuel, and food due to the electricity cut off by Israel. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees reported that Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a large population of refugees. The ICRC highlighted the dire situation in hospitals where power shortages are risking the lives of patients. Gaza's unemployment rate is over 45%, and 80% of residents rely on humanitarian assistance. Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007, severely limiting the movement of people and essential supplies. The Rafa border crossing with Egypt is currently the only route for aid into Gaza.

### [What is â€˜Visa Shoppingâ€™ and why is it being done to enter countries in Europe](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/visa-shopping-immigration-europe-schengen-explained-8994712/)

The practice of 'visa shopping' is becoming popular in several Indian states, including Punjab. Visa shopping refers to obtaining visas for countries that individuals may or may not visit during the granted visa period. This allows people to enter their preferred countries, particularly in Europe, even if they have obtained a visa for another European nation. People are also purchasing visas for countries they have no immediate plans to visit in order to increase their chances of obtaining visas for countries of their choice in the future. The Schengen Visa is a popular example of this, as it allows travellers to explore many European countries without the need for separate visas. The Schengen system was established in 1985 and allows people to travel freely between member countries without going through border controls. Many people opt to apply for a Schengen Visa from a country with an easier application process and then use it to travel to their intended destination. While this practice is not illegal if travellers adhere to the norms and guidelines of the visa process, legal concerns arise if a person seeks a visa for a particular country but stays in another or shows that their intentions were not to stay in that country but to only use it as an entry point. The Embassy of Estonia in New Delhi has advised against visa shopping and warned that there may be severe consequences, including refusal of the visa or being offloaded from the plane or returned back home from the EU borders. Repeatedly engaging in visa shopping may also raise suspicion among officials.

### [Who are the Bedouin Arabs in the Israeli army?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bedouin-arabs-israeli-army-8993875/)

The article discusses the role of Bedouin soldiers in Israel's military and their contributions to the country. The Bedouins are a nomadic Muslim Arab people who traditionally lived in the Negev desert in southern Israel. In the past, they provided security and intelligence to early Jewish settlers in Palestine during the Arab-Israeli War. Israel recognized a large number of Bedouins as citizens in the 1950s and built settlements for them in the Negev. Many Bedouin soldiers serve in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), particularly in scouting and tracking units. Specialized search and rescue units, mainly comprising Bedouins, were also formed by the IDF. The article mentions that army training is not compulsory for Bedouin youth, but many still volunteer, with a record number of approximately 600 enlisting in 2021. The Bedouin population in Israel currently numbers around 210,000 individuals, with a significant presence in the Negev desert. The Israeli government has launched Operation Negev Shield to integrate Bedouin communities into society through educational programs. The article also highlights the appointment of Israel's first Bedouin ambassador and the presence of Bedouin entrepreneurs in the country's high-tech sector.

### [Nawaz Sharif back in Pakistan: What this means for the former PM, his country, and Imran Khan](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nawaz-sharif-returns-pakistan-8993870/)

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has returned to Pakistan after four years of voluntary exile in London. Sharif, who left Pakistan in 2019 for medical treatment while serving a prison sentence for corruption, landed in Islamabad and will travel to Lahore to hold a gathering of his supporters. His return is seen as a signal that the military is willing to give him another chance and help thwart Imran Khan and his party from coming to power. Sharif's downfall came after he lost support from the military and was accused of corruption. He was disqualified from office and later banned from politics. The military had previously supported Khan but their relationship soured, leading to Khan's ouster as prime minister. Sharif remains popular and the military hopes his return will help defeat Khan's party in the upcoming general elections. However, Sharif must have his corruption-related convictions overturned in order to run for office again.

### [Israel missiles hit Gazaâ€™s oldest church: What you need to know about the Church of Saint Porphyrius](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-missiles-hit-gazas-oldest-church-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-church-of-saint-porphyrius-8993651/)

An Israeli airstrike on a building near the Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza has caused significant damage to the church. The building, which was affiliated with the church, collapsed in the explosion. Around 500 people had sought refuge at the church compound during the recent hostilities, and at least 16 people were killed and many injured in the airstrike. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate has condemned the attack as a war crime, stating that targeting churches and their affiliated institutions is unacceptable. The Church of Saint Porphyrius, located in Gaza's Old City, has a long history dating back to the 5th century. It was converted into a mosque after the Islamic conquest but was later reclaimed and rebuilt by Crusaders. Today, it is one of three churches in Gaza and serves as an important institution for the Christian Palestinian community. The church has also provided sanctuary for Muslims during times of conflict. In 2014, during an Israeli bombing campaign, the church's courtyard was used for daily prayers and was also targeted, causing damage to nearby structures.

### [As Israel-Hamas conflict gets deadlier, what happens to the India-Europe economic corridor?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/israel-hamas-india-europe-imec-corridor-8993474/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) faces significant challenges and complexities in light of the recent fighting in Israel and escalating tensions in the region. The project aims to physically connect a vast stretch of the Eurasian subcontinent through cross-country railway lines and shipping corridors. However, officials from multiple government ministries indicate that the ongoing conflict has made progress on the project even more difficult.

When Prime Minister Modi announced the IMEC alongside US President Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, there was an acknowledgment of the logistical complexities involved. This includes potential customs checks and clearance for consignments as well as navigating the complex geopolitics of the West Asian region.

The design of the corridor involves traversing diverse nations with different political dynamics, strategic interests, and historical tensions. The US backing was seen as crucial, especially considering the involvement of countries like Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. However, the recent outbreak of fighting between Hamas and Israel threatens to disrupt these efforts, potentially affecting the Saudi-Israel peace initiative.

The premature announcement of the project without finalized implementation details or funding plans has been criticized as lacking clarity. The use of the land route in the Arabian peninsula could offer logistical advantages by bypassing the congested Suez Canal. Indian officials emphasize the need for close coordination among various departments and ministries involved in the initiative.

The fresh trouble in the West Asia region poses a risk to diplomatic outreach between Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as other countries like the UAE, Bahrain, and Jordan. Moreover, Turkey has announced its own project as a counter to the IMEC, citing disputed waters along the proposed sea route between Haifa in Israel and Piraeus in Greece.

The IMEC is part of a US-led initiative called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment (PGII), with discussions starting in January 2023. The alignment of the corridor stretches from Western India to Europe via the ports of Piraeus, Haifa, and Dubai. The corridor includes two separate routes: the east corridor connecting India to the Arabian Gulf and the northern corridor connecting the Arabian Gulf to Europe.

The IMEC aims to establish a reliable and cost-effective cross-border ship-to-rail transit network to facilitate the movement of goods and services between India and Europe. It also presents opportunities for laying cables for electricity and digital connectivity, as well as a pipeline for clean hydrogen export. However, the current conflict and geopolitical complexities pose significant challenges to the realization of this ambitious project.

### [Israel-Palestine conflict: How international humanitarian law views forced displacement and human shields](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/international-humanitarian-law-forced-displacement-human-shields-8992746/)

In an article, President Joe Biden accused Hamas of using innocent Palestinians as human shields. Israel has long made this accusation against Hamas, claiming that they hide behind civilians while targeting Israeli civilians. Protests condemning the forced displacement of Palestinians by Israel are ongoing in the Arab world and beyond, as many worry about a refugee influx and permanent Israeli occupation. The use of human shields is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law (IHL), and it is also prohibited to target human shields. The article discusses the complexities of the situation in Gaza due to the population density and highlights that regardless of intent, it would be illegal for Israel to attack civilian homes used for military purposes. Recently, Israel ordered hundreds of thousands of civilians to evacuate from northern Gaza, which could constitute forcible displacement under the statute of the International Criminal Court. The order was criticized by organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Norwegian Refugee Council. While warning civilians of military operations is necessary, it is illegal to threaten people to leave. Any displacement of civilians must be temporary and for their benefit, with guarantees of safety and return.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Army has deployed 140 AI-based surveillance systems along its borders with Pakistan and China to enhance its operational capabilities. These systems include high-resolution cameras, sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and radar feeds, which are collected and analyzed through AI to detect intrusions and classify targets. The army is also using AI-powered drones and robots to patrol borders, reducing the need for human intervention in dangerous situations. India is investing approximately $50 million each year in AI spending for defense purposes but needs to increase investments to keep up with China's advancements in the field. The country is positioning itself at the forefront of intelligent warfare strategies by integrating AI into its defense systems. However, experts emphasize the importance of human intelligence in interpreting data gathered from AI solutions, especially in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism measures. While deploying high-tech solutions has minimized human involvement in monitoring and improved intrusion detection, there are still challenges that need to be overcome to fully utilize the potential of AI in military operations.

### [Canada visa services now available only in Delhi: How will Indian visa seekers, including students, be impacted?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/canada-visa-services-delhi-india-students-impact-explained-8992540/)

Canada has suspended visa and consular services at its consulates in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and will now only offer these services at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi. This decision comes after Canada withdrew 41 diplomats from India, following New Delhi's decision to revoke their diplomatic immunity. The ongoing diplomatic dispute between the two countries was triggered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegation that India may have been involved in the killing of a Khalistani separatist in Canada. 

The expected fallout of this situation is that there will be a significant slowdown in Indian visa applications for Canada. A large portion of these applications come from Indian students who wish to study in Canadian universities. Currently, there are over 319,000 registered Indian students in Canada, making it the second-largest destination for Indian students after the United States. This downsizing of Canada's diplomatic corps and the suspension of visa services in major Indian cities will impact the processing of these applications, potentially causing a backlog.

Indian students make a substantial contribution to the Canadian economy through tuition fees and their spending on living expenses. Tuition fees for international students in Canada are higher than those for domestic students, and it is estimated that Indian students contribute approximately Canadian $10 billion annually to the education sector in the country. Moreover, international students, including Indian students, fill essential jobs in critical sectors of the Canadian economy.

While Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has stated that it is reducing the number of employees in India from 27 to 5, the visa application centers operated by third-party contractors will not be impacted. These centers process the majority of visa applications outside the country, through IRCC's global network. The remaining staff will focus on urgent cases, visa printing, and working with the visa application centers.

Overall, the slowdown in the visa process is expected to have negative consequences for Indian students and the Canadian economy. The diplomatic dispute between Canada and India has further strained relations and created challenges for those seeking to travel and study between the two countries.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the history of Durga Puja, a religious festival celebrated in Bengal, India. The origins of modern Durga Puja can be traced back to the nexus between Bengali zamindars (landowners) and merchants, and the East India Company during colonial rule. With Company rule came economic opportunities, leading to the rise of a new class of powerful natives who used Durga Puja as an occasion to display their wealth and socialize with the British elites. By the late 19th century, Durga Puja became a part of the nascent nationalist project, symbolizing the nation and its fight against foreign rule. After Lord Curzon's decision to Partition Bengal in 1905, Durga Pujas became places where collective consciousness and action were forged in the Swadeshi Movement. In the 1920s, public Pujas began to emerge, making the festival accessible to everyone regardless of caste or residence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the first leg of India's Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS), which is the country's first mass rapid system dedicated to regional connectivity. The trains on this first section have the capability to run at speeds up to 180 km/h, which will eventually reduce the journey time between Delhi and Meerut to less than an hour. The RRTS is an integrated mass transit network aimed at achieving balanced and sustainable urban development by providing better connectivity and access across the National Capital Region (NCR). The idea for this network originated from a study commissioned by the Indian Railways in 1998-99, which identified the possibility of connecting various locations in the NCR through fast commuter trains. The proposal was later re-examined in 2006 with the extension of the Delhi Metro lines to towns in the NCR. The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) was established to implement the RRTS project, which includes eight corridors to connect different towns in the NCR. The RRTS, also known as Namo Bharat, aims to unlock the full potential of the NCR by enhancing multi-modal connectivity and reducing congestion on roads, highways, metro, and railway networks. Additionally, the project is expected to boost employment and stimulate economic activity in the region. The RRTS trains will run faster than metro trains, operating at speeds up to 180 km/h, compared to the maximum speed of 100-120 km/h for Delhi Metro trains. The Phase I development includes three corridors: Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut (82 km), Delhi-Gurugram-SNB-Alwar (164 km), and Delhi-Panipat (103 km). The project plans to develop five more corridors in the future. The Sarai Kale Khan station in Delhi will serve as the central hub for all three Phase I corridors. The priority section of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor, a 17 km stretch with five stations, has been inaugurated, and the entire corridor is scheduled to be operational by 2025.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to conduct the Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) on Saturday, as part of its preparations for launching an Indian astronaut into space. The TV-D1 mission will test the Crew Escape System of the Gaganyaan project, which allows the crew to leave the spacecraft in an emergency. The rocket will reach an altitude of almost 17 km before triggering an abort signal, leading to the separation of the crew module and its descent using a parachute. The test mission will last 532 seconds and will demonstrate the new Test Vehicle and a basic version of the crew module. ISRO has developed a low-cost Test Vehicle specifically for these tests, using existing liquid propulsion technology. The Gaganyaan human space flight programme has a budget of around Rs 9,000 crore ($1.2 billion).

During Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent visit to China, he was seen with officers carrying the "nuclear briefcase." This briefcase is part of a system for authorizing the launch of nuclear strikes. It is used to convey orders for a nuclear strike to the rocket forces of the country. The briefcases are also carried by the defense minister and the chief of general staff, who coordinate with the president in case of a potential order to strike. The first known instance of a nuclear briefcase being used was in 1995 during a crisis. The briefcases were developed during the Cold War to cut down reaction time in the event of a sudden attack. The American president also has a similar briefcase, officially called the presidential emergency satchel or the "football," which contains information on retaliatory options and authentication codes to authorize a nuclear attack. Other countries have similar systems as well. There have been instances of misplaced or lost codes in the past.

The demand to open the Ratna Bhandar (treasure room) of the Puri Jagannath Temple in Odisha is growing as assembly and general elections approach. The treasure room has not been unlocked for 30 years. The BJP and Congress have both raised the issue and demanded its opening. The Ratna Bhandar stores precious ornaments given by devotees and kings over centuries. The outer chamber is regularly opened for rituals, but the inner chamber has not been opened in 38 years. The demand to open the Ratna Bhandar has increased due to concerns about cracks in its walls that could endanger the precious ornaments. The last inventory of the treasure room was done in 1978, and efforts to open it in 2018 were unsuccessful due to missing keys. A judicial inquiry was ordered to investigate the loss of the keys. The issue resurfaced when the ASI sought permission to inspect the inner chamber in 2022. Eminent individuals and opposition parties have demanded the opening of the treasure room, leading to the temple managing committee recommending its opening during the annual rath yatra in 2024. The Orissa HC directed the government to form a high-level committee to supervise the inventory-making of the valuables but declined to interfere in the inventory and repair plans.

### [Who are the Palestinians?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/who-are-palestinians-israel-hamas-8990440/)

The article discusses the oversimplification of the Palestinian identity in media coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict. It highlights that the emphasis is often placed on Palestinians being Muslims who are in conflict with Jewish Israelis, which fails to acknowledge the rich and complex history of the Palestinians. The term "Palestine" originated in ancient Greece and referred to the coastal land between Phoenicia and Egypt. The region underwent Islamisation and saw the emergence of various overlapping identities. After the defeat of the Ottomans in World War I, Palestine was divided among the British and the French. The Palestinian national charter of 1968 emphasized the Palestinians' Arab identity but did not define Palestine in religious terms. The majority of Palestinians today are Sunni Muslims, but there is also a Jewish minority in Palestinian areas. Palestinian Christians make up a small percentage of the population.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Egypt and Jordan have refused to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza, fearing that Israel wants to permanently expel Palestinians into their countries and nullify Palestinian demands for statehood. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi warned that a mass exodus of Palestinians into Egypt could bring militants into the Sinai Peninsula, from where they might launch attacks on Israel, endangering the two countries' peace treaty. Jordan's King Abdullah II gave a similar message, stating that there would be no refugees in Jordan or Egypt. Both countries fear that allowing a large Palestinian refugee population would threaten their stability and security.

### [Why reforms have been proposed for World Bank, other Multilateral Development Banks; what they say](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/reforms-proposed-world-bank-multilateral-development-8990139/)

A G20 expert panel has recommended that multilateral development banks (MDBs), such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, shift their focus from financing individual projects to prioritizing programs with sectoral focus and long-term transformation plans as identified by national governments. The panel argues that MDBs should align their operations with national development priorities and increase coordination between stakeholders to address global challenges effectively. The panel also suggests that private sector engagement should be brought to the center of MDB operations to increase financing and reverse the trend of low private financial flows to emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The existing perception of MDBs as bureaucratic and risk-averse has impacted their engagement with the private sector. MDBs have played a significant role in India's development journey, with commitments from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and European Investment Bank in key infrastructure sectors such as transport, energy, and urban infrastructure.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Andhra Pradesh has announced that it will conduct a census for backward classes starting from November 15. The Minister for Backward Classes Welfare, C Srinivasa Venugopala Krishna, stated that this census will help the government better understand the numerical strength of the 139 backward-class communities in the state. The publication of the caste survey results in Bihar earlier this month has raised the possibility of other states conducting similar exercises. The enumeration of castes, along with the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), has been a long-standing issue to ensure equal distribution of reservation benefits. The OBCs are identified based on their occupation and are categorized into various groups. The demand for reservation for the "backwards among OBCs" has gained traction as it is felt that a few "upper" OBCs have benefited the most from the existing reservation system. Bihar has already identified backward and extremely backward classes through its caste survey. The report also provides information about previous OBC commissions and their recommendations. The subcategorization of OBCs has been discussed by various commissions, but the recommendations have not been implemented yet.

### [Suspected Banksy artwork appears in London: The artistâ€™s long connection with Palestine](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/banksy-artwork-in-palestine-8989505/)

A new Banksy mural has appeared near the Edgware Road Underground Station in London. The artwork, which depicts robotic arms being pulled by three individuals, bears the words "another world is possible." While Banksy has not claimed ownership of the piece, it has attracted a large number of visitors. Interpretations of the artwork vary, with some viewing it as a warning against the dangers of artificial intelligence and others seeing it as a commentary on the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.

Banksy has a history of working in Palestine since the early 2000s, with his artworks being spotted in the region, including on the West Bank wall. He also owns a hotel next to the separation wall in Bethlehem called the Walled Off Hotel. The hotel features rooms with artwork by Banksy and other artists, a gallery showcasing Palestinian artworks, and a museum with audio-visual presentations about the region's history.

One of Banksy's most notable statements on the Israel-Palestine conflict is a video he released in 2015, sarcastically promoting tourism in Gaza. The video highlights the devastation in Gaza and the restrictions faced by its residents, juxtaposed with the Israeli military presence. Banksy also references the destruction caused by the 2014 military operation and the network of illegal tunnels. The video concludes with a quote spray-painted on a wall, emphasizing the importance of not remaining neutral in conflicts between the powerful and the powerless.

Banksy's artworks in the region include the famous "Love is in the Air" mural in Jerusalem, which depicts a man throwing a bouquet of flowers instead of a weapon, symbolizing peace. He has also created murals featuring children interacting with Israeli soldiers and commenting on the Israeli occupation. One of his well-known projects in Palestine is a series of large murals painted on the segregation wall in 2005, including images of children playing on a sandcastle and a variation of Banksy's "Girl with Balloon" painting.

Overall, Banksy's artworks in Palestine and his recent mural in London continue his exploration of political and social issues, provoking thought and sparking conversations about topics such as artificial intelligence and the Israel-Palestine conflict.

### [Severe drought grips the Amazon rainforest: The impact, cause and grim future](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/drought-amazon-rainforest-8989382/)

The Amazon rainforest is experiencing a severe drought, causing rivers to dry up and leaving Indigenous communities without water, food, or medicine. The Rio Negro, one of the largest rivers in the world, has reached a record low level. The drought has also led to dead fish and river dolphins contaminating the water supply, leaving residents with limited access to clean water. The lack of water has affected a major hydropower dam and stranded tens of thousands of people in remote villages. The dry conditions have also increased the risk of wildfires, with the Amazonas state experiencing a high number of blazes this month. The drought is attributed to the combined effects of El Nino and high sea surface temperatures. Studies suggest that with rising global temperatures, the Amazon will experience more frequent and longer droughts, potentially leading to irreversible damage and releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere. Experts emphasize the need to curb deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions to protect the Amazon and its vital role in global ecosystems.

The trust, which publishes books and commentaries on Indian religious philosophy, has been granted permission to approach tech companies Google and Meta (owners of YouTube and Instagram) with takedown orders against those reproducing copyrighted works on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita. The court found that while religious scriptures are in the public domain, copyright protection applies to original parts of literary works that explain or interpret these scriptures. The court also noted that Srila Prabhupada, the founder of the trust, had handed over copyrights to be administered by the trust, making unauthorized reproduction a violation.

South Korea has joined the US in condemning North Korea after allegations that Pyongyang provided munitions and weapons to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine. South Korea is considering additional measures against North Korea, but analysts suggest there are few options left for exerting pressure on the country. North Korea has managed to bypass international sanctions through alliances with Russia and China. The South Korean Foreign Ministry stated that any weapons exchanges between North Korea and Russia are a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and a threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Both Russia and North Korea have denied these allegations. Experts believe that Russia and North Korea's collaboration could last a long time as both countries have grievances against the West and desire to overturn the international order. However, further sanctions from the US or South Korea may not significantly impact North Korea's regime, as Russia has indicated it will not support additional UN pressure on North Korea. It is also suggested that North Korea may be willing to teach Russia some of its survival tactics in return for nuclear weapons and missile technology.

### [Israel using white phosphorus in Gaza? 5 things about the controversial weapon](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/israel-white-phosphorus-gaza-5-things-8988938/)

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have accused the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of using white phosphorus munitions in Gaza and Lebanon, in violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The organizations claim that Israel's use of these munitions in densely populated areas poses long-term risks to civilians. White phosphorus is a pyrophoric substance that ignites when exposed to oxygen, producing thick smoke and intense heat. It is primarily used as a smokescreen to hide troop movement and can also be used as an incendiary weapon. Exposure to white phosphorus can cause severe burns, respiratory damage, and harm to internal organs. The use of white phosphorus munitions is regulated under the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), specifically Protocol III, but there are loopholes in the regulations. Efforts have been made to strengthen the CCW to address these loopholes.

The Union Cabinet has approved a 4 percentage point increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief for central government employees and pensioners, bringing it to 46% from 42%. The hike will be effective from July 1st and is intended to benefit government employees and pensioners during the festive season. The hike will cost the exchequer Rs 12,857 crore per year. Approximately 48.67 lakh central government employees and 67.95 lakh pensioners will benefit from this increase. This hike follows the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission. The DA for employees and pensioners is estimated based on the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW), released monthly by the Labour Bureau. The last revision in DA was done on March 24, 2023, and was effective from January 1, 2023. In addition, the government has announced the grant of non-productivity linked bonus (ad-hoc bonus) for eligible employees for the year 2022-23. The ad-hoc bonus has been approved for certain categories of employees, including paramilitary forces, and the calculation ceiling for payment has been set at Rs 7,000.

### [Why a Supreme Court order on telcosâ€™ licence fee tax has the industry worried](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/supreme-court-order-telecom-licence-fee-8988571/)

The Supreme Court in India has ruled that telecom companies will have to classify their payment of entry fees and annual license fees as capital expenditure rather than revenue expenditure, resulting in potential additional tax liabilities for the companies. This decision could lead to a tax liability of around $1 billion for telecom companies like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in the current fiscal year. The Court's decision means that telecom companies will need to deduct a portion of the total fee over each year for tax purposes, rather than deducting the entire expenditure at once. This change in accounting is expected to result in lower cash flow for telecom companies. It is unclear whether the change will be applied retrospectively, and income tax authorities are expected to demand any shortfall in tax payment for the prior period, along with penalties. Telecom companies are likely to file a review petition, which could delay the actual tax liability. Bharti Airtel is currently examining the order and its impact to determine the next course of action.

### [Supreme Courtâ€™s marriage equality judgment unpacked: Two views on four key issues](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/scs-marriage-equality-judgment-unpacked-two-views-on-four-key-issues-8988049/)

A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud, has declined to grant legal status to same-sex marriages. The majority opinion, held by three judges, stated that the issue should be addressed by the legislature rather than the judiciary. While the CJI and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul recognized civil unions for queer couples, they were in the minority. The judges provided their views on four key questions raised during the case.

Regarding the argument that there exists a fundamental right to marry a person of one's own choice under the Constitution, the minority view disagreed. They stated that marriage may have gained significance because of state regulation, rather than being inherently fundamental. The majority opinion agreed with this perspective, emphasizing that personal preference and social status are important aspects of marriage. They also highlighted that the US courts' reasoning for declaring the right to marry a fundamental right may not be applicable.

The court considered a gender-neutral interpretation of the legislation governing civil marriages, where the state sanctions the marriage instead of religion. However, the minority view warned against entering the domain of the legislature, while the majority view stated that the legislation is intended only for heterosexual couples belonging to different faiths.

The petitioners also argued against discriminatory adoption guidelines set by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). The minority view found certain CARA regulations to be precluding unmarried couples from adopting without sufficient justification. They emphasized that good or bad parenting should not be assumed based on individuals' sexuality. The majority view agreed with the discriminatory impact on queer couples but stated that legislative changes are necessary to address this issue.

Regarding the recognition of civil unions for queer couples, the minority view located the right to form intimate associations within the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. They suggested that a committee would determine the rights available to queer couples in unions. In contrast, the majority view disagreed with prescribing civil unions as a choice for queer couples, suggesting that the state should facilitate this choice if the community desires it.

Overall, the Supreme Court's Constitution Bench refused to grant legal status to same-sex marriages, emphasizing that the issue falls within the domain of the legislature rather than the judiciary. The judges provided differing opinions on various aspects related to fundamental rights, legislation interpretation, adoption guidelines, and civil unions for queer couples.

### [Why Supreme Courtâ€™s same-sex marriage verdict opens no doors for queer people](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-scs-same-sex-marriage-verdict-opens-no-doors-for-queer-people-8987899/)

In November 2022, two same-sex couples brought a case to the Supreme Court of India, arguing that their inability to marry under Indian family law violated their fundamental rights. After a 10-day hearing, the court reserved its judgment and delivered its final verdict on October 17, 2023.

The court, with a majority of three judges, addressed key questions in their separate opinions. The main issue was whether same-sex couples have the right to marry under the Indian Constitution and if the prevention of such marriages is discriminatory. The court unanimously answered both questions in the negative.

The court held that marriage is an institution established by law, and same-sex couples do not have the right to participate in it unless the law permits them to do so. The court found that the Special Marriage Act, which permits marriages only between a man and a woman, was constitutional.

The court also rejected the idea of allowing queer couples to enter into a civil union, stating that only an elected legislature has the authority to make such changes. The court acknowledged the complexity of aligning legal frameworks based on heterosexual unions with the right of queer individuals to marry.

Regarding adoption, since same-sex couples cannot legally marry in India, they cannot adopt as a couple. However, a single person within a same-sex couple could adopt a child. The court shifted the burden to the executive branch, encouraging it to reconsider adoption laws in line with the best interests of children.

In summary, the court's judgment did not recognize queer marriages or civil unions. It affirmed the right of queer individuals to choose a partner, even if it does not amount to a marriage or union. The court acknowledged the exclusion of the queer community from family laws but shifted the responsibility to the legislature to address these issues. The court directed the government to set up a committee to examine potential amendments to make the benefits of marriage available to same-sex couples.

The judgment represents a setback for the queer community, and the authors suggest that the legislature should take the lead in re-evaluating and improving Indian family law to be more inclusive and non-discriminatory.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Dutch cricket team has made history by defeating South Africa in a rain-truncated game in Dharamshala. This victory marks their first win in 50 over World Cups. Cricket was introduced to the Netherlands in the 18th century through British traders and spread through elite Dutch schools. The first written reference of the game being played in the Netherlands dates back to 1845. However, cricket in the Netherlands developed differently from British colonies, with different clubs following their own rules and ideas of the game. This lack of standardization led to embarrassing losses for the Dutch team against proper English sides. In 1884, the Nederlandsche Cricket Board (NCB) was founded to ensure proper administration of the game, making it the second international cricket association in the world after MCC. World War I brought an influx of talent to Dutch leagues, and cricket continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1930s. Despite World War II, cricket did not stop being played in the Netherlands and was seen as a demonstration of defiance against Nazi occupation. The professionalization of Dutch football in 1954 made it more accessible than cricket, leading to its decline as a popular sport. Additionally, the exclusionary policies of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which only granted Test status to England, Australia, and South Africa, further hindered the development of cricket in the Netherlands. If ICC had been more inclusive, Netherlands could have enjoyed regular international matches and seen an increase in standards and performances.

Demand for MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu remains high, but seats in the All-India quota are going vacant due to a flawed allotment system. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has called for the abolition of the All India quota. PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss highlighted that 16 MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu's government medical colleges, as well as seats in private medical colleges, remain unoccupied after four rounds of counseling. The issue stems from the National Medical Commission's (NMC) policy on student admissions. Previously, the central government conducted two counseling rounds, and unfilled seats were given to the states. However, after increasing counseling rounds to four, now unfilled seats go to waste. This has resulted in vacancies in top medical colleges, causing missed opportunities and financial losses. The situation appears to have worsened from the previous year. Despite efforts from the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) and the state selection committee, seats remain empty. Tamil Nadu contributes over 800 seats to the All India quota, and there are calls to appeal to the Supreme Court to prevent these high-demand seats from going unclaimed. Experts argue that the flawed admission policy by the central government is at the crux of the problem. The government announced in 2021 that it would no longer return any seat surrendered by state governments. While private medical colleges with high fees can admit students until the deadline, state-run colleges with lower fees are left with vacancies. PMK leader Ramadoss suggests scrapping the All India quota, as each state now has its own medical institutions.

The judges agreed that there is no fundamental right to marry under the constitution and that it is not possible to modify the special marriage act to allow same-sex marriage using gender-neutral language. Additionally, the judges expressed concern that striking down provisions of the act would negatively impact interfaith and inter-caste couples and violate the doctrine of separation of powers. However, they acknowledged that a high-level cabinet committee will consider conferring specific rights on non-heterosexual couples. The minority view, led by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, argued in favor of extending civil unions to same-sex couples and struck down guidelines by the central adoption resource authority that disallowed same-sex or unmarried couples from jointly adopting a child, stating that it is discriminatory to assume that only married, heterosexual couples can provide a safe space for raising children.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have discussed Google's plan to establish an electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India. The production of Chromebooks in India is seen as a major boost to the country's electronics manufacturing ambitions and puts Google among high-profile companies manufacturing in India. The production of Chromebooks will help Google compete with Windows computers built by Dell, Lenovo, and Asus. India aims to become a trusted partner in global supply chains, as companies worldwide look to diversify away from China. The import of electronic goods in India has increased, with China accounting for around 70-80% of Indian imports of personal computers and laptops. The Indian government has implemented policy changes to discourage imports from China and is expected to clear applications from around 30 companies to manufacture laptops and computers in India. The government has also introduced an "import management system" requiring companies to register and disclose import data, and is aiming to reduce import dependence on China by reorienting supplies from trusted sources.

The Supreme Court of India, headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, ruled unanimously against legalizing same-sex marriage in India. The court also ruled against civil unions for non-heterosexual couples in a 3:2 verdict. The Chief Justice stated that it is up to the Parliament to decide on the issue and that the Special Marriage Act cannot be struck down or interpreted differently. The focus of the petitions filed was on a gender-neutral interpretation of the Act. Justice Kaul supported the idea of civil unions for non-heterosexual couples, while all five judges agreed that there is no fundamental right to marry and that the decision should be left to the legislature. The court heard arguments for 10 days, covering topics such as equality, privacy, marriage privileges, and the impact on children. The Center, the national child rights body, and an Islamic scholars' body opposed the petitioners. The court directed the Center to ensure non-discrimination and equal access to goods and services for the queer community, as well as raise public awareness of queer rights and establish support systems. The court also issued guidelines to the police to prevent harassment of queer individuals. The Chief Justice emphasized that marriage is not a stagnant institution but stated that the court cannot change the provisions of the Special Marriage Act. Four judgments were delivered, with each judge expressing their opinion. The Chief Justice disagreed with the Center's argument that only Parliament can decide on same-sex marriage, stating that fundamental rights must be enforced. The court also referred to previous judgments that recognized LGBTQ rights, such as the 2018 ruling that decriminalized homosexuality. Same-sex marriage is recognized in 32 countries worldwide, with most countries introducing it through legislation. The hearings were live-streamed for the public, and arguments were made on the implicit right to marry for non-heterosexual couples based on equality, non-discrimination, and the right to privacy.

### [India-Sri Lanka ferry service restarted after 40 yrs: Opportunities, challenges](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-sri-lanka-ferry-service-restarted-opportunities-challenges-8986549/)

India and Sri Lanka have launched a passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu, India, and Kankesanthurai in Jaffna, northern Sri Lanka. The service aims to strengthen bilateral ties, boost tourism, and increase people-to-people relations. The ferry, named 'Cheriyapani', is a high-speed craft that operates once daily. The service is expected to benefit local traders and enhance connectivity and trade between the two nations. The resumption of ferry services between India and Sri Lanka is a revival of an age-old maritime linkage that was disrupted by the civil war in Sri Lanka. The service is expected to amplify religious tourism and boost regional commerce. The state government of Tamil Nadu is making infrastructural developments to accommodate the influx of travelers, and efforts are being made to ensure a smooth experience for passengers. The service was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who both emphasized the importance of connectivity in bringing the two countries closer. However, the success of the service will depend on its operation, and challenges such as ticket prices and booking systems need to be addressed for the service to thrive.

### [Can AAP be an accused in Delhi excise policy case? What law says](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/aap-delhi-excise-policy-case-law-8986484/)

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is considering adding the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an accused in its money laundering probe related to the Delhi government's now-scrapped excise policy. The ED is contemplating charging AAP under Section 70 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which deals with offences by companies. Although a political party is not considered a company, the provision includes an explanation that could bring a political party under the ambit of the anti-money laundering law. This would be the first instance of a political party being accused of money laundering if AAP is directly named as an accused. Political parties have previously been booked and investigated under the Income Tax Act, and trusts and NGOs are already under the PMLA ambit. The main allegation against AAP is that it was the recipient of the proceeds of crime in the excise scam. Even if cases involving individuals fall, the political party can still be prosecuted for money laundering separately. The ED's consideration to book AAP as an accused comes in response to a statement made by a bench of Supreme Court justices during a hearing seeking bail for former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India is set to deliver its verdict on a series of petitions seeking marriage equality for LGBTQIA+ couples. The hearings, which lasted for 10 days in April-May, were live-streamed for the public. The petitioners argued that marriage brings with it various rights and privileges protected by the law. They claimed that the right to marry for non-heterosexual couples is implicit in several articles of the Indian Constitution, including those related to equality, non-discrimination, and right to life. The petitioners also discussed issues such as the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ couples in marriage laws, minimum marriageable age, and the impact of such marriages on children. The respondents, including the Central government and various organizations, opposed the petitions. They argued that the Supreme Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear this case and that only Parliament can make changes to marriage laws. The respondents also raised concerns about the impact on children and the need to regulate marriages for the welfare of the child. Different states responded differently to the plea, with some opposing it and others seeking more time to consider the matter. Overall, the case involves complex legal arguments and has implications for various aspects of marriage laws in India.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has proposed in the Supreme Court to name the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as an accused in the Delhi Excise Policy case. This situation poses a dilemma for the Election Commission (EC) as there are no clear guidelines on what action should be taken when a political party is accused of illegal activity. Former officers of the poll panel state that the EC's options for punitive action against a party are limited. The EC has the power to suspend or withdraw a party's recognition, but this can only be done if the party fails to observe the model code of conduct or disregards the orders and instructions of the commission. If a party is accused of illegality, there are no specific provisions on what should be done. The option to de-register a party is also limited and can only be done if the party obtained its registration by fraud, shows a lack of faith in the constitution or principles of socialism, secularism, and democracy, or is declared unlawful by the union government under specific laws. The Representation of the People Act has no provisions for dealing with the inclusion of a political party in a case like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). There is uncertainty regarding whether the AAP can be implicated under section 70 of the PMLA, as a political party is not categorized as a company. The legal expert questions how the AAP can be implicated under this section. The article is written by Ritika Chopra, Chief of National Bureau at the Indian Express.

The Supreme Court will review a ruling by the Kerala High Court that affirmed a Muslim woman's right to pronounce extrajudicial divorce through "khula." Khula is the right of a Muslim woman to unilaterally divorce her husband, similar to talaq for Muslim men. Scholars differ on whether the husband's consent is necessary for khula. Other forms of extrajudicial divorce available to Muslim women include talaq-e-tafwiz (contract-based divorce), mubara'at (separation by mutual consent), and faskh (divorce through court intervention). The 1939 Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act clarified and consolidated the provisions of extrajudicial divorce for Muslim women, including the faskh route. The Kerala HC ruled in 2021 that Muslim women retain their right to extrajudicial divorce under the 1939 Act.

The CBDT issued a directive stating that no verification is required for start-ups recognized by the DPIIT for notices related to the amended provisions for angel tax. This clarification comes after many start-ups expressed concerns about receiving scrutiny notices for angel tax. The CBDT outlined two scenarios for start-ups selected under scrutiny: in the first scenario, no verification will be done for the issue of applicability of section 56 (2) (viib) of the Income Tax Act, and the contention of the start-up companies on the issue will be accepted. In the second scenario, the issue of applicability of the mentioned section will not be pursued during the assessment proceedings. The finance act proposed to extend angel tax to non-resident investors from April 1, 2023. The DPIIT-recognized start-ups were previously excluded from angel tax.

China has expressed its opposition to acts that harm civilians and called for a ceasefire and the establishment of an independent State of Palestine. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized Israel's actions and expressed support for the Palestinians' just cause. China's stance is rooted in its strategic and economic interests in West Asia and its initial opposition to Israel as a US ally. By aligning with Arab nations' support for Palestine, China seeks to secure regional allies and criticize Western powers' involvement. China has positioned itself as an alternative to the US through diplomatic engagement, brokering normalization agreements between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hosting Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas. China recognizes the PA as the representative of the Palestinian people and advocates for a two-state solution based on 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. China has made significant investments in infrastructure projects in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative. Despite growing economic ties with Israel, China has criticized Israel's role in Palestine, while Israel has condemned Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

South Africa has a long history of supporting Palestine due to its own experience with discrimination and disempowerment during apartheid. However, over time, many African nations, including South Africa, softened their stance towards Israel as more Arab countries recognized the Jewish state and saw the benefits of trade and technological advancements. Despite this, South Africa has remained steadfast in its support for Palestine, citing its deep links with anti-discrimination activism and a resistance to Western influence on global issues. Last year, South Africa declared Israel an apartheid state and downgraded its embassy in Israel to a liaison office in March of this year.

The article discusses the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel has issued a warning to Palestinians to leave northern Gaza, indicating a possible ground invasion to target Hamas. The article highlights the potential humanitarian catastrophe that could occur due to the dense population in Gaza, with innocent civilians being the most affected. It also mentions that Israel does not have a clear plan for what comes next if they were to destroy Hamas, and the reoccupation of the Strip could lead to more loss of lives and resistance from smaller groups. The Israelis are pushing for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt and the Sinai desert, but Egypt rejects this plan. The article criticizes the unconditional support from the West to the Israeli operation, which many human rights groups consider to be war crimes. It emphasizes that Hamas is deeply integrated into Palestinian society and enjoys significant support, making it difficult to eliminate completely. The article also discusses the implications of the conflict on the peace process between Israel and Arab nations, particularly the potential US-led deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Abraham Accords have been discredited in the eyes of many Arabs due to the situation in Gaza, leading to the freezing of talks of normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The article includes insights from Khaled Al Hroub, a scholar of the Middle East, who discusses the history and role of Hamas in Palestinian society.

The 2023 Nobel Prize for Peace has been awarded to Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian womenâ€™s rights activist, for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all. Mohammadi is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Iran for charges including spreading propaganda against the state. The Norwegian Nobel Committee also mentioned the 2022 protests in Iran following the killing of Mahsa Amini, stating that the protests' motto "Woman - Life - Freedom" reflects Mohammadi's dedication and work. Mohammadi's quote, "Women will not give up. We are fueled by a will to survive, whether we are inside prison or outside," emphasizes the strength and determination of women in their struggle against patriarchy. Born into a politically active family, Mohammadi has been involved in activism since the 1990s and has faced multiple arrests and convictions. She has campaigned against the death penalty and published a book on solitary confinement. The recent protests in Iran after Amini's death highlighted women's frustration with years of regulations, including mandatory hijab wearing.

### [Why Putin has compared Israelâ€™s actions in Gaza to the Nazi siege of Leningrad](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/putin-israel-gaza-nazi-siege-leningrad-8983106/)

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently warned Israel against besieging Gaza in a manner reminiscent of Nazi Germany's siege of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad, which occurred between 1941 and 1944, resulted in the deaths of around 1.5 million civilians, leading some scholars to describe it as a genocide due to the deliberate starvation and destruction of the city's population. Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union, included the devastating siege of Leningrad. The city was strategically and symbolically important to the Soviets, who mobilized citizens and soldiers to defend it. The siege lasted for 872 days and involved constant shelling, famine, and harsh weather conditions. Approximately 650,000 residents of Leningrad died in 1942 alone, with around 100,000 perishing each month during the peak winter. Ultimately, 1.5 million people lost their lives during the siege, with an additional 500,000 dying during evacuation attempts. The tragedy of Leningrad was on a scale greater than the combined casualties of the United States and Britain in the entire war. German forces targeted civilians by cutting off supplies, leading to widespread starvation. Some desperate individuals even resorted to cannibalism. Putin's personal connection to the siege, as his brother died during that time, likely contributes to his invocation of this historical event. His mother also experienced near-starvation during the siege.

Israel is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to wipe out the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The country's military has told 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza to evacuate within 24 hours, and has deployed tens of thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery on the edge of the territory. Israel has been bombarding Gaza since Hamas attacked on October 7, dropping over 6,000 bombs so far. It has also mobilized 360,000 troops and enforced a naval blockade to cut off supplies to Hamas. If a large-scale invasion is ordered, Israel would likely divide Gaza in two and target Hamas leaders and infrastructure. However, urban warfare and the difficulty of distinguishing fighters from civilians pose challenges for Israeli troops. The implications of an invasion are uncertain for Israel, but it would be a catastrophe for Gaza, where infrastructure has been destroyed and there is little electricity or means of escape.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case regarding a married woman's request to end her 26-week pregnancy. The case has raised important questions about a woman's right to choose and the legislative framework surrounding abortion in India. Two key ideas that have come up during the hearings are "foetal viability" and the rights of the unborn child. Foetal viability refers to the point at which a foetus can survive outside the womb, and it has been argued that this is an arbitrary standard. The Indian legal framework leans towards a woman's autonomy to decide and choose, but there is criticism that the decision to terminate after 20 weeks is left to doctors rather than the woman herself. The case will continue on October 16, and a fresh medical report has been requested by the court.

### [What the 2023 Nobel Economics Prize winner says on womenâ€™s aspirations, role in workforce and pay gap](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/economics-laureates-book-charts-womens-aspirations-role-in-workforce-8982036/)

Claudia Goldin, an economist and winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, explores the history of college-educated women in the United States in her book "Career & Family: Womenâ€™s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity." She examines how women's aspirations and circumstances have changed over time, highlighting the ongoing problem of women feeling short-changed in their careers compared to their husbands and male colleagues. Goldin attributes this problem to sex discrimination, gender bias, and the glass ceiling. However, she suggests that even if these issues were to disappear, the problem would still persist due to the underlying system at play.

The book categorizes women who graduated from college into five groups ranging from the 1900s to the 1990s. Goldin explores how their aspirations shifted over time, from having to choose between a career and family, to sacrificing one for the other, to ultimately aspiring for both equally. She attributes these shifts to factors such as laws that initially prohibited women and married women from working, which later changed with increased job demand after the Great Depression and the "baby boom" era following World War II.

The introduction of the birth control pill in 1960 allowed women to delay childbirth and marriage, leading to greater enrollment in post-graduate courses and aspirations for long-term careers rather than just jobs. The feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s also played a role in increasing women's participation in the workforce, contributing significantly to economic growth.

Goldin emphasizes the tension between work and caregiving responsibilities as a major challenge faced by women today. This challenge impacts women's career goals and contributes to the gender pay gap. While previous explanations attributed the pay gap to differences in fields of study and occupational choices, Goldin argues that it expands as men and women age, get married, and have children.

The root of the problem, according to Goldin, is the prevalence of "greedy work," referring to careers that demand extensive time and attention, such as doctors, lawyers, and senior corporate executives. Greedy jobs heavily reward individuals who are available at all times, creating an imbalance between work and family life. Goldin asserts that addressing this issue requires changing the existing work and care structures, which she considers relics of a time when men were the only ones who could have both careers and families.

One part of the solution involves making rewarding, well-paying work more flexible in terms of hours and allowing for time-offs. Goldin cites fields like veterinary medicine in the US as examples of how this flexibility has been implemented to some extent. Remote work, which became more prevalent during the pandemic, also provides a potential solution.

Men play a crucial role in achieving gender equality at work and in caregiving. Goldin emphasizes the importance of men supporting their male colleagues on parental leave, advocating for public policies that subsidize childcare, and pressuring their firms to adopt more flexible practices. Ultimately, Goldin calls for a reimagination of work and care to allow both men and women to have fulfilling careers and family lives.

It mentions that approximately 150 Israelis, mostly civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, were taken hostage and are currently held in multiple locations in Gaza. The fate of these hostages remains unknown as an Israeli ground assault is imminent. The article also provides historical context, stating that hostage-taking has been a common tactic in unconventional warfare and has been used by terrorist groups for various purposes such as political concessions, ransom, attracting international attention, and inspiring further terrorism. It highlights previous instances of hostage-taking in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the Munich massacre in 1972 and the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Private Shalit by Hamas in 2011. The article also explores different approaches to hostage situations by various countries, such as the US and UK's policy of no negotiations with terrorists, France and Europe reportedly paying ransom for kidnapped journalists, and instances where negotiations or military operations were used to free hostages. It emphasizes the challenges and risks involved in a potential Israeli ground offensive to rescue the hostages, as well as the need for negotiations involving countries like Iran. The article concludes by providing examples of notable hostage crises throughout history, including the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, the hijacking of TWA flight 847 in 1985, and the Beslan school siege in 2004.

### [What is Israelâ€™s new â€˜unity governmentâ€™ overseeing the military campaign in Gaza?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-unity-government-gaza-8981806/)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formed an emergency unity government with opposition leader Benny Gantz to oversee the ongoing war with Hamas. The unity government aims to bring together political rivals to keep Netanyahu out of power. The agreement includes Gantz and members of his Blue and White party joining forces with Netanyahu's far-right ruling coalition. An emergency war cabinet has been formed, consisting of Netanyahu, Gantz, and Yoav Gallant from the Likud party. The unity government will serve for the duration of the war, during which crucial decisions regarding the conduct of the war will be made. Legislation unrelated to the war will be put on hold. Some opposition parties, including Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid, have chosen not to join the unity government due to their opposition to Netanyahu's far-right allies. The ruling coalition includes ultra-Orthodox allies and a far-right faction, including controversial figures such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, known for their anti-liberal and anti-democratic views.

### [Which nation can mediate in Hamas-Israel conflict?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/which-nation-mediate-hamas-israel-conflict-8981745/)

The article discusses the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas in the aftermath of a terror attack. Israel has conducted massive airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, resulting in a high death toll. The Israeli government has also imposed a siege on Gaza and is attempting to free hostages held by Hamas. The militant group Hezbollah has supported Hamas by firing rockets into Israel, while extremist settlers have killed Palestinian civilians. There are concerns that the conflict could lead to a broader war involving other Middle Eastern countries. Various international actors, including the US, European nations, Russia, and China, have expressed a desire to help facilitate negotiations and establish a ceasefire. However, it is emphasized that Middle Eastern countries should take the lead in resolving the crisis. Egypt plays a crucial role as it shares a border with Gaza and is involved in providing humanitarian aid. Jordan has a history of involvement in the region and supports a two-state solution. Qatar, with its close ties to Hamas, is leading efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Turkey, which does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization, has also offered to mediate. Overall, the situation remains volatile, with concerns about further displacement and refugees seeking safety across borders.

### [What is Australiaâ€™s Indigenous Voice referendum?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/australia-indigenous-voice-referendum-explained-8981365/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A referendum will be held in Australia on October 14 to determine whether the country's indigenous peoples should be formally consulted in the decision-making process for laws. The referendum question asks if the constitution should be altered to recognize the first peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. However, a recent YouGov poll suggests that the referendum is unlikely to pass. Indigenous Australians are not mentioned in the country's constitution, and the referendum aims to address this by proposing the establishment of an Indigenous "voice to parliament" to advise lawmakers on matters affecting their lives. Aboriginal people in Australia face various socio-economic challenges, including lower life expectancy, higher rates of disease and infant mortality, and a suicide rate twice as high as non-indigenous Australians. Supporters argue that the proposed body would provide a voice for the original inhabitants of the continent and address the legacy of failed programs and broken policies. The history of the indigenous communities in Australia has been marked by marginalization resulting from laws and policies implemented by colonial settlers. The opposition parties, including the Liberal Party and Nationals, have opposed the referendum, citing concerns about unclear details regarding the proposed body and the potential for dividing Australian society along racial lines. Some indigenous people have also rejected the idea of a consultative body, advocating instead for a formal treaty that transfers substantial power between the government and indigenous people.

### [An Expert Explains: Why did Hamas attack now, what does it say about Israeli intelligence?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-did-hamas-attack-now-what-does-it-say-about-israeli-intelligence-8980558/)

The article discusses the military conflict between Israel and the Gaza Strip-based militant group Hamas, highlighting some key factors and background information. The conflict is seen as unprecedented due to Hamas's ability to breach advanced border fencing mechanisms and intelligence capabilities. Hamas was founded in 1987 as a political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood and has significant influence in the Palestinian territories, particularly in Gaza. The group has carried out rocket attacks against Israel and developed expertise in digging military tunnels. Hamas considers Israel its sworn enemy and aims for its destruction.

The article also mentions the reciprocal accusations between the parties involved, with Israel being accused of acts of terrorism and violating international law by encouraging Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The lack of progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the perception that the conflict is now more of an Israel-Palestinian issue contribute to the frustration among Palestinians. Additionally, Israel's hardline government and talk of expanding settlements have exacerbated tensions.

The article suggests that Hamas's attack on Israel, codenamed "Al-Aqsa Flood," may be a response to the desecration of the Al-Aqsa mosque complex and an attempt to convey that Jerusalem is undividable. There is also speculation that Hamas aims to disrupt the possible Israeli-Saudi agreement for normalization by provoking heavy retaliation. The author points out the blow to Israel's intelligence apparatus and raises questions about potential failures in coordination between the government and military-security officials.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for Israel to reassess its counter-terrorism and intelligence strategies in light of this conflict.

### [What war crimes laws apply to the Israel-Palestinian conflict?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-war-crimes-laws-apply-to-the-israel-palestinian-conflict-8980317/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The recent conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces, sparked by the assault from the militant group Hamas, has resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides. The conflict falls under an international system of justice that has evolved since World War II. The rules governing this conflict are based on the internationally accepted principles of armed conflict, as outlined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions. These conventions have been ratified by all UN member states and have been supplemented by rulings from international war crimes tribunals. These rules, collectively known as the "law of armed conflict" or "international humanitarian law," apply to government forces, organized armed groups, and Hamas militants.

If alleged perpetrators of atrocities in Israel, including Palestinians, or alleged crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories are not brought to justice locally, the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is the only international legal body that can bring charges. While domestic courts can exercise universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases, its scope is limited. The ICC derives its legal authority from the Rome Statute and can investigate alleged crimes on the territories of its member states or committed by their nationals when domestic authorities are "unwilling or unable" to do so. The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor has confirmed that its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict and is currently collecting information.

The ICC, established in 2002, is the world's permanent war crimes tribunal. It has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in its 123 member states or committed by their nationals. However, major powers such as China, the United States, Russia, India, and Egypt are not members. While the ICC recognizes Palestine as a member state, Israel rejects the court's jurisdiction and does not engage with it formally. Due to budget and staff constraints, ICC prosecutors are already investigating 17 cases in different countries, and the budget for investigations in the Palestinian territories for 2023 is just under a million euros ($1.06 million).

The ICC has been conducting an ongoing investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupied Palestinian territories since 2021 but has not yet issued any arrest warrants. Prosecutors have stated that there is a reasonable basis to believe that violations have been committed by all sides, including Israeli troops, Hamas militants, and other armed Palestinian groups.

Acts that could potentially violate war crimes law include the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate rocket attacks, taking civilians as hostages by Palestinian armed groups, and the Israeli counter-strikes in Gaza resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians. The deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are deemed heinous crimes by human rights organizations, with no justification. Violations such as the taking of hostages, murder, and torture are explicitly prohibited under the Geneva Conventions. Israel's response to the conflict could also be subject to a war crimes investigation, particularly concerning the announcement of a tightened blockade and the possibility of a ground invasion to destroy Hamas.

US President Joe Biden has stated that Israel has the right and duty to respond but emphasized the importance of acting according to the rule of law. A siege can be considered a war crime if it targets civilians instead of being a legitimate means to undermine Hamas' military capabilities or if it is deemed disproportionate. Under international law, attacks on military objectives must be proportional and should not lead to excessive loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects compared to the expected military advantage. A defense lawyer at the ICC highlighted the gruesome killings by Hamas militants, such as the attack on a dance rave and civilians in kibbutz communities near the Gaza border, as potential focuses for a war crimes case.

### [Why China has assisted Sri Lanka over debt worth $4.2 billion](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-sri-lanka-debt-deal-imf-explained-8980203/)

Sri Lanka has reached an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to cover $4.2 billion of its outstanding debt, as the country continues to grapple with an economic crisis. China is the largest bilateral creditor to Sri Lanka, having lent $7 billion of the country's total foreign debt of $42 billion. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka was caused by factors such as tax cuts, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on tourism, and fuel shortages due to the war in Ukraine. Sri Lanka has also sought assistance from India, including a $500 million credit line for fuel and a $1 billion credit line for importing essentials. In September 2022, Sri Lanka qualified for a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but this loan is contingent on securing financing assurances for debt sustainability from its creditors through negotiations and debt restructuring. Sri Lanka has asked for a 30% reduction in the value of its outstanding debt and hopes to reduce its overall debt by $16.9 billion through restructuring. Negotiations between Sri Lanka and countries including Japan, India, and France for a debt rework deal did not go through in September 2023. The agreement with China's EXIM Bank will help Sri Lanka secure the release of the second tranche of about $334 million from the IMF and provide fiscal space for implementing reform measures. China's assistance to Sri Lanka will be seen as another way it is deepening ties with the country, which has joined China's Belt and Road Initiative. India has concerns about China's increasing presence in its neighborhood and fears it could lead to increased Chinese military presence and surveillance in the region.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh recently visited the VC Yeshwant Ghadge Sundial Memorial in Montone, Italy to pay tribute to Indian soldiers who fought in World War II. This visit highlights the shared military history between India and Italy during the campaign to liberate Italy. The soldiers' contributions had been largely ignored until Italy opened the memorial earlier this year. Naik Yeshwant Ghadge, a 23-year-old soldier, played a significant role in the Italian campaign. Despite facing heavy machine gun fire, Ghadge charged at the enemy and neutralized their position, even though he suffered fatal injuries. For his bravery, he posthumously received the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honor. Indian soldiers made up the third-largest Allied contingent in Italy, with 50,000 soldiers and over 5,000 casualties. They played a crucial role in various battles, including Monte Cassino and breaching the Gothic Line. The Indian Army's professionalism and successes in the Italian campaigns gained recognition from Allied commanders.

### [Why Odisha govtâ€™s new rural development scheme has triggered a controversy](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/odisha-govts-rural-development-scheme-controversy-8980142/)

Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has launched a new scheme called 'Ama Odisha, Nabin Odisha' ahead of the upcoming General and Assembly elections in 2024. The scheme aims to provide assistance of Rs 50 lakh to every panchayat in the state for various projects, including the protection of places of worship, upgrading historical sites, improving rural infrastructure, and enhancing digital access. This initiative builds on the success of the 'Ama Gaon, Ama Bikash' scheme, which helped the ruling BJD party secure a fifth consecutive term in the previous Assembly elections. Under the new scheme, funds are allocated based on suggestions from rural residents through video conferencing. However, the opposition BJP has raised concerns about the use of the ruling party's electoral symbol in government advertisements for the scheme and has questioned the timing of its launch. The BJP MLA has accused the government of not following proper guidelines and has threatened to challenge the use of the symbol in court.

### [Large ozone hole detected over Antarctica: Is it a matter of concern?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/large-ozone-hole-antarctica-explained-8979396/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Satellite measurements taken by the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite have detected a large hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. The hole, which is referred to as an "ozone-depleted area," is 26 million square kilometers in size, approximately three times the size of Brazil. This is one of the largest ozone holes ever observed. The ozone layer acts as a protective shield against ultraviolet radiation, reducing the risk of skin cancer. The size of the ozone hole over Antarctica varies each year, opening in August and closing in November or December. This year's large ozone hole is believed to be a result of volcanic eruptions in Tonga, which released water vapor and other elements that can deplete ozone. However, human activities, particularly the use of chlorofluorocarbons, were responsible for creating significant ozone holes in the past. The Montreal Protocol was established in 1987 to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances, which has led to a reduction in ozone holes. While ozone depletion is not a primary cause of global climate change, there are indications that rising global temperatures could impact ozone holes. Additionally, ozone holes may contribute to cooling effects and alter the progression of seasons.

### [In law change: a push for electric vehicles, less dependence on battery imports](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-new-royalty-rates-for-strategic-minerals-lithium-rees-can-help-cut-their-imports-8978912/)

The Indian government has amended a key law to specify competitive royalty rates for the mining of three strategically significant minerals: lithium, niobium, and rare earth elements (REEs). This decision follows the removal of six minerals, including lithium and niobium, from the list of specified atomic minerals, which opens the possibility for private sector participation through auctioning of concessions for these minerals. The move is aimed at encouraging domestic mining to reduce imports of these minerals and promote the development of industries such as electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage solutions. The lower royalty rates, set at 3% for lithium and niobium and 1% for REEs, align India's rates with global benchmarks and will help attract bidders to the auctions.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses India's relationship with Israel and Palestine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with Israel during the recent Hamas assault and India's Ministry of External Affairs mentioned Palestinians for the first time in a statement. The article explores India's historical perspective on Palestine, including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's support for a federal state and Mahatma Gandhi's opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine. India recognized Israel in 1950 but did not establish diplomatic relations until 1992 due to the Cold War dynamics and India's alignment with the Soviet Union. However, India's support for Palestine has since toned down, and the country has developed a closer relationship with Israel, especially in the defense sector. The article suggests that India's support for Israel may be driven by a desire for stronger action against cross-border terrorism. While India officially supports the two-state solution, its growing closeness to Israel has raised concerns among Palestinians. However, the article argues that Arab countries have lost interest in the Palestinian cause, and India's relationship with them is unlikely to be affected.

The article discusses the impact of the conflict between Israel and Hamas on the global markets. Initially, there was uncertainty and a sell-off in the markets, but as the scope of the war became clearer, markets recovered. The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty Index in India experienced fluctuations throughout the week, but overall, they showed resilience. The Dow Jones index in the US also gained points. The recovery was attributed to factors such as the resilience of the US economy, declining US bond yields, and the hope that the conflict would remain localized and not impact crude prices. However, concerns remain about the potential spread of the conflict to other countries and the impact on oil prices. Investors are advised to remain cautious, but indications suggest that the prevailing tone will continue. Inflation rates in India and the US, as well as corporate performance, are also factors influencing the markets.

### [Is Chinaâ€™s investment in Pakistan slowing down?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-investment-pakistan-8978474/)

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project, specifically the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), appears to have stalled, according to recent reports. The CPEC, which was signed in 2015, aims to develop rail and road links to facilitate the shipping of Chinese goods through Pakistan into the Arabian Sea. However, China has shown reluctance to fund several requested CPEC projects due to economic concerns and its own recent slowdown. Experts believe that the actual outcomes of the CPEC in Pakistan have fallen short of expectations, with limited tangible benefits for the Pakistani people and a surge in public debt to Chinese companies. Pakistan's political instability, following the ouster of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, is seen as a concern for China, as it risks unrest and violence that could threaten Chinese nationals and interests in Pakistan. Security threats to Chinese workers in Pakistan are also worrying China, with incidents such as militant attacks on Chinese engineers and workers. These security concerns could jeopardize new investments and the completion of projects. Despite these challenges, some believe that the CPEC is moving forward as planned, while others assert that security concerns and political instability could impede progress on the project.

Israel's defence minister has ordered a complete siege of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity, food, water, and fuel. The article explains that Gaza has been under an air, land, and sea blockade since 2007 and is often referred to as an "open air prison" due to the conditions created by the occupation and blockade. It provides a brief history of Gaza's occupation by Israel since 1967 and the withdrawal of Israeli settlements in 2005. The article also highlights the physical barriers surrounding Gaza, including walls and border crossings controlled by Israel and Egypt. It emphasizes the densely populated and impoverished nature of Gaza, with high unemployment rates, food insecurity, and aid dependency. The blockade has also made it difficult for people from Gaza to travel to the West Bank for medical treatment or other purposes. The term "open air prison" is used by UN experts, intellectuals, rights groups, and even former British Prime Minister David Cameron to describe the situation in Gaza.

Cheng Lei, a China-born Australian journalist, has returned home after being detained in China for over three years on suspicion of illegally supplying state secrets overseas. Her release was welcomed by Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who stated that her return would be warmly welcomed by all Australians. Cheng had a successful journalism career and worked for various media outlets in China and Singapore. She suddenly disappeared from Chinese television in August 2020 and was later announced to be held on national security grounds without formal charges or access to a lawyer. Cheng's trial began behind closed doors in March 2022, and the verdict has not been made public. Her detention occurred during a turbulent period in China-Australia relations, but tensions have since simmered down with the removal of tariffs and the resumption of ministerial visits. The timing of Cheng's release suggests that politics played a role in China's handling of her case.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The recent attack on Israel has brought attention not only to Hamas but also to other significant players in Palestine, such as Fatah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and Palestinian Authority (PA). Let's take a quick look at each of them and their roles in the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Fatah, meaning "to conquer," was formed in the late 1950s in Kuwait. It was established by key figures like Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas with the objective of armed struggle against Israel to liberate Palestine. Fatah's military operations began in 1965 and were carried out from Jordan and Lebanon. In 1968, Fatah became part of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which aimed to achieve statehood for Palestine through armed resistance. However, Fatah later transformed its approach and started negotiating with Israel. In the 1990s, Fatah-led PLO renounced armed resistance and signed the Oslo Accords, which established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) or Palestinian Authority (PA) as an interim self-governing body leading to an independent Palestinian state. Currently, Fatah heads the PA, governing about 40% of the occupied West Bank.

Hamas, founded in the late 1980s, is another major political party in Palestine known for its ongoing armed struggle against Israel. Like Fatah, Hamas aims to establish a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967. However, unlike Fatah, Hamas has not recognized the statehood of Israel. Since 2006, Hamas has been ruling the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second-largest militant group in Palestine, aiming to destroy Israel and establish an Islamic Palestinian state through force. It was established in 1981 by members of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and is believed to receive financial support from Iran. Though Hamas and PIJ are allies, they have separate identities and some differences. PIJ has mainly focused on armed struggle but also participated in student politics and legislative elections.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was conceived in 1964 with the goal of liberating Palestine through armed struggle. It is a coalition of smaller Arab groups, with Fatah being the dominant one. PLO was recognized by the Arab League and the United Nations as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people." In the early 1990s, PLO gave up armed struggle and recognized the statehood of Israel, which led to the rise of Hamas.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) was founded in 1994 as an interim body to govern parts of Gaza and the West Bank. It functions as an agency of the PLO and is led by a directly-elected president, currently Mahmoud Abbas. In 2006, Hamas won the legislative elections and took control of the Gaza Strip, while the PA continued to govern parts of the West Bank.

These various groups and organizations play significant roles in the complex Israel-Palestine conflict, each with its own history, objectives, and approach.

### [What the hottest September ever reveals about climate change](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-the-hottest-september-ever-reveals-about-climate-change-8977093/)

September 2023 has been confirmed as the hottest September on record, continuing the trend of record-breaking temperatures seen throughout this year. Scientists had predicted that 2023 would be exceptionally warm due to the development of El Nino in the Pacific Ocean. The remaining three months of the year are also expected to be warmer than usual. July 2023 was not only the warmest July ever recorded, but also the warmest month overall. June, February, March, April, and May all experienced average temperatures that ranked among the highest ever for those respective months. The period between June and August was the warmest on record globally. September 2023 stood out by being significantly warmer than both pre-industrial times and a more contemporary baseline. The Secretary-General of the World Meteorology Organisation expressed concern about the ongoing warming trend and its impacts on the environment and society. It is anticipated that 2023 will surpass 2016 as the warmest year on record, with fears that it may breach the 1.5 degree Celsius mark for the first time. Despite these alarming trends, there has been little policy response from countries to address climate change. Only a significant global disruption could make a noticeable difference in reducing temperatures in the short term. The world is likely to exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius target within four years if current trends continue. The promise to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, made at a recent G20 meeting, is considered insufficient to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions adequately. At an upcoming climate change meeting in Dubai, countries will assess global climate action and its adequacy in relation to temperature goals. It is hoped that this assessment will prompt more energetic climate action from nations.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Baiga Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Chhattisgarh, India, has been granted habitat rights ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. This makes them the second PVTG to receive these rights in the state, following the Kamar PVTG. A total of 19 Baiga villages with a population of 6,483 people have been given habitat rights. Habitat rights recognition provides the community with rights over their customary territory, socio-cultural practices, livelihood means, and protection of their natural and cultural heritage. These rights are granted under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. The Baiga community primarily resides in various districts of Chhattisgarh and neighboring Madhya Pradesh. Only three out of 75 PVTGs in India currently have habitat rights. Chhattisgarh has seven PVTGs living in 17 districts, with a total population of 2.50 lakh. The government determines habitats based on consultations with tribal leaders and verification by relevant departments. The process of granting habitat rights began in December 2021, starting with the Kamar tribes as a pilot project.

### [Washington rallies behind Israel: Why a lasting consensus may prove elusive](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/washington-rallies-israel-democrats-republicans-consensus-8976826/)

The recent surprise attack by Hamas on Israel has brought together politicians in the United States, who have been divided on the issue of support for Israel. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed condemnation of Hamas and solidarity with Israel following the killing of Israeli civilians. However, as Israel retaliates with airstrikes and a potential ground invasion, some Democrats on the left have criticized Israel for its treatment of Palestinians. This current unity in support for Israel may be tested as the conflict continues and Israeli forces employ more firepower. The Biden administration has declared Israel's right to defend itself and is providing military aid. The sensitivity of the situation is evident in mixed signals sent by the administration, which were subsequently deleted due to backlash. The article highlights that while there is bipartisan support for retaliation against Hamas, there are concerns about the impact of the response on the civilian population in Gaza. The article also discusses the evolving partisan divide on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Washington, with Republicans solidly supporting Israel and Democrats being more divided on the issue. President Biden, despite his past differences with Netanyahu, has offered unwavering support for Israel in the current crisis. Some dissenting voices among Democrats have called for an end to U.S. support for Israel's military occupation and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza. However, there are Democrats who strongly condemn these views and emphasize the importance of standing with Israel as an ally in the region. The article concludes by noting that the involvement of Americans in the conflict adds another dimension and suggests that there may be little sympathy for those who do not prioritize protecting Israel and standing up to terrorists.

### [SC to hear petition challenging electoral bonds: What is the scheme and its criticisms?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/sc-petition-challenging-electoral-bonds-explained-criticism-8976353/)

The Supreme Court has announced that it will hear petitions challenging India's electoral bonds scheme on October 31. Introduced in 2018, electoral bonds are interest-free bearer instruments that allow anonymous donations to political parties. They can be purchased in various denominations from authorized branches of the State Bank of India. Political parties have 15 days to encash the bonds and use the funds for electoral expenses. If the bonds are not encashed within the timeframe, the money is deposited into the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. The scheme has faced legal challenges, with critics arguing that it lacks transparency and allows unlimited corporate funding. They also claim that the anonymity of donors under the scheme can be exploited for unfair advantage. Additionally, it has been noted that a majority of the electoral bonds have gone to the ruling party, the BJP, raising concerns about impartiality.

### [Hamas may have hit â€” or killed â€” a brewing Israel-Saudi agreement: hereâ€™s how](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/hamas-attack-israel-saudi-agreement-palestine-explained-8976056/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The recent attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel may be linked to ongoing negotiations between Israel and Saudi Arabia for the normalization of ties. The potential deal, mediated by the United States, would see Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel for the first time and receiving security guarantees from the US in exchange. It would also bring economic benefits to Israel and political gains for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US is motivated by concerns over growing Chinese influence in the region and hopes to improve relations with Saudi Arabia. The Palestinians are not directly involved in the negotiations, but Saudi Arabia has indicated that a deal is possible even without providing Palestinians an independent state. The US wants the deal to be finalized before the next presidential elections in November 2022, and Iran's refusal to halt its nuclear program adds urgency to strengthening ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The Israel-Hamas conflict has disrupted the timeline of the deal and triggered sympathy for Palestinians in the Arab world, casting doubt on its chances of being finalized soon. Some believe Iran played a role in encouraging Hamas to launch the attack, although there is no concrete evidence of Iranian involvement.

### [Why Mahatma Gandhi opposed a Jewish nation-state in Palestine](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/gandhi-opposed-jewish-nation-state-palestine-8975964/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article discusses Mahatma Gandhi's views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Gandhi expressed sympathy for the Jewish people, acknowledging their historical persecution and the parallels between their treatment and that of the untouchables in Hinduism. He even stated that a war against Germany to prevent the persecution of Jews would be justified. However, Gandhi opposed the creation of a Zionist state in Palestine. He believed that imposing Jews on the Arabs would be wrong and inhumane. Gandhi argued that the settlement of Jews in Palestine should occur only with the goodwill of the Arab Palestinians, without the aid of force. He also believed that a Jewish homeland in Palestine would hinder the fight for Jewish rights elsewhere. Gandhi's stance on this issue influenced India's foreign policy for many years and shaped the perspective of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. India voted against the partition of Palestine in the United Nations and only established diplomatic relations with Israel much later, in 1992.

Claudia Goldin, a professor of economics at Harvard University, has won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for 2023. She has been awarded the prize for her contributions to understanding women's labor market outcomes. Goldin's research has provided insights into the causes of the gender gap in earnings and labor market participation over centuries. She has demonstrated that the relationship between economic growth and women's involvement in the labor market is not linear and that historical and social factors play a significant role. Goldin's work also highlights the impact of education, marriage, and childbirth on women's career opportunities. Her research has shed light on the barriers that need to be addressed to achieve gender equality in the labor market. This recognition marks a significant achievement for Goldin, who has been a trailblazer in studying the role of women in the economy.

### [Why is Israel an attractive destination for Indian caregivers?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-is-israel-an-attractive-destination-for-indian-caregivers-8975296/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the concerns in India about the safety of its expatriate population in Israel, particularly the estimated 14,000 Indian caregivers who work there. The job of a caregiver in Israel is attractive due to the high pay and benefits, such as free food, accommodation, and healthcare. Caregivers in Israel have specific facilities in their clients' homes and typically only look after one person. They are also allowed to change employers after a year of employment or if their client passes away. To become a caregiver in Israel, one does not need to be a nursing graduate but can have completed an ANM or GNM course. Language proficiency tests are required before recruitment, and short-term courses in Hebrew are available. The flow of caregivers from India to Israel began in the mid-1990s when the government enacted a law providing home care for the elderly and disabled. The recruitment process starts when an Israeli citizen or their family raises a demand for a caregiver with local government authorities. Caregivers are paid directly by employers or through health insurance. Many Indian nursing professionals choose to work in Israel due to low salaries and limited opportunities in Indian hospitals.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent violence between Israel and Hamas, which began when Hamas launched an attack on Israel. The toll has surpassed 1,100 and thousands have been injured on both sides. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have also taken over 130 people from Israel and brought them to Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, stated that the attack was in response to the blockade of Gaza and Israeli occupation. Deif, who has been the head of Hamas' military wing since 2002, was born in Gaza and joined the Islamic University of Gaza. He was involved in suicide bombings in the 1990s and narrowly escaped multiple assassination attempts by Israel. The US State Department has designated him as a terrorist. Deif has targeted high-impact locations such as settlements, soldiers, and buses. He is said to be in a wheelchair and has lost an arm, a leg, and possibly an eye.

Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University professor, has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for her work on women's labor market outcomes. Goldin's research has focused on women's participation in the labor market over the past two centuries and the persistent gender pay gap. She found that older data revealed a history of women's involvement in economic activities related to agriculture and cottage industries before industrialization. The growth of the services sector in the early 20th century, along with factors such as marriage and the contraceptive pill, influenced women's access to higher education and employment opportunities. Goldin highlighted that legislation and societal expectations limited married women's employment prospects, and the introduction of contraceptive pills allowed women to plan their careers and motherhood. Despite women catching up in terms of education and employment fields, the gender pay gap persists. Goldin and her co-authors demonstrated that the pay gap widens when women have children, as they face slower career advancements. This Nobel Prize in Economics is not a part of Alfred Nobel's original will but was established through a donation from Sweden's central bank in 1968. Goldin is the third woman to receive this honor.

### [In Israel-Palestine conflict, why Hamas and Hezbollah have raised the issue of â€˜normalisationâ€™](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-palestine-conflict-hamas-hezbollah-normalisation-explained-8973995/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the recent attack by Hamas on Israel and its connection to the concept of "normalization" in the region. "Normalization" refers to the efforts to establish diplomatic relations and normalize ties between Israel and other Muslim countries in West Asia. The attack by Hamas is believed to be a response to these attempts at normalization.

The Israel-Palestine conflict is rooted in the shared claim of both Jews and Palestinians to the land of Palestine, which is now Israel. The dispute also encompasses cultural, ethnic, and religious aspects that are integral to the identity of both sides. The city of Jerusalem holds particular significance for Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, making it a focal point of the conflict.

The article provides a brief historical overview, highlighting the partition plan proposed by the United Nations in 1947, which was rejected by Arab parties, leading to the first war in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Israel declared its establishment as a state in 1948, and Arab armies invaded the next day. The war resulted in Israel capturing a significant portion of the former Mandatory Palestine, with Jordan annexing the West Bank and Egypt gaining control of the Gaza Strip.

Efforts have been made over the years to establish a two-state solution, but none have been universally accepted. The Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, proposed the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, which called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories and the recognition of East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state. However, it was not until recently that progress towards normalization began to materialize.

Factors such as the Arab Spring protests, the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, and the signing of the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco have contributed to the process of normalization. These developments have been influenced by shifting geopolitics, including concerns about an expansionist Iran and China's growing influence in the region.

However, the article also highlights that the Palestinian issue has been somewhat sidelined in these normalization efforts, leading to discontent among Palestinians. The author argues that true normalization cannot be achieved without addressing past annexations and other concerns.

In summary, the article explores the recent attack by Hamas in response to attempts at normalizing relations between Israel and Muslim countries in the region. It provides a historical background of the Israel-Palestine conflict, discusses the significance of Jerusalem, and examines the factors contributing to the process of normalization. The article also emphasizes the importance of addressing Palestinian concerns for true normalization to occur.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Consumer food prices in India were 9.9% higher year-on-year in August, causing concern for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government. The RBI's monetary policy committee stated that food price shocks are impacting inflation, and the government is keen to prevent food inflation from spiraling out of control ahead of national elections in six months. Food inflation is being driven by cereals and pulses, although vegetable prices are expected to moderate. The government may need to consider a more balanced approach to food inflation that takes into account both consumer and producer interests.

### [How India-Israel ties progressed: from Palestine-leaning to a strategic embrace of the Jewish nation](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/arc-of-indias-ties-with-israel-8974060/)

The article discusses India's historical relationship with Israel and Palestine, highlighting the roller coaster nature of their ties over the past seven decades. It mentions that India initially supported the Palestinian cause after independence in 1947, but recognized Israel in 1950. In the late 1960s and early 70s, India developed a strong relationship with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and recognized it as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. However, India's support for Palestine faced criticism within the country due to Arab countries' neutral position during India's conflicts with China and Pakistan. The article notes that India established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992, which proved beneficial during the Kargil conflict in 1999 when Israel provided precision target bombs to India. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India's ties with Israel have become more visible, but New Delhi has maintained its support for the Palestinian cause. The article concludes by stating that recent attacks between Hamas and Israel put India in a diplomatic tight spot as it tests efforts towards peace in the Middle East.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has conducted a Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) for its spacecraft Aditya L1 to ensure it reaches its destination at the Sun Earth Lagrangian point 1. The Aditya L1 is embarking on a 110-day journey through space, one of the longest for an Indian spacecraft since the Mars mission in 2013-2014. Deep space missions require trajectory correction plans to ensure the spacecraft remains on course for its destination. The Aditya L1 spacecraft will be injected into an orbit around L1, and trajectory errors were identified after the Trans Lagrangian Point 1 Insertion maneuver. The spacecraft will orbit around L1 in an irregularly shaped orbit in a plane perpendicular to the line joining the Earth and the Sun. The L1 orbit is challenging to acquire and maintain, and course corrections may be needed during the mission. ISRO has previously performed TCMs during the Mars Orbiter Mission to ensure the spacecraft reached the correct trajectory.

### [What was the Yom Kippur war, and why is the Hamas attack on Israel being compared to it](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-was-the-yom-kippur-hamas-attack-israel-8973844/)

The recent surprise attack by Hamas on Israel has brought back memories of the Yom Kippur War, which started 50 years ago. This current conflict is being compared to the Yom Kippur War for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it has been the deadliest attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Hamas gunmen carried out a rampage in Israeli towns, killing at least 400 Israelis and kidnapping civilians. In retaliation, Israeli strikes have killed at least 313 Palestinians. In the Yom Kippur War, over 2,500 Israeli soldiers were killed. 

The second similarity is the criticism within Israel for being unprepared. The attack on Saturday came as a surprise, despite Israel's advanced intelligence and interception systems. This is similar to the Yom Kippur War, where Israel was also caught off guard due to many soldiers being on leave for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.

The Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War or the Ramadan War, was fought between Israel, Egypt, and Syria from October 6 to 25, 1973. It was the fourth Arab-Israeli war, following conflicts in 1949, 1956, and 1967. After Israel's decisive victory in the six-day war of 1967, it acquired territories from its neighbors, including the Golan Heights from Syria and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. 

Six years later, Egypt and Syria coordinated an attack on Israel. Israel was initially caught off guard and took time to mobilize its soldiers who were on leave for Yom Kippur. While both Syria and Egypt made some gains initially, Israel eventually halted their advances and launched counterstrikes. The intervention of the US and the Soviet Union further escalated tensions between the superpowers. A lasting ceasefire was finally reached on October 25, weakening Israel's previously perceived invincibility. 

Despite Israel's ability to beat back both attackers, the Yom Kippur War is still seen as a game-changer. Israel's scramble to rally troops initially and the heavy casualties it suffered showed that it could be vulnerable in battle. Prime Minister Golda Meir and her cabinet resigned six months after the war. Many analysts believe that Egypt's strategy behind launching the attack was to bruise Israel enough to bring it to the negotiating table. 

Following the war, a peace process was initiated, leading to the 1978 Camp David Accords in which Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. This marked the first instance of an Arab country recognizing Israel as a state. However, for Syria, the war had no positive outcomes as Israel continued to occupy the strategically important Golan Heights.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched a devastating attack on Israel, resulting in the deaths of at least 300 people. The attack is being seen as the biggest exchange of fire between the two parties in decades. Israel has declared war, raising concerns for an already volatile region. Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militant group, has also fired rockets at Israeli positions and declared solidarity with the Palestinian resistance. Hezbollah is described as the world's most heavily armed non-state actor and is supported by Iran. It opposes Israel and Western influence in the region. Hezbollah has been involved in Lebanese politics and holds seats in the country's Parliament. It has been characterized as a terrorist organization by many Western governments. Israel and Hezbollah have a history of conflict, with Hezbollah possessing a large arsenal of rockets and missiles. The Israeli government is facing criticism for being caught off guard by a less powerful force. Hamas' motivations for the attack are related to its opposition to recent engagements between Israel and other West Asian governments that lacked diplomatic relations with Israel. The attack follows months of rising violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Iran has called the attack an act of self-defense by Palestinians and pledged support to Palestinian fighters until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.

### [What is Israelâ€™s Iron Dome, how does it intercept rockets?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israel-palestine-conflict-iron-dome-air-defence-explained-8973212/)

The article discusses the recent attack by Hamas on Israel and the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome air defense system. The attack resulted in the deaths of 250 Israelis and the abduction of several others, while Israel's retaliatory strikes caused over 230 casualties in Gaza. The video shared by Nic Robertson shows the Iron Dome intercepting rockets from Gaza. The Iron Dome is a short-range, ground-to-air defense system that includes radar and interceptor missiles to neutralize rockets or missiles aimed at Israeli targets. It was developed in response to the Hezbollah's rocket attacks during the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon war. The Iron Dome has a success rate of over 80%, according to experts. It consists of a detection and tracking radar, a battle management and weapon control system, and a missile firing unit. Each battery of the Iron Dome can cost over $50 million, while one interceptor missile costs around $80,000. Despite the high cost, it serves as a deterrent and helps save lives.

### [Why the RBIâ€™s Open Market Operation plan caught the market by surprise](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-open-market-operation-8972699/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent announcement to consider open market operation (OMO) sales of government securities took the bond market by surprise. The central bank did not specify a timeline for this proposal, causing the yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds to rise by 12 basis points to 7.34%. This unexpected move led to speculation of an OMO being implemented soon, which would tighten liquidity in the system. The surprise element stemmed from the absence of a specific calendar for these operations, leaving market participants on edge as OMOs could potentially be announced at any time.

The market was not anticipating such a measure by the RBI to withdraw excess liquidity, adding a hawkish tone to the monetary policy. Liquidity is expected to tighten further due to cash withdrawals during the upcoming festival season. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das mentioned that OMO sales may be considered to manage liquidity, but the timing and quantity of such operations will depend on evolving liquidity conditions.

OMOs are used by the RBI to adjust rupee liquidity conditions in the market on a lasting basis. If there is excess liquidity, the central bank sells government securities to remove rupee liquidity. Conversely, when liquidity conditions are tight, the RBI purchases securities to release liquidity into the market. OMOs are employed as a tool to control inflation and money supply. However, when liquidity is sucked out, it can lead to higher bond yields, as the RBI introduces more government securities into the market, causing bond buyers to demand higher interest rates on these securities.

The RBI's emphasis on active liquidity management during the post-policy press conference indicates its inclination towards tighter liquidity conditions in the future. This approach is driven by concerns about inflation risks and financial stability, aligning with the central bank's objective of keeping inflation at 4%. The RBI aims to achieve this target through liquidity management, particularly during the October-May period when cash withdrawals are high due to festive and wedding seasons.

The current liquidity position is such that the RBI may opt for OMO sales auctions of government securities to absorb any excess liquidity. In September, the RBI conducted OMO sales in the secondary market, resulting in net sales amounting to Rs 6,200 crore. Despite the gradual withdrawal of the incremental cash reserve ratio (i-CRR) implemented in the August Monetary Policy Committee meeting, systemic liquidity remained in deficit due to tax outflows and GST payments. The government's cash balance with the RBI is estimated at around Rs 2.7 lakh crore, and an increase in government spending and the withdrawal of i-CRR could boost systemic liquidity. However, the festive season may also lead to increased currency demand, offsetting any liquidity increase.

### [How China invaded Tibet and annexed it](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/china-tibet-invasion-annexation-dalai-lama-8972679/)

This article discusses the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950 and its long-lasting impact. It emphasizes how the invasion was initially unknown to most Tibetans due to the remote location of the region and the slow spread of news. The Chinese Communist Party had both ideological and pragmatic motivations for annexing Tibet, wanting to secure the border and access its natural resources while also seeing it as a feudal-theocracy in need of liberation. However, Tibet had historically existed independently, with its own culture, language, and religion. Tense negotiations took place between Lhasa and Beijing, but China steadily built up forces at Tibet's border to exert pressure. The People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet in October 1950, capturing the town of Chamdo and forcing the Tibetan garrison to surrender. China then sent the defeated governor of Chamdo to Lhasa to propose the seventeen point agreement to the Dalai Lama. Under duress, Tibetan plenipotentiaries signed the agreement in May 1951, subordinating Tibet to China while promising non-interference in domestic affairs, culture, and religion. However, China soon violated the agreement and introduced communist reforms in Tibet, eroding its autonomy and imposing cultural and economic changes. Massive resistance grew in Tibet by 1954, and in 1959, a revolt erupted in Lhasa amid fears that the CCP might arrest the Dalai Lama. Chinese reprisals were brutal, resulting in the deaths of thousands and the destruction of monasteries. The Dalai Lama fled to India, repudiated the seventeen point agreement, and declared himself as Tibet's legitimate representative. Since then, China has maintained absolute control over Tibet, suppressing dissent, placing its own people in religious positions, and encouraging Han Chinese immigration, which has affected Tibet's demographics and culture.

### [Why India is launching a national framework for climate services](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/national-framework-for-climate-services-nfcs-8972568/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India is launching its first national-level framework for climate services, called the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS). Spearheaded by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the NFCS aims to provide climate information and services to key sectors such as agriculture, energy, disaster management, health, and water. The NFCS is based on the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), which is a partnership of governments and organizations at a global level. The GFCS aims to produce and improve the usage of climate information and services. The NFCS will focus on generating high-quality data on weather parameters and creating long-term projections and scenarios. The five major components of the GFCS are Observations and Monitoring, Research, Modelling and Prediction, Climate Services Information System, User Interface Platform, and Capacity Building. The IMD will be the nodal agency for implementing the national framework in India. Initially, the NFCS will work on bridging gaps between various agencies that require climate services. The IMD plans to strengthen its observational network and improve data inflow to run weather and climate models for deriving climate predictions. The framework aims to support efforts in preparing for new climate conditions and adapting to their impacts on various sectors. Several countries have already launched their own NFCS, and India will soon release its statement after receiving consensus from key stakeholders.

### [A short history of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has attacked Israel](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/a-short-history-of-hamas-israel-8972553/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Palestinian militants launched rockets into southern and central Israel, leading to a state of war being declared by Israel. At least 22 Israelis were killed and over 500 injured in the attacks. Israel responded with air strikes on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. Hamas leader Mohammed Deif claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel as part of "Operation Al-Aqsa Storm." Hamas is a Palestinian militant group and political party that governs the Gaza Strip. It was founded in the late 1980s as an armed resistance against Israeli occupation. The rise of Hamas came after the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made concessions in recognition of Israel's right to exist and dropped armed struggle as a strategy. Hamas opposed the Oslo Peace Accords and carried out suicide bombings to disrupt the peace process. The group gained prominence during the second intifada and won democratic elections in 2006. Israel holds Hamas responsible for attacks from Gaza, and conflicts between the two sides have resulted in significant casualties.

Palestinian fighters infiltrated southern Israel on October 7 and launched thousands of rockets into the country, marking the beginning of a new operation called "Operation al-Aqsa Storm" by Hamas. The leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, called on Palestinians to join the offensive in response to what they view as the "crimes of the occupation." Israel quickly retaliated by launching their own rockets into Gaza and declaring a state of war alert. Gun battles between Palestinian fighters and Israeli forces have been reported, along with Israeli personnel being taken captive by Hamas. As a result of the escalation, people on both sides of the Gaza border are fleeing their homes. International concern has been expressed, with the UK, France, and Egypt calling for restraint and the protection of civilians. This conflict is part of a long history of conflict in the region, with the creation of Israel in 1948 and subsequent wars and uprisings in Palestinian territories. Some observers have referred to the latest escalation as the beginning of the "third intifada," which represents a popular uprising against Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza. Tensions between Israel and Palestine have remained high, with continued expansion by Israel and increased terrorist attacks by Palestinian organizations. The rise of far-right ultranationalists in Israel has further contributed to the conflict. 2022 saw the highest number of conflict-related deaths for both Israelis and Palestinians since 2015, and violence has continued to escalate in 2023.

### [An Expert Explains: Caste survey & OBC vote](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-expert-explains-caste-survey-obc-vote-8971768/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The BJP's electoral success has seen a shift in its social base, with the party now having a much wider support base compared to its earlier perception as a party of urban upper castes and upper classes. The party has made significant inroads among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Adivasis, and Dalits while retaining its core support among the upper castes. This expansion among OBCs has come at the cost of both the Congress and regional parties, particularly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The BJP's support among OBCs has been consistently higher than that of the Congress, with the trend intensifying in recent years. The party has also gained greater support from lower backward castes compared to more powerful OBCs. However, upper OBCs remain more committed to regional parties. OBC support has played a crucial role in the BJP's dominance in Indian politics, but a dent in this support could impact its hold on power in the Hindi belt. The recent caste survey in Bihar may become a rallying point for regional parties and increase pressure on the BJP to announce an all-India caste census. However, it is important to note that the OBCs are divided between upper and lower backwards, which influences their voting patterns.

### [Russia may pull out of CTBT: How the treaty tried â€” and failed â€” to stop nuclear testing](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nuclear-test-ban-treaty-ctbt-8971599/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia may revoke its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to be on equal terms with the United States, not to resume nuclear testing. The CTBT is a multilateral treaty that prohibits all nuclear explosions. While Russia ratified the agreement in 2000, the US has yet to do so. The CTBT was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996 but is still in the ratification stage, with 18 countries yet to ratify it. The treaty came into being due to concerns about the health and environmental effects of nuclear tests. Previous attempts to curb nuclear testing included the Limited Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (LTBT) in 1963 and the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) in 1974. The breakthrough for a comprehensive test ban came after the end of the Cold War, leading to the adoption of the CTBT in 1996. Since then, there have been 10 nuclear tests conducted by various countries, including India, Pakistan, and North Korea. To enter into force, the CTBT requires ratification by 44 specific nuclear technology holder countries, eight of which have yet to ratify it: China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and the United States. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has urged these countries to ratify the treaty.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi has been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize for Peace for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her work to promote human rights and freedom. The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited last year's protests in Iran following the killing of Mahsa Amini, stating that Mohammadi's dedication and work align with the protests' motto "Woman - Life - Freedom." Mohammadi is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Iran's Evin House of Detention on charges including spreading propaganda against the state. She has been involved in political protests since childhood and has focused her activism on women's rights and prisoners' rights in Iran. Mohammadi has been previously recognized with other prominent awards for her work, including the PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award and the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. The Nobel Peace Prize has faced criticism for being awarded to politicians and world leaders too soon, unlike other Nobel prizes that are awarded years after the research work is published.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, announced on Friday that a seven-judge bench will be established to hear a group of pleas challenging the government's use of the money bill route to pass certain legislations. The Chief Justice made this observation while hearing a plea specifically challenging amendments to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The seven-judge bench will examine whether the legislation in question was validly categorized as a money bill or if it was done to avoid scrutiny from the Rajya Sabha. A money bill is defined by Article 110 of the Constitution as a bill that deals with taxation or the appropriation of public funds. It can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and if the Speaker categorizes a bill as a money bill, it does not need to be passed by the Rajya Sabha. The Modi government has introduced several key legislations as money bills, bypassing the Rajya Sabha. The constitutionality of three key legislations, including the PMLA, the Aadhaar Act, and amendments altering service conditions of tribunals, will be examined by the larger bench to determine if they qualified as money bills. The Supreme Court had previously upheld the PMLA and the Aadhaar Act but struck down the tribunal amendments as unconstitutional. The court will reconsider the validity of these laws in light of whether they were rightly categorized as money bills.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.India's Telecom Appellate Panel, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), has ruled that over-the-top (OTT) platforms like Hotstar are not under the jurisdiction of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) but are instead governed by the Information Technology Rules, 2021. This ruling came in response to a petition by the All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF), which claimed that the free streaming of ICC Cricket World Cup matches on Disney+Hotstar was discriminatory under TRAI regulations. The rejection of AIDCF's plea is significant because it challenges TRAI's attempt to regulate OTT services, which has been opposed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had previously released a draft telecom bill that aimed to classify OTT platforms as telecommunications services, but the IT Ministry argued that such services are not under the DoT's jurisdiction. TRAI has recently started consultations on how to regulate OTT services, revisiting its previous stance against intervention.

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep key interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive time due to concerns about retail inflation. This means that banks will not raise their lending rates, keeping equated monthly installments (EMIs) on loans steady. The MPC also retained the inflation projection at 5.4% for FY2024 and the GDP growth at 6.50% for FY2024. The decision to pause the rate hike cycle is driven by uncertainty in the overall inflation outlook, including factors such as lower reservoir levels and volatile global food and energy prices. The pause in the Repo rate hike will provide relief to borrowers, as their EMIs will not increase. However, existing and new home buyers should expect continued higher outgo in the form of monthly installments. The RBI remains focused on withdrawing its accommodative stance until all risks to inflation dissipate.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.There have been reports of bedbugs in various public places in Paris, leading to demands for government action. While the Transport Minister claims there is no resurgence of cases, videos of the bugs on social media have caused concern. The increase in bedbugs may be attributed to travel, as they can attach themselves to clothes and objects. Pesticides like DDT used to keep bedbugs away, but their environmental impact led to a decline in their use and the re-emergence of the insects. The upcoming Olympic games and high influx of tourists in Paris are also causing worry. Bedbug bites cause itching and inflammation, with some people experiencing more severe reactions. Technicians are using hot steam to exterminate infested areas, and some individuals are freezing their clothes as a precaution.

Norwegian playwright, poet, novelist, essayist, and translator Jon Fosse has won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his focus on the subterranean that connects personal experiences with universal themes. Fosse's work, which includes innovative plays, novels, poetry collections, essays, children's books, and translations, gives voice to the unsayable. While he is known for his plays, Fosse has also gained recognition for his prose. In his acceptance statement, Fosse expressed gratitude and a sense of overwhelm, seeing the award as a recognition of literature that aims to be literature above all else. Fosse's literary career began with the novel "Red Black" in 1983, and he has since written several notable plays and novels. His work is often compared to that of Henrik Ibsen and Jacques Derrida for its modernist concerns and ability to tap into the unspoken.

### [Nobel Prize for Literature 2023: Meet the winner, the Norwegian author Jon Fosse](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/nobelliterature-who-is-jon-fosse-8970192/)

Norwegian author Jon Olav Fosse has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature 2023 for his innovative plays and prose that give voice to the unsayable. Fosse's work presents everyday situations that are relatable and expresses powerful human emotions of anxiety and powerlessness in simple terms. He is regarded as a major innovator in contemporary theatre for his ability to evoke man's loss of orientation and provide access to a deeper experience close to divinity. Fosse writes in Norwegian Nynorsk, the least common version of Norwegian, and sees the award as recognition for this language and the movement promoting it. He started writing novels before switching to plays and has become one of Norway's most-performed dramatists. His works have been translated into over 40 languages, and he has written around 40 plays along with novels, short stories, children's books, poetry, and essays. Fosse's writing style is characterized by simple, minimal, searing dialogue similar to Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. His themes explore the absurdity, futility, and power of the human condition, everyday confusions and irresolutions, and the difficulty of forming connections through conversation. While Fosse has been celebrated in Europe for a long time, he is not as popular in English-speaking countries like the UK and US due to difficulties in relating to his themes and connecting with his plays. However, his popularity has been increasing in these geographies in recent years.

The Cultural Affairs Minister of Maharashtra, Sudhir Mungantiwar, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to bring back Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's wagh nakh to the state. The wagh nakh is a medieval claw-like dagger that was used across the Indian subcontinent. It will be displayed in museums across Maharashtra for a period of three years. The most famous use of the wagh nakh comes from the story of Afzal Khan's killing by Shivaji. The weapon was brought to Britain by James Grant Duff, an East India Company officer, and it is currently housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The return of the wagh nakh is part of a larger trend of former colonies demanding the return of cultural artifacts taken during colonial times.

The Union cabinet has approved the establishment of the Sarakka Central Tribal University in Telangana, India. The university, which will be located in Mulugu district, is estimated to cost Rs 889 crore. The university was initially promised by the Central government as part of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act in 2014, which stated that both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana would receive support to establish a tribal university each. However, the Telangana tribal university faced challenges due to delays in land allocation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently announced that the university would be named after Sammakka-Sarakka, a revered mother-daughter duo among the local tribal community. The duo played a significant role in a 13th-century battle against local rulers who imposed taxes on the Koya people. The region holds a biennial festival called Sammakka Saralamma Jatara, which is considered one of the largest gatherings of tribal people in the world. The festival attracts millions of devotees from various tribal and non-tribal communities across India. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the state government of Telangana provide financial support for the festival, and the Ministry of Tourism has sanctioned funds for the development of a tribal circuit in the area.

### [Why Punjab wants to ban the cultivation of PUSA-44 paddy variety](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/punjab-ban-pusa-44-paddy-explained-8969472/)

The Punjab Chief Minister, Bhagwant Singh Mann, has announced that the state will ban the cultivation of the pusa-44 paddy variety from next year. This variety was widely grown in Punjab and covered 70 to 80 percent of the state's total area under paddy cultivation. Farmers were satisfied with its high yield, but the agriculture department and Punjab Agricultural University discouraged its cultivation due to declining groundwater levels. The government aims to conserve one month of irrigation water by banning the variety, as well as address issues such as stubble burning and air pollution. Pusa-44 has an extended maturity period, leading to a narrow window for stubble disposal between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing. The variety is grown extensively in several districts of Punjab, where stubble-burning incidents are high. The ban is expected to have an impact on farmers' income, as pusa-44 yields more than other varieties.

The Delhi High Court has issued a "dynamic injunction" to prevent nine websites from illegally broadcasting the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 matches. The court granted this injunction to protect the revenues of Star India, the official broadcaster of the World Cup, as rogue websites that engage in piracy are likely to illegally broadcast the matches. Dynamic injunctions are granted before copyrighted works are publicly released or created to prevent irreparable loss due to online piracy. The Delhi High Court has previously passed similar injunctions to protect copyrighted works, including films and series. Star India cited previous cases and its exclusive rights acquired from the ICC to seek the injunction. The court's ruling falls under Section 37 of the 1957 Copyright Act, which grants broadcasting organizations special rights and specifies actions that constitute infringement. Exceptions to copyright infringement are included under Section 39 if the reproduction can be considered fair dealing.

Fourteen people have been killed and 102 are missing in Sikkim, India, after the South Lhonak Lake burst due to heavy rains. The release of water caused flooding in downstream areas, including four districts. Glacial lakes like South Lhonak Lake are dangerous because they are mostly dammed by unstable ice or sediment, and if the boundary breaks, it can cause flooding. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) can be triggered by earthquakes, heavy rains, or ice avalanches. Rising global temperatures have led to the rapid melting of glaciers in Sikkim Himalayan, resulting in the expansion of glacial lakes. There are currently over 300 glacial lakes in Sikkim Himalayan, with 10 identified as vulnerable to outburst floods. South Lhonak Lake has been under observation for years due to its significant increase in size. In 2016, authorities syphoned off water from the lake to mitigate the risk of a GLOF.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2023 has been awarded to Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus, and Alexei Ekimov for their discovery and synthesis of quantum dots. Quantum dots are small particles of nanotechnology that have various applications, including in televisions, LED lamps, and guiding surgeons during tumor removal. While scientists had theorized about the existence of these particles, the three laureates were able to create high-quality quantum dots that could be practically used. Ekimov was the first to make notable discoveries but his research was not accessible beyond the Iron Curtain. Ekimov and Brus independently observed how the size of particles affected their absorption of light, leading to the realization that particle size alters characteristics and behavior. Bawendi further improved the creation of quantum dots using different methods. Quantum dots are now utilized in computer and television screens, LED lamps, biochemistry, and medicine.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Actor Ranbir Kapoor has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Mahadev online betting case. The ED alleges that Kapoor promoted an illegal online betting and gaming platform. Mahadev Online Book is accused of providing platforms for illegal betting in various live games, including poker, card games, cricket, badminton, tennis, football, and even elections in India. The main promoters of the platform are based in Dubai and may have made around Rs 5,000 crores through the app. The app operates by advertising contact numbers on websites and luring people to play for profits. Users are provided with separate contact numbers for depositing money and encashing accumulated points. The operations involve creating user IDs, distributing credentials, and collecting money through benami accounts. The app's reach among users increased during the pandemic. The main promoters of Mahadev Online Book are Sourabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal from Bhilai, who are currently based in Dubai. They allegedly control 80% of the profits made through the app. In August, the ED arrested four individuals who were involved in facilitating illegal funds movement and protecting the racket from police action. ASI Chandra Bhushan Verma is accused of playing a major role in protecting the main accused and collecting bribes amounting to Rs 65 crore. The bribes were allegedly passed on to additional superintendents of police and senior IPS officers in Chhattisgarh. The ED claims that ASI Verma was the link between the main promoters in Dubai and those in power in the Chhattisgarh government. The Dammani brothers facilitated hawala movement of funds generated from the illegal business using their jewellery shop and petrol pump. Satish Chandrakar got raids carried out on two branches of Mahadev book and was given a panel/branch to run for his own benefit. The Chhattisgarh Police has registered 75 FIRs and arrested 429 individuals in connection with the case. They have seized laptops, mobile phones, betting materials, and luxury cars worth about Rs 2.50 crore. Over 3,033 bank accounts were used in the racket, with 1,035 accounts frozen so far. FIRs have also been registered against the app operators in other states like Andhra Pradesh.

Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has written a letter to Governor Banwarilal Purohit, requesting a five-year moratorium on the state's growing debt. Punjab's debt is estimated to reach Rs 3.27 lakh crore by the end of this fiscal year. The government has already spent a significant amount on debt servicing, with 20% of the annual budget going towards loan repayments. If the situation does not improve, Punjab's debt could exceed Rs 4 lakh crore in two years. The state's debt has multiplied nearly ten times over the past twenty years, largely due to "freebies" provided by the government, such as power subsidies. Economists suggest that a moratorium on debt repayment and a special package from the central government could help revive Punjab's economy and attract private investment. It is crucial for Punjab to change its course promptly to avoid becoming a "debt-trapped" state and to benefit the Indian economy as a whole.

Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, was ousted by a group of Republican leaders in a no-confidence vote. This is the first time a House Speaker has lost such a vote. McCarthy had the support of most Republicans but lost eight votes from his own party. The motion to remove him was brought by Matt Gaetz, a far-right Republican representative, who criticized McCarthy for mishandling government spending and budget fights. McCarthy's close relationship with former President Donald Trump and his impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden also contributed to his ouster. Patrick T McHenry, a Republican representative from North Carolina, has temporarily replaced McCarthy as acting Speaker. The path to electing a new Speaker remains uncertain due to deep polarization within the House and the Republican party.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Police has sealed the office of news portal NewsClick, accusing it of receiving money for pro-China propaganda. The police have filed an FIR against the portal under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law. The main allegation is that NewsClick received illegal funding from China through the United States. The FIR includes various sections of the UAPA, including Section 16, which deals with punishment for terrorist acts. This section defines "terrorist act" as any act that threatens India's unity, integrity, security, or sovereignty or strikes terror in the people. Other provisions invoked against NewsClick include unlawful activities, raising funds for terrorist acts, conspiracy, and offences by companies and trusts. The UAPA gives the state more powers compared to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by relaxing timelines for filing chargesheets and imposing stringent conditions for bail. The Supreme Court has defined prima facie narrowly in relation to denying bail under the UAPA, stating that courts must only consider whether a prima facie case can be made out and not analyze evidence or circumstances. Section 43D(5) of the UAPA states that a person accused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV and VI of the Act cannot be released on bail unless the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to be heard and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accusation is prima facie true.

On China's National Day, the Chinese military released an animated short film that depicted two pieces of a torn historical scroll painting, one kept in China and the other in Taiwan, joining together. The film symbolized the shared cultural heritage and hope for reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. China claims Taiwan as its territory and has increased its military presence around the island in recent years. President Xi Jinping has even stated that Beijing is ready to take Taiwan by force if necessary. The painting in question is called "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains," created by artist Huang Gongwang in the 14th century. It is considered a great classical work and was passed down to art collectors over time. Attempts were made to restore it, but it became separated into two parts. One part is now in the collection of the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in China, while the other is in Taipei, Taiwan. The animated film released by the Chinese military features two elves representing the two pieces of the painting, magically making it whole again at the end of the movie. China claims that Taiwan was part of its territory until Japan occupied it after a war in 1895. After World War II, a civil war between the Communists and Nationalists led to both sides claiming to be the "official" China. However, as China's economy grew and opened up to the world, more countries recognized it as China officially, maintaining only informal relations with Taiwan. Currently, only 13 countries have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) winning elections in 2004 brought a change as they have been wary of China's control over Taiwan. President Xi Jinping's increasing power since 2013 has also led to heightened rhetoric on Taiwan from China. The Chinese military's release of a film showing the reunification of the painting is seen as part of its larger aims related to Taiwan. The film also references the separation of cultural relics during the relocation of the Palace Museum to Taiwan over half a century ago. The painting has been recreated for the ongoing 2023 Asian Games in China's Hangzhou.

### [Nobel Prize in Physics 2023: What the three scientists have been awarded for](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/nobel-prize-in-physics-2023-what-for-8966824/)

Three scientists, Anne L'Huillier, Pierre Agostini, and Ferenc Krausz, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in making it easier to observe electrons. They have developed a way to create extremely short pulses of light, lasting only attoseconds, which allows for the measurement of rapid electron processes. This breakthrough has potential applications in diagnosing diseases and developing more efficient electronic gadgets. L'Huillier, Agostini, and Krausz's work has brought humanity closer to studying the movement of electrons and understanding mechanisms governed by them. This could be used to study molecular-level changes in blood for disease identification and improve electronic device efficiency.

### [Why Google producing its Chromebook laptops in India is significant](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/google-chromebook-laptops-india-production-8966416/)

Google has partnered with HP to start manufacturing its Chromebook laptops in India, boosting the country's electronics manufacturing ambitions. The move comes as companies worldwide seek to diversify their supply chains amid geopolitical uncertainties. The Chromebooks will be produced at HP's Flex facility near Chennai and will cater to the demand for affordable PCs in India, particularly in the education sector. This development aligns with India's goal of becoming a trusted partner in global supply chains and reducing its dependence on imports from China. The government has also introduced an import management system to track imports of electronic hardware and encourage companies to source from "trusted sources."

### [An expert explains: Why has the BJP been shying away from an all-India caste-based census?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-bjp-does-not-want-caste-based-census-8965780/)

The BJP's success in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections was partly due to its support among Other Backward Castes (OBCs). However, despite demands from opposition parties, the BJP-led government is hesitant about conducting a caste-based census. The implementation of the Mandal Commission report in the 1990s changed electoral politics in India, leading to the rise of regional parties. The BJP had to counter this with its Hindutva politics. While the BJP gained OBC support in the 2019 elections, it does not maintain the same level of support during state government elections. The BJP has been more successful in mobilizing lower OBC votes compared to dominant OBCs in North India. The reluctance to conduct a caste census may be due to fears that it could give regional parties leverage to reshape OBC quotas and challenge the BJP's dominance.

### [ExplainSpeaking: How employment and consumer sentiments vary with caste and religion in India](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-employment-consumer-sentiments-caste-religion-india-8965910/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar government has released details about the state's caste survey, which provides information on how the population is divided into different caste categories. The survey's findings could have significant political implications, as caste often plays a role in determining economic fortunes in India. This article focuses on caste-wise data related to employment and consumer sentiments sourced from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy's Economic Outlook. The data shows that the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) has fallen for each caste, with the lowest LFPR among upper castes. OBCs and SCs have experienced the biggest fall in LFPR since 2016. The Unemployment Rate (UER) remains high for all caste groups except OBCs, but this is due to a decline in LFPR rather than an increase in job opportunities. The Employment Rate (ER) has also fallen for every caste group, with the largest drop seen among OBCs and SCs. The article also mentions that the survey looked at caste across religious identities and highlights the falling employment rate among Hindus compared to other recognized religions. Additionally, it discusses consumer sentiments, which have decreased for almost all caste groups since 2016-17, with the lowest levels observed among OBCs and intermediate castes aspiring to be included in the OBC category. The article concludes by asking readers for their views on whether a caste survey should be conducted nationwide and if India would benefit from it.

### [Four takeaways from Bihar caste survey: On its significance, possible impact on elections](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/nitish-kumar-govt-4-takeaways-from-bihar-caste-survey-8965735/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar government has released the results of its survey on castes in the state, revealing that Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) make up more than 63% of the population. The "unreserved" category of forward castes accounts for about 15.5%. This is the first release of nationwide caste data since 1931. The EBCs are the largest social group in Bihar, comprising 36.01% of the population, followed by OBCs at 27.12% and Scheduled Castes at 19.65%. Scheduled Tribes only make up 1.68% of the population. The survey was conducted in two phases, with over 3 lakh people going door-to-door to collect data on caste, religion, and economic status. The findings could have political implications, potentially leading to increased demands for reservation and a quota within a quota for EBCs. It may also reopen debates on the 50% ceiling on reservation imposed by the Supreme Court.

### [Why free speech is not a priority in Southeast Asia](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/free-speech-not-priority-in-southeast-asia-8965588/)

Southeast Asian countries have some of the worst press freedom and media rights in the world, according to a report by the Pew Research Center. Governments in the region, ranging from communist states to tentative democracies, tend to limit free speech in order to protect national "harmony." This is reflected in global press freedom rankings, with Vietnam ranked third worst in the world. The deterioration of free speech internationally is attributed to increased aggression from authorities and growing animosity towards journalists on social media. A majority of respondents in three out of four Southeast Asian states agree that national harmony should come before free speech, although younger and more educated individuals are more likely to support the ability to criticize governments and prioritize free speech. Differences based on religion were also found, with Thai Muslims more likely than Thai Buddhists to prioritize harmony over free speech. Critics argue that Southeast Asia's strict laws on hate speech and other legislation do not actually defend social harmony in practice.

The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman for their work on mRNA vaccines against Covid-19. Their groundbreaking findings have revolutionized our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system, leading to the rapid development of vaccines during the pandemic. Traditional vaccines rely on introducing weakened or dead viruses into the body, but mRNA technology uses messenger RNA to deliver instructions to cells to produce the necessary proteins to fight a specific virus. Kariko and Weissman discovered that lab-grown mRNA was recognized as foreign by dendritic cells, triggering an inflammatory response. By modifying the bases in the mRNA, they were able to significantly reduce this response. Their work laid the foundation for the development of mRNA vaccines by companies like Moderna and Pfizer. Kariko is a Hungarian scientist who has worked at various institutions, including BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals, while Weissman is an American researcher based at the University of Pennsylvania.

### [Bihar caste survey data out: Why it was legally challenged â€” and why the court found it â€˜perfectly validâ€™](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/bihar-caste-survey-legal-challenged-8965424/)

The Bihar caste survey conducted by the state government has revealed that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) make up more than 63% of the population of Bihar. This is in contrast to the 27% reservation that the OBC population receives in government jobs and educational institutions. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is expected to use this data for political gain both at the state and national level. 

The caste survey faced challenges during its second phase, with the Patna High Court initially staying the survey in May. However, the court later deemed the survey to be valid. The grounds for the challenge included claims that the survey violated citizens' right to privacy and that the state did not have the power to conduct such a survey. The court ruled that permissible restrictions can be imposed on the right to privacy in the state's legitimate interests, and it accepted the Bihar government's assurance of data security. The court clarified that the survey aimed to identify backward classes for development schemes, not to discriminate against individuals or groups. 

The competence of the state government to conduct the survey was also questioned, with petitioners arguing that only the Union government has the power to conduct a census. The Bihar government argued that a caste census was previously conducted by the Union government in 2011, and that it had the power to collect statistics under the concurrent list. The court ruled that the state's actions were valid and within its competence, as it aimed to provide development with justice and did not violate privacy rights.

Overall, the Patna High Court upheld the validity of the Bihar caste survey, stating that it serves a compelling public interest and is in line with the state's legitimate interests.

### [Was Mahatma Gandhi racist?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/was-mahatma-gandhi-racist-8965363/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article explores the complex legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, a prominent figure in India's fight for freedom. While Gandhi is widely admired and studied for his non-violent methods of resistance, there has been increasing scrutiny of his views on race. Critics argue that his writings during his time in South Africa demonstrate a racist mindset. Gandhi's discomfort with Indians being treated similarly to black South Africans is apparent in his writings, where he derogatorily refers to black people as "kaffirs." However, African leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. have praised Gandhi's role in mobilizing resistance against British rule. Some historians have also criticized Gandhi for excluding Africans from the struggle for equality and maintaining a similar attitude towards them as the British. Despite these criticisms, Gandhi's grandson Rajmohan Gandhi argues that while his grandfather had his flaws, he was ahead of his time in terms of racial equality and paved the way for the fight for black rights.

### [Four things to know about Lal Bahadur Shastri: From â€˜Jai Jawan, Jai Kisanâ€™ to resignation over railway accident](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/lal-bahadur-shastri-anniversary-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-railway-tashkent-8965233/)

October 2 is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, two iconic Indian leaders who played a role in the freedom struggle and nation-building. Shastri, who came from humble origins in Uttar Pradesh, dedicated his youth to India's struggle for independence. After independence, he served in the UP state government and the central government before becoming Prime Minister in 1964. Shastri's rise from a humble background is notable, as he displayed social consciousness at an early age and dropped his birthname "Varma" to oppose caste differences. He took responsibility for a train accident during his tenure as Union Minister for Railways and Transport, resigning twice to accept moral responsibility. This increased his moral stature nationally and set a new precedent for political conduct. Shastri also played a crucial role in solving disputes over the government's official language policy. As Prime Minister, he focused on addressing economic stagnation, food production, and defense issues. He famously gave the nation the slogan "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" (Hail the soldier, hail the farmer) to emphasize the importance of both sectors. During his tenure, India faced the 1965 war with Pakistan, which led to the signing of the Tashkent Declaration for long-term peace between the two nations. However, Shastri passed away suddenly due to a heart attack the day after signing the declaration. Speculation arose about his death, but based on available evidence, it is believed that he died of a heart attack without any external intervention.

Swaminathan highlighted the importance of technology, services, and public policy in achieving food security. He also emphasized the need for nutrition-sensitive farming systems and promoting naturally bio-fortified foods. However, criticisms of the Green Revolution include its focus on water-intensive crops like wheat and rice. Swaminathan advocated for providing adequate nutrition sustainably for all.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui faced backlash after making derogatory comments about women with lipstick and bob-cut hair potentially taking advantage of the women's reservation Bill. Siddiqui later apologized, stating that he used the reference to explain his point to a rural audience. This remark echoes a similar comment made by JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav in 1997. The opposition to the women's reservation Bill from parties like RJD, Samajwadi Party, and JD(U) stems from concerns that reserved seats will go to upper caste and upper class women, reducing representation for disadvantaged classes. Critics argue that these women may not have their own voice and will further the agenda of dominant classes. However, parties like JD(U) have softened their stance and now support the Bill, demanding a quota for women from disadvantaged communities within the 33% quota for women. The AIMIM remains opposed to the Bill, highlighting the minimal representation of OBC and Muslim women in Parliament.

### [An Expert Explains: In alarm over Conocarpus trees, echo of faulty policies on invasive exotics](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/expert-explains-gujarat-conocarpus-trees-invasive-plants-8964032/)

Concerns have been raised over the management of the invasive Conocarpus species of trees in India, leading to bans in Gujarat and Telangana. This has drawn attention to the selection of species in urban landscaping projects, which often favor exotic species for beautification. Many previously introduced species for greening or ornamental purposes have become invasive, driving native species to extinction and incurring significant costs for their management. The two species of Conocarpus trees, which are easily propagated in nurseries, have caused pollen allergies and respiratory problems. The proliferation of non-native species is facilitated by their lack of pests or pathogens in new habitats and minimal aftercare requirements. It is recommended that landscape managers choose native species for long-term sustainability and refer to existing information on these species before large-scale use. Monitoring the import and use of horticultural plants is necessary to protect native species, ecosystems, and public health. Clear guidelines are needed for landscape planners and land managers in mega greening projects, as urban greens contribute significantly to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. India's climate commitments require a focus on nature-based solutions, such as sustainable biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban areas.

### [Why IIT Bombayâ€™s liberal arts programme for engineering undergrads has not found takers](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/iit-bombays-no-takers-8963985/)

IIT Bombay's liberal arts program, called LASE, has struggled to attract students since its launch in 2021. The program aimed to give undergraduate students the opportunity to customize their degree according to their interests. However, factors such as the perception of liberal arts education in an IIT and concerns about the utility of the Bachelor of Science degree offered by the program have hindered its success. LASE allows students to take courses from any department at IIT Bombay, providing greater flexibility for those interested in disciplines outside of engineering. Despite efforts to attract applicants, only a few students have enrolled in the program in the past two years, falling short of the minimum number required to run any course. Reasons for low interest include apprehensions about a BS degree instead of a traditional BTech degree and risk aversion towards something unfamiliar. The program was conceived as an alternative to address the lack of interest among students in their engineering streams and align with the multidisciplinary approach advocated by the New Education Policy. While branch changes at IIT Bombay will be discontinued from next year onwards, LASE will continue to be offered as an option for students.

### [Nashik onion traders on strike: What are their demands, and could this affect onion prices?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/nashik-onion-traders-strike-prices-explained-8963884/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Onion traders and commission agents in Nashik, Maharashtra, have decided to continue their ongoing strike over recently imposed export duties on onions and other related issues. The strike began on September 21 and will continue until their demands are met and the government rescinds the duty. Traders are protesting against the 40% export duty and want government agencies to not sell onions procured from farmers in wholesale markets. They also demand a reduction in market cess levied by wholesale markets. The government argues that the export duty is necessary to control onion exports and ensure enough availability in domestic markets due to low stock levels caused by untimely rain and hailstorms earlier this year. The immediate effect of the strike is limited to Nashik district, as other states are supplying onions to retail markets. However, exports have come to a halt and price rises may occur until the new crop arrives in November.

### [The story of Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s portrait on Indian banknotes](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/story-mahatma-gandhi-portrait-indian-banknotes-8963152/)

This article discusses the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi on Indian official currency notes. While many prominent photographers captured images of Gandhi throughout his life, the most widely circulated image of him is the one on the currency notes. The portrait on the notes is a cut-out of a photograph taken in 1946 where Gandhi is seen standing with British politician Lord Frederick William Pethick-Lawrence. The identity of the photographer and the person who selected the photo remain unknown.

The article explains that it wasn't until 1996, many decades after India gained independence in 1947, that Gandhi became a permanent feature on all legal banknotes issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI's Department of Currency Management designs the rupee notes and needs approval from the central bank and the union government.

The article mentions that Gandhi first appeared on Indian currency in 1969, with a special series issued to commemorate his 100th birth anniversary. In October 1987, a series of 500-rupee currency notes featuring Gandhi was launched. Before independent India, the RBI continued to issue notes from the colonial period featuring King George VI. The design of the 1-rupee note was changed in 1949 to replace King George VI with the lion capital of Ashoka pillar at Sarnath.

Over the years, new designs and motifs were introduced on the banknotes to represent different aspects of India. In the 1990s, the RBI introduced the 'Mahatma Gandhi series' to replace the former Ashoka pillar banknotes. Various security features were also added to combat counterfeiting. In 2016, the 'Mahatma Gandhi new series' of banknotes was announced, with additional security features and the inclusion of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan logo on the back of the notes.

The article concludes by mentioning suggestions made to include other personalities on currency notes, such as Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi. However, the RBI committee decided that Mahatma Gandhi best represents the ethos of India and rejected the suggestions to replace his portrait with any other leader.

Overall, the article provides insight into the history and significance of Mahatma Gandhi's portrait on Indian currency notes and discusses the various changes made to the designs over time.

### [Why Vivek Ramaswamy wants to end birthright citizenship in the US](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vivek-ramaswamy-birthright-citizenship-us-8963079/)

Indian-American presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has stated that he would end birthright citizenship in the US if elected, echoing a proposal made by former President Donald Trump in 2015. Ramaswamy argues that children of undocumented immigrants should not be granted citizenship as their parents broke the law to be in the country. The debate over birthright citizenship centers around the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to individuals born in the US. The amendment was introduced in 1858 to overturn a Supreme Court ruling that denied African Americans citizenship rights. It wasn't until 1898, in the case of 'United States v. Wong Kim Ark,' that the Supreme Court confirmed birthright citizenship for most people born in the US. Proponents of ending birthright citizenship argue that it should not apply to children of illegal immigrants and question whether they are subject to US jurisdiction. Supporters of birthright citizenship believe that any person in the US is subject to US laws regardless of immigration status and argue against racial undertones in the debate. Birthright citizenship remains a recurring topic in American politics, with Trump previously proposing to abolish it but facing constitutional barriers.

Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira was arrested by Fazilka Police on September 28 based on a report from a Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigating a 2015 case. The case was related to the seizure of drugs, gold biscuits, and weapons from Gurdev Singh and his associates, who were eventually convicted. During the investigation, Khaira's name came up as he had spoken with Gurdev Singh multiple times before the case was lodged. Khaira was previously arrested in a money laundering case in November 2021 but was granted bail ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls in 2022. In February 2023, the Supreme Court quashed summon orders against Khaira, but a fresh SIT was formed in April 2023 to investigate the case again. Khaira has also faced other cases, including forgery and defamation charges. He has had a political career spanning different parties, including Congress and AAP. The arrest has been criticized by Congress and condemned by Shiromani Akali Dal, while AAP stated that there is enough evidence for Khaira's arrest.

### [How did Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping get so close, and what are they trying to achieve?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-get-close-8962748/)

The article discusses the evolving relationship between China and Russia and their joint mission to reshape the world. It traces the origins of their partnership, which began during the end of the Cold War when China faced sanctions and Russia provided military technology assistance. Over time, their relationship grew stronger, with Russia's abundance of natural resources complementing China's need for capital and technology.

The article highlights key moments, such as Vladimir Putin's speech at the Munich Security Conference in 2007, where he criticized the enlargement of NATO and expressed concerns about Russia's security. Putin's obsession with maintaining control over Ukraine is also discussed, which eventually led to the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

On the other hand, Xi Jinping's rise to power in China brought a renewed sense of national rejuvenation and ambitious goals for China to become the world's leading power by 2049. The article notes China's assertiveness in various areas, including cracking down on freedoms in Hong Kong, the Belt and Road infrastructure project, and threats to seize Taiwan.

The convergence of Xi's and Putin's journeys is highlighted, as both leaders coordinate in international arenas to counter perceived Western containment and regime change efforts. The Ukraine war has brought China and Russia even closer, with China providing essential support to Russia without crossing red lines that could trigger Western sanctions.

While the China-Russia relationship is not a formal military alliance like NATO, the article suggests that closer military coordination between the two powers could pose challenges for US defense planners, especially if Russia escalates in Ukraine while China makes a move on Taiwan.

The article concludes by discussing the role China may play in any potential endgame to the Ukraine war and highlights China's opposition to NATO expansion. Putin, confident in his position, is betting on the resilience of his joint mission with Xi Jinping in contrast to Western support for Ukraine.

### [Four reasons why bank credit growth is expected to moderate in FY24](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/bank-credit-growth-moderate-fy24-8962582/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.According to domestic rating agency Crisil Ratings, the growth of credit in the banking sector is expected to be lower at 13-13.5% in fiscal year 2023-24. This projection comes after a strong credit growth of 15.9% in fiscal year 2022-23, driven by a broad-based economic recovery, healthier balance sheets, and a lower base from the previous two fiscal years.

However, this estimate excludes the impact of the merger between HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank in fiscal year 2024. Care Ratings also projected a growth rate of 13-13.5% for bank credit in fiscal year 2024, excluding the merger's impact.

As of September 8, 2023, bank credit grew by 19.81% on a year-on-year basis to Rs 150.38 lakh crore, including the impact of the merger. Excluding the merger's impact, bank credit grew by 15.08%. Year-to-date, bank credit (including the merger) has risen by 8.6% as of September 8.

In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, personal loans (housing and non-housing) recorded some deceleration but continued to grow above the overall credit growth. Non-food credit grew by 15% in August, while personal loans growth decelerated to 18.3% due to moderation in credit to housing.

Credit growth to the industry registered a growth of 6.1%, while credit to the services sector accelerated to 20.7% primarily due to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and commercial real estate.

Crisil attributes the moderation in bank credit growth to four factors. First, GDP growth is expected to decline to 6% in fiscal year 2023-24, impacting overall credit growth. Second, inflation is projected to ease due to the softening of commodity prices, reducing the demand for working capital loans. Third, the substitution of debt capital markets has decreased, impacting wholesale credit growth. Finally, the high-base effect from strong credit growth in fiscal year 2023 will contribute to lower bank credit growth this fiscal year.

Crisil expects bank credit growth to improve to 13.5-14% in fiscal year 2024-25 as economic growth picks up. Retail credit is expected to remain a key growth driver, expanding steadily at 19-20% each fiscal year.

The revival of private industrial capex is slower than expected, but capex announcements and higher capacity utilization levels suggest a ground-level pickup in capex next fiscal. On the services side, demand from non-banks is expected to support corporate credit growth. In the MSME segment, credit demand is expected to be steady due to the government's initiatives and the productivity-linked incentive scheme. Home loan demand is expected to be steady, and unsecured loans are expected to grow faster due to digitalization and borrowing for discretionary spending.

A suicide attack in Mastung district of Pakistan's Balochistan province killed at least 53 people and injured over 70 others. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Tehreek-e-Taliban distanced themselves from it. This is the deadliest terror attack in Pakistan since 2018. Balochistan, the largest Pakistani province, has been the site of insurgencies and a Baloch nationalist movement since 1948. The region's ethnic differences, economic alienation, and political grievances contribute to the ongoing conflict. Baloch nationalists argue that the Baloch people do not benefit from the province's natural resources, and they have targeted Chinese officials involved in projects like the China-backed Gwadar Port. The Pakistani government blames foreign actors for destabilizing the region.

### [UKâ€™s beloved Sycamore Gap cut down: The tree and its significance](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/britain-sycamore-gap-tree-cut-down-8962114/)

A 300-year-old sycamore tree in England, located in a gap in the Hadrian Wall, was deliberately cut down by a teenage boy. The motive behind the act is unclear. The tree was a popular spot for visitors and had cultural significance, being featured in films and used for special occasions. Sycamore trees can grow up to 35 meters tall and live for up to 400 years. They were introduced to the UK by the Romans or during the Tudor era and have since become common, sometimes at the expense of native species. The Hadrian Wall is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site called the 'Frontiers of the Roman Empire'.

### [Who is Yaroslav Hunka, Ukrainian Nazi praised in Canadaâ€™s Parliament?](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/ukrainian-nazi-praised-canada-8962078/)

The Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, Anthony Rota, resigned from his position after praising a Ukrainian veteran, Yaroslav Hunka, who was revealed to have fought for a Nazi military unit during World War II. Hunka received a standing ovation in Canada's parliament during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Hunka was part of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, which was declared a criminal organization by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946. Hunka's involvement in the unit's atrocities is not known. The controversy has brought attention to allegations that the Canadian government has been lenient in prosecuting Nazi war criminals and collaborators. In 1950, Canada allowed Ukrainian soldiers who fought against the Soviet Union to immigrate, resulting in over 1,880 members of the 14th Waffen SS unit settling in Canada. However, charges of war crimes against the unit members were never substantiated.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Former US President Donald Trump has been ruled to have committed fraud by misrepresenting his wealth, according to a New York judge. The case was initiated by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who accused Trump of deceiving banks, insurers, and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth. The ruling could result in Trump losing major properties, including the iconic Trump Towers in Manhattan. James aims to secure at least $250 million in penalties from Trump and a ban against him and his sons from running businesses in New York. Trump has sued the judge and sought to have the case thrown out, but these appeals have been rejected. The trial will begin next week, and further evidence will be presented. Despite facing multiple lawsuits and indictments, Trump remains a frontrunner among Republican nominees for the 2024 elections.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Around 3.5 tonnes of gold, 18 crore cigarette sticks, 140 metric tonnes of red sanders, and 90 tonnes of heroin were seized along with other drugs in India during the last financial year. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs Chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal emphasized the need to tackle issues such as counterfeiting, smuggling, and tax evasion to safeguard India's economic stability. A report by FICCI Cascade titled 'Hidden Streams' revealed that India has a higher overall score of 6.3 in the illegal economy compared to the average score of 5 in 122 other countries. While India has a lower score of 4.3 in the organized crime segment, the efficacy of criminal networks in the country enables them to generate substantial illicit financial flows despite their smaller numbers. The report also highlighted the economic impact of violence in India, costing around $1170 billion in 2021, approximately 6% of the country's GDP. The presence of criminal networks involved in drug and human trafficking, illegal trade in wildlife products, and other illicit activities contributes to the higher score of 6 for India in terms of the total illegal economy. The report also mentioned the increase in the illicit drug trade in India, with a higher prevalence of cannabis, synthetic drugs, and heroin compared to other countries.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Maldives will hold a runoff election this Saturday since no candidate received more than 50% of the votes in the first round. The electoral system in the Maldives requires the winner to secure a majority of votes. In the first round, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih received 39% of the votes, while opposition candidate Mohamed Muizzu received 46%. The runoff will be between these two candidates.

Maldives has followed an Executive Presidency system since 1968, with a transition to a multi-party system in 2008. No incumbent President has been re-elected since then. India has had a mixed experience with Maldives politics, with closer ties during President Solih's government. India has provided assistance in various areas, including vaccines, infrastructure development, and debt relief.

The relationship between India and Maldives has strengthened over the years, and India has undertaken several projects in Maldives. The defense ties between the two countries have also grown, with India providing training and equipment to the Maldivian defense and security personnel.

The current political landscape in the Maldives sees President Solih facing a challenge from opposition candidate Muizzu, who is seen as a proxy of former President Abdulla Yameen. Muizzu has made statements that have raised concerns in India, including threats to terminate agreements with foreign countries and expel foreign companies if they are not beneficial to Maldives.

Solih's campaign has focused on his government's achievements, but he is also facing anti-incumbency sentiment. The voter turnout in the first round was relatively low compared to previous elections.

The outcome of the runoff election will depend on the support of smaller parties, including Nasheed's The Democrats. India will be closely watching the election as President Solih trails in the first round.

The Gujarat government has banned the planting of ornamental conocarpus trees in forest or non-forest areas due to their adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The fast-growing exotic mangrove species had been popular in increasing green cover in Gujarat. Telangana had also previously banned this plant species. Other non-indigenous trees, such as vilayati kikar in Delhi and eucalyptus in Kerala, have also faced restrictions due to their negative effects on the local environment and flora and fauna. The vilayati kikar in Delhi had taken over the central ridge, killing native trees and fauna, while also depleting the water table. Kerala stopped cultivating acacia and eucalyptus in forest tracts due to their impact on fodder availability and forest habitats.

NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has spent seven years collecting and returning samples from the asteroid Bennu. After mapping the asteroid and collecting about 250 grams of rock, the spacecraft is now returning to Earth. The samples will be released over the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah and then transferred to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. OSIRIS-REx will then continue its journey to the asteroid Apophis. Sample return missions provide valuable information about our solar system and early Earth history. The samples from Bennu are expected to give insight into the formation of the Sun and planets. NASA will keep 25% of the samples and distribute the rest among mission members and international partners. Sample return missions have been conducted in the past, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and Japan's Hayabusa missions to asteroids. Future missions, such as Japan's MMX and the European Space Agency and NASA's Mars sample return mission, aim to bring back samples from Mars and its moons.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The upcoming Noida International Airport (NIA) in Jewar has been awarded its own unique international three-letter code, 'DXN', by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The CEO of NIA, Christoph Schnellmann, explained that the code is significant as it represents the connectivity of Delhi-Noida with the world through the airport. The "D" in DXN signifies Delhi, the national capital, while the "N" represents Noida, indicating the presence of the airport in the western UP area. The letter "X" signifies connectivity within India and the world. Phase 1 of the airport is expected to be operational by the end of 2024, with a capacity of 12 million passengers per year and a 3.9-km-long north runway.

### [How MS Swaminathan triggered the Green Revolution and helped India achieve food security](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ms-swaminathan-father-green-revolution-explained-8959892/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Monkomb Sambasivan Swaminathan, also known as the 'Father of the Green Revolution', passed away at the age of 98. He played a significant role in transforming farming in the 1960s and '70s, leading to India achieving food security. Swaminathan was highly dedicated to agriculture and conducted extensive research in the field throughout his career.

He held various positions in agricultural institutions both in India and abroad. Notable roles included serving as the Independent Chairman of the Food and Agricultural Organisation Council, President of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, President of the World Wide Fund for Nature (India), and the Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Swaminathan's interest in agriculture was sparked during the Bengal famine in 1942-43. This event, combined with Mahatma Gandhi's call for the Quit India Movement, led him to study agriculture instead of pursuing a medical career. Fascinated by the science of genetics, he decided to focus his research on genetics and breeding, recognizing the impact that improved crop strains could have on farmers.

His research on rice led him to work at the Central Rice Research Institute, where he pioneered the transfer of genes for fertilizer response from Japonica varieties to Indica varieties. This breakthrough laid the foundation for developing high-yielding crop varieties that could thrive in good soil fertility and water management.

Swaminathan's most significant achievement was his contribution to the Green Revolution, which involved providing farmers in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh with high-yielding variety seeds, irrigation facilities, and fertilizers. As a result, wheat production in India increased dramatically, transforming the nation from a food-deficient country to self-sufficiency. This achievement instilled confidence in Indian farmers and disproved the notion that India was reliant on wheat imports from the US.

He collaborated with American scientist Norman Borlaug, who incorporated dwarfing genes into spring wheat varieties suitable for the Indian climate. Their joint efforts led to the development of Gaines, a high-yielding dwarf wheat variety. This breakthrough marked the beginning of the "Wheat Revolution" in India.

Despite the success of the Green Revolution, Swaminathan acknowledged its shortcomings, such as favoring already prosperous farmers and unsustainable farming practices. He advocated for the conservation of soil fertility, responsible use of pesticides and herbicides, and scientific management of underground water resources.

In recognition of his contributions, Swaminathan received numerous accolades, including the first World Food Prize Laureate in 1987. His work saved millions from food deprivation and secured India's food self-sufficiency.

Swaminathan's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements. As the head of the National Commission on Farmers, he advocated for fair prices for farmers, recommending that the Minimum Support Price should be at least 50 percent higher than the weighted average cost of production.

Monkomb Sambasivan Swaminathan's pioneering work in agriculture has left an indelible mark on India's farming landscape, ensuring food security and improving the lives of millions of farmers.

### [Nearly 69 lakh cancer deaths among Indian women were preventable: What a study says on gender and the disease](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/cancers-gender-problem-8959239/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new report by the Lancet Commission on gender inequity in cancer care reveals that around 63% of premature deaths due to cancers in Indian women could have been prevented through risk reduction, screening, and diagnosis. Additionally, 37% of these deaths could have been averted with timely and optimal treatment. The report, titled 'Women, Power and Cancer', highlights that although men are at a higher risk of cancers that affect both genders, cancer incidence and mortality in women remain high. Globally, women account for 48% of new cancer cases and 44% of cancer deaths. The report emphasizes that women face challenges in accessing timely and appropriate care due to a lack of knowledge, decision-making power, financial resources, and availability of services at the primary level. Women are also more likely than men to lack the knowledge and power to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Furthermore, they are more likely to experience financial hardship due to cancer. The report also notes that women are underrepresented as leaders in providing cancer care and often face gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment. They also constitute the largest unpaid workforce in this field. The report estimates that the value of unpaid cancer caregiving by women is about 3.66% of India's national health expenditure. Dr Abhishek Shankar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences explains that there is a gendered aspect to cancer care, with healthcare-seeking behavior being lower among women, especially those from poor sections of society. He adds that treatment for women is often not prioritized, leading to worse outcomes compared to men. The report calls for societal changes alongside increased knowledge about cancer prevention. It suggests creating awareness campaigns to encourage people, especially women, to come forward for screening and seek care. The report also recommends developing laws and policies that reduce exposure to known cancer risks and ensuring equitable access to research resources, leadership positions, and funding opportunities for women in the field of cancer care.

Legislation in the EU aims to eliminate deforestation from the supply chains of everyday items, including palm oil. Malaysia recently signed a â‚¬500 million agreement with China to establish a trading and distribution center for palm oil, with the goal of doubling exports to China in the coming years. There are concerns that if Malaysia and Indonesia become dependent on China for exports, the intended environmental benefits of the EU legislation could be nullified. The EU's reputation has been criticized for potentially protecting its own vegetable oils, such as rapeseed and sunflower oil, at the expense of Southeast Asian producers. While some argue that trade restrictions should be the last resort, the EU emphasizes its efforts to improve environmental standards globally and believes it will remain an attractive market for exporters. Dialogue and collaboration between all parties involved are crucial for finding solutions.

JP Morgan Chase & Co has recently decided to include Indian government bonds in its emerging markets index, which could lead to a surge in dollar inflows into India. Other global investment majors are also considering including India in their investment index baskets. While there are differing views on when the foreign funds may start flowing into the country, it is widely agreed that this surge in flows will positively impact India's fiscal and balance of payments dynamics. The inclusion of government bonds in JP Morgan's index will be staggered over a 10-month period, starting in June 2024. Analysts estimate that this inclusion could result in inflows of around $25-30 billion into the government securities market. Other major index providers, such as FTSE Russell, are also reportedly considering including Indian bonds in their indices. The impact of these inflows is expected to include a downward pressure on interest rates, higher profits for the corporate sector, a potential boost to the bond market, a stronger rupee, and a rise in foreign exchange reserves. However, there are concerns about the macro-prudential risks associated with heavy foreign debt flows, as well as the potential for capital flight and market volatility. The RBI will play a crucial role in monitoring and intervening to maintain stability in the financial markets.

The Odisha government has announced its plans to conduct a tiger census after questioning the findings of the All-India Tiger Estimation (AITE) 2022. The AITE report stated that more than half of the tigers in Odisha have disappeared since 2016, with one tiger reserve left with no tigers. Disagreeing with the AITE's methodology, Odisha will use the camera trap method along with other approaches for its own census. The state aims to have a more accurate estimation of the tiger population and their habitats for better monitoring and protection. Odisha intends to conduct the counting more frequently than the AITE, which is done every four years. The survey will be carried out in the rest of Odisha, excluding coastal districts, and will include camera-trapping and DNA analysis. The survey will be conducted in phases, starting with a preparatory phase and ending with the analysis of camera trap images and DNA findings before compiling the results. The success of the census will depend on the sincerity of forest officers, and the state's survey aims to take place annually instead of every four years.

A new study by the European Commission has found that x, previously known as Twitter and now owned by Elon Musk, has the highest ratio of disinformation posts among large social media platforms. The study analyzed over 6,000 social media posts across various platforms in three countries, including Poland, Slovakia, and Spain. The study has prompted the EU's values and transparency commissioner, Vera Jourova, to call on Musk to comply with the bloc's laws against disinformation. This is not the first time Musk has faced criticism for failing to address the increase in disinformation and hate speech on x since taking over in October 2022. After Musk's acquisition, there was a significant surge in antisemitic, misogynistic, and transphobic language. Previous studies have also shown an uptick in hateful narratives, particularly against the LGBTQ+ community. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that x failed to take action against 99% of hate posts by Twitter blue subscribers. Musk's changes within the company, including laying off employees and restoring barred accounts, have been attributed to the deterioration of safety standards on the platform. The dilution of the verification process has also led to the creation of fake accounts. X has sued the CCDH in response to their findings, claiming harm to its business.

The article discusses the diplomatic tensions between India and Canada triggered by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's accusation of India's involvement in killing a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. This accusation has led to the expulsion of a senior diplomat from both countries. The article highlights Chinese interest in the row due to China's own diplomatic hostility with Canada a few months ago. Chinese media, particularly pro-Beijing outlets, have focused on exposing what they perceive as American double standards, with articles highlighting the hypocrisy of US values-based alliances. Some Chinese publications blame Canada for provoking India and causing trouble due to its reliance on the US. Left-leaning platforms describe the tension as India being in big trouble and potentially being classified as a "terrorist" country. Reader comments express caution when siding with India, claiming that the US pardons every sin done by India in its efforts to use India against China and Russia. Some Chinese people enjoy the deteriorating relations between two American allies, and believe that China's rise exposes India's value to the West. Overall, the Chinese media and public discourse remain occupied with the issue, with many believing that the spat is a result of US President Joe Biden favoring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain China.

### [Why the delimitation exercise is seen as a political battle between the BJP and the rest](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/womens-reservation-bill-political-issue-of-delimitation-8957721/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Women's Reservation Bill, which aims to provide a 33% quota for women in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies, was recently passed by both Houses of Parliament. However, its fate is uncertain due to its connection to the delimitation exercise. Opposition parties have criticized the government for linking the implementation of women's reservation with delimitation, arguing that there is no reason for this association. The government's decision to make women's reservation contingent on delimitation seems to serve multiple objectives. First, the delimitation exercise will increase the number of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies, potentially maintaining the current number of male legislators while accommodating women's reservation. Second, it appears to be an attempt to exert pressure on opposition parties, particularly those from south India, to support the delimitation exercise. Delimitation is a constitutional mandate that adjusts the number of seats and their boundaries based on population data after each Census. However, the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies has remained unchanged for the past 50 years due to opposition from parties in South India. These parties are reluctant to allow delimitation as it would result in a significant increase in Lok Sabha seats in North Indian states, benefiting the BJP the most. The fear of male politicians losing their seats has been a major obstacle in the implementation of women's reservation. By connecting women's reservation to delimitation, the government aims to ensure the preservation of the current male politicians' political fortunes. If the delimitation exercise results in an increase in the number of Lok Sabha seats to 770, 257 seats would be reserved for women, leaving 513 seats for men to contest. This would simplify the accommodation of male leaders within political parties. The opposition parties have recognized the government's larger agenda, which is to make the delimitation exercise inevitable and to use any resistance to it as a means to accuse the opposition of hindering the women's reservation bill. However, the opposition is not willing to surrender and has raised concerns about the potential reduction in the representation of South Indian states if the implementation of women's reservation is linked to delimitation. Former law minister Kapil Sibal has warned that the linkage with delimitation could further delay the implementation of women's reservation beyond 2029. Delimitation aims to ensure equitable representation in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies based on population, but there is no defined number of seats. If the number of seats were to remain the same as in 1977, the Lok Sabha would need to expand to nearly 1,400 seats due to population growth. However, the maximum capacity of the new Lok Sabha is set at 888 seats. Therefore, the average population size of each constituency would have to increase. The number of Lok Sabha seats in North Indian states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is likely to increase significantly compared to South Indian states, as the number of seats has remained unchanged for the past 50 years. The BJP is eager for delimitation as it would strengthen its political position, particularly in North India. By linking delimitation with women's reservation, the BJP is attempting to leverage its advantage, but the opposition has not yet revealed its strategy. In this political battle, the women's reservation bill may suffer as a consequence.

India also finds this concerning and had objected to a Chinese ship docking in Sri Lanka last year. The Shi Yan 6 is a scientific research vessel that conducts oceanography, marine geology, and marine ecology tests. It is expected to dock in Sri Lanka in October for research purposes. India considers Chinese ships near its mainland a security threat, even if their stated purpose is scientific research. Last year, India objected to a Chinese ballistic missile and satellite tracking ship staying at Hambantota port in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka initially postponed the ship's arrival but later allowed it to dock. This raised concerns in India about potential surveillance of its ports and vital installations. Sri Lanka maintains a neutral stance and has a Standard Operating Procedure for foreign ships and aircraft operating in its territory. It believes in an even-handed approach and cannot exclude China.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Members of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, have carried two pending matters to their new building. The first matter is the formulation of a Code of Conduct for members, which has been under consideration by the Committee on Ethics for over eight years. The second matter is the declaration of members' business interests, which currently only applies to members of Rajya Sabha, the upper house. Concerns over conflicts of interest among MPs have been raised for almost a century. The Ethics Committee in Lok Sabha has been reconstituted every year and is responsible for examining complaints of unethical conduct and formulating a Code of Conduct.

The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Rajya Sabha also require the maintenance of a Register of Members' Interests, accessible to ordinary citizens under the Right to Information Act.
