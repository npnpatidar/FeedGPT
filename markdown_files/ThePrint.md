The Panama Canal Authority has announced an increase in the number of booking slots available in its Panamax and Neopanamax locks due to a severe drought. From mid-January, the authority will offer 24 transit slots per day, up from the previously planned 18. This decision is based on the current and expected levels of the artificial Gatun Lake, which provides the necessary water for the canal's operation. The additional slots will cover regular, supers, and neopanamax vessel categories. The authority has also provided information regarding applications for the new slots, as well as the prioritization process for slot allocation. Additionally, due to the water crisis, the authority will only allow one booking slot per customer per date for transit dates starting on Jan. 16, until further notice. The ongoing drought has resulted in increased fees and traffic at the canal, prompting some vessels to take longer routes to avoid congestion. An alternative route takes ships down South America’s entire Atlantic coast, crossing the Strait of Magellan at the continent’s southern tip and heading back up the Pacific coast tracks.

As an AI language model, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. India has decided to allow sugar mills to divert up to 1.7 million metric tons of sugar for ethanol production. This decision aims to reduce disruptions in India's biofuel program. Previously, sugar mills were directed not to use cane juice or syrup for ethanol due to concerns over production. However, the government has now permitted the diversion of cane juice and B-heavy molasses for ethanol production. This diversion is capped at 1.7 million metric tons for the 2023/24 marketing year. Uneven rainfall in sugar cane-growing states has raised concerns about this year's output, leading to anticipated production decreases and higher local sugar prices.

As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. India's overall foreign exchange reserves increased by USD 2.816 billion to reach USD 606.859 billion in the week ending on December 8, 2023. The country's foreign currency assets, which are the largest component of the forex reserves, rose by USD 3.089 billion to USD 536.699 billion. However, gold reserves declined by USD 199 million to USD 47.130 billion during the same week. Prior to this week, India's total foreign exchange reserves had risen by USD 6.107 billion to USD 604.042 billion. It's worth noting that India's foreign exchange reserves reached an all-time high of around USD 645 billion in October 2021 but have since declined due to the increased cost of imported goods in 2022. The relative fall in forex reserves can be attributed to the Reserve Bank of India's intervention in the market to defend against the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar. The RBI closely monitors the foreign exchange markets and intervenes to maintain orderly market conditions and manage exchange rate volatility. Please note that this summary is generated by GPT-3.5 and may not include all the details from the original article.

The article reports on the approval of Germany's 2023 supplementary budget, which includes the suspension of the self-imposed cap on borrowing. This decision was made following a constitutional court ruling that disrupted the government's spending plans. The budget was approved in the parliament with 392 votes in favor and 274 against in the lower house, and subsequently passed in the upper house with no objections. The suspension of the constitutionally enshrined debt brake was justified by the government as a response to the emergency situation caused by the war in Ukraine. The supplementary budget exceeds the borrowing permitted under the debt brake by 44.8 billion euros, with planned new borrowing of 70.6 billion euros. Notably, part of this budget is earmarked for energy price subsidies and relief funds for natural disasters. Additionally, the article discusses the government's resolutions and measures passed to address the budget deficit, including a higher carbon dioxide surcharge, a reduction in the electricity tax for industry, and limitations on parental allowance based on taxable income.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) stopped a three-day session to train returning officers (ROs) only a day after it began, raising doubts about Pakistan's ability to hold national elections in February. This action came after a Lahore High Court order suspended a notification by the election watchdog regarding the appointment of ROs and district returning officers (DROs) from the bureaucracy. The court order has caused concern among political parties about the upcoming general elections, which are scheduled for February 8. The process of announcing the election schedule is now on hold pending the final verdict in the case related to the appointment of DROs and ROs. The ECP official stated that the appointment of ROs was made in accordance with the law, expressing surprise over the court ruling. Additionally, delimitation cases being remanded to the election watchdog by the high courts present another hurdle. Although intervention from the Supreme Court could dissipate the uncertainty surrounding the elections, an ECP spokesperson rejected reports that it planned to approach the Supreme Court against the LHC order.

In a long-awaited national security trial in Hong Kong, leading China critic and media tycoon Jimmy Lai faces charges of colluding with foreign forces, including the United States. Lai, the founder of the now-shuttered pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, has faced a salvo of litigation since a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019. He is accused of requesting foreign sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials, among other charges. The trial is viewed as a test for the city’s judicial independence and freedoms under the sweeping national security law imposed by China in 2020. The trial brings attention to the challenges faced by Hong Kong in reconciling its global financial center status with China's growing national security prerogative under Xi Jinping. The U.S. government has repeatedly called for Lai’s release, saying his case is politically motivated. Lai is already serving a 5-year, 9-month jail term for a fraud conviction over a lease dispute for his newspaper. The trial could last more than 80 days, and there are concerns about fairness, with the appointment of national security judges and restrictions on defense lawyers.

The article provides a summary of the retail inflation data for November 2023, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The key points include:

1. Retail inflation saw a spike to 5.55 percent in November from a four-month low of 4.87 percent in October. This was driven by a combination of an unfavorable base effect and elevated food prices. Rural inflation continued to surpass urban inflation.

Elon Musk's social media platform X, previously known as Twitter, has received a money-transmitter license from Pennsylvania, marking a step toward offering payment features. This approval enables X to facilitate money transfers and potentially allow users to send money to each other, similar to services offered by PayPal's Venmo. Musk aims to transform the platform into an "everything app" similar to WeChat, where users can conduct their entire financial lives. However, the process of obtaining approval in every U.S. state may take up to 18 months and millions of dollars.

X's push into payments signals an effort to diversify its business beyond digital advertising, which has faced challenges since Musk acquired the platform. However, the company's history of controversial statements and unpredictable decision-making may pose challenges in gaining the trust of users and financial regulators. Furthermore, holding users' money will require X to obtain a bank charter or form a partnership with an existing bank. 

Other states that have approved X for money-transmitter licenses include Arizona, Georgia, Wyoming, and Maryland, with ongoing reviews in other states. Ultimately, X's foray into payments may encounter regulatory hurdles and necessitate further strategic and operational adjustments.

The article reports that U.S. stocks lost momentum in afternoon trading, while benchmark Treasury yields dropped to multi-month lows after investors rotated out of momentum growth stocks following the U.S. Federal Reserve's dovish pivot. The dollar hit a four-month low, and the three major U.S. stock indexes gyrated, reclaiming positive territory after the Fed's policy decision to leave interest rates unchanged and signal that historic rate cuts are likely over.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 91.71 points, or 0.25%, to 37,181.95, the S&P 500 gained 8.03 points, or 0.17%, to 4,715.12, and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.74 points, or 0.06%, to 14,742.71. European shares gave back some gains but closed at a more than 22-month high as the dovish Fed offset the ECB's dismissal of rate cut speculation.

Emerging market stocks rose 1.99%, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closing 1.97% higher. The article also mentions movements in Treasury yields, exchange rates, oil prices, and gold prices.

Captain Suryakumar Yadav's outstanding performance led India to a 106-run victory in the third Twenty20 International against South Africa. He scored a century from 56 balls, helping India reach 201 for seven in their 20 overs. South Africa was dismissed for 95 in their chase. India's seamers created problems for South Africa, and wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav took a career-best figure of 5-17 in 2.5 overs. Additionally, there was a concern when Suryakumar Yadav rolled his ankle during the match. The article also mentions the upcoming three-match One-Day International series between the two sides.

In the recent T20I match between India and South Africa, Captain Suryakumar Yadav scored a remarkable century, contributing significantly to India's total score of 201 for 7. Suryakumar's innings, which included seven fours and eight sixes, played a key role in India's victory. In the company of Yashasvi Jaiswal, he made 112 runs for the fourth wicket, allowing India to recover from a tight spot after the loss of two early wickets. India's left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav also played a crucial role in the match, taking five wickets for 17 runs. South Africa's chase never really took off, as they were reduced to 42 for four, and ultimately crumbled under the pressure of India's bowling attack. Suryakumar's absence due to an ankle injury in the third over of South Africa's innings was the only setback for India, as Jadeja stood in for him for the rest of the match.

Gold prices rose to their highest in a week after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that its interest rate-hiking policy is at an end and that it sees lower borrowing costs in 2024. This sent the dollar and Treasury yields lower. Specifically, spot gold was 0.4% higher at $2,034.58 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures jumped 2.6% to $2,049.50. The market perceives the Fed's stance as dovish, with 17 of 19 Fed officials projecting lower interest rates by end-2024. This has put pressure on the dollar and bond yields, increasing the appeal of non-yielding bullion, such as gold. In addition, markets are now pricing in a chance of about 89% of a rate cut in March from the Fed. Other metals also saw gains, with spot silver rising 1.2% to $24.04 per ounce, platinum gaining 0.9% to $942.22, and palladium climbing 2.3% to $1,015.42. The European Central Bank also slashed its forecasts for inflation next year, which observers view as signaling that interest rates may soon be cut.

The stock market in Mumbai displayed a significant uptrend following the US Federal Reserve's positive signals. The Nifty reached an all-time high of 21,210, reflecting the positive market momentum. The Sensex also recorded an upswing, gaining 944.12 points to close at 70,528.73. The market received this news well, with small and mid-cap stocks available at attractive discounts, prompting investors to capitalize on the opportunity.

The article highlights the increasing number of Syrian refugees arriving in Cyprus and the government's efforts to address the situation. The Cypriot interior minister, Constantinos Ioannou, is seeking the European Union's consideration to declare parts of Syria as safe for the repatriation of refugees. This request is based on a report by the European Union Agency for Asylum which stated that two Syrian governates – Damascus and Tartous – were assessed to have "no real risk for a civilian to be personally affected by indiscriminate violence."

Cyprus has experienced a surge in asylum applications and refugee arrivals, with most of the migrants coming from Syria. The government is also focused on improving support for Lebanon, which hosts a significant number of refugees.

The article also mentions that Cyprus became a migrant hotspot after the closure of the Turkish springboard to the Greek islands in a 2016 EU deal with Ankara. The island has seen a rise in the number of arrivals through a new migrant route from Africa, leading authorities to be concerned about potential future influxes.

Furthermore, the idea of creating "safe zones" outside the EU for examining asylum requests is being considered, with Italy already announcing a plan to build such centers in Albania.

Amid these developments, the article also reports that the United Nations refugee chief discussed the potential for more displacement in the wider region due to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza at an international forum on refugees held in Geneva.

The European Commission did not reply to requests for comment on the matter.

As GPT-3.5, I can summarize the article for you. South Korea's vice financial regulator chief, Kim So-young, stated that authorities in South Korea will consider innovation in the next stage of regulating cryptocurrencies. He emphasized the need for regulations to strike a balance between investor protection and technological innovation. The conference on digital currencies, organized by the South Korean government, central bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), took place following the Bank of Korea's project to develop a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC). South Korea has enacted legislation on virtual assets to regulate cryptocurrency markets for investor protection, which will come into effect in July 2024. This move was prompted by previous cryptocurrency troubles and concerns raised by the alleged fraud committed by South Korean crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon.

In stoppage time, 17-year-old Marc Guiu attempted to deny Antwerp's celebration with an equalizer, but Antwerp ultimately won the game through another teenage substitute, George Ilenikhena. Despite the defeat, Barcelona had already secured a top-two place in the group and became group winners due to Porto's win over Shakhtar Donetsk.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved the first review of Sri Lanka's $3 billion bailout, providing approximately $337 million in funds to address the country's severe financial crisis. Sri Lanka experienced its worst financial crisis since gaining independence in 1948, leading to a plummeting economy, high inflation, currency depreciation, and low foreign reserves. The IMF has now sent a total of around $670 million to Sri Lanka. The approval of Memoranda of Understanding with official creditors and timely implementation of agreements, along with resolving issues with external private creditors, are crucial for restoring Sri Lanka's debt sustainability. Sri Lanka's economy began stabilizing after securing the IMF bailout, and the country's parliament recently approved an increase in value-added tax (VAT) to meet revenue targets set under the IMF program.

The Beijing policy institute has suggested that investing in children would be beneficial for China's economy, as the country experienced its first population decline in over six decades in 2022. The report emphasizes that infrastructure investment and manufacturing capacity are reaching saturation, making children the best investment for stimulating consumption and expanding domestic demand. Additionally, the report recommends the urgent reversal of the decline in newborn numbers and the implementation of national-level maternity subsidies to reduce the high cost of childbearing and rearing. It also highlights the current insufficiency of subsidies compared to European countries and the challenges women face in balancing family and work, contributing to the low fertility willingness among Chinese people. These factors, combined with a drop of roughly 850,000 people in China's population, mark the first decline since 1961.

The Nifty 50 index in India is expected to open higher, tracking the rise in Asian markets. The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is due, and it is anticipated to show a moderation in inflation while still being above the Fed's target. The inflation data, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve's commentary, could influence the near-term rate outlook. Additionally, India's retail inflation likely picked up in November due to higher food prices. The Nifty 50 has recently achieved new all-time highs, supported by strong macroeconomic data, a decline in crude oil prices, favorable global interest rate outlook, the resurgence of foreign inflows, and sustained inflows from domestic mutual fund investors.

Some key stocks to watch include Dixon Technologies, which secured a manufacturing contract from Lenovo, and Rail Vikas Nigam, whose joint venture emerged as the lowest bidder for a project worth 5.43 billion rupees.

Epic Games has prevailed in its antitrust trial against Google's Play app store, with the California jury finding against the alleged monopoly on all counts.

Google plans to appeal, maintaining its commitment to the Android business model and users. Additionally, Epic Games has also filed a similar antitrust case against Apple, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, while Apple is fighting a ruling that would require changes to its App Store rules.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who is President Vladimir Putin's top oil and gas representative, will lead a delegation of up to 20 officials to China. The purpose of the visit is to participate in an intergovernmental commission on energy. The delegation will be in China from December 12 to 16. China has become one of Russia's main trade partners, along with India, and they purchase a significant amount of Russian oil exports. This shift in trade occurred after Russia faced sanctions following the conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, Russia aims to increase its natural gas supplies to China, with plans to reach around 100 billion cubic meters per year by 2030. Moscow has been engaged in discussions with China regarding the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which would transport Russian natural gas from northern Siberia to China via Mongolia.

### [Training algorithm breaks barriers to deep physical neural networks: Research](https://theprint.in/science/training-algorithm-breaks-barriers-to-deep-physical-neural-networks-research/1881846/)

Researchers at EPFL have developed an algorithm that can train analog neural networks as accurately as digital ones, enabling the creation of more efficient alternatives to power-hungry deep learning hardware. The algorithm allows for training physical systems using sound waves, light waves, and microwaves to carry information, rather than electrons. The approach, known as the physical local learning algorithm (PhyLL), replaces the backward pass (BP) step with a second forward pass through the physical system to update each network layer locally. This method decreases power use, eliminates the need for a digital twin, and better reflects human learning. The research team aims to decrease digital computation and increase network scalability, with the goal of eventually implementing their algorithm on a small-scale optical system. While the approach is the first BP-free training of deep physical neural networks, some digital updates of the parameters are still required, making it a hybrid training approach. The ultimate goal is to overcome technical limitations of physical systems and increase network scalability.

4. Economists expect U.S. inflation to slow to 3.1% in November year-on-year and anticipate the Fed to hold interest rates at the current level for a third meeting in a row.

5. U.S. job growth accelerated in November, challenging expectations of imminent rate cuts from the Fed beginning early next year.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses five hacks to save money on car insurance renewal. Here are the key points:

1. Compare Insurance Online: By comparing quotes from different companies online, you can find the best rate and maximum coverage that fits your budget.

2. Install Genuine Anti-Theft Devices: Adding approved anti-theft devices can qualify you for theft-prevention discounts from insurers. These devices enhance security and aid in recovery.

3. Know Your Car's Worth: Research the current market price of your car to negotiate better on premiums. Use online pricing guides to determine its depreciated value and provide this information to insurers.

4. Get No Claim Bonus: Safe driving habits can earn you a no-claim bonus, which reduces your premium costs. Make sure to apply the full savings you're entitled to when renewing.

5. Understand the Policy Details: Thoroughly examine the fine print of your insurance contract to avoid surprises. Pay attention to clauses that may affect rates or coverage, and seek clarity on any terms you don't understand.

Remember, these are just a summary of the hacks mentioned in the article. If you need more detailed information, I recommend reading the full article.

### [Tennis-Djokovic says young rivals have awoken his inner ‘beast’](https://theprint.in/sport/tennis-djokovic-says-young-rivals-have-awoken-his-inner-beast/1880891/)

Novak Djokovic, the world number one tennis player, is turning 37 next year. Despite his age, Djokovic's hunger for success continues to grow, especially with the emergence of young challengers. In 2023, Djokovic had an exceptional year, winning three out of the four Grand Slam tournaments and bringing his total Grand Slam titles to 24, surpassing his rivals Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. However, he faced tough competition from 20-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, who denied him a fifth-straight Wimbledon crown, and 22-year-old Jannik Sinner, who dashed his hopes of Davis Cup glory. Djokovic sees these young players as additional motivation and believes they awaken a competitive drive within him. Despite his defeats, Djokovic acknowledges the talent and threat posed by these young rivals. He used his loss in the Wimbledon final as motivation to reinvent himself and push harder, resulting in victories at the Cincinnati and Flushing Meadows tournaments. Djokovic's determination and drive remain strong as he continues to strive for success.

AI has the potential to enhance medical tasks such as diagnosis and surgery, making them more efficient and reducing treatment time. However, according to Prof Andrew Elder, President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, it may take a couple of decades for AI to play a significant role in disease diagnosis. He emphasizes that the application of human judgment will continue to be important even with the advancement of AI. Doctors who embrace AI technology will have an advantage over those who do not. While AI can contribute to drug manufacturing and vaccine development, its role in diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. It is crucial for AI development in healthcare to involve individuals with medical training and understanding of patient care.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices experienced a slight decline due to the strength of the dollar. Investors are eagerly awaiting central bank meetings and the release of U.S. inflation data to gain more clarity on the future of interest rates. Spot gold was down 0.3% at $1,997.16 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures eased 0.1% at $2,013.20. The recent strong jobs report has shifted expectations for the Federal Reserve's actions next year, providing some relief to the dollar and bond yields, which in turn puts downward pressure on gold. The upcoming U.S. consumer price report and the comments of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be closely watched for further rate clues. The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, is expected to leave rates unchanged this week. Goldman Sachs predicts that the Fed may deliver its first rate cut in the third quarter of next year. Lower interest rates typically support non-interest-bearing assets like gold. That's the summary of the article you shared.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices have declined due to the strength of the dollar, and investors are awaiting central bank meetings and U.S. inflation data for further clarity on interest rate trends. Spot gold dropped 0.2% to $1,998.89 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures remained flat at $2,014.80. The stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report has led to a reevaluation of expectations for the Federal Reserve's actions next year, which has put downward pressure on gold. The upcoming U.S. consumer price report and central bank meetings will provide more insights into the future of interest rates. Lower interest rates typically support gold prices. The outcome of these events will determine whether gold can stay above the $2,000 level. Spot silver rose slightly to $23.98 per ounce, while platinum remained steady at $915.31 and palladium fell to $941.11 per ounce.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Australia has announced plans to tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers in an effort to overhaul its migration system, which the government considers to be "broken." This move is expected to reduce Australia's migrant intake by half over the next two years. The decision comes after net immigration was projected to reach a record high in 2022-23 but is now forecasted to decline to pre-COVID levels. The increase in net overseas migration in recent years has been largely driven by international students. The government's targeted reforms aim to put downward pressure on net overseas migration. The new policies include higher English test requirements for international students and the elimination of settings that allowed students to extend their stay in Australia. Additionally, a new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be introduced with a shorter processing time of one week. These measures are intended to ensure a more sustainable level of migration for Australia.

### [What to watch at COP28 on Monday](https://theprint.in/world/what-to-watch-at-cop28-on-monday-2/1880643/)

The almost 200 nations at the U.N. climate summit, led by COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber, are grappling with the issue of whether to call for a reduction in the world's use of oil and gas. A new draft text of the hoped-for final deal is expected to be released by the COP28 presidency. The negotiations intensify as countries advocating for a phase-out of fossil fuels clash with those who see them as crucial for their economies. Some countries argue that the focus should be on reducing climate pollution rather than specifically targeting fossil fuels. Time is running out, as the summit is scheduled to end on Tuesday, and discussions are likely to continue late into Monday night. If fossil fuels are mentioned in the final deal, it would be the first time they are directly addressed in 30 years of U.N. climate talks, which the summit host, the United Arab Emirates, would consider a success. However, opponents such as OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iraq find it challenging to support such a move domestically.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Egyptians have started voting in a presidential election that is expected to give Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a third term in power. The country is facing economic challenges and a conflict on its border with Gaza. If Sisi wins, his immediate priorities would be addressing inflation, managing the foreign currency shortage, and preventing spillover from the Israel-Gaza conflict. Voting will take place over three days, and results will be announced on December 18. Critics view the election as a sham due to a crackdown on dissent. Sisi led the ousting of Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013 and has since overseen a crackdown on activists. Despite economic pressures, some voters support Sisi for providing security and stability. The election campaign has been low-key, and some analysts believe it was brought forward to implement economic changes. The International Monetary Fund is in talks with Egypt for additional financing.

Johan Floderus, a Swedish national employed by the European Union, is facing charges in Iran for allegedly spying for Israel and being involved in 'corruption on earth'. These charges are considered capital offenses under Iran's Islamic laws. Floderus was detained in April 2022 while on vacation in Iran, and his trial has recently begun. His family has claimed that he was detained without any valid reason or proper legal process. Human rights groups and Western governments have criticized Iran for using arrests on security charges to extract political concessions, while Tehran maintains that such arrests are made in accordance with its criminal code and denies any political motives. Tensions between Sweden and Iran have been high since Sweden arrested a former Iranian official in 2019 for his role in the mass execution and torture of political prisoners during the 1980s.

The European Union's plan to impose a tax on carbon pollution emitted during the production of goods imported from countries like India and China has sparked a debate at the United Nations climate conference in Dubai. The tax, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aims to set a price on carbon emissions associated with energy-intensive products. The EU argues that this creates a level playing field for domestically-manufactured goods and reduces emissions from imports. However, developing countries are concerned that the tax will harm their economies and make trading with the EU too expensive. The EU sees CBAM as crucial for funding and achieving its climate goal of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. A recent study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development found that a carbon tax of $44 per tonne could cut pollution from the supply chain in half. However, it also estimated that poorer countries could lose up to $5.9 billion, while rich countries could make $2.5 billion from the tax. India's government strongly opposes the idea of a carbon tax, although some experts believe that it could have a positive impact in the long run by reducing emissions.

The Christmas pudding has a rich global history, influenced by the British Empire and enjoyed in various parts of the world. It originated from two older dishes, "plum pottage" and "figgy pudding," which were made with a mixture of meats, dried fruits, and spices. Over time, these dishes evolved into the more familiar plum pudding, incorporating ingredients from the British Empire such as French brandy, raisins from the Mediterranean, and citrus from the Caribbean. The Victorians further popularized it as the "Christmas pudding," and it became a centerpiece of the holiday season. The socioeconomic accessibility of the pudding, with affordable ingredients like candied citrus peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and raisins, contributed to its lasting appeal. Versions of Christmas pudding also spread across the British Empire, including in Australia and India. Even after decolonization, the tradition of Christmas pudding continues in various forms and adaptations.

Hmm, based on the provided text, I can tell you that the study mentioned in the article focuses on identifying diets that are effective in lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. It highlights that plant-based diets like the Mediterranean diet and traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Indian cuisines have shown to reduce the risk compared to the Western diet. The study also mentions that certain foods, such as saturated fats, red meat, processed meats, and ultra-processed foods high in sugar and refined grains, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, foods like green leafy vegetables, colorful fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, omega-3 fatty acids, and whole grains are considered protective against Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the study suggests that poverty and the consumption of meat and ultra-processed foods contribute to the rising trend of obesity, which is believed to be a driving force behind dementia.

The Prambanan temple in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is a testament to the deep-rooted cultural and historical ties between India and Southeast Asia. It is a large compound consisting of 240 Hindu temples and is considered Indonesia's largest Hindu temple. The temple complex has been restored with the assistance of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in various ASEAN nations. The restoration work is challenging due to the complex structure and the limitations imposed by UNESCO heritage site rules. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deities Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The Prambanan temple, along with the nearby Borobudur Temple, attracts a significant number of tourists, although Yogyakarta remains relatively unexplored by Indian tourists. India's contribution is expected to boost the number of visitors to these historical sites in the future.

GPT-3.5: This fascinating article discusses the recent discovery of a tyrannosaur's last meal, which was found preserved inside its stomach cavity. The researchers found the hind legs of two baby dinosaurs in the tyrannosaur's stomach, marking the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered. The tyrannosaur in question was a young Gorgosaurus libratus, weighing about 772 pounds and measuring 13 feet in length at the time of its death. It appears that the tyrannosaur had a preference for the hind limbs of its prey, as only the hind legs of the baby dinosaurs were found in its stomach. The baby dinosaurs belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and were younger than 1-year-old. This discovery provides valuable insights into the feeding behavior of tyrannosaurs during the late Cretaceous period.

Mata ni pachedi is a form of traditional cloth-painting associated with the Vaghri community in western India. It originated around three hundred years ago as a way for the non-dominant caste members to create their own shrines for worship since they were not allowed to enter temples. These paintings depict Hindu goddesses and are narrative in style, showcasing events from mythological texts, epics, religious processions, and historical themes. The paintings are made on rectangular fabric divided into columns, creating a grid for the narrative. Natural colors such as red and black were traditionally used, but now artificial colors are also used. Mata ni pachedi has expanded beyond its ritual aspect and is now used to create decorative consumer goods.

The voting period spans three days, and the results will be announced on December 18. Critics view the election as lacking genuine political pluralism due to a crackdown on dissent. While some Egyptians are encouraged to vote, others feel indifferent, believing that the election will not bring about significant change. Sisi came to power in 2013 after leading the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Murs

Hmm, visiting a museum can indeed have positive effects on your health. The Association des Médecins francophones du Canada launched a program where patients could receive a doctor's prescription to visit a museum, aiming to promote recovery and well-being for those with chronic illnesses, neurological conditions, cognitive disorders, or mental health problems. While the specific effects of art exposure on health are still being studied, research suggests that regular visits to cultural venues like museums can lower the risk of dementia, depression, and age-related decline in health. Contact with artwork has been shown to potentially lower blood pressure, heart rate, and stress levels. However, it's important to note that the effects may vary depending on the individual and the specific museum experience. So, going to a museum can be a great way to have a pleasant day and potentially contribute to your overall well-being.

Regenerative agriculture is gaining attention at COP 28, with the Sustainable Markets Initiative's Agribusiness Task Force launching a blended finance framework to support it. This framework aims to make regenerative farming financially viable and scalable. The task force includes companies like Mars, McCain Foods, McDonald's, Mondelez International, PepsiCo, and Waitrose. They are exploring implementation projects in India, the UK, and the US, and are calling for policy changes to support regenerative farming. The global food system currently contributes to GHG emissions and nature loss, so embracing regenerative farming could help address these issues. The task force proposes a four-lever framework, including new funding and sourcing models, common metrics, government policy changes, and creating new revenue streams for farmers. They are also exploring farming projects in different countries to prove the concept. The full plan can be viewed on the Agribusiness Task Force webpage.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is set to launch its Climate Action Catalyst Fund (CACF) on January 1, 2024. The CACF aims to mobilize innovative carbon finance by acquiring carbon credits to encourage investments in transformative mitigation actions in ADB's developing member countries. Unlike traditional carbon market practices, the CACF will provide upfront finance for high-impact climate mitigation actions, ensuring future delivery of carbon credits through long-term transactions. This approach accelerates the decarbonization of economies in Asia and the Pacific. The CACF enables cooperative approaches among nations under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, allowing the transfer of carbon emissions reductions achieved through climate mitigation measures from one country to count towards the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of another. The Swedish Energy Agency has committed to contributing 300 million Swedish krona to the fund, aiming to mobilize over USD 100 million in commitments from various entities. The CACF prioritizes high-quality climate mitigation actions, advanced low-carbon technologies, and sustainable development impacts for local communities in Asia and the Pacific. The launch of the CACF solidifies ADB's role in operationalizing international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

Hmm, it seems like you're looking for a summary of the article about the World Bank's program to address air pollution in India. The program aims to tackle the impact of ambient particulate matter (PM)2.5 pollution, which poses severe health risks to the population. The World Bank's efforts include introducing airshed management tools, developing State-wide Air Quality Action Plans, and creating a Regional Airshed Action Plan for the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The article highlights the alarming levels of PM2.5 pollution in India and its detrimental effects on public health and the economy. The World Bank emphasizes the need for coordinated efforts at the sub-national level and regional cooperation to effectively address air pollution. India has already taken steps to combat air pollution, such as revising air quality standards and promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) sets goals to improve air quality, particularly in cities where pollution standards are not met. The World Bank's involvement in India's Air Quality Management (AQM) is part of a phased strategy, leveraging insights from similar projects in Mexico and China. The focus is on the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain, where pollution intensity is high. The article also mentions the importance of integrating air quality management into government capabilities, business practices, and individual behavior. The World Bank's goal is to reduce air pollution within a generation by implementing successful strategies from other countries. Overall, the World Bank's comprehensive approach aligns with India's commitment to cleaner air and sustainable development.

Hmm, based on the provided text, I can summarize the article for you. The Finnish Twins Cohort Study found that while people who exercise more tend to live longer on average, the direct effect of "leisure time physical activity" on lifespan is not significant. Factors such as genetics, diet, disabilities, education, and wealth may also influence lifespan. The study analyzed data from 11,000 pairs of adult same-sex twins and found that the most active group had a 24% lower death rate compared to the least active group. However, when considering other factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index, the link between exercise and longevity was reduced. The study suggests that exercise may have a smaller role in lifespan than previously thought, but it still has benefits in preventing illness, improving mood, and enhancing overall quality of life.

Biden referred to Trump as a threat to democracy and did not mention his son's recent criminal charges during the fundraiser. California has traditionally been a significant source of funding for Democrats, and the end of labor strikes in the entertainment industry has unlocked pent-up dollars for fundraising. Biden is expected to participate in fundraisers with notable figures such as Steven Spielberg, Rob Reiner, Barbra Streisand, and Lenny Kravitz. The fundraisers in California and Boston are projected to raise at least $15 million, with a total fourth-quarter haul of around $67 million. Biden also made an announcement in Las Vegas regarding funding for new passenger rail projects. These projects, funded by the infrastructure law, include the nation's first high-speed rail line in California and a high-speed rail corridor between Las Vegas and Southern California. Biden has been traveling across the country to announce new funding tied to his legislative initiatives, aiming to boost his poll ratings and demonstrate his ability to lead the U.S. economy. However, recent public opinion polls suggest limited success in these efforts.

The Louvre art museum in Paris will increase its entrance fee by 29% starting in January next year.

Although the Louvre did not directly reference the Olympics, the timing of the increased fee coincides with rising costs in Paris as the city prepares to host the Games. Additionally, visitors to Paris during the Olympics will also encounter nearly doubled metro ticket prices and significantly higher hotel rates, which are expected to rise by over 300% between the 2023 and 2024 summer seasons.

A French court has convicted six teenagers in connection with the beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty in 2020. Paty had shown caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, which caused controversy among some Muslim parents. One of the teenagers falsely accused Paty of asking Muslim students to leave the room before showing the caricatures, but it was proved that she was not present during the class. The other adolescents were found guilty of being part of a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping prepare the attack. Paty was killed by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was subsequently shot dead by the police. The court also found the convicted teenagers guilty of pointing out Paty to the murderer. The heaviest sentence given was six months in prison for one of the adolescents.

The Reserve Bank of India has decided to maintain the policy rate at 6.5 percent, marking the fifth consecutive time it has remained unchanged.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously agreed to keep the repo rate at 6.5 percent and will remain focused on actively reducing inflation. The growth projection for the current financial year has been raised from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. The central bank projects consumer price-based inflation to be at 5.4 percent for this fiscal year. The MPC meeting was held with inflation declining to 4.87 percent in October, and the November figures are expected to be released soon. The government has mandated the RBI to maintain CPI inflation at 4 percent with a margin of 2 percent on either side.

According to a post by X CEO Linda Yaccarino on a social media platform, over 10 million people have signed up for X in December. However, the company, previously known as Twitter, is facing a potential loss of up to $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as several major brands have paused their marketing campaigns on the platform. The New York Times reported on this risk. X, which does not regularly disclose user data, has not commented on how the December sign-ups compare to the average or why Yaccarino shared this figure. In July, X's billionaire owner Elon Musk stated that the site had 540 million monthly users.

In November, various companies such as Apple, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Comcast, Lions Gate Entertainment, Paramount Global, and IBM announced that they were halting their advertisements on X. This decision came after Musk faced controversy for agreeing with a user who made false claims about Jewish people inciting hatred against white people. Additionally, a watchdog group called Media Matters discovered ads from major companies appearing next to X posts supporting Nazism. X subsequently filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing them of defamation.

Shaun Murphy, an Englishman, achieved the first-ever 147 break in the history of the Snooker Shoot-Out tournament. He accomplished this feat during his first-round match against Bulcsu Revesz, a Hungarian teenager.

This break surpassed the previous record of 142, set by Mark Allen in 2011. Murphy expressed his excitement and joy, stating that he loves the event and wanted to make a century break. He will receive a prize of £5,000 ($6,293.50) for achieving the highest break unless it is equaled in subsequent rounds.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Japanese yen experienced a significant surge against the US dollar after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda hinted at a possible shift away from the ultra-low interest rate plan. This speculation arose as Ueda mentioned that policy management would become more challenging in the coming year. The Bank of Japan is the only central bank that has not started tightening its policy, while other central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are either nearing or at the end of their rate hike cycles. In the US, stocks climbed, led by communication services stocks, and the labor market data showed a slight increase in weekly jobless claims. The focus now turns to the upcoming government payrolls report. European shares closed lower, and global stocks experienced their first advance after three consecutive declines. US Treasury yields remained relatively unchanged, and expectations for a US rate cut in March have increased. Oil prices settled at a six-month low due to concerns about sluggish energy demand in the US and China.

Asian equities attracted significant foreign investment in November, indicating the potential for continued inflows in the coming year. The decrease in U.S. Treasury yields and growing optimism for Federal Reserve rate cuts contributed to this trend. Data from stock exchanges across several Asian countries showed that foreign investors purchased a net $11.16 billion worth of stocks last month, the highest since May. Cooler U.S. inflation and dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials led to notable declines in U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar. This has sparked interest among foreign investors who may have a greater appetite for emerging market assets with lower USD interest rates and a weaker USD. Asian equities have experienced a significant turnaround, receiving a net inflow of $14.03 billion this year, compared to net selling of approximately $57.52 billion in 2022. Taiwanese stocks saw the highest foreign inflows since at least 2008, while South Korean and Indian equities also attracted substantial investments. However, Philippine stocks witnessed only slight inflows after three months of outflows, while Thai and Vietnamese shares experienced outflows. Analysts predict that Asia may demonstrate resilience in the coming year, outperforming other regions due to strong fundamentals and growth prospects, particularly in industries such as AI and semiconductors.

Universal Pictures' film "Oppenheimer," directed by Christopher Nolan, is set to debut in Japan in 2024, according to local distributor Bitters End. The release had faced uncertainty due to criticism that the movie downplays the devastation caused by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Despite the controversy, the biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the pioneer of atomic bombs, has achieved tremendous global success with over $950 million in box office earnings since its July premiere. The film is also expected to be a strong contender for various film awards. In addition to the controversy surrounding its content, the movie faced backlash for its marketing campaign, which unintentionally linked it to the blockbuster film "Barbie." Fan-produced images featuring the stars of both films alongside nuclear blasts caused offense among many Japanese viewers. Warner Bros., the distributor of "Barbie," issued an apology in response to the backlash. The atomic bombings, which occurred toward the end of World War Two, led to over 200,000 deaths.

This was Villa's 14th consecutive home Premier League win. City struggled throughout the game and only managed two shots on target, their fewest ever under manager Pep Guardiola.

GameStop, the video game retailer, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter as competition increased and consumer spending decreased. The company's shift towards an online-focused model was hindered by economic uncertainty and inflation. GameStop's shares fell by nearly 3% in extended trading following the announcement. The results mark the first quarter since Ryan Cohen became GameStop's CEO and chairman. Despite the sales decline, the company managed to achieve breakeven earnings per share and reduced expenses by almost 24%. Analysts believe that GameStop will continue to face challenges and market share losses from mass merchants and e-commerce giants like Amazon.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is visiting Athens with a delegation of ministers for meetings with Greek counterparts in the hopes of improving relations between the two countries. Greece and Turkey have been at odds for years over various issues, including territorial boundaries, energy resources, Cyprus, and defence matters. Although tensions have eased recently, little progress is expected on these longstanding bilateral issues. The leaders will focus on areas of mutual benefit such as the economy, health, education, agriculture, migration, and tourism. Greece is also planning to allow Turkish citizens to apply for a seven-day tourist visa for certain islands close to the Turkish coast as a gesture of goodwill. Both countries want to demonstrate their willingness to mend ties, with Turkey seeking EU membership and Greece aiming to regain stability in the changing geopolitical landscape. Despite the positive rhetoric, some officials believe that little progress will be made on the thorny issues between the two nations.

Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, made a speech to supporters last year, vowing to strike Israel with fighters and rockets. His words turned out to be more than mere rhetoric when Hamas fighters breached Gaza's fence, resulting in the death of around 1,200 people and the taking of over 200 hostages. The attack, known as the "flood of Al-Aqsa," targeted the mosque in Jerusalem and was planned by Sinwar and Hamas' military leader, Mohammed Deif. Sinwar, who spent 23 years imprisoned by Israel before rising to a leadership role in Hamas, is now leading negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps and directing military operations. He has a personal motivation to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Israel considers him and other Hamas leaders to be "living on borrowed time" and is unlikely to end the conflict until Sinwar is captured or killed. Sinwar is described as devoted to Hamas and willing to endure great suffering for his cause.

Britain's Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, has resigned from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Cabinet due to disagreements over the government's policy of deporting illegal migrants to Rwanda. Jenrick expressed his belief that the emergency legislation presented by Home Secretary James Cleverly did not go far enough to address the issue. He argued for a clear piece of legislation that would limit legal challenges to the government's immigration policy. Sunak responded by stating that the proposed bill would be the toughest ever introduced by the UK government. The move is seen as a setback for Sunak as he prepares for the 2024 general election. The opposition Labour Party criticized the Conservatives for presiding over a "chaotic" government. The Safety of Rwanda Bill will be tabled in the House of Commons, aiming to control the borders and deter dangerous journeys across the English Channel.

Israeli troops have intensified their offensive into southern Gaza, leading to tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians seeking refuge in the city of Rafah near the Egyptian border. However, fears remain as options for refuge dwindle and the Israeli bombardment continues. At least nine people were killed in an Israeli shelling incident in Rafah. This latest exodus adds to the already large number of displaced Palestinians who have fled from northern Gaza to the south during the two-month-long conflict between Israel and Hamas. The displaced Palestinians are now trapped near the fortified Egyptian border, despite Israel's claims of safety in the area. Israeli forces have entered Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, for the first time, targeting Hamas' military and administrative rule. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that they are encircling the house of Hamas leader Yahya Al-Sinwar. Fierce combat has been reported, with Israeli bombings intensifying overnight and tanks battling Palestinian militants in various areas. The humanitarian crisis worsens as hundreds of thousands of homeless people desperately seek shelter in the diminishing safe areas designated by Israel. The situation has caused a lack of tents, hindering aid distribution. Amid the conflict, Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with dead and wounded, and supplies are running out. Both sides are accused of committing serious rights violations, prompting calls for immediate humanitarian ceasefires from world leaders and a resolution at the United Nations Security Council.

### [Dr BR Ambedkar was a progressive thinker; says head of UK group Pankaj Shamkunwar](https://theprint.in/world/dr-br-ambedkar-was-a-progressive-thinker-says-head-of-uk-group-pankaj-shamkunwar/1875417/)

The general secretary of the Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisation (FABO) UK, Pankaj Shamkunwar, praised Dr BR Ambedkar as a progressive thinker and emphasized his contributions to Indian democracy. He highlighted that the Constitution, which forms the foundation of Indian democracy, guarantees fundamental rights and principles based on equality, fraternity, and freedom. According to Shamkunwar, Dr Ambedkar's major contribution lies in women's empowerment and education, noting that Dalit women are now competing on par with other women in the country. These remarks were made during a memorial event organized by the Indian High Commission in the UK to commemorate Babasaheb Dr BR Ambedkar's 68th Parinirvan Divas.

Acting High Commissioner to India in the UK, Sujit Ghosh, acknowledged Ambedkar's commitment to liberty, equality, and fraternity, which laid the foundation for democratic India. He stated that Dr Ambedkar played a crucial role as a visionary leader, social reformer, and principal architect of the Indian Constitution. Ghosh mentioned that Ambedkar's focus on justice and dedication to these principles guided the framing of the Constitution, aiming to dismantle social hierarchies. He also commended Ambedkar's recognition of education as a powerful equalizer, breaking caste barriers and fostering self-worth among marginalized communities.

Dr BR Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, and was an Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer. He fought against social discrimination towards Dalits and advocated for women's and workers' rights. Considered the architect of the Indian constitution, Ambedkar passed away on December 6, 1956. In addition to his legal and political pursuits, he earned doctorates in economics from Columbia University and the University of London. Ambedkar led a satyagraha in Mahad in 1956, advocating for the rights of the untouchable community to access the main water tank of the town. The 'Poona Pact' agreement, signed on September 25, 1932, between Ambedkar and Madan Mohan Malaviya, secured increased legislative representation for the depressed class.

Ambedkar was one of the seven members on the committee responsible for drafting the Indian Constitution after independence. In 1990, he posthumously received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor.

### [GameStop misses revenue estimates on faltering videogame demand](https://theprint.in/tech/gamestop-misses-revenue-estimates-on-faltering-videogame-demand/1875408/)

GameStop, a videogame retailer, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter due to reduced consumer spending in an uncertain economy. The company's shift towards an online-focused business model was hampered by sticky inflation and high borrowing costs, which resulted in uneven spending in the gaming industry. Despite the revenue miss, GameStop managed to post adjusted breakeven earnings per share, surpassing analysts' estimates of a loss. Ryan Cohen, the top investor who joined as CEO and chairman in September, has adjusted the company's strategy, relying more on physical stores for customers to pick up online orders. GameStop's revenue for the quarter was $1.08 billion, falling short of the estimated $1.18 billion. The company's stock price dropped nearly 1% in after-hours trading.

Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has granted loading windows this month to two vessels destined for India, under spot deals for crude oil with Italy's ENI and U.S.-based Chevron.

Indian refiners such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corp, and HPCL-Mittal Energy (HMEL) have been actively seeking Venezuelan crude cargoes since the sanctions were eased in October. Some refiners have made purchase agreements with trading houses that have access to Venezuelan oil, while others are planning to buy directly from PDVSA's partners.

Ukraine's Defense Minister, Rustem Umerov, met with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon to discuss Ukraine's strategic goals and long-term vision for its military. The Biden administration has been warning Congress that it is running out of time and money to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. In October, the administration requested nearly $106 billion from Congress, but the package was rejected by Republican lawmakers who control the House. Despite this setback, Austin announced an additional aid package for Ukraine, including air defense munitions. The US has been meeting with industry leaders to find ways to support Ukraine's military, which has depleted its artillery fighting Russian forces faster than its Western allies can provide assistance. President Biden warned that a victory for Russia over Ukraine would leave Moscow in a position to attack NATO allies. While Congress has approved over $110 billion for Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022, no additional funds have been approved since Republicans took over the House in January. The postponement of US assistance being debated in Congress was described by Ukraine's chief of staff as a "big risk" that could lead to Ukraine losing the war.

The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched ballistic missiles over the Red Sea, which were intercepted and shot down by Israel's Arrow air defense system. The missiles did not enter Israeli airspace or pose a threat to civilians. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they targeted military sites in the Eilat area. This is not the first time the Houthis have fired missiles at Eilat during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israel has successfully intercepted four ballistic missiles and used fighter jets to neutralize cruise missiles and drones launched by the Houthis. The Houthis, supported by Iran, are part of the "axis of resistance" against Israel, together with Hamas. They have expressed support for the Palestinians and issued threats against Israel. Iran has warned that Israel could face broader threats if it continues its war against Gaza. In a separate incident, Houthi-fired ballistic missiles struck three commercial ships in the Red Sea, and US warships shot down three drones in self-defense during the attack.

The Coast Guard continues to investigate the sheen and has not identified any damage or leaks after surveying the pipelines. Additionally, surrounding pipelines belonging to other operators are also closed. The volume of the initial leak is estimated at 1.1 million gallons (4.2 million liters).

The United States has determined that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing have been committed by warring parties in Sudan, specifically the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict, which began in April, has resulted in the displacement of over 6.5 million people, over 10,000 deaths, and severe economic devastation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for an end to the conflict and for those responsible for atrocities to be held accountable. The RSF has been accused of leading ethnic massacres, looting, rape, and imprisonment of civilians, while the army has conducted intense air and artillery strikes on residential areas. The determination made by the United States does not automatically lead to punitive actions, but it emphasizes the need to address the ongoing crisis. The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions related to the conflict but has not directly targeted the army and RSF. However, Blinken stated that future determinations are possible as more information becomes available.

The Group of Seven (G7) countries have announced a direct ban on Russian diamonds starting from January 1, with phased-in restrictions on indirect imports from around March 1. The G7 plans to implement a traceability-based verification and certification mechanism for rough diamonds within the group by September 1, 2024. However, the ban excludes diamonds for industrial use, and there is no mention of tracing polished stones or specifying carat size. Belgium, which houses the world's main diamond hub in Antwerp, has expressed satisfaction with the G7's adoption of the central principles of its proposal. The announcement is seen as an opportunity for Antwerp's diamond sector to further develop into a center for "clean" diamonds.

U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries held a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where they expressed solidarity and agreed on a new ban on Russian diamonds. The ban will prohibit non-industrial diamonds from Russia by January and Russian diamonds sold by third countries from March. Additionally, the leaders discussed tightening controls on Russia's use of the international financial system and imposing more sanctions to enforce a price cap on Russian oil. In the meeting, Zelenskiy called for continued support for Ukraine, stressing the importance of maintaining consolidation, interaction, and support for those whose freedom is under attack. The G7 members had previously pledged in May to restrict exports to Russia that could fund its war effort in Ukraine. The impact of the $60 price cap on Russian crude oil implemented by Western nations has diminished, prompting them to explore ways to strengthen implementation.

The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has commended the Manipur government's decision to lift the long-standing ban on liquor, citing positive effects on tax revenues and the fight against illegal alcohol and drug-related issues. CIABC's Director General, Vinod Giri, urged Bihar to follow a similar path, emphasizing potential economic growth, prevention of hooch tragedies, and generation of substantial revenues amounting to Rs 10,000 crore per year. Giri highlighted that lifting the prohibition in Manipur would boost state revenues, curb the illegal liquor trade, and address social challenges. He called on the Bihar government to reconsider its prohibition policy, which has negatively impacted development, led to hooch-related deaths, and fostered the growth of illicit liquor. Giri suggested responsible lifting of prohibition, such as employing women in liquor factories for economic empowerment and implementing a special cess on liquor sales to fund de-addiction and rehabilitation centers. He dismissed proposed door-to-door surveys on prohibition and pointed out that other states like Haryana, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh have experienced unsuccessful bans. Giri advocated for a pragmatic approach like Gujarat's, which permits alcohol sales to non-domiciles and exempts Special Economic Zones from the ban. The CIABC represents the interests of the Indian Alcoholic Beverage Industry, promoting responsible practices and advocating for a balanced approach to liquor regulations.

Negotiations on the European Union's first-ever regulations for artificial intelligence (AI) are reaching a critical stage. The outcome of these discussions could serve as a model for other governments crafting their own AI rules. The main challenge lies in accommodating technologies like ChatGPT, which was not considered when the initial draft of the law was created. ChatGPT's versatility and generative capabilities have sparked debates on how it should be regulated. Proposals include documenting the training data and capabilities of AI systems, mitigating potential risks, and allowing external audits. France, Germany, and Italy argue for self-regulation to compete with dominant U.S. companies. Additionally, there is disagreement about the use of AI by law enforcement agencies, with EU lawmakers seeking to protect citizens' rights while member states want flexibility for national security purposes. A final agreement on the legislation could be reached soon or lead to provisional agreements pending further technical meetings.

Italy has officially withdrawn from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) after four years of participation. The decision was communicated to Beijing three days before it was reported by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. Italy became the first major Western country to join the BRI in 2019, despite concerns from the US about China's influence over critical infrastructure and technology. The withdrawal was carried out through the cancellation of the agreement by the Italian government, which was accompanied by promises of strategic friendship. Both countries chose not to make public statements about the cancellation. Financial difficulties faced by the BRI project may have contributed to Italy's decision. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had previously expressed her intention to leave the BRI, citing a lack of significant benefits for Italy. This decision does not compromise relations with China, according to Meloni.

India has pledged USD 1 million in immediate relief assistance to Papua New Guinea following a volcanic eruption that occurred on November 20. The eruption led to the evacuation of over 26,000 people and created urgent humanitarian needs. In an official statement, India expressed sympathy for the damage caused and extended solidarity to the people of Papua New Guinea. As a close friend and development partner, India provided relief assistance to support the country's efforts in relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. This is not the first time India has supported Papua New Guinea during natural disasters, having previously assisted during a 2018 earthquake and a volcanic eruption in 2019. The volcanic activity in Papua New Guinea is attributed to its location on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," known for seismic and volcanic activities. Ulawun, the country's most active volcano, has experienced multiple eruptions since the 1700s, with the last significant eruption occurring in 2019. The article also mentions that disaster risk reduction and management are important aspects of India's Indo-Pacific Ocean's Initiative (IPOI), announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2019.

The British government has promised to prevent a recurrence of the injustices suffered by the families of the 97 victims of the Hillsborough crush in 1989, but has rejected calls for new legislation. The tragedy occurred when Liverpool fans were overcrowded in a fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough soccer ground during an FA Cup semi-final. Initially, the police blamed the supporters themselves, but an inquest in 2016 concluded that the fans were unlawfully killed and that the police were to blame. A government-commissioned report called for a charter for bereaved families, and the government has now signed the "Hillsborough Charter" to provide better support to such families in the event of disasters. However, campaigners for a "Hillsborough Law" argue that the measures do not go far enough and lack the families' support.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah criticized India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the ongoing dispute in Kashmir, claiming that two of Nehru's decisions were "historic blunders." Shah mentioned a letter from Nehru to Sheikh Abdullah where he admitted that he felt the decisions to escalate the issue to the United Nations and agree to a ceasefire with Pakistan in 1948 were mistakes. The Bills discussed in the Lok Sabha were later passed, but the Opposition briefly walked out after Shah's remarks. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill aims to increase the number of seats in the legislative assembly and provide representation for various groups. The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill provides quotas for jobs and education. Shah also argued that Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was at the "root of terrorism" and presented statistics indicating a decline in terror incidents after its abrogation. He further criticized Nehru, suggesting that delaying the 1948 ceasefire by three days could have resulted in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir being part of India.

The sugar output in Maharashtra is expected to be low due to below-average rainfall in sugarcane-growing areas this year. Despite this, the mills are focused on producing sugar rather than diverting the crop for ethanol production. The decision was made during a meeting with stakeholders, as sugar prices are currently high. The sugar commissionerate had previously estimated that 1,022 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane would be available for crushing in the next season, with 103.58 lakh metric tonnes of sugar to be produced. It also suggested that 15 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane could be diverted for ethanol production. The reduced sugarcane production may result in a shorter sugar production season.

Failure to do so may result in not only fines but also a loss of public trust in the technology.

Risks associated with the rapid development of AI have become a key concern for policymakers worldwide. Although there is a general consensus on the need for AI regulation, a global plan for oversight is still in progress. Edwards cautioned that firms should use AI carefully to avoid alienating the public, as a lack of trust in AI could hinder its adoption and limit societal benefits and innovation.

He highlights the competitive spirit and insecurity among artists, citing incidents such as rappers claiming superiority and one rapper buying a Rolls Royce after another rapper's statement. While "Chamak" draws inspiration from true events, it incorporates fictional characters and a father-son storyline. The show features cameo appearances by various Punjabi artists.

India's overnight index swap (OIS) market is indicating that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will not rush to cut interest rates, even if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts lowering rates early next year. The odds of the Fed's first rate cut in March have increased to 63%, while the RBI is expected to keep rates unchanged until mid-2024. This is reflected in India's OIS rates, which have only dropped modestly over the past six weeks. Market participants anticipate shallow rate cuts by the RBI due to strong economic growth and the need to control inflation. Inflation concerns are resurfacing in India, with retail inflation expected to exceed the RBI's tolerance limit. As a result, there is no room for the RBI to suggest any dovishness, and swap markets have not altered their rate cut expectations.

Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio is planning to spin off its battery manufacturing unit in a bid to reduce costs and improve efficiency, according to anonymous sources. Led by experienced engineers from Apple and Panasonic, the nascent battery unit will seek external investors and could be spun off by the end of the year. Nio intends to continue in-house research and development on batteries but plans to outsource all manufacturing. The company currently purchases batteries from CATL and CALB Group. The spin-off aligns with Nio's strategy to turn profitable sooner, as it aims to develop and manufacture some batteries internally while outsourcing production to other suppliers. This move will involve the transfer of top engineers to the new firm and the merging of some staff into other departments. Nio hired these engineers to facilitate mass production of large cylindrical cells similar to Tesla's 4680 at a planned plant in China's Anhui province. The assets to be spun off may include the planned plant, testing equipment, and intellectual property. Nio reported a loss of $637.06 million in Q3 and aims to improve profitability over the next three years by deferring its plan to bring battery production in-house. The company has also undertaken measures to reduce costs, including trimming its workforce and deferring long-term investments. Nio is expanding abroad and considering building a dealer network in Europe to accelerate sales growth.

Australia's weather bureau reported that rainfall in November was 37.8% above the average from 1961-1990, providing relief to farmers after a dry period. However, the overall rainfall during the southern hemisphere spring was 20.1% below average, the lowest since 2019.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced his authorization for oil exploration in a disputed area with Guyana, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) barring Venezuela from changing the status quo in the region. Maduro's decision follows a referendum where voters rejected the ICJ's jurisdiction over the dispute and supported creating a new state in the territory. State oil company PDVSA and state iron and steel maker CVG will establish divisions for the contested region. In response, Guyana plans to report Maduro's actions to the United Nations and the ICJ, calling Venezuela an "outlaw nation." The maritime border between the two countries is also under dispute. Exxon Mobil has been producing oil off Guyana's coast since 2019, and Guyana recently received bids for new exploration licenses. Despite the tensions, Guyana's president reassured investors that their investments are secure, with support from international partners and the community. Analysts suggest that Maduro's move may be aimed at gauging his government's support ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

The Indian rupee is expected to open unchanged amid a rebound in the US dollar, despite a decline in US Treasury yields due to lower-than-expected job openings in October. Non-deliverable forwards suggest the rupee will open around 83.36-83.37. The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped to 4.16% after data showed job openings at their lowest level in over two and a half years. Weakness in the data led to speculation that the US Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as March. The rupee's movement is currently influenced by speculation about the Reserve Bank of India's response rather than economic fundamentals. The RBI likely sold US dollars on Tuesday to limit the rupee's decline. Despite increased equity inflows, the rupee has been unable to strengthen. The dollar index has ticked up to 103.97, recovering after a recent sharp fall, driven by dovish comments from a European Central Bank official and safe-haven demand amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. Investors are awaiting further information on the US labor market from jobless claims data and the non-farm payrolls report.

Israel's military launched a fierce assault on the main city in southern Gaza, marking the most intense combat since its ground invasion began to eliminate Hamas five weeks ago. The US urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties. Israeli forces, supported by warplanes, reached the heart of Khan Younis and surrounded the city, engaging in violent clashes with Hamas fighters. The battles were the most intense since the collapse of the truce between Israel and Hamas. Hamas claimed to have killed or wounded eight Israeli troops and destroyed 24 military vehicles, while the Israeli military reported two troop deaths and 83 since the start of the ground operation. Gaza health officials said many civilians were killed in an Israeli strike, but the exact toll could not be confirmed. Israel initiated its campaign in response to an attack by Hamas fighters on Israeli towns, resulting in numerous casualties and hostages. The US continued to pressure Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and reduce harm to civilians. President Joe Biden accused Hamas of rape and mutilation during their assault on Israel, which Hamas denounced as false accusations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mentioned claims of sexual assault in a meeting with families of returned hostages. Hostage releases have stalled, with Hamas refusing further releases until Israel's aggression stops. Additionally, the US imposed visa bans on individuals involved in violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant condemned settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.

The NAO assessed the country's resilience against four extreme weather risks - droughts, surface water flooding, storms, and high temperatures - and found that more needs to be done to prepare for and develop resilience to such events. The report urges the government to increase its focus on reducing these risks and making the system more resilient. It also calls for accelerated investment in climate and wider resilience, with implementation by 2028 instead of the current target of 2030. The absence of an effective strategy and targets makes it difficult for the government to make informed decisions on investment.

Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to appear before an inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The inquiry has already heard damaging testimonies about Johnson's management of the crisis, including allegations of government incompetence and misogyny. Johnson will face two days of questioning, with families of COVID-19 victims planning to confront him over claims that he preferred to see people die rather than order a second lockdown. The inquiry is also expected to shed light on the role of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who reportedly shared similar views. The pandemic claimed over 230,000 lives in Britain. Johnson resigned after reports of alcohol-fueled gatherings in Downing Street during lockdowns. The inquiry aims to examine the government's response to the virus and its impact on the economy.

The EU will also stress the importance of respecting sanctions on Russia and raise concerns about arms supply from North Korea to Russia. Additionally, the EU is worried about its "imbalanced" economic relations with China, citing a significant trade deficit. On the other hand, China is expected to inquire about an EU anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles and the EU's efforts to reduce reliance on Chinese imports. Areas of potential cooperation include climate change, biodiversity, and macroeconomics and trade dialogues. While no concrete outcomes are expected from this summit, mutual interests could lead to technical and practical collaboration between the EU and China.

Formula One's governing body, the FIA, has launched a compliance probe following reports that a team boss received confidential information from an employee of the commercial rights holder. While the principal was not named, media outlets identified him as Mercedes' Toto Wolff, whose wife Susie leads the all-female F1 Academy. The FIA stated that its compliance department is investigating the matter, which drew a strong response from Mercedes and Susie Wolff. They rejected the allegations and expressed surprise that they learned about the investigation through a media statement rather than direct communication from the FIA. Formula One's owners, Liberty Media, also expressed confidence in their team and claimed that no unauthorized disclosure had been made to a team principal. Reports suggest that conflict of interest concerns were raised by some team bosses last year when Shaila Ann-Rao, who had previously worked as an adviser to Wolff, was appointed as the FIA's interim head of Formula One.

Sexual assaults in the Canadian military have seen a significant increase in 2022 compared to 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Around 1,960 members of the military, or 3.5% of the total, reported being sexually assaulted by fellow armed forces personnel, up from 1.6% in 2018. The majority of complaints (75%) were made by women. The military has faced longstanding pressure regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by senior officers. A survey conducted by Statscan revealed that 64% of victims did not report the incidents they experienced due to a belief that it would not make a difference. General Wayne Eyre, chief of the defense staff, expressed disappointment at the prevalence of sexual misconduct and acknowledged the need for substantial efforts to address the issue. An official investigation in the previous year recommended external civilian authorities to handle sex crime investigations due to the unsatisfactory handling of offenses by military courts over the past two decades.

The Biden administration is urging Israel to minimize civilian deaths in its offensive in southern Gaza. U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have publicly called for a more surgical approach to avoid heavy casualties. However, the U.S. is not willing to take stronger measures such as restricting military aid or harshly criticizing Israel. The U.S. believes that private negotiations are effective in influencing Israeli actions. Israel has faced international pressure, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems unmoved. The United States provides significant military aid to Israel, giving it leverage over the conduct of the war against Hamas. However, the Biden administration is cautious about reducing aid due to potential risks and political implications. While some progressive Democrats push for setting conditions on military aid and an immediate ceasefire, Biden is also concerned about pro-Israel voters and the upcoming presidential election. The fighting between Israel and Hamas resumed after a seven-day pause, resulting in a soaring death toll. Israel accuses Hamas of using human shields, while critics point out civilian casualties caused by intense airstrikes.

The U.S. State Department has announced that it will impose visa bans on individuals who undermine peace, security, or stability in the occupied West Bank. The restrictions will target those who commit acts of violence or restrict civilians' access to essential services. Family members of these individuals may also be affected. President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials have urged Israel to take action against violence by Israeli settlers towards Palestinians in the West Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the U.S. is ready to use its own authorities to address the issue. The first visa bans will be implemented immediately, with more to follow in the coming days. Israelis with existing U.S. visas who are targeted will be notified of their revoked status. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, building Jewish settlements that are considered illegal by most countries. Daily settler attacks have increased significantly, while the U.S. aims for Israel to hold accountable those responsible for the violence. Washington will also engage with the Palestinian Authority to address Palestinian attacks against Israelis.

Greek referees and match officials have announced that they will not officiate any Super League matches starting from the upcoming weekend. They are protesting against what they deem to be dangerous working conditions. Greek football has been plagued by crowd trouble, corruption allegations, and match-fixing, leading to dwindling attendances. Referees often face violent attacks from fans, with some having their homes and vehicles set on fire. Recently, referee Andreas Gamaris had his shop firebombed, while another referee, Tasos Papapetrou, allegedly received death threats. The referees state that they have been targeted and made scapegoats for shifting responsibilities, enduring bullying, threats, and physical attacks. Club presidents also openly criticize specific referees, sometimes even before matches. In previous seasons, foreign referees were brought in to ensure top division matches could proceed. The referees have decided to abstain until conditions are safe and have requested a meeting with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to discuss the matter. The Greek Super League was not immediately available for comment.

### [COP28 pledge to curb cooling emissions backed by 63 countries](https://theprint.in/environment/cop28-pledge-to-curb-cooling-emissions-backed-by-63-countries/1873541/)

The United States, Canada, Kenya, and 60 other countries have made a pledge to significantly reduce cooling-related emissions at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai. This commitment, known as the Global Cooling Pledge, focuses on cutting emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning, with a goal of reducing these emissions by at least 68% compared to 2022 levels by 2050. The pledge also includes targets such as establishing minimum energy performance standards by 2030. The increase in demand for cooling due to rising temperatures, growing populations, and higher incomes has led to a surge in cooling emissions, which are expected to reach between 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050. The pledge aims to address this issue and increase access to sustainable cooling solutions. However, some challenges remain, with India, a country that is likely to experience significant growth in cooling demand, not yet joining the pledge. The progress on meeting the goals of the pledge will be monitored annually until 2030.

Greek olive growers, including Panagiotis Tsafaras, are facing an increase in thefts as olive prices rise during a poor harvest. Tsafaras has been robbed twice, losing over a tonne of olives in one incident. Other producers in Greece have resorted to installing cameras, GPS trackers, and considering private security measures. The thieves strike at night, using rods or silent electric chainsaws to steal the olives. The decline in olive production, due to unfavorable weather conditions, has caused wholesale prices to double to 8-9 euros per liter.

### [Indonesia softens internet law after critics complain of misuse](https://theprint.in/world/indonesia-softens-internet-law-after-critics-complain-of-misuse/1872629/)

Indonesia's parliament has passed a revision to its internet law, aiming to address concerns that certain articles were being used to suppress government opposition. The amendment introduces stricter requirements for the defamation article of the electronic information and transaction law (ITE), including a higher burden of proof in prosecutions, and reduces the maximum penalty for defamation from four years to two. However, critics argue that the revision does not go far enough in safeguarding freedom of speech, as it fails to prevent misuse of the law by offended officials seeking extra protection. Human rights activists have long called for changes to the 2008 law, citing its vague and potentially misused articles. This development follows the sentencing of singer and opposition figure Ahmad Dhani under the ITE law in 2019 for insulting political rivals online.

Israel has reportedly assembled a system of pumps to potentially flood tunnels used by Hamas in the Gaza strip, according to U.S. officials cited by the Wall Street Journal. The pumps, located near the Al-Shati refugee camp, are capable of moving thousands of cubic meters of water per hour and could render the tunnels inoperable within weeks. It remains unclear whether Israel would use the pumps before the release of all hostages held by Hamas. While Reuters cannot verify the details of the report, a U.S. official stated that it made sense for Israel to neutralize the tunnels. The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the flooding plan but acknowledged its efforts to dismantle Hamas's capabilities using various tools. Israel had informed the United States about this option, though it is unknown how close they are to carrying out the plan. No final decision has been made yet.

### [‘Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce’ tops box office](https://theprint.in/entertainment/renaissance-a-film-by-beyonce-tops-box-office/1872235/)

The film "Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce" premiered at the top of the U.S. box office, earning $21.8 million during the typically slow first weekend of December. This marks the first time a movie has crossed the $20 million mark on this particular weekend since 2003. The release date was strategically chosen as it is historically a dead zone for the box office. The film gives fans of Beyonce, known as the Beyhive, a chance to experience her concert tour even if they couldn't get tickets to the sold-out shows. The film received praise for its behind-the-scenes look at Beyonce's world tour and her candid discussions about fame, motherhood, and being a Black woman in the music industry. Although the box office results fell short of Taylor Swift's opening weekend earnings, experts believe it will still boost music downloads and provide a more affordable alternative to attending live concerts.

Five9, a call center software firm, is reportedly considering a sale after a failed buyout by Zoom Video Communications two years ago. The news caused Five9's shares to increase by over 7%, bringing its market capitalization to $6.2 billion. Five9 is said to be working with advisors to assess interest from potential buyers, including Zoom, which has had discussions about reviving the deal. However, there is no certainty that a sale will occur as deliberations are ongoing. In October 2021, Zoom's proposed acquisition of Five9, valued at $14.7 billion, was terminated due to concerns raised by proxy advisory firms about Five9's growth prospects. Five9 declined to comment on the recent developments, while Zoom has not responded to requests for comment.

AT&T has announced that it has chosen Ericsson to build a telecom network in the United States using ORAN (open radio access network) technology. This new network will cover 70% of AT&T's wireless traffic by late 2026. ORAN technology promises to reduce costs for telecom operators by using cloud-based software and equipment from multiple suppliers, rather than relying on proprietary equipment from companies like Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei. While some telecom providers have tested ORAN technology, mass adoption has been slow. However, new networks by Dish and Japan's Rakuten are already using Open RAN. AT&T has spent six months analyzing Open RAN and has looked at multiple vendors before choosing Ericsson. The company plans to invest around $14 billion over the next five years for this project. Winning the Open RAN deal will make Ericsson the largest supplier to AT&T, potentially overshadowing Nokia. Nokia shares fell on speculation that they might lose the AT&T contract. Ericsson has agreed to open up its interfaces, which were previously proprietary, across its footprint. AT&T expects fully integrated Open RAN sites operating with Ericsson and Fujitsu by 2024, and by 2025, their network will have equipment from multiple suppliers. AT&T views this move as a game-changer for the industry.

France, with support from the United States, plans to propose a halt to private financing for coal-based power plants at the upcoming U.N. climate conference. This plan, called the "New Coal Exclusion Policy," was communicated to India earlier this month. However, India and China are opposed to any efforts to block the construction of coal-fired power stations due to their energy needs. The proposal aims to dry up private funding for coal power by setting coal-exit standards for finance firms, tracked by regulators and rating agencies. The U.S., European Union, and Canada have expressed concerns about private international financing supporting new coal capacity in developing nations. About 490 gigawatts of new coal capacity is planned or under construction, mainly in India and China. India, where 73% of electricity is produced using coal, intends to resist committing to a fossil fuel phase-out or phase-down at the conference. Instead, it may focus on reducing emissions from other sources and urge developed nations to become carbon negative by 2050.

### [Explainer-Argentina presidential election: Key takeaways from Milei’s win](https://theprint.in/world/explainer-argentina-presidential-election-key-takeaways-from-mileis-win/1852147/)

Javier Milei, a radical libertarian, has been elected as the president of Argentina, receiving a wide margin of votes in a run-off election. This outcome reflects a desire for change and a rejection of the peronist government, which has overseen soaring inflation and increasing poverty. Despite Milei's significant voter support, he will face challenges due to his limited presence in regional governments and congress, and he may have to moderate his plans for economic reforms such as dollarization. Milei's election comes at a time of economic crisis for Argentina, and his proposed reforms could help address the country's fiscal issues. However, he will need the support of more moderate conservatives to implement his plans. Milei, a 53-year-old economist, has been compared to Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro due to his abrasive style and desire to slash government spending.

Pakistan's caretaker Prime Minister, Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar, has dismissed allegations of bias against political parties and stated that holding general elections and transferring power to the elected government is his top priority. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and Pakistan People's Party (PPP) have complained about the lack of a level playing field in the upcoming election, accusing the caretaker government of favoring the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. Kakar denied these allegations and emphasized the importance of conducting fair and transparent elections. He also addressed concerns about the arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan, stating that the arrest occurred before the formation of the caretaker setup.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The article discusses the issue of explicit content on TikTok and its potential harm to young users. Despite efforts to moderate content, TikTok's focus seems to be on user engagement rather than creating a safe environment. The automated moderation system is not always accurate, leading to the removal of beneficial LGBTQ+ and sex education content while explicit content slips through. Users also employ tactics like "algospeak" to avoid filters. Harmful content on TikTok promotes unhealthy attitudes towards sex, perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes, and can influence vulnerable young boys with misogynistic views. The platform's promotion of idealistic and sexualized content also negatively affects the self-perception of young women and queer youth. However, TikTok offers an opportunity for informative and inclusive sex education content. Social media platforms face challenges in effectively moderating harmful content, and regulatory bodies like Australia's eSafety Commissioner play a role in pressuring platforms to remove such content. It is important for parents to equip young users with media literacy skills and actively monitor their online activities. Rather than solely restricting app usage, open discussions, building trust, and educating oneself and children about online risks are more effective approaches.

### [The future of transport is electric](https://theprint.in/world/the-future-of-transport-is-electric/1851557/)

The article discusses the need for countries to implement effective policies to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. Currently, transport emissions have been increasing at a rate of 1.7 percent per year since 1990, making it the sector with the highest emissions growth. Road vehicles contribute the most to these emissions, accounting for 74.5 percent.

While the global EV market has experienced significant growth in recent years, adoption rates vary across different regions. The article highlights successful government policies in China, Europe, and the US that have incentivized consumers to switch to EVs through subsidies, rebates, and tax discounts. For example, Norway has achieved a 79 percent market share for EVs by providing financial incentives and other benefits such as lower tolls and access to bus lanes.

The article suggests that alongside EV incentives, higher taxes on polluting vehicles can further encourage the transition to electric transport. Many European Union countries already levy car taxes based on carbon dioxide emissions. Feebate systems, which impose levies on high-emission vehicles and provide rebates for low-emission vehicles, are also effective in discouraging the purchase of polluting vehicles.

In addition to incentives and taxes, the phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles and the implementation of fuel efficiency standards are recommended. Over 35 countries have announced plans to electrify or phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. Fuel efficiency standards set limits on vehicle emissions and encourage the production of low or zero-emission vehicles.

To support the widespread adoption of EVs, the report suggests the need for robust charging infrastructure. Currently, only 13 percent of the estimated 100 million chargers needed by 2030 are in place. Accessible chargers can alleviate range anxiety concerns and make EVs more affordable by reducing the need for larger batteries.

The article concludes by emphasizing that a comprehensive set of consistent policies is crucial for achieving emissions reduction goals and transitioning to cleaner transport. It highlights the importance of not solely relying on EVs but also implementing strategies to change travel behavior, such as reducing car usage, promoting e-bikes and e-scooters, and improving walkability and public transport access.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of getting the policy mix right to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles and achieve global commitments for net zero emissions by 2050.

The indigenous ZThe prototype of the Zorawar light tank, designed for mountain warfare, will be unveiled in December 2023. Following this, it will undergo development trials and then user trials, likely in March next year. The Indian Army has chosen Cummins, an American company, for the engines of these tanks due to clearance issues faced with German companies. The Zorawar tank is specifically designed for high-altitude operations and aims to counter Chinese armoured deployments in such terrains. Weighing 25 tonnes, the tank will have greater mobility and accuracy compared to Chinese Type 15 tanks deployed along the Ladakh border. The need for a light tank arose as the existing T72s and T90s are more suitable for plains and deserts and lack maneuverability. The tank will feature a 105 mm gun made by a Belgium-based firm, active protection against incoming attacks, integrated UAVs, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and situational awareness technology. The Defense Acquisition Council approved the project worth Rs 16,000 crore in December 2022, and the DRDO will manufacture 59 of the 354 light tanks being procured.

### [Oil extends gains as OPEC+ to mull deeper cuts](https://theprint.in/economy/oil-extends-gains-as-opec-to-mull-deeper-cuts/1851346/)

Oil futures rose slightly on Monday as expectations grew that OPEC+ would deepen supply cuts to stabilize prices. Brent crude futures increased by 0.1% to $80.72 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 8 cents to $75.97 a barrel. The gains come after OPEC+ sources indicated that the group will consider additional supply cuts at its meeting on November 26. Oil prices have fallen nearly 20% since September, and prompt prices for Brent and WTI slipped into contango last week, indicating sufficient supply. Analysts suggest that deeper cuts should not be ruled out given the fall in speculative positioning and higher inventories.

The third round of United Nations negotiations for a treaty to control plastic pollution has received over 500 proposals from participants. Some see this as progress, while Greenpeace calls it "chaos". Negotiators have until the end of next year to reach a deal addressing the 400 million tonnes of plastic waste produced annually. The plastics industry and oil exporters advocate for promoting recycling and reusing, while environmental campaigners and certain governments believe in reducing production. Greenpeace emphasizes that the United States and the European Union should show greater leadership. The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) believes that the proposals reflect the robustness of the talks. Canada, Kenya, and the European Union support limiting plastic production, while a coalition of Russia and Saudi Arabia emphasizes recycling. Only less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled, and at least 14 million tonnes end up in the ocean each year. Two more rounds of negotiations will occur next year to finalize the deal.

International calls for humanitarian pauses have been made, but the conflict shows no signs of abating.

The petitioner claims that SEBI failed to comply with the court's direction to submit the final conclusion/report. The application also refers to a report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) regarding the Adani Group's alleged investments through "opaque" Mauritius funds. The focus of the plea is on strengthening the regulatory system to protect investors and their investments in the share market. The petitioner argues that SEBI's objection to a necessary timeline for the investigation goes against the need for an efficient regulatory mechanism. Delays in investigations can lead to the disappearance of evidence and reduce investor confidence. The expert committee appointed by the court is still working on the matter, and the application calls for an independent body to investigate the new disclosures. The court had granted time until August 14 for SEBI's probe and emphasized the need for expeditious completion. SEBI has completed its investigation in most matters but is awaiting information from tax havens. The regulator will take appropriate action based on the investigation's outcome. An interim report by the expert committee found no evident pattern of manipulation but highlighted regulatory constraints. The Adani Group stocks faced allegations of fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, which the group denies.

Targeted groups may include domestic workers, rickshaw drivers, waste pickers, gardeners, and construction workers. The DAY-NULM, launched in 2013, aims to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting self-help groups, skill development, self-employment training, and homeless shelters. The ministry is considering a shift towards entrepreneurship development, market linkages, standardizing norms for identifying the urban poor, and providing social benefits to all NULM beneficiaries. This move follows the success of the PM Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme, which provided loans to street vendors affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although nearly 8.7 lakh self-help groups have been formed under DAY-NULM, experts suggest targeting a wider range of occupational groups and adopting income-generating schemes to address the challenges faced by the urban poor. Creating self-help groups in urban areas is more challenging due to the transient nature of migrant workers. The ministry is planning to focus on entrepreneurship development in the next phase of the mission, aiming to empower individuals with business knowledge and assistance.

The study highlights the importance of getting enough sleep in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that sleep restriction can elevate the risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and disordered glucose metabolism. The current study focused on women and found that a prolonged, mild restriction of sleep increased women's blood glucose and insulin levels. Insulin resistance rose by 14.8% among both pre- and postmenopausal women, with more severe effects for postmenopausal women. The researchers also found that changes in body weight did not explain the changes in insulin and glucose levels. Further studies are planned to understand how sleep deficiency affects metabolism in both men and women and explore sleep interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention efforts.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！According to an article by Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), the Global Listed Infrastructure (GLI) sector remains resilient in the face of short-term challenges and shows a promising long-term outlook. Although GLI experienced underperformance in 2023 compared to global equity markets, it still demonstrates solid fundamentals across various infrastructure sectors. The four major industry categories within GLI—Utilities, Energy Infrastructure, Communications, and Transportation—show positive trends in terms of revenue and profitability. The Communications sector, specifically the US wireless tower subsector, faces some challenges with stagnant cash flow growth in 2023. However, European tower operators and global data center companies enjoy strong fundamental trends. Despite current valuations being at odds with the fundamental backdrop, GLI companies are well-positioned to maintain margins. The defensive sectors of Utilities and Communications offer attractive valuations, and regulatory constructs help infrastructure companies navigate higher interest costs effectively. GLI has historically outperformed global equities during economic downturns, and certain sectors within GLI, such as freight rail and energy infrastructure, are poised for a positive recovery in the event of a modest economic downturn. As the global economy potentially re-accelerates in 2024, GLI is expected to benefit. Growth areas in infrastructure, such as the energy transition and renewables, have not been fully rewarded in 2023, but a more stable economic and financing environment is likely to create opportunities and potentially lead to a re-rating of companies involved in these themes. In the long term, GLI demonstrates its strength with low earnings volatility, stable cash flows, a higher relative income component compared to global equities, and attractive returns. Overall, the MSIM Global Listed Infrastructure Team highlights the resilience of GLI and its potential as a lucrative investment option in the evolving financial landscape.

Several major advertisers, including Disney, Lionsgate, Paramount Global, and Apple, have announced that they are cutting off their spending on microblogging site X. This decision comes after Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on social media. Musk agreed with a post that made derogatory remarks about Jewish people and supported the immigration of minorities. The White House condemned Musk's actions, calling it "unacceptable." X's CEO, Linda Yaccarino, stated that the company has been clear about its efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. Musk later clarified that accounts promoting extreme violence would be suspended. Advertisers have become concerned about X since Musk purchased the platform and expressed intentions to loosen content moderation rules. Many companies have been hesitant to have their ads appear alongside offensive or hateful speech. In April, Musk announced that most advertisers had returned to the platform, but ad revenue had decreased by 50%.

### [Japan to keep urging China to lift seafood import ban: Prime Minister Fumio Kishida](https://theprint.in/world/japan-to-keep-urging-china-to-lift-seafood-import-ban-prime-minister-fumio-kishida/1849769/)

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stated that Japan will continue to urge China to lift its import ban on Japanese seafood in response to the release of treated radioactive water from a nuclear power plant. Kishida emphasized the need for a science-based judgment on the issue and called for a constructive approach based on scientific analysis and facts. He also mentioned that Japan and China have agreed to have expert consultations on the issue from a scientific standpoint. The water being released from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex is diluted to reduce tritium levels and has been deemed to have a negligible impact on people and the environment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The import ban remains an obstacle to improving relations between Japan and China.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The ongoing Gaza war is causing a crisis in agriculture in Israel, with farmers unable to plant crops due to the conflict. This has led to a shortage of produce, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and carrots. Many farms near the Gaza Strip and the Lebanese border have been devastated by Hamas terrorists, and the situation is further exacerbated by the return of Thai agricultural workers to their home country. To address the shortage of workers, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Employment Service have launched an initiative to pair unemployed Israelis with farms in need of extra hands. Salaries will be doubled in areas near the conflict zones.

The United States has imposed new sanctions on the militia group Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS) and its secretary-general, Hashim Finyan Rahim al-Saraji, designating them as "specially designated global terrorists." The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned six individuals affiliated with the Iran-aligned militia group Kata'ib Hizballah (KH). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the KSS's terrorist activities have threatened the lives of US and global coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria. Blinken also noted that Iran has supported KSS, KH, and other Iran-aligned militia groups with training, funding, and sophisticated weapons. The investigation into the Hamas massacre at the Re'im music festival on October 7 has revised the death toll to 364, with 40 festival attendees being taken hostage in Gaza. The investigation suggests that Hamas was allegedly unaware of the music festival prior to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the IDF does not plan to keep soldiers inside Gaza after the war, and stressed the need for a civilian administration in Gaza committed to ending funding for terrorism. Israel will maintain overall military responsibility for Gaza but seeks a cultural change and rejects anyone who shares Hamas' goals.

England secured a 2-0 home victory against Malta in a lacklustre performance that disappointed the Wembley Stadium crowd. The only goal until the 75th minute came from an own goal by Enrico Pepe. Captain Harry Kane later doubled England's lead. Despite the win, several fringe players failed to impress. The victory ensured England's top spot in Group C and moved them closer to a top seeding at Euro 2024. However, their performance was underwhelming, with Malta posing more attacking threats in the first half. England will face tougher tests in upcoming friendlies against Belgium and Brazil.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Biden administration's efforts to negotiate an ambitious Asia trade deal are facing challenges, according to trade experts and business groups. The administration aimed to complete key chapters of its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative trade "pillar" but encountered resistance from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, who were unwilling to commit to strong labor and environmental standards with binding enforcement provisions. Despite completing non-binding pillars on clean energy cooperation and anti-corruption measures, the lack of trade outcomes overshadowed these achievements. Some experts believe that election-year pressures make a deal unlikely, similar to the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2016. The administration had hoped to limit the scope of the IPEF trade pillar to avoid political blowback but faced skepticism from stakeholders due to its lack of ambition. Trade deals typically take a long time to negotiate, and the tight deadline ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit was seen as a constraint. Meanwhile, China expressed interest in aligning with Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) standards, signaling its desire to expand high-standard free trade areas.

Israel has warned Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to relocate westward away from the line of fire and closer to humanitarian aid, indicating a potential attack on Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north. The Israeli government aims to protect civilians from being caught in the crossfire but such a move could worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the area. Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militant group controlling Gaza since their attack into Israel on October 7th that resulted in many deaths and hostages taken. The Israeli assault on Gaza City has left two-thirds of its population homeless, leading to fears of permanent displacement. Gaza health authorities report over 12,000 deaths, including 5,000 children, although these figures are not frequently updated due to data collection challenges. Despite international calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pauses, the conflict shows no signs of abating. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and increase aid as per the United Nations' requests amid concerns of starvation and disease. The Al Shifa hospital, a primary target in Israel's ground assault, is under scrutiny for alleged use by Hamas as a command headquarters, although hospital staff deny these claims. A premature baby and an elderly captive from Israel have died recently, further deepening the humanitarian crisis.

Liberia President George Weah has conceded defeat in the country's election to opposition leader Joseph Boakai. Boakai, a former vice president, secured 50.9% of the vote, while Weah received 49.1%. This marks a turnaround from the previous election in 2017, where Weah won by a large margin. Weah's concession ensures a smooth transition of power and Liberia's second democratic transfer in over seven decades. The country has been grappling with poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, and inadequate electricity supply. Many people have become disillusioned with Weah's lack of progress in addressing these issues. Boakai's supporters celebrated the victory in the capital, Monrovia, with dancing and honking car horns. Boakai emphasized a message of peace and reconciliation and his commitment to bring about positive changes in the country. Liberia is still recovering from two civil wars and a devastating Ebola epidemic.

### [Israeli govt approves regular fuel deliveries to Gaza amid humanitarian concerns](https://theprint.in/world/israeli-govt-approves-regular-fuel-deliveries-to-gaza-amid-humanitarian-concerns/1849635/)

Two fuel tankers carrying 60,000 liters of diesel fuel entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing after approval from Israel's war cabinet. The fuel is authorized for use by international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It will support desalination facilities providing water to the southern strip, with oversight led by the United States and Egypt. This decision allows two fuel tankers per day to enter Gaza, providing crucial support to the water and sewage systems that are on the verge of collapse due to a lack of electricity. Additionally, the fuel will be used for UN relief agency trucks, waste disposal, bakeries, hospitals in southern Gaza, and generators for cell phones and internet services. The decision was made in consultation with the Israel Defence Forces and Israel's International Security Academy to ensure it aligns with operational objectives and does not support Hamas. The rationale behind the decision is to prevent the spread of pandemics and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, there has been criticism within the Israeli government, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling for a reversal of the policy. Fuel shortages have worsened water and sewage issues in Gaza, affecting approximately 70% of the population. This move to allow fuel deliveries comes after pressure from the US.

The number of offenses under EU criminal law will be increased from nine to 18, including timber trafficking, illegal recycling of polluting ship components, and serious breaches of chemical legislation. Additionally, the agreement includes a provision for "qualified offenses" that cause significant and irreversible damage to ecosystems, natural habitats, or air, soil, and water quality.

Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, did not have a crisis plan in place when a nationwide network outage occurred, leaving half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours. The company's executive admitted that their defences had failed and they were not prepared for an outage of that scale. Optus had recently conducted scenario simulations, but they did not anticipate a nationwide shutdown because they had alternate connections built into their network. The outage highlighted concerns about the resilience of Australia's telecommunications networks, following a data breach at Optus last year. The government plans to introduce stricter cyber security reporting standards and mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks across all sectors. The outage was caused by a failure of the company's defensive filters, which led to data overload and the inability to send data on alternate routes. The outage lasted for 12 hours as Optus had to physically reboot their routers and core network devices. The CEO of Optus stated that the company followed up on all incidents, but 228 calls to the emergency hotline failed to connect during the outage. The company also discussed their reliance on third-party contractors and the need to evaluate the appropriate level of outsourcing. Singtel, the parent company of Optus, stated that the software upgrade was not the direct cause of the outage.

Asian shares took a pause on Friday, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan easing from a two-month high but still up for the week. The slump in oil prices and softer U.S. economic data weighed on Wall Street, while boosting bonds and impacting the inflation outlook. The sell-off in oil was likely driven by algorithmic and trend-following funds, causing prices to slide to four-month lows. Walmart's announcement of planned price cuts for the holiday season also added to disinflationary concerns. In Japan, the Nikkei added 0.1%, supported by the Bank of Japan's commitment to its loose policy. Chinese blue chips were lower, as Alibaba Group's Hong Kong shares slumped after it abandoned its cloud business spin-off plans. Bond markets reacted positively to the U.S. inflation report, with future expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve increasing.

Efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear program are facing significant challenges, leaving the United States and its allies with limited options. Talks to revive a nuclear deal have stalled, and tougher actions against Iran risk escalating tensions in an already volatile region. Despite Iran's consistent denial of seeking nuclear weapons, confidential reports indicate that the country now possesses enough uranium enriched up to 60% purity to make three bombs. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election further restricting Washington's flexibility, President Joe Biden cannot currently consider a more informal "understanding" with Iran. Iran's stonewalling of the International Atomic Energy Agency has hindered monitoring efforts, and an accommodation with Iran on the nuclear issue is politically unfeasible at this time. Western powers are now likely to focus on a non-binding statement rather than a resolution to avoid pushing Iran to further nuclear escalation. In the coming months, efforts will be made to strengthen oversight of Iran's nuclear program, although it remains uncertain whether Iran will ultimately become a nuclear state.

The Democracy Forum (TDF) recently organized a webinar titled 'Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh - the subcontinental Brotherhood?' to discuss the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and its potential impact on the country's democratic process. The webinar examined the circumstances surrounding the re-emergence of Jamaat-e-Islami as a democratic movement after a decade of political isolation.

Lord Bruce, the TDF President, highlighted the history of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was established in 1941 with the aim of incorporating Islamic ideology into all aspects of state governance. Although Jamaat-e-Islami is considered Bangladesh's most populous and well-organized political movement, it has not been close to exercising power since 2006 due to evidence of violence and intimidation linked to the party. For the past 15 years, Jamaat has been proscribed as a political actor.

During the webinar, various speakers shared their perspectives on Jamaat-e-Islami. Professor Shafi Mostofa discussed Jamaat's history, agenda, and its controversial role in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. Mohammed Sinan Siyech examined Jamaat's transnational connections and organizational structure, while Maidul Islam assessed the party's influence in contemporary Bangladeshi politics and the challenges it faces.

There appears to be a tactical shift within Jamaat's leadership as they consider changing their position from the time of the Bangladesh Liberation War. However, some argue that fundamental positions have not changed despite a softer rhetoric. Dr. Md Nazrul Islam explored the theme of Jamaat and democracy, suggesting that political Islam and democracy are not necessarily incompatible and that Jamaat has shown support for constitutionalism and electoral politics.

Overall, the webinar provided a platform for discussing Jamaat-e-Islami's role in Bangladesh's political landscape and its potential impact on democracy.

Researchers at the University of Rochester's Wilmot Cancer Institute have made a significant advance in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. They have discovered the genetic changes that occur during tumor migration and identified a medication, known as np137, that may block the process. The next step is a clinical trial planned for early 2024 at the University of Rochester to test the drug's safety and effectiveness on pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to the liver. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and has a low survival rate, with the number of cases predicted to rise. The researchers focused on understanding the biology of metastatic pancreatic cancer since the cancer spreads early during its development and the cells become genetically reprogrammed as they migrate to the liver, making them resistant to standard treatment. The trial will likely involve eligible patients taking np137 before surgery, undergoing surgery to remove the cancer, and then continuing with the medication and chemotherapy afterwards. The study was funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

A recent study conducted by researchers at UCL (University College London) has found that a hunger hormone produced in the gut can directly influence the decision-making area of the brain, known as the hippocampus. The study, which was conducted on mice, is the first to demonstrate how hunger hormones can impact brain activity when an animal is thinking about food. The researchers discovered that the ventral hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in decision-making, is sensitive to the levels of hunger hormones in the gut. When the mice were hungry, there was less neural activity in this area, allowing them to eat. Conversely, when the mice were full, activating the ventral hippocampal neurons stopped them from eating. The researchers hope that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of eating disorders and other health outcomes related to diet. They also plan to investigate whether hunger can affect learning and memory.

Analysts caution that market expectations of rate cuts in the past have often been reversed. Other currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, also weakened.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has reported to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that two experimental smog towers in the city have not been effective in reducing air pollution. The DPCC stated that the operation of these costly air purifiers lacks merit and suggested that the structures be repurposed as a museum for the dissemination of technical information on air pollution control. The report highlighted that the smog tower at Connaught Place, which has been operational for two years at a cost of Rs 25 crore, can only mitigate air pollution by up to 17% within a 100-meter radius. The DPCC argued that considering Delhi's large area, the city would require more than 47,000 such towers, making the cost and maintenance unjustified. The central government also expressed that smog towers are not a solution to the air pollution problem in Delhi-NCR and is against installing more of these air purifiers. The two smog towers were installed in 2021 following directions from the Supreme Court.

The Philippines stated that it is not obligated to inform China about its resupply missions in the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs called on China to remove its illegal structures within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone and be accountable for the damage caused. China has accused the Philippines of illegally entering its waters during resupply missions, while the Philippines asserts that these missions are legitimate. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that China's claim over the South China Sea had no legal basis, a ruling supported by the US Defense Secretary during a meeting with his Manila counterpart. Since 1999, when the Philippines grounded the Sierra Madre ship at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, China has requested its removal based on an alleged agreement that the Philippines denies. The shoal lies well within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.

India's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in October to a record level of $31.46 billion. This increase was driven by a rise in imports, particularly in oil, gold, and silver imports ahead of the Diwali festive season. However, analysts believe that this spike in imports is likely to be a temporary outlier, and they expect the trade deficit to moderate considerably in November and December. The easing of oil prices also provides some relief. Despite the high trade deficit in October, economists retain their current account deficit (CAD) estimates, expecting it to normalize from November onwards.

### [Pakistan: Air pollution crisis intensifies in Lahore](https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-air-pollution-crisis-intensifies-in-lahore/1846439/)

Lahore, Pakistan is facing a severe air pollution crisis as the air quality index (AQI) has reached alarming levels. After a brief period of relatively normal air quality, the city saw a sudden spike with a maximum AQI of 401, marking it as extremely unsafe for breathing. Although there was a slight improvement in the afternoon with the AQI dropping to 188, the air quality deteriorated again in the evening, reaching an AQI of 236. As a result, Lahore now ranks third on the list of the most polluted cities globally. The current readings indicate a severe threat to public health.

Different areas of Lahore showed varying levels of air pollution, with Fida Hussain House reporting an AQI of 364 and WWF Pakistan at 231. The decline in air quality during winter months, from October to February, is a common occurrence in Lahore. Crop burning by farmers in the Punjab province contributes to smog, while weather changes trap pollutants in the air for longer periods.

The main contributors to air pollution in Lahore are vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and waste, dust from construction sites, and deforestation. Temperature inversion worsens winter air pollution by preventing the upward movement of pollutants and causing their accumulation.

Experts recommend providing real-time air quality data to the public with greater detail to help individuals protect themselves and contribute to efforts against air pollution. Reducing industrial and vehicular emissions is crucial for improving air quality. Urgent and coordinated efforts are needed to address the root causes of air pollution and protect the health and well-being of Lahore's residents.

The researchers used a novel approach to induce and study RNA damage in the absence of DNA damage, leading to the identification of the ribosome as a sensor for crosslinking damage. The findings have implications for the mechanisms of action of commonly used anti-cancer drugs. Aldehydes, which are produced in the body through metabolic processes, are toxic because they bind to macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins and crosslink them.

### [Can a Balanced Advantage Fund Help you Withstand Market Volatility?](https://theprint.in/ani-press-releases/can-a-balanced-advantage-fund-help-you-withstand-market-volatility/1845834/)

Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs) are hybrid mutual fund schemes that dynamically manage their portfolio between equity and debt based on market conditions. These funds aim to optimize returns by shifting between asset classes. BAFs have the flexibility to invest in equity, debt, or have a balanced exposure to both. This allows them to generate returns in different market conditions, making them suitable for investment through all economic cycles.

BAFs can help in volatile markets by adapting to changing conditions. Unlike traditional approaches with fixed allocation percentages, BAFs can capitalize on opportunities and manage risks effectively. They deliver returns in both bull and bear phases, capturing the upside during market booms and cushioning losses during downturns. BAFs also provide downside mitigation by increasing debt exposure during volatile phases, balancing the risk of equities. Additionally, professional fund managers continuously monitor market trends and adjust allocations for optimal risk-adjusted returns.

BAFs overcome the limitations of other hybrid schemes by offering more flexible equity-debt rebalancing parameters. Traditional hybrid funds may fail to adapt to extreme market movements due to allocation constraints. Aggressive hybrid funds with high equity allocation limits may decline sharply during steep corrections, while conservative hybrid funds with lower equity caps may miss out on maximizing upside potential. BAFs, on the other hand, have a dynamic and unconstrained approach, optimizing returns in all market environments.

When choosing a suitable BAF, it is important to track the fund manager's record in navigating different markets, evaluate the extent of allocation shifts between equity and debt over the past 5-10 years, consider the consistency and success of returns across bull and bear phases, and assess factors such as portfolio churn, expense ratios, and the experience of the fund management team.

BAFs provide flexibility and can serve as all-season funds across economic cycles. They are a robust long-term investment choice suitable for various financial needs. It is advisable to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative parameters before selecting a BAF as an investment vehicle.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The first truck carrying a United Nations fuel shipment entered Gaza from Egypt, marking a small step in alleviating the fuel shortages that have been affecting relief efforts in the region. Israel allowed 24,000 liters of diesel fuel to be delivered for UN aid distribution, but not for use at hospitals. The limited delivery of fuel is just 9% of what is needed daily to sustain life-saving activities in Gaza. The lack of fuel has caused the closure of hospitals, bakeries, and sewage pumping stations, as well as threatening to shut down telecoms data centers and connection points. The UN had warned that it may have to halt humanitarian operations if its fuel stocks became fully depleted. However, aid workers say the initial delivery of fuel is not enough to meet the needs of hospitals or aid deliveries. Despite the delivery of food and supplies, the aid distribution has been significantly affected due to the lack of fuel. Israel had previously refused to allow fuel in, fearing it would be used by Hamas. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas began in response to Hamas fighters crossing into southern Israel. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hungary is challenging the European Union's policy towards Ukraine, disagreeing with other EU countries that support bringing Ukraine closer to the bloc and providing more aid amid the Russian invasion. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties with Moscow, believes the EU's strategy of sending aid has failed and opposes starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. Hungary's opposition is the main obstacle to a decision by EU leaders to begin formal membership talks with Ukraine and allocate €50 billion in aid. Hungary argues for a period of reflection and strategic discussion on the EU's policy towards Ukraine before supporting any decisions on Ukraine's accession process or further aid. This dispute highlights Hungary's concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine and its disagreement with the EU over democratic issues and access to funds. EU officials are exploring ways to bypass a Hungarian veto on aid to Ukraine but recognize the significance of supporting Ukraine's security and credibility. The outcome of the December EU summit and the decision on Ukraine's membership talks remain uncertain due to the need for consensus among member states.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Germany's constitutional court has ruled that the government's plan to use unused emergency funds from the pandemic for climate initiatives is unconstitutional, leaving a 60 billion euro ($65 billion) hole in its finances. This decision complicates budget negotiations within Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition and could set a precedent for future fiscal responses to crises. Finance Minister Christian Lindner will face increased scrutiny on spending control, and the ruling may force the government to make spending cuts. The earmarked funds were intended for energy efficiency, renewable electricity subsidies, chip production, and support for energy-intensive companies. The ruling has significant implications for Germany's fiscal policy and support for decarbonization. Germany's 2024 budget and financial plans through 2027 are being finalized this week as the country curbs spending due to COVID-19 and the Ukraine war.

A Russian delegation, led by natural resources minister Alexander Kozlov, visited Pyongyang, North Korea. The visit came as the politically isolated state announced progress in its banned ballistic missile program. The talks between Russia and North Korea focused on the economy, science, and technology. Kozlov emphasized Russia's desire for substantial cooperation with North Korea based on agreements made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, a cultural delegation from North Korea traveled to St. Petersburg for an event. South Korea's intelligence agency stated that North Korea is in the final stages of preparing for the launch of a spy satellite, potentially with technical assistance from Russia. North Korean state media reported successful static tests of new high-thrust solid-fuel engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). These tests are seen as essential for enhancing North Korea's military capabilities in a challenging security environment. Solid-fuel missiles are considered easier to operate and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons. Both North Korea's missile program and its nuclear weapons are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions, leading to imposed sanctions. The US has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in the war with Ukraine, while Moscow is alleged to provide technical military support to North Korea. However, both countries deny these claims and pledge closer military cooperation.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have made significant gains in their war with the army, breaking months of stalemate. These gains have strengthened the RSF's position and influence in talks in Jeddah. While there is speculation about the possibility of Sudan splitting, it remains unclear how the RSF could govern a breakaway territory. Instead, the RSF aims to increase its access to resources, such as gold, and secure its role in any political settlement. The RSF has been expanding its control in various regions, including Darfur and Khartoum, and has expressed its intention to reach Port Sudan. However, there is currently no immediate risk of Sudan splitting. The war between the RSF and the army began after a plan to integrate the two forces fell apart. The RSF has been gradually gaining territory and has recently used drones and longer-range artillery. The army has faced challenges with repairs to its warplanes and fatigue among soldiers. The RSF's advances have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with thousands of casualties and millions displaced. Ceasefire talks in Jeddah have been adjourned without a resolution, with the RSF seeking checkpoints and outposts to formalize its role in Khartoum. The army is under pressure from Bashir loyalists and Islamist militias. The situation remains volatile, and ethnically targeted violence is likely to persist.

Central European defense companies are aiming to expand their sales of weapons, military equipment, and related services in Africa. Former Warsaw Pact countries, such as the Czech Republic, have a history of supplying weapons to African nations during the Communist era and are now well-positioned to upgrade these systems. The shift towards Western technology by African countries still using Soviet-era equipment provides new opportunities for Central European defense companies. These companies are negotiating deals for guns, ammunition, military equipment, and services with various African nations. Their expertise in maintaining and modernizing Eastern-origin military land systems appeals to African customers who want to reduce reliance on Russian suppliers. With concerns over the reliability of Russian arms, there is potential for Central European defense companies to fill the gap. Russia has become the leading arms seller in sub-Saharan Africa, but the expertise of Czech industry in former Soviet weapons presents a valuable advantage. Polish defense companies have also intensified their talks with African markets, and interest has increased from potential African customers in Poland. The Czech Republic recently sent a trade mission to several African countries, focusing on boosting opportunities for the defense industry. Reopening and strengthening relationships with traditional partners in Africa is a key goal. Defense industry cooperation is seen as an integral part of these efforts. The Czech arms industry's reputation has been enhanced through its efforts to supply Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion in 2022. As African countries using Soviet-style equipment start to view Russia as a problematic supplier, they are turning to Central European alternatives.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent analysis has revealed that government efforts to remove unapproved and banned antibiotic fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs in India have been largely ineffective. The study found that in 2020, the majority of antibiotic formulations sold in India were either unapproved or banned. FDC drugs are combinations of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients in a single drug. While the total number of antibiotic FDC formulations on the market decreased from 574 in 2008 to 395 in 2020, around 70.4% of these formulations were unapproved or banned. Antibiotic resistance is a global concern, making it crucial to address this issue. The study suggests that regular surveys of the market and strengthened enforcement are necessary. Despite regulatory initiatives taken since 2007, hundreds of unapproved antibiotic FDC formulations have remained in the Indian market. Additionally, a considerable portion of antibiotic FDCs sold in India in 2020 were not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The slow progress in removing irrational FDC drugs is attributed to weak and inefficient regulatory enforcement.

According to a study conducted by the University of Adelaide and Oxford University, asbestos exposure led to a higher prevalence of asbestos-related lung cancers among British and Australian navy personnel compared to other armed forces. The study analyzed data from 30,085 British and Australian troops who served in the 1950s and 1960s, when asbestos-containing materials were present on naval vessels. The researchers found that the lung cancer rate was higher in naval personnel, and although smoking remains the primary cause of lung cancer, the excess cases in the navy could not be explained by a higher smoking rate. The study concluded that onboard asbestos exposure was likely the main cause of the increased lung cancer rate. Additionally, asbestosis deaths were observed among sailors, further strengthening the link. The researchers estimated that approximately 27% of lung cancers among Australian seamen and 12% among British seamen were related to onboard asbestos exposure. The study highlights the ongoing risk of asbestos exposure to workers, despite bans and regulatory controls. The researchers suggest that the effects of asbestos exposure may be underestimated unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis. They emphasize the need for strict control measures to protect workers from asbestos and other harmful airborne dusts.

Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), a steel company, has stated that if it can raise between Rs 3000-4000 crore through the monetization of its forged wheel plant and land, as well as ongoing efficiency measures, it will be able to increase production and turn around from losses. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) handles the monetization process as RINL is a divestment candidate. RINL had invested Rs 2000 crore in the wheel plant, which has the capacity to produce one lakh forged train wheels per year. RINL’s CEO, Atul Bhatt, said that if monetization occurs this fiscal year, it will help RINL come back to cash profit through increased production. RINL posted a loss of around Rs 3000 crore in 2022-23 due to factors such as a glut in the steel market, the export tax on steel, and a lack of captive raw material security. Bhatt highlighted a cost disadvantage of Rs 6000 per tonne due to buying iron ore from the open market and an unsustainable debt of around Rs 23000 crore. The monetization plan aims to reduce debt and improve the working capital situation. Bhatt also mentioned measures such as increasing oxygen capacity and switching the import of coking coal. RINL’s substantial land bank is considered attractive as it eliminates the need for prospective buyers to invest in developing new land parcels. The land parcels are currently under the direct ownership of the union government.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new study published in Frontiers in Science raises doubts about the effectiveness of achieving "net-zero" emissions in halting global warming. Net-zero emissions refers to the point at which the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount removed from it. The study argues that there is uncertainty surrounding the estimates that global warming will stop at net-zero, suggesting that there is a chance global warming could continue and intensify after reaching this point. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address this risk. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing global temperatures and highlights the need to limit initial disturbances to the planet in order to mitigate climate risks. The research identifies several processes that could contribute to significant warming after reaching net-zero emissions. The melting of polar ice, for example, leads to increased absorption of solar energy, which further drives up temperatures. The study concludes that political obstacles, rather than technological or physical ones, are currently hindering climate action. It argues for collaborative efforts among climate experts to better understand the impact of various processes and improve warming predictions.

The introduction of a passport requirement for crossing into Afghanistan has also disrupted businesses and family connections in Chaman, leading to protests. The social impact of the deportations is significant, as many Afghans had been part of the society for years, marrying and developing community ties. The deportations may strain cross-border kinships, diminish cultural and social contributions, and potentially destabilize local economies. Baloch nationalist parties, who were previously opposed to Afghan refugees, have remained silent on the issue this time. There are allegations that a large number of Afghans have been issued Pakistani identity cards, and there is speculation that these cards will be blocked and cancelled in the next phase, which could inadvertently affect Pakistani citizens in Balochistan. A careful and humane approach is necessary to prevent further disruption to the lives of both Afghan refugees and Balochistan's citizens.

Syria has granted the United Nations (UN) permission to continue delivering aid to opposition-held areas in the country's northwest for another three months. Initially, after an earthquake caused significant casualties in Turkey and Syria, the UN was allowed to provide aid through Turkish border crossings for a period of three months, which has now been extended for a third time until February 13th. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs highlighted the importance of this cross-border operation, as it reaches around 2.5 million people monthly with critical assistance and protection services. Syria's mission to the UN confirmed the extension of the UN's use of the Bab al-Salam and Al Ra'ee crossings. The UN had also been using the Bab al-Hawa crossing since 2014, but authorization from the UN Security Council expired in mid-July. However, shortly after, the Syrian government allowed the UN to continue using Bab al-Hawa for an additional six months. In total, over 4,200 trucks carrying UN aid have utilized these border crossings so far this year.

Israeli tanks have positioned themselves at the gates of Gaza City's main hospital, Al Shifa, resulting in patients, including newborns, dying due to a lack of fuel and power. The siege of the hospital and the lack of resources have caused the death of 32 patients in the last three days. Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra stated that there are still around 650 patients in need of evacuation. Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters by Hamas fighters, an accusation denied by Hamas. President Joe Biden expressed his hope for less intrusive action at the hospital and stressed the need to protect it. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of two-thirds of Gaza's population. Fighting has also occurred at Al Quds hospital, causing it to cease functioning. Israel alleges that terrorists were shot from the hospital entrance in return fire. The conflict has raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militia targets in Syria.

The Brazilian government plans to expand its railway network with a 40 billion reais ($8 billion) fund, funded by removing discounts given to rail companies under previous government contracts. The discounts were given to iron ore miner Vale and logistics companies Rumo and MRS in 2022 under the government of former President Jair Bolsonaro. These contracts did not go through the normal public bidding process, and the companies were allowed to make an advance payment deducting unamortized assets from their owed concession payments. The government claims that the companies owe an additional 40 billion reais ($8.1 billion) in unpaid concession payments. While Rumo has agreed to pay, Vale and MRS are still disputing the matter in court. Once the court's decision is made, the government plans to arrange any payments with the companies. The funds will be used to finance the construction of new railways and extend existing ones, with the goal of increasing rail freight transportation from 17% to 40% of Brazil's total freight, including iron ore.

The government has accused Google of paying billions to ensure its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, alleging it as an abuse of monopoly. Murphy also stated that these payments often result in benefits to users, such as cheaper phones or better data plans. He added that while Microsoft had the majority of preinstalled browser defaults, its Bing search engine only received 15% of search queries. The trial is expected to conclude this week.

### [Rising temperatures, longer monsoon drive Bangladesh’s worst dengue outbreak](https://theprint.in/environment/rising-temperatures-longer-monsoon-drive-bangladeshs-worst-dengue-outbreak/1843678/)

Bangladesh is experiencing its worst-ever outbreak of dengue fever, with a death toll of 1,476 and over 291,000 infected. Experts attribute the severe outbreak to rising temperatures and a longer monsoon season caused by climate change, which create ideal breeding conditions for the dengue-spreading mosquito. This year's death toll is more than five times that of 2022 and the highest since authorities began tracking the disease in 2000. The Aedes mosquito, which spreads dengue, is adapting to the changing climate patterns, leading to the disease's spread in all 64 districts of the country. Vector surveillance is now needed year-round to monitor the disease's spread. There is no specific vaccine or drug for dengue, but early detection and proper medical care can reduce deaths to less than 1% of those infected. Hospitals in Bangladesh are struggling to cope with the influx of patients and a shortage of intravenous fluids.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Oil prices increased by over 1% following the release of OPEC's monthly market report, which alleviated concerns about declining demand in the US and China. OPEC stated that oil market fundamentals remained strong and attributed the drop in prices to speculators. The organization slightly raised its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and maintained its high prediction for 2024. The report countered negative sentiment around Chinese demand and increased demand growth forecasts for this year. Last week, the US Energy Information Administration lowered its projection for crude oil production and predicted a decrease in demand. Additionally, weak economic data from China raised fears of faltering demand. However, analysts believe that oil prices may have reached a bottom and expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to continue their voluntary supply cuts into next year, limiting downside potential.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices rose slightly as the dollar weakened, and investors are awaiting U.S. inflation data that could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $1,934.25 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,938.50. The upcoming release of U.S. consumer prices index (CPI) data and producer price index data will be closely watched. If the inflation data exceeds expectations, gold may face downward pressure due to the possibility of a rate hike. However, if the data aligns with expectations, gold could trade above $1,950. It's important to note that higher interest rates can reduce the appeal of gold as it doesn't generate yield. The market currently predicts an 86% chance of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in December. Last week, gold prices dipped due to reduced safe-haven demand and a hawkish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Moody's recently changed the outlook on the U.S. government's ratings to "negative" from "stable." Spot silver fell by 1% to $21.99 per ounce, while platinum gained 1.1% to $849.49 and palladium fell by 1% to $953.44, near a five-year low.

In lupus, an autoimmune disease, women are affected nine times more than males. The reasons behind this gender disparity have been unclear, but a recent study by Johns Hopkins Medicine has shed light on the role of the X chromosome and a specific genetic material called X-inactive specific transcript (XIST). The study found that XIST can trigger an immune response involving toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a protein in the immune system. This immune response contributes to the development and severity of lupus in women. The research suggests that XIST may play a role in promoting autoimmunity and could be a potential target for future therapies.

Negotiators at the third round of talks in Nairobi are urged to reach a deal on the world's first treaty to combat plastic pollution. The global plastic waste production is around 400 million metric tonnes per year, with less than 10% being recycled. Approximately 14 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean annually, alongside increasing amounts in landfills. Delegates will discuss potential measures for the treaty, focusing on the entire life cycle of plastics or prioritizing plastic waste management. Kenya advocates for a binding agreement on plastic production and usage and has implemented laws banning certain plastic uses since 2017. The plastic industry and oil and petrochemical exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, oppose curbing plastic use and argue for improved recycling and reuse. Majority of countries support advancing the negotiations, while a smaller group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are attempting to hinder progress.

So far, no country has made a specific financial pledge to the fund, although the US has signaled interest in contributing "several millions of dollars".

Presidential front-runner Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia criticized the European Union (EU) over its ban on palm oil imports and claimed that Europeans were also responsible for deforestation during colonial times. The EU recently passed a law to ban imports of commodities linked to forest destruction, including palm oil, which Indonesia is the largest producer of. Prabowo argued that while Indonesia has maintained good relations with Europe, the EU's ban on palm oil has created difficulties for selling other products such as coffee, tea, and cocoa. The EU, previously the third-largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil, did not immediately respond to Prabowo's comments. Prabowo further highlighted that during colonial rule, Europeans forced Indonesians to plant other crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, and cocoa, resulting in the destruction of forests. He emphasized the need for an equal playing field and expressed concern about the impact of the EU's deforestation law on Indonesia's annual exports. A task force comprising the EU, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the second-largest palm oil producer globally, has been formed to discuss the law.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The dollar reached its highest level against the Japanese yen in over a year, boosted by reduced expectations of US interest rate cuts next year. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stated that the government would monitor the currency market and respond accordingly, but this had little immediate impact on the yen. The British pound slightly increased after a reshuffle of key government posts by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Traders in global currency markets were cautious, awaiting the latest US inflation numbers to determine the likelihood of rate cuts next year. While the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen since October 2022, it was last up 0.15%. Last week, Fed policymakers indicated that the battle against inflation was not yet over, leading to a reduction in market rate cut bets and supporting the dollar. The dollar index also saw gains, remaining firm due to last week's increase. Moody's lowering the outlook for US credit had little impact on the market. Japanese data showed that wholesale inflation had slowed, suggesting diminishing pressure on the yen. However, there was still concern about potential intervention from the Japanese government to strengthen the currency. The euro and sterling both gained slightly, with sterling also rising against the euro after news of changes in the UK government.

Medics inside the hospital reported that patients, including newborn babies, were dying due to a lack of fuel. The Gaza health ministry stated that 32 patients had died in the past three days, and around 650 patients were still awaiting evacuation. However, Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters for Hamas fighters and accuses them of using patients as shields. The conflict has also raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militias in Syria. The ongoing conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and made more than half of the population homeless. The situation at Al Shifa hospital remains dire, with tanks stationed at the gates, Israeli fire targeting the hospital, and limited resources available. Another major hospital in northern Gaza has also stopped functioning. The United Nations observed a minute's silence for the 101 staff members killed so far. The conflict has sparked polarized reactions globally, with some countries condemning the Israeli response and the high civilian casualties. Israel maintains that it must destroy Hamas and blames fighters hiding among civilians for the harm caused. The United States supports Israel's position but urges the protection of civilians.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the Congress party's efforts in promoting social justice and its impact on the caste composition of its candidates for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly election. The party has appointed a Dalit leader as its national president and has been advocating for a caste census. However, an analysis of the party's nominated candidates reveals that substantial changes have not been made in its candidate nomination policy.

The Congress has allocated 36% of the tickets to upper castes, which comprise only around 10% of the state's population. In contrast, OBCs, representing more than half of the state's population, have been given only 27% of the tickets. This indicates that while there is a symbolic shift towards social justice, there have been no substantive changes in the candidate nomination policy.

The article also highlights the dominance of certain jatis (castes) among the Congress candidates. More than half of the nominated candidates belong to five jatis: Rajput, Brahmin, Gond, Bhil, and Jatav/Ahirwar. Rajputs and Brahmins make up a significant portion of the nominations, with Rajputs comprising around 14% and Brahmins around 13% of the total candidates.

Gonds and Bhils, as well as Jains, Baniyas, and Gurjars, also receive notable political representation. Among Scheduled Castes, the Jatav/Ahirwar castes have the highest number of nominations. However, the Congress has not been able to implement its aggressive stance on caste issues within the party, as the traditional upper-caste local elite still have influence over nominations.

The article concludes by suggesting that the Congress may face electoral consequences if it fails to address these disparities in caste representation.

### [Why are my kids good around other people and then badly behaved with me?](https://theprint.in/world/why-are-my-kids-good-around-other-people-and-then-badly-behaved-with-me/1842704/)

This article discusses why children often behave well at school or in other settings but exhibit worse behavior at home. It explains that children learn from an early age that their behavior produces outcomes and can be a way to control the actions of others. Sometimes, children are inadvertently rewarded for misbehavior at home through increased attention or getting what they want. In contrast, children may behave better at school because teachers have clear expectations and reward systems in place. The article suggests that parents can help improve their children's behavior at home by establishing routines, setting simple house rules, noticing good behavior, spending regular small amounts of time with their child, and having realistic expectations.

China's increasing presence in the Pacific region has led to mixed perceptions among local populations, according to surveys conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands. While both governments welcome China's engagement, concerns over environmental pollution and perceived lack of benefits from Chinese projects were raised. However, those living near mining operations tended to view them more positively due to financial benefits. Chinese government scholarships improved students' views of China, with participants recommending the program and reporting a positive change in their impressions of the country. In the Solomon Islands, support for closer ties with both China and the US was high among surveyed students, although some expressed concerns about potential debt risks associated with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Non-governmental organizations in the Pacific also raised concerns about human rights violations, governance, debt risks, and environmental pollution related to China's initiatives. The complex and nuanced perceptions of local populations in the Pacific regarding China's influence should be considered by policymakers in the US and Australia as they aim to counter China's growing relationships in the region.

Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that China has been increasing its presence in the Pacific region, particularly in countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands. While the governments of these countries welcome China's engagement, there are mixed perceptions among the local populations. For example, in PNG, concerns about environmental pollution related to the China-owned Ramu NiCo project were expressed by the majority of respondents. However, those living in the mining lease area had a more positive view due to the direct financial benefits they receive. In Solomon Islands, there is support for a closer bilateral relationship with China, but some individuals have concerns about debt risks and Chinese control over resources.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) experienced a significant cyber hack on its U.S. broker-dealer, causing disruption to its operations. The attack was so extensive that the corporate email system stopped working, forcing employees to switch to Google mail. As a result, the brokerage temporarily owed BNY Mellon $9 billion, which was much larger than its net capital. ICBC's New York-based unit received financial support from its Chinese parent to repay BNY Mellon, and manual processing of trades was conducted with the help of the custody bank. ICBC expected the process of setting up secure systems and resuming normal business to take at least until Monday. During this time, clients were asked to temporarily suspend business and clear trades elsewhere. The ransomware attack, claimed by cybercrime gang Lockbit, raises concerns about the resilience of the Treasury market and highlights the importance of cybersecurity. The hack may also influence regulatory discussions surrounding central clearing of Treasury trades. The incident is likely to be a topic of conversation at an upcoming Treasury market conference. Despite being a mid-sized broker, ICBC's systems being paralyzed caused disruptions in the market, leading some market participants to reroute their trades. BNY Mellon played a crucial role in helping sort through the situation and facilitated the clearing of trades manually. ICBC's parent injected capital into the unit to ensure payment to BNY Mellon. Once ICBC's new system is operational, others in the industry will also review its safety measures, potentially causing further delays in returning to normal operations.

### [Payments app Zelle begins refunds for imposter scams after Washington pressure](https://theprint.in/tech/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-for-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure/1842693/)

Banks on the payment app Zelle have made a significant policy change by starting to refund victims of imposter scams. This decision comes in response to concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers and the federal consumer watchdog. Zelle, which is owned by seven major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, began reversing transfers on June 30 for customers who were deceived into sending money to scammers posing as government agencies or financial service providers. The move goes beyond legal requirements, according to Ben Chance, the chief fraud risk officer at Early Warning Services (EWS), the company that owns Zelle.

Previously, banks were only required to reimburse customers for unauthorized payments made by hackers, not for transfers initiated by customers themselves. While Zelle introduced a new reimbursement benefit for specific scam types, it had not previously provided details about its imposter scam refund policy due to concerns that it could encourage false scam claims.

This policy shift represents a significant change from last year when banks argued against refunding transfers that customers were tricked into approving. Zelle has faced criticism after a New York Times report highlighted the prevalence of scams on their platform, with Senator Elizabeth Warren estimating that Zelle users lost $440 million to fraud in 2021 alone.

Impersonator fraud was the most-reported scam across all payment methods in the U.S. in 2022, resulting in $2.6 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Despite concerns that covering the cost of authorized transactions might lead to more fraud, Zelle's owner company, EWS, has implemented a mechanism that allows banks to recover funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender. Additionally, Zelle now requires lenders to implement a tool that detects transfers with risky attributes.

Zelle's changes have satisfied the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) so far, but pressure from lawmakers may lead to further rule changes to protect customers from scams. Zelle faces market pressure to improve its standards of care as it competes with other peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo, which offer purchase protection programs for eligible transactions.

While Zelle's policy change is seen as a positive step, experts emphasize that regulations mandating imposter fraud protections would be better to ensure customer well-being. Payment fraud is expected to be a topic of discussion when bank CEOs appear before the Senate in the future.

The Japanese yen reached a one-year low against the dollar as traders eagerly awaited U.S. inflation data, which is expected to provide insight into whether the Federal Reserve needs to take further action to control rising prices. Market analysts believe that even if the CPI numbers are softer, the Fed will continue to resist rate cuts, considering inflation remains above target. Moody's recent announcement of lowering its outlook for the U.S. credit rating had little impact on the market. The yen remained under pressure due to increasing U.S. Treasury yields and a strong dollar. Meanwhile, data from Japan indicated that wholesale inflation had slowed below 1% for the first time in over two years, suggesting fading cost pressures that offered little support to the yen.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.New Zealand's Prime Minister-elect, Christopher Luxon, stated that he is unlikely to attend the upcoming APEC meeting in San Francisco due to ongoing coalition negotiations. Although Luxon's conservative National Party won the largest share of votes in last month's general election, they require the support of both the right-wing ACT New Zealand and populist New Zealand First Parties to form a majority government. While talks have intensified since the release of final election results on November 3, there is still no set timeline for reaching an agreement. Luxon believes that progress is being made and wants to focus on concluding negotiations and forming a government. However, he expressed a desire to attend APEC to showcase New Zealand as open for business and establish relationships with world leaders. If Luxon doesn't attend, New Zealand will send representatives from the caretaker government and the National Party. The process of forming a government in New Zealand typically takes about a month but can sometimes take longer under the country's mixed member proportional system.

New research led by NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Centre suggests that genetic data from healthy tissue near lung tumors may be a better predictor of cancer recurrence than analyzing the tumors themselves. The study, which focused on lung adenocarcinoma, found that analyzing the transcriptome of apparently healthy tissue accurately predicted recurrence 83% of the time, compared to 63% when analyzing tumor tissue. The study also revealed that genes associated with inflammation in adjacent healthy tissue were particularly useful for making predictions. The findings suggest that immunotherapy could be used to combat tumor growth before it becomes detectable by traditional methods. The researchers plan to use their findings to assess recurrence risk in newly treated lung cancer patients.

A study published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mSystems found that diets high in fiber, particularly those that include broccoli sprouts or other cruciferous vegetables, could help mice with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) live longer and improve their well-being. The researchers examined the impact of a broccoli sprout diet on the immune systems of the mice and the microbes in their gut affected by Crohn's disease. They also studied the reduction of Crohn's symptoms and the anti-inflammatory compounds found in broccoli sprouts. The study involved IL-10-ko mice divided into different diet groups and used new healthy mice to trigger symptoms of colitis and Crohn's disease. The researchers examined gut tissues and microbial communities in the intestines of the mice. They found that the mice on the broccoli sprout diet had higher levels of the anti-inflammatory metabolite sulforaphane in their blood, resulting in milder disease symptoms. The study also revealed that younger mice responded better to the diet and had stronger gut bacterial communities compared to adolescent mice.

The construction of cities equivalent to the size of New York City every month is being driven by population growth and urbanization. However, this rapid urban development is putting increased pressure on the planet and its natural resources because concrete and cement, which are key construction materials, contribute approximately 7% of global CO2 emissions. To address this issue, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and industry input from the Global Cement and Concrete Association, has developed a framework to reduce concrete emissions. The framework suggests three key strategies: decarbonizing the manufacturing process, using lower-carbon cement blends, and optimizing the volume of material used in projects. One potential solution for decarbonizing cement production is an electric chemical approach that replaces fossil fuel kilns with an ambient temperature process. This approach aims to achieve true zero carbon and can be a high-performance, low-carbon building material. The journey of developing sustainable cement production technology serves as a lesson that good ideas can come from anywhere.

Higher oil prices resulting from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to lower economic growth and higher inflation, according to Fitch Ratings. The rating agency estimates that world GDP growth would be 0.4 percentage points lower in 2024 and 0.1 percentage points lower in 2025. Fitch's simulations assume average oil prices of $120 per barrel in 2024 and $100 per barrel in 2025. The impact of higher oil prices would dampen GDP growth in most economies, with South Africa and Turkey being the most affected. Fitch also expects higher inflation rates in 2024, followed by corrections in 2025. The potential oil price shock could result in tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets.

Negotiations are underway for the creation of a treaty to address plastic pollution, and officials are divided on whether to limit plastic production or focus on waste management. The world currently produces around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with less than 10% being recycled. The European Union and several countries advocate for binding provisions to reduce plastic production and eliminate problematic plastics, while the plastic industry and oil-exporting nations argue for a focus on recycling and reusing plastics. The United States has shifted its stance, now calling for national plans that align with global goals to reduce plastic pollution. Environmental groups hope the discussions can move past procedural matters and focus on substantive solutions.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A study conducted by researchers from Michigan State University found that there is no reliable association between pet ownership and well-being. The study involved 767 participants who completed online surveys, and while pet owners reported that their pets improved their lives, there was no difference in the well-being of pet owners compared to non-pet owners over time. The study also found that the type of pet, the number of pets, and the quality of the human-pet relationship did not affect the association. The researchers suggested that non-pet owners may have other sources of happiness in their lives. They concluded that while pets may provide positive experiences, they may not have a transformative effect on overall well-being.

### [Diwali car discounts make for a great deal. But don’t drive home a soon-to-be extinct SUV](https://theprint.in/opinion/dashboard/diwali-car-discounts-make-for-a-great-deal-but-dont-drive-home-a-soon-to-be-extinct-suv/1840907/)

The Indian automotive industry has experienced a swift rebound after the challenges of 2020, with consistent monthly sales growth over the past two years. It is predicted that by March 2024, the Indian passenger car market will surpass four million units, making it the world's third-largest car market behind China and the United States.

However, Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor India, Tarun Garg, raises concerns about the current situation. He points out that rival carmakers are offering massive discounts on their flagship products during the Diwali season, suggesting that there may be underlying issues despite the apparent positive growth. Garg predicts a decline in growth as 2024 approaches, marking the end of a period of intense expansion.

Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) indicates that sales of passenger cars in October 2023 grew by 15.87% compared to the previous year. While major manufacturers like Hyundai saw their sales increase by close to 15%, smaller players such as Renault, Nissan, and Citroen experienced significant declines. This could be due to a lack of suitable products, although even established carmakers like Honda have resorted to offering attractive discounts to drive sales growth.

Discounts are not limited to the mainstream market and can also be found in the luxury segment. Luxury carmakers offer attractive loan deals through their finance arms to show volumes, often at rates lower than those offered by banks. There are also instances where dealers are asked to pick up cars to demonstrate monthly volumes, which are then sold off as unregistered vehicles at significant discounts.

The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) has created confusion among Indian consumers. Currently, the EV market offers limited choices, mostly retrofitted variants of internal-combustion engine cars. However, purpose-built EVs are expected to enter the market around 2025-26, providing better options for consumers. Major automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti-Suzuki, Hyundai, and Kia are working on upcoming EV models.

Despite potential economic uncertainty after the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Hyundai remains committed to its plans for a 'Made In India' EV, similar to a C-segment SUV, by 2025. This raises the question of whether buying a new vehicle at this time might lead to owning a car that could become obsolete in a few years.

In summary, while the Indian automotive industry has shown impressive growth, concerns about underlying issues such as discounts, declining sales for some manufacturers, and the impending shift towards EVs raise questions about the future of the market.

### [Bangladeshi Muslims are building a 300-yr-old Kali temple. Now they want Modi’s help](https://theprint.in/ground-reports/bangladeshi-muslims-are-building-a-300-yr-old-kali-temple-now-they-want-modis-help/1841292/)

The 300-year-old Sasan Kali temple in Bangladesh's Magura district was partially destroyed in the 2000 floods. Now, both Muslims and Hindus are coming together to rebuild the temple and are seeking assistance from the governments of Bangladesh and India. The village of Basurdhuljhuri, where the temple is located, serves as a symbol of secularism in a country that has been witnessing communal violence during Hindu festivities.

Every year, journalist Sahidul Hasan Khokon returns to his native village for the Kali pujo at the temple. This year, he and his friends plan to form a committee to restore the temple to its original glory. Despite its current modest appearance, the temple attracts millions of devotees who believe that their wishes will be granted by the goddess Kali.

In 2001, there was no Kali pujo due to the flood, but Muslim neighbors contributed funds and resources to help construct a temporary temple for the Hindus in the village. Now, the community wants to build a proper temple and hopes for support from both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments. They cite a similar project funded by India in Natore district as a precedent.

The Kali temple at Basurdhuljhuri holds historical significance and requires a budget of at least fifteen lakh Bangladeshi Taka for construction. Bengali Hindus in West Bengal and Bangladesh worship Goddess Kali during Diwali, and the Sasan Kali form is revered in certain temples like the one in Basurdhuljhuri.

The story of Hindus and Muslims coming together to rebuild a Kali temple is seen as an example of syncretic culture defeating fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh. Many individuals, such as actress Ashna Habib Bhabna, appreciate this display of unity and hope for the prompt construction of the temple.

For Sahidul Hasan Khokon, supporting the temple's restoration is not only about rebuilding a part of his childhood, but also about defending his belief system in the face of temple attacks. He hopes that both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments will help restore this shared heritage.

The Maharashtra government is working to identify all Marathas who were once part of the Kunbi caste before the January 2 deadline for their reservation quota. District officials are scrambling to complete the identification process, with more than 300-400 government officials involved in each taluka. The government has directed districts to search various documents and publish Kunbi references found. Afterward, people will be asked to submit claims for caste certificates based on their genealogy. However, there are challenges such as old and delicate records, missing last names, and discrepancies between siblings' castes. Scanning the documents has been a challenge, with smartphone cameras being used due to the issues with regular scanners. The records are in different scripts, so Modi script readers and translators have been employed to identify the word "Kunbi" in various formats. Despite the difficulties, progress is being made, with some districts having already found thousands of Kunbi records.

### [Unlike AAP’s corruption in Delhi, UP’s excise policy is transparent: UP minister Nitin Agarwal](https://theprint.in/india/unlike-aaps-corruption-in-delhi-ups-excise-policy-is-transparent-up-minister-nitin-agarwal-2/1841972/)

The Uttar Pradesh Excise Minister, Nitin Agarwal, has accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi of engaging in corrupt practices that benefit the "liquor mafia." He stated that unlike Delhi, where one person can have more than two liquor shops, Uttar Pradesh restricts individuals to a maximum of two liquor shops. Agarwal highlighted that no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption have occurred during the current term of the Yogi Adityanath-led government. The excise policy of the Delhi government for 2021-22 came under scrutiny, leading to a recommendation for a CBI investigation into alleged irregularities by the Lieutenant Governor. Agarwal criticized the AAP for blaming the BJP and suggested that the leaders responsible for the excise scam were involved with the liquor mafia. Both the CBI and the ED are investigating the excise policy cases.

Agarwal emphasized that the UP excise department differs from Delhi's as it provides a level-playing field and operates on a pro-industry policy. He mentioned that the previous policies were not transparent and favored the liquor mafia. The minister stated that the current government welcomes anyone interested in doing business in the state and highlighted the revenue growth of the excise department since the formation of the BJP government in 2017. The target is to reach a revenue figure of Rs 50,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs 80,000 crore by 2027.

Agarwal also mentioned that there have been no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption in Uttar Pradesh during CM Adityanath's second term. He explained that deaths occur when local-level liquor production involves mixing jaggery with urea, which becomes poisonous if methyl alcohol is added. Agarwal assured that country liquor made in distilleries in Uttar Pradesh is safe. The department targets an annual growth rate of 8-10% and sells one crore cases of country liquor per month. Country liquor contributes 44% to the department's total revenue.

The festive seasons in India can take a toll on the skin, leading to a dull and tired complexion. Winter pollution and indulgence in rich foods can further worsen skin issues. To maintain a glowing complexion, dermatologists recommend taking a vitamin B supplement, drinking plenty of water, and applying moisturizer regularly. Home remedies such as using vinegar and lime juice for dandruff or shampooing with beer can also help. Seeking advice from a dermatologist, especially in areas with heavy pollution, is advised. For specific skin issues, treatments like microdermabrasion and exfoliation creams can be effective. However, it is important not to try new treatments right before important events. Hydration, proper cleansing, and moisturizing are essential steps in a skincare routine. Using a micellar water for makeup removal and a gentle cleanser is recommended. Regular exfoliation and sunscreen application are also important. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for overall skin health. Following these skincare steps can ensure that the skin reflects the joy and brightness of the festive season.

The Chief of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Om Prakash Rajbhar, has stated that his party is prepared for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and has requested five seats from the BJP, their alliance partner, for the general elections. Rajbhar also mentioned that the opposition India bloc does not pose a challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as the constituent parties within the opposition fight among themselves. In response to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's statement on contesting in 65 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajbhar claimed that Yadav wants Narendra Modi to become the prime minister again, as the Congress becoming strong in Uttar Pradesh would weaken the Samajwadi Party. Rajbhar criticized Yadav's PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) strategy, stating that the Samajwadi Party only benefits the Yadavs and not the backward classes. SBSP won six seats in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party and later formally joined the NDA. Rajbhar dismissed the threat of the opposition India bloc, describing it as not a challenge and citing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's controversial comments in the assembly on women. SBSP, with a significant presence among the OBC Rajbhar caste, aims to contest a few parliamentary seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh and contiguous areas of Bihar. Regarding seat-sharing for the 2024 elections, Rajbhar stated that the SBSP has sought three seats in Uttar Pradesh and two in Bihar from the BJP. Although discussions on seat-sharing are yet to be held, the party is laying groundwork in Bihar. Rajbhar did not disclose the specific seats his party has requested. The SBSP was previously in an alliance with the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and won four seats, and Rajbhar served as a minister during Yogi Adityanath's first term. After formally rejoining the NDA in July, there is speculation about Rajbhar's return to the cabinet and the induction of another OBC leader, Dara Singh Chauhan.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has released a white paper blaming the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government for the economic crisis in Pakistan, according to a report by Dawn. The PTI claims that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, their government managed to put the economy on a path of rapid growth. The white paper argues that the PDM government, which came into power through a regime change conspiracy, reversed the economic gains achieved by the PTI-led government and caused more economic damage than natural disasters and the pandemic combined. The white paper highlights that when the PTI took office in 2018, the economy was on the verge of collapse, with various economic indicators such as an overvalued Pakistani rupee and a high current account deficit. The document also criticizes the previous government's mismanagement of the energy sector, particularly in relation to the overbuilding of power supply through imported fuel plants. The white paper states that the PTI government had to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance, which came with tough conditions such as increasing taxes and tariffs. Despite facing a global commodity super cycle that led to higher prices for petroleum products, edible oil, and coal, the PTI government was able to maintain control over inflation rates. The white paper also emphasizes that the PTI government accumulated additional debt compared to the previous government, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In related news, the PTI has canceled its public gathering in Karachi after the district administration denied permission. The PTI described the attitude of the authorities towards the party as unfair and stated that they were being denied a level-playing field.

Many residents, like Ran Singh, migrate to Gujarat in search of work because the rocky land in Jhabua does not yield sufficient crops. Singh himself had worked as a cotton-picker in Gujarat in the past. The upcoming state assembly elections in Jhabua, a Congress stronghold reserved for scheduled tribes, have not generated much election atmosphere. The incumbent Congress candidate is Vikrant Bhuria, while the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded Bhanu Bhuria as their candidate. Vikrant claims that the BJP government has not done enough to increase employment opportunities in the tribal-dominated region, leading to migration. Bhanu Bhuria alleges that the lack of dams in Jhabua, which could have provided water for irrigation, has contributed to the migration issue. In the 2018 assembly elections, Guman Singh Damor of the BJP defeated Vikrant Bhuria, but subsequently resigned for the Lok Sabha seat.

### [Trump backs requests for TV coverage of his federal criminal trial – court filing](https://theprint.in/world/trump-backs-requests-for-tv-coverage-of-his-federal-criminal-trial-court-filing/1841867/)

Former US President Donald Trump has filed a legal motion supporting media requests for live television coverage of his federal trial. Trump argues that prosecutors want the trial held in darkness as part of a politically motivated effort by President Joe Biden's administration to undermine his bid for re-election in 2024. Trump is facing four criminal proceedings, including charges of attempting to defraud the federal government and obstructing Congress by spreading false claims of election fraud. The latest filing by Trump's lawyers endorses media organizations' requests for live television coverage, stating that it would allow the American public to see that the case is a "dreamt-up constitutional charade." Special prosecutor Jack Smith had previously opposed the media requests, citing a federal court rule that prohibits broadcasts of criminal proceedings.

Novo Nordisk has announced new data that suggests the heart protective benefits of its obesity treatment, Wegovy, are not solely due to weight loss. The drug, which has been shown to help patients lose an average of 15% of their weight, also reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from heart disease by 20%, according to early data from the company's select trial. The study found that the cardiovascular benefits of Wegovy appeared almost immediately after starting treatment, suggesting they were not solely a result of weight loss. The drug also demonstrated a reduction in non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death. The study's authors note that while the mechanisms behind Wegovy's cardiovascular protection remain speculative, it has a consistent effect on associated risk factors such as inflammation, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. However, the trial did report adverse side effects, primarily gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, in almost 1,500 patients taking Wegovy compared to 718 patients in the placebo group. Novo Nordisk expects to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits in the U.S. and EU next year.

Private spy firm Black Cube used LinkedIn to target Hungarian activists and journalists in a hidden video campaign leading up to Hungary's 2022 election, according to the professional networking site.

### [Turbulent winters are coming. Blame El Niño and global warming combo](https://theprint.in/environment/turbulent-winters-are-coming-blame-el-nino-and-global-warming-combo/1841694/)

According to a new forecast from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the climate pattern known as "El Niño" is predicted to intensify over the winter, potentially leading to a winter of extreme weather, particularly in the US. El Niño refers to a rise in sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, which results in warmer-than-average weather globally. After three years of a cooling phase called La Niña, El Niño is returning at a time when the world is already experiencing high temperatures due to climate change. As a result, NOAA predicts warmer-than-average temperatures in wide areas of the US, along with above-average rainfall in some southern states. El Niño's impact extends beyond the Americas, with potential hotter and drier weather in areas like Australia and Indonesia, and increased hurricane activity in the Pacific Ocean. Studies suggest that global warming may lead to stronger El Niño phases, and climate-related risks are a top concern for risk experts. Mitigating and adapting to climate change is seen as the most pressing issue of the next decade.

### [Can taking salt off the table help prevent diabetes? It’s not that simple](https://theprint.in/health/can-taking-salt-off-the-table-help-prevent-diabetes-its-not-that-simple/1841665/)

A new study from Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that salt consumption may be linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the study is an observational study and cannot prove causation, only association. The data used to assess salt intake was based on a simple question, making it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of salt associated with an increased risk. Most salt intake comes from processed foods rather than added at the table. The study also found a weak association between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but did not provide specific recommendations for reducing salt intake. The key takeaway is that maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet are known to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) plans to maintain its diplomatic ties with Israel despite the international outcry over the war in Gaza. The UAE aims to have a moderating influence on Israel's campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. The mounting death toll in Gaza has stirred outrage in Arab capitals, but the UAE has publicly condemned Israel's actions and called for an end to the violence. The UAE is also working to moderate the public positions of other Arab states to facilitate a return to dialogue once the war ends. The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and has no plans to sever diplomatic ties. The UAE's motivation for establishing ties with Israel includes shared concerns over Iran and economic-driven realignment of foreign policy. Despite their close ties, Abu Dhabi has been concerned about Israel's right-wing government's expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and visits to the Al Aqsa mosque compound. The displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan is seen as a red line for Abu Dhabi. The UAE has distanced itself from Hamas, viewing them as a threat to regional stability. They have played a significant role in opposing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Sudan.

### [Study gives more insight into bacterium’s protective role in chronic rhinosinusitis](https://theprint.in/science/study-gives-more-insight-into-bacteriums-protective-role-in-chronic-rhinosinusitis/1841441/)

The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been increasing in Japan and around the world. CRS is an inflammatory condition that causes symptoms like nasal congestion, discharge, trouble breathing, face pain, and loss of smell. Treating CRS is challenging because it presents in various ways. There are two categories: eosinophilic (ECRS) and non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS) CRS. ECRS is associated with higher levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that releases pro-inflammatory substances, in the nasal and sinus tissues.

The rise in CRS is influenced by environmental factors, which in turn are affected by lifestyle changes. The role of the nasal microbiome in the development of ECRS has not been clear. To address this, a research team from the University of Fukui conducted a study on CRS in a Japanese population, specifically focusing on the nasal microbiome. They collected nasal swabs from 143 subjects, including those with ECRS, non-ECRS, and healthy controls.

The researchers found significant differences in the microbiome diversity between the CRS and control groups, indicating the involvement of the nasal microbiome in the disease. Additionally, they observed distinct microbiome compositions between the ECRS and non-ECRS groups. The bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum) was found to be less abundant in patients with ECRS. Metagenomic analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis was greater in patients with non-ECRS compared to ECRS.

Based on these findings, the researchers speculated that LPS produced by F nucleatum may be linked to the pathogenesis of both ECRS and non-ECRS. Further experiments demonstrated that LPS derived from F nucleatum suppressed the expression of ALOX15, an enzyme involved in nasal polyps and eosinophil-related inflammation.

The study concludes that disruptions in the nasal microbiome likely play a crucial role in ECRS. Understanding this could lead to the development of more effective strategies for treating CRS. The researchers believe that the microbiome may also have an impact on other allergic diseases and suggest future studies for probiotic development and lifestyle modifications to prevent chronic sinusitis.

### [COP28 aims to bolster climate action, reinforcing Paris Agreement as a global cornerstone](https://theprint.in/world/cop28-aims-to-bolster-climate-action-reinforcing-paris-agreement-as-a-global-cornerstone/1841417/)

The article discusses the impact of heatwaves that occurred in July and August of the previous year, causing widespread disruptions such as forest fires, water and food shortages, and hurricanes resulting in numerous deaths. The global momentum for addressing climate change is increasing, and world leaders will discuss effective solutions at COP28, which will be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The conference marks a turning point after the Paris Agreement (COP21) in 2015, where countries committed to limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and making efforts to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Paris Agreement focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting technology transfer and adaptation to carbon-free economies. The agreement's provisions include two review processes until 2025. It entered into force in 2016 after being signed by 195 countries and ratified by 191 out of 197 countries.

COP28 will initiate the first global stocktake of progress made in implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement, measuring countries' efforts to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United Nations emphasizes the need to recalibrate the course due to the significant increase in global temperatures. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledges the challenges faced by developing countries in responding to climate change and calls for funding support.

Air pollution's detrimental impact on health, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO issued new Air Quality Guidelines, emphasizing the need to reduce suffering and save lives through improved air quality.

Fossil fuels are identified as the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions and around 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. To address the climate challenge, emissions must be reduced by nearly half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050. The UN emphasizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, accessible, and sustainable sources of energy.

Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water, waste, and geothermal energy, are highlighted as effective alternatives to fossil fuels. While cleaner energy sources are gaining ground, fossil fuels still dominate global energy production with over 80% contribution.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address climate change, particularly in light of recent extreme weather events and their devastating consequences.

Scientists from the universities of Delaware and Wyoming have found that the layout of cities can help in reducing population exposure to future weather extremes. The design of urban landscapes, including how buildings are spread out or clustered, seems to be more important than the size of a city. The researchers investigated how changes in urban land and population will affect future populations' exposures to weather extremes by the end of the 21st century. Well-planned urban land patterns can reduce population exposures to weather extremes, regardless of the size of a city. The findings encourage researchers and practitioners to reconsider how cities are designed and built to be more resilient to climate risks. The researchers looked at urban areas across the US and predicted their growth by 2100. They analyzed how these urban land changes might affect weather extremes and the number of people potentially exposed to these events. Carefully designed urban land patterns can reduce the increase in risks caused by climate change. The researchers suggest adjusting how cities are built and renovated to consider their natural surroundings and create an integrated human-environment system.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is using its position as an oil producer and host of the upcoming United Nations climate talks to urge secretive state-run oil companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The UAE's effort, called the Global Decarbonisation Alliance, aims to have a significant impact at the COP28 negotiations in Dubai. Led by Sultan al-Jaber, head of this year's climate talks and chief of the UAE's national oil company, the initiative suggests using resources to clean up petroleum production rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels. It seeks to engage national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Colombia's Ecopetrol, which account for half of global crude production and hold 90% of the world's oil and gas reserves. While environmentalists criticize the lack of stringency and inclusion of emissions from oil and gas produced and sold, supporters hope that public and international pressure will encourage these companies to adopt eco-friendly practices. A spokesperson for COP28 confirmed that 20 companies, both national and investor-owned, have already joined the alliance. Critics also express concerns about the leadership of al-Jaber, as his role overseeing negotiations while heading Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) may lack impartiality. Nonetheless, the potential alliance of oil producers represents the first such effort to institutionalize engagement on climate emissions within the industry.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a 20% drop in net profit for the September quarter due to lower oil prices and decreased output. The company's net profit was Rs 10,216 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs 12,826 crore in the same period last year. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline in net profit for ONGC. The decline in profit is mainly attributed to lower oil prices and slightly lower oil and gas production. However, the company expects production to increase in the current quarter with the start of production from a new oilfield in the KG basin. ONGC also faced challenges such as a shutdown in Panna-Mukta for commissioning a new crude oil pipeline and disruptions caused by Cyclone Biparjoy. Despite the current decline in production, ONGC anticipates compensation with the commencement of additional production from new projects.

### [5 green flags that show your employer is serious about making you find ‘purpose’ in work](https://theprint.in/feature/5-green-flags-that-show-your-employer-is-serious-about-making-you-find-purpose-in-work/1841273/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The concept of purpose at work is important to many individuals, with 70% of respondents in a survey stating that their personal sense of purpose is defined by their work. Organizations often use the promise of purpose to attract and retain employees, offering opportunities to contribute to social or ecological causes beyond just completing tasks. However, sometimes employers fail to deliver on this promise, engaging in "purpose-washing" where they make promises but don't follow through with consistent actions.

To determine if an employer's promise of purpose is genuine, there are five green flags to look for. Firstly, the organization should dedicate resources such as time, money, training, and staff towards purpose-driven work. Secondly, they should provide well-being support to protect employees from exploitation and burnout. Thirdly, purpose should be made relevant to all roles within the organization, encouraging collaboration beyond specific departments. Fourthly, diverse representation across gender, race, occupations, and organizational levels can facilitate purpose-driven aims. Lastly, organizations should provide opportunities for employees to see the impact of their work, whether through reports, case studies, or feedback conversations.

While purpose-driven work may be justified by its benefits to the organization and bottom line, solely relying on this justification can disconnect employees from their values over time. Instead, organizations need to redefine what counts as doing business and adapt their operations accordingly. This includes giving autonomy to purpose-driven workers, aligning performance indicators and reward systems with efforts to change, and creating career paths that value and support purpose-driven projects.

Ultimately, purpose can provide meaningful work for those interested in finding solutions to social and ecological challenges. Falling victim to purpose-washing can negatively affect one's career and well-being, so it's crucial to identify companies that demonstrate commitment, authenticity, and support for purpose-driven initiatives.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a rush to extract cobalt, a crucial component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and low-carbon innovations. The country's Katanga region holds more cobalt reserves than the rest of the world combined. However, this exploitation of resources is reminiscent of King Leopold II's brutal reign, during which millions of Congolese lost their lives. Today, the harsh realities of cobalt mining involve hazardous conditions, including child labor and toxic exposure. Companies in the supply chain claim to uphold human rights standards but often fail to address these issues effectively. International coalitions, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), aim to ensure clean supply chains and eliminate child labor in cobalt mining. However, on-ground observations reveal extreme suffering and environmental devastation in the Congo due to cobalt extraction.

Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has issued a warning about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic growth. The agency's Global Economic Outlook predicts that potential disruptions in the Middle East's oil supply due to conflicts could cause oil prices to surge, leading to a significant decrease in global GDP growth and a rise in inflation. Fitch's simulations show that if oil prices reach USD 120 per barrel in 2024 and USD 100 per barrel in 2025, there could be a 0.4 percentage point reduction in world GDP growth in 2024, with a lingering 0.1 percentage point lower growth in 2025. The impact is expected to be felt across the board, with most countries experiencing longer-lasting effects on GDP levels. Inflation rates would also be elevated in 2024, with India, Turkey, and Poland being particularly affected. Fitch highlights the potential ripple effects of an oil price shock, such as tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets. The report emphasizes the intricate web of global economic interdependencies and the vulnerabilities arising from geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions.

South Africa's Rassie Van der Dussen believes that Australia has a good reference for winning knockout matches, but South Africa will maintain their must-win mindset in the upcoming semifinal match. Van der Dussen acknowledges that Australia has more experience in these situations, having won the World Cup and played in the semifinals before. However, he emphasizes that the outcome will depend on the performance of the teams on the day. South Africa has approached the tournament with a must-win mentality from the start, and they will continue to do so. Van der Dussen also mentions that South Africa wanted to test themselves by chasing down a total before the semifinal, as their chasing record in the tournament has been poor. They were successful in their recent match against Afghanistan, where Van der Dussen played a crucial unbeaten innings. South Africa's captain, Temba Bavuma, is a doubtful starter for the semifinal due to a hamstring injury. If he is unable to play, Reeza Hendricks is likely to open the batting.

The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh is preparing for assembly polls, with BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing Congress candidate Vikram Mastal. Despite the entry of Samajwadi Party's Vairagyanand Giri, also known as Mirchi Baba, the contest has not gained much momentum. Chouhan, confident in his position as the longest-serving chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, has not visited his assembly constituency since filing nomination papers. The BJP dominates the constituency with their flags and posters, while the Congress' presence is scarce. Although the BJP has chosen not to project Chouhan as its CM face this time, they heavily rely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity to secure victory. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains optimistic about his chances and claims that people are angry with Chouhan for not doing enough for Budhni. However, supporters of Chouhan believe he will win due to his track record and the development he has brought to the area. Chouhan's son Kartikeya is actively campaigning on his behalf, aiming for a record victory margin. Overall, Budhni seems to have a strong support base for Chouhan, although Mastal is putting up a brave fight.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.
