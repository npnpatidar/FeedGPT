The United States, Canada, Kenya, and 60 other countries have made a pledge to significantly reduce cooling-related emissions at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai. This commitment, known as the Global Cooling Pledge, focuses on cutting emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning, with a goal of reducing these emissions by at least 68% compared to 2022 levels by 2050. The pledge also includes targets such as establishing minimum energy performance standards by 2030. The increase in demand for cooling due to rising temperatures, growing populations, and higher incomes has led to a surge in cooling emissions, which are expected to reach between 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050. The pledge aims to address this issue and increase access to sustainable cooling solutions. However, some challenges remain, with India, a country that is likely to experience significant growth in cooling demand, not yet joining the pledge. The progress on meeting the goals of the pledge will be monitored annually until 2030.

### [Greek olive growers brace themselves as thieves seek pricey crop](https://theprint.in/environment/greek-olive-growers-brace-themselves-as-thieves-seek-pricey-crop/1872638/)

Greek olive growers, including Panagiotis Tsafaras, are facing an increase in thefts as olive prices rise during a poor harvest. Tsafaras has been robbed twice, losing over a tonne of olives in one incident. Other producers in Greece have resorted to installing cameras, GPS trackers, and considering private security measures. The thieves strike at night, using rods or silent electric chainsaws to steal the olives. The decline in olive production, due to unfavorable weather conditions, has caused wholesale prices to double to 8-9 euros per liter. Retail prices have reached up to 14 euros, making the crop an attractive target for thieves. Greek police have confirmed a spike in olive and olive oil thefts across the country this year.

### [Indonesia softens internet law after critics complain of misuse](https://theprint.in/world/indonesia-softens-internet-law-after-critics-complain-of-misuse/1872629/)

Indonesia's parliament has passed a revision to its internet law, aiming to address concerns that certain articles were being used to suppress government opposition. The amendment introduces stricter requirements for the defamation article of the electronic information and transaction law (ITE), including a higher burden of proof in prosecutions, and reduces the maximum penalty for defamation from four years to two. However, critics argue that the revision does not go far enough in safeguarding freedom of speech, as it fails to prevent misuse of the law by offended officials seeking extra protection. Human rights activists have long called for changes to the 2008 law, citing its vague and potentially misused articles. This development follows the sentencing of singer and opposition figure Ahmad Dhani under the ITE law in 2019 for insulting political rivals online.

Israel has reportedly assembled a system of pumps to potentially flood tunnels used by Hamas in the Gaza strip, according to U.S. officials cited by the Wall Street Journal. The pumps, located near the Al-Shati refugee camp, are capable of moving thousands of cubic meters of water per hour and could render the tunnels inoperable within weeks. It remains unclear whether Israel would use the pumps before the release of all hostages held by Hamas. While Reuters cannot verify the details of the report, a U.S. official stated that it made sense for Israel to neutralize the tunnels. The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the flooding plan but acknowledged its efforts to dismantle Hamas's capabilities using various tools. Israel had informed the United States about this option, though it is unknown how close they are to carrying out the plan. No final decision has been made yet.

The film "Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce" premiered at the top of the U.S. box office, earning $21.8 million during the typically slow first weekend of December. This marks the first time a movie has crossed the $20 million mark on this particular weekend since 2003. The release date was strategically chosen as it is historically a dead zone for the box office. The film gives fans of Beyonce, known as the Beyhive, a chance to experience her concert tour even if they couldn't get tickets to the sold-out shows. The film received praise for its behind-the-scenes look at Beyonce's world tour and her candid discussions about fame, motherhood, and being a Black woman in the music industry. Although the box office results fell short of Taylor Swift's opening weekend earnings, experts believe it will still boost music downloads and provide a more affordable alternative to attending live concerts.

Five9, a call center software firm, is reportedly considering a sale after a failed buyout by Zoom Video Communications two years ago. The news caused Five9's shares to increase by over 7%, bringing its market capitalization to $6.2 billion.

However, there is no certainty that a sale will occur as deliberations are ongoing. In October 2021, Zoom's proposed acquisition of Five9, valued at $14.7 billion, was terminated due to concerns raised by proxy advisory firms about Five9's growth prospects.

AT&T has announced that it has chosen Ericsson to build a telecom network in the United States using ORAN (open radio access network) technology. This new network will cover 70% of AT&T's wireless traffic by late 2026. ORAN technology promises to reduce costs for telecom operators by using cloud-based software and equipment from multiple suppliers, rather than relying on proprietary equipment from companies like Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei. While some telecom providers have tested ORAN technology, mass adoption has been slow. However, new networks by Dish and Japan's Rakuten are already using Open RAN. AT&T has spent six months analyzing Open RAN and has looked at multiple vendors before choosing Ericsson. The company plans to invest around $14 billion over the next five years for this project. Winning the Open RAN deal will make Ericsson the largest supplier to AT&T, potentially overshadowing Nokia. Nokia shares fell on speculation that they might lose the AT&T contract. Ericsson has agreed to open up its interfaces, which were previously proprietary, across its footprint. AT&T expects fully integrated Open RAN sites operating with Ericsson and Fujitsu by 2024, and by 2025, their network will have equipment from multiple suppliers. AT&T views this move as a game-changer for the industry.

France, with support from the United States, plans to propose a halt to private financing for coal-based power plants at the upcoming U.N. climate conference. This plan, called the "New Coal Exclusion Policy," was communicated to India earlier this month. However, India and China are opposed to any efforts to block the construction of coal-fired power stations due to their energy needs. The proposal aims to dry up private funding for coal power by setting coal-exit standards for finance firms, tracked by regulators and rating agencies. The U.S., European Union, and Canada have expressed concerns about private international financing supporting new coal capacity in developing nations. About 490 gigawatts of new coal capacity is planned or under construction, mainly in India and China. India, where 73% of electricity is produced using coal, intends to resist committing to a fossil fuel phase-out or phase-down at the conference. Instead, it may focus on reducing emissions from other sources and urge developed nations to become carbon negative by 2050.

Javier Milei, a radical libertarian, has been elected as the president of Argentina, receiving a wide margin of votes in a run-off election. This outcome reflects a desire for change and a rejection of the peronist government, which has overseen soaring inflation and increasing poverty. Despite Milei's significant voter support, he will face challenges due to his limited presence in regional governments and congress, and he may have to moderate his plans for economic reforms such as dollarization. Milei's election comes at a time of economic crisis for Argentina, and his proposed reforms could help address the country's fiscal issues. However, he will need the support of more moderate conservatives to implement his plans. Milei, a 53-year-old economist, has been compared to Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro due to his abrasive style and desire to slash government spending.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The article discusses the issue of explicit content on TikTok and its potential harm to young users. Despite efforts to moderate content, TikTok's focus seems to be on user engagement rather than creating a safe environment. The automated moderation system is not always accurate, leading to the removal of beneficial LGBTQ+ and sex education content while explicit content slips through. Users also employ tactics like "algospeak" to avoid filters. Harmful content on TikTok promotes unhealthy attitudes towards sex, perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes, and can influence vulnerable young boys with misogynistic views. The platform's promotion of idealistic and sexualized content also negatively affects the self-perception of young women and queer youth. However, TikTok offers an opportunity for informative and inclusive sex education content. Social media platforms face challenges in effectively moderating harmful content, and regulatory bodies like Australia's eSafety Commissioner play a role in pressuring platforms to remove such content. It is important for parents to equip young users with media literacy skills and actively monitor their online activities. Rather than solely restricting app usage, open discussions, building trust, and educating oneself and children about online risks are more effective approaches.

### [The future of transport is electric](https://theprint.in/world/the-future-of-transport-is-electric/1851557/)

The article discusses the need for countries to implement effective policies to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. Currently, transport emissions have been increasing at a rate of 1.7 percent per year since 1990, making it the sector with the highest emissions growth. Road vehicles contribute the most to these emissions, accounting for 74.5 percent.

While the global EV market has experienced significant growth in recent years, adoption rates vary across different regions. The article highlights successful government policies in China, Europe, and the US that have incentivized consumers to switch to EVs through subsidies, rebates, and tax discounts. For example, Norway has achieved a 79 percent market share for EVs by providing financial incentives and other benefits such as lower tolls and access to bus lanes.

The article suggests that alongside EV incentives, higher taxes on polluting vehicles can further encourage the transition to electric transport. Many European Union countries already levy car taxes based on carbon dioxide emissions. Feebate systems, which impose levies on high-emission vehicles and provide rebates for low-emission vehicles, are also effective in discouraging the purchase of polluting vehicles.

In addition to incentives and taxes, the phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles and the implementation of fuel efficiency standards are recommended. Over 35 countries have announced plans to electrify or phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. Fuel efficiency standards set limits on vehicle emissions and encourage the production of low or zero-emission vehicles.

To support the widespread adoption of EVs, the report suggests the need for robust charging infrastructure. Currently, only 13 percent of the estimated 100 million chargers needed by 2030 are in place. Accessible chargers can alleviate range anxiety concerns and make EVs more affordable by reducing the need for larger batteries.

The article concludes by emphasizing that a comprehensive set of consistent policies is crucial for achieving emissions reduction goals and transitioning to cleaner transport. It highlights the importance of not solely relying on EVs but also implementing strategies to change travel behavior, such as reducing car usage, promoting e-bikes and e-scooters, and improving walkability and public transport access.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of getting the policy mix right to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles and achieve global commitments for net zero emissions by 2050.

The indigenous ZThe prototype of the Zorawar light tank, designed for mountain warfare, will be unveiled in December 2023. Following this, it will undergo development trials and then user trials, likely in March next year. The Indian Army has chosen Cummins, an American company, for the engines of these tanks due to clearance issues faced with German companies. The Zorawar tank is specifically designed for high-altitude operations and aims to counter Chinese armoured deployments in such terrains. Weighing 25 tonnes, the tank will have greater mobility and accuracy compared to Chinese Type 15 tanks deployed along the Ladakh border. The need for a light tank arose as the existing T72s and T90s are more suitable for plains and deserts and lack maneuverability. The tank will feature a 105 mm gun made by a Belgium-based firm, active protection against incoming attacks, integrated UAVs, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and situational awareness technology. The Defense Acquisition Council approved the project worth Rs 16,000 crore in December 2022, and the DRDO will manufacture 59 of the 354 light tanks being procured.

The Black Friday sales will test the US consumer-driven economy, while the Thanksgiving holiday is expected to result in thin markets. Reports suggest a potential agreement between Israel, the US, and Hamas to release hostages in Gaza. MSCI's Asia-Pacific index rose slightly, Japan's Nikkei remained unchanged, and S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures dipped. Goldman Sachs analysts highlight the significant outperformance of mega-cap tech stocks but indicate that the risk/reward profile may not be compelling. Tech major Nvidia's quarterly results are highly anticipated for insight into AI product demand. The Federal Reserve's minutes from their previous meeting could shed light on policymakers' thinking. Markets have priced out the possibility of further rate hikes but imply a 30% chance of easing in March. Bond yields dropped, and the US dollar weakened against currencies, including the euro and yen. European manufacturing surveys and Sweden's central bank meeting will be closely watched. Oil prices rebounded amid speculation of extended OPEC+ production cuts, and gold prices dipped slightly.

### [Oil extends gains as OPEC+ to mull deeper cuts](https://theprint.in/economy/oil-extends-gains-as-opec-to-mull-deeper-cuts/1851346/)

Oil futures rose slightly on Monday as expectations grew that OPEC+ would deepen supply cuts to stabilize prices. Brent crude futures increased by 0.1% to $80.72 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 8 cents to $75.97 a barrel. The gains come after OPEC+ sources indicated that the group will consider additional supply cuts at its meeting on November 26. Oil prices have fallen nearly 20% since September, and prompt prices for Brent and WTI slipped into contango last week, indicating sufficient supply. Analysts suggest that deeper cuts should not be ruled out given the fall in speculative positioning and higher inventories.

Israel has accused Hamas of committing abuses at the al Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip. They claim that a captive soldier was executed and that two foreign hostages are being held at the hospital. Al Shifa hospital has been evacuating patients and staff since Israeli troops entered last week. Israel is also searching for 240 people that Hamas kidnapped to Gaza. The Israeli military stated that a forensic examination found that a 19-year-old Israeli conscript, Noa Marciano, had sustained non-life-threatening injuries from an Israeli airstrike, contradicting Hamas' claim that she died in an Israeli airstrike. Israel alleges that Noa was taken by Hamas terrorists and murdered at the Shifa hospital.

The third round of United Nations negotiations for a treaty to control plastic pollution has received over 500 proposals from participants. Some see this as progress, while Greenpeace calls it "chaos". Negotiators have until the end of next year to reach a deal addressing the 400 million tonnes of plastic waste produced annually. The plastics industry and oil exporters advocate for promoting recycling and reusing, while environmental campaigners and certain governments believe in reducing production. Greenpeace emphasizes that the United States and the European Union should show greater leadership. The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) believes that the proposals reflect the robustness of the talks. Canada, Kenya, and the European Union support limiting plastic production, while a coalition of Russia and Saudi Arabia emphasizes recycling. Only less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled, and at least 14 million tonnes end up in the ocean each year. Two more rounds of negotiations will occur next year to finalize the deal.

The petitioner claims that SEBI failed to comply with the court's direction to submit the final conclusion/report. The application also refers to a report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) regarding the Adani Group's alleged investments through "opaque" Mauritius funds. The focus of the plea is on strengthening the regulatory system to protect investors and their investments in the share market. The petitioner argues that SEBI's objection to a necessary timeline for the investigation goes against the need for an efficient regulatory mechanism. Delays in investigations can lead to the disappearance of evidence and reduce investor confidence. The expert committee appointed by the court is still working on the matter, and the application calls for an independent body to investigate the new disclosures. The court had granted time until August 14 for SEBI's probe and emphasized the need for expeditious completion. SEBI has completed its investigation in most matters but is awaiting information from tax havens. The regulator will take appropriate action based on the investigation's outcome. An interim report by the expert committee found no evident pattern of manipulation but highlighted regulatory constraints. The Adani Group stocks faced allegations of fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, which the group denies.

Targeted groups may include domestic workers, rickshaw drivers, waste pickers, gardeners, and construction workers. The DAY-NULM, launched in 2013, aims to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting self-help groups, skill development, self-employment training, and homeless shelters. The ministry is considering a shift towards entrepreneurship development, market linkages, standardizing norms for identifying the urban poor, and providing social benefits to all NULM beneficiaries. This move follows the success of the PM Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme, which provided loans to street vendors affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although nearly 8.7 lakh self-help groups have been formed under DAY-NULM, experts suggest targeting a wider range of occupational groups and adopting income-generating schemes to address the challenges faced by the urban poor. Creating self-help groups in urban areas is more challenging due to the transient nature of migrant workers. The ministry is planning to focus on entrepreneurship development in the next phase of the mission, aiming to empower individuals with business knowledge and assistance.

The study highlights the importance of getting enough sleep in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that sleep restriction can elevate the risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and disordered glucose metabolism. The current study focused on women and found that a prolonged, mild restriction of sleep increased women's blood glucose and insulin levels. Insulin resistance rose by 14.8% among both pre- and postmenopausal women, with more severe effects for postmenopausal women. The researchers also found that changes in body weight did not explain the changes in insulin and glucose levels. Further studies are planned to understand how sleep deficiency affects metabolism in both men and women and explore sleep interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention efforts.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！According to an article by Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), the Global Listed Infrastructure (GLI) sector remains resilient in the face of short-term challenges and shows a promising long-term outlook. Although GLI experienced underperformance in 2023 compared to global equity markets, it still demonstrates solid fundamentals across various infrastructure sectors. The four major industry categories within GLI—Utilities, Energy Infrastructure, Communications, and Transportation—show positive trends in terms of revenue and profitability. The Communications sector, specifically the US wireless tower subsector, faces some challenges with stagnant cash flow growth in 2023. However, European tower operators and global data center companies enjoy strong fundamental trends. Despite current valuations being at odds with the fundamental backdrop, GLI companies are well-positioned to maintain margins. The defensive sectors of Utilities and Communications offer attractive valuations, and regulatory constructs help infrastructure companies navigate higher interest costs effectively. GLI has historically outperformed global equities during economic downturns, and certain sectors within GLI, such as freight rail and energy infrastructure, are poised for a positive recovery in the event of a modest economic downturn. As the global economy potentially re-accelerates in 2024, GLI is expected to benefit. Growth areas in infrastructure, such as the energy transition and renewables, have not been fully rewarded in 2023, but a more stable economic and financing environment is likely to create opportunities and potentially lead to a re-rating of companies involved in these themes. In the long term, GLI demonstrates its strength with low earnings volatility, stable cash flows, a higher relative income component compared to global equities, and attractive returns. Overall, the MSIM Global Listed Infrastructure Team highlights the resilience of GLI and its potential as a lucrative investment option in the evolving financial landscape.

The resolution states that if the bills are passed again and presented to the Governor, he cannot withhold assent under the proviso to Article 200 of the Constitution of India. The Chief Minister criticized the Governor, accusing him of blocking the government's initiatives and acting undemocratically. The Chief Minister also alleged that non-BJP ruled states were being targeted through Governors, possibly by the central government.

Several major advertisers, including Disney, Lionsgate, Paramount Global, and Apple, have announced that they are cutting off their spending on microblogging site X. This decision comes after Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on social media. Musk agreed with a post that made derogatory remarks about Jewish people and supported the immigration of minorities. The White House condemned Musk's actions, calling it "unacceptable." X's CEO, Linda Yaccarino, stated that the company has been clear about its efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. Musk later clarified that accounts promoting extreme violence would be suspended. Advertisers have become concerned about X since Musk purchased the platform and expressed intentions to loosen content moderation rules. Many companies have been hesitant to have their ads appear alongside offensive or hateful speech. In April, Musk announced that most advertisers had returned to the platform, but ad revenue had decreased by 50%.

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stated that Japan will continue to urge China to lift its import ban on Japanese seafood in response to the release of treated radioactive water from a nuclear power plant. Kishida emphasized the need for a science-based judgment on the issue and called for a constructive approach based on scientific analysis and facts. He also mentioned that Japan and China have agreed to have expert consultations on the issue from a scientific standpoint. The water being released from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex is diluted to reduce tritium levels and has been deemed to have a negligible impact on people and the environment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The import ban remains an obstacle to improving relations between Japan and China.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The ongoing Gaza war is causing a crisis in agriculture in Israel, with farmers unable to plant crops due to the conflict. This has led to a shortage of produce, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and carrots. Many farms near the Gaza Strip and the Lebanese border have been devastated by Hamas terrorists, and the situation is further exacerbated by the return of Thai agricultural workers to their home country. To address the shortage of workers, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Employment Service have launched an initiative to pair unemployed Israelis with farms in need of extra hands. Salaries will be doubled in areas near the conflict zones.

The United States has imposed new sanctions on the militia group Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS) and its secretary-general, Hashim Finyan Rahim al-Saraji, designating them as "specially designated global terrorists." The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned six individuals affiliated with the Iran-aligned militia group Kata'ib Hizballah (KH). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the KSS's terrorist activities have threatened the lives of US and global coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria. Blinken also noted that Iran has supported KSS, KH, and other Iran-aligned militia groups with training, funding, and sophisticated weapons. The investigation into the Hamas massacre at the Re'im music festival on October 7 has revised the death toll to 364, with 40 festival attendees being taken hostage in Gaza. The investigation suggests that Hamas was allegedly unaware of the music festival prior to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the IDF does not plan to keep soldiers inside Gaza after the war, and stressed the need for a civilian administration in Gaza committed to ending funding for terrorism. Israel will maintain overall military responsibility for Gaza but seeks a cultural change and rejects anyone who shares Hamas' goals.

The victory ensured England's top spot in Group C and moved them closer to a top seeding at Euro 2024. However, their performance was underwhelming, with Malta posing more attacking threats in the first half. England will face tougher tests in upcoming friendlies against Belgium and Brazil.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Biden administration's efforts to negotiate an ambitious Asia trade deal are facing challenges, according to trade experts and business groups. The administration aimed to complete key chapters of its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative trade "pillar" but encountered resistance from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, who were unwilling to commit to strong labor and environmental standards with binding enforcement provisions. Despite completing non-binding pillars on clean energy cooperation and anti-corruption measures, the lack of trade outcomes overshadowed these achievements. Some experts believe that election-year pressures make a deal unlikely, similar to the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2016. The administration had hoped to limit the scope of the IPEF trade pillar to avoid political blowback but faced skepticism from stakeholders due to its lack of ambition. Trade deals typically take a long time to negotiate, and the tight deadline ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit was seen as a constraint. Meanwhile, China expressed interest in aligning with Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) standards, signaling its desire to expand high-standard free trade areas.

Israel has warned Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to relocate westward away from the line of fire and closer to humanitarian aid, indicating a potential attack on Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north. The Israeli government aims to protect civilians from being caught in the crossfire but such a move could worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the area. Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militant group controlling Gaza since their attack into Israel on October 7th that resulted in many deaths and hostages taken. The Israeli assault on Gaza City has left two-thirds of its population homeless, leading to fears of permanent displacement. Gaza health authorities report over 12,000 deaths, including 5,000 children, although these figures are not frequently updated due to data collection challenges. Despite international calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pauses, the conflict shows no signs of abating. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and increase aid as per the United Nations' requests amid concerns of starvation and disease. The Al Shifa hospital, a primary target in Israel's ground assault, is under scrutiny for alleged use by Hamas as a command headquarters, although hospital staff deny these claims. A premature baby and an elderly captive from Israel have died recently, further deepening the humanitarian crisis.

Liberia President George Weah has conceded defeat in the country's election to opposition leader Joseph Boakai. Boakai, a former vice president, secured 50.9% of the vote, while Weah received 49.1%. This marks a turnaround from the previous election in 2017, where Weah won by a large margin. Weah's concession ensures a smooth transition of power and Liberia's second democratic transfer in over seven decades.

Many people have become disillusioned with Weah's lack of progress in addressing these issues. Boakai's supporters celebrated the victory in the capital, Monrovia, with dancing and honking car horns. Boakai emphasized a message of peace and reconciliation and his commitment to bring about positive changes in the country.

### [Israeli govt approves regular fuel deliveries to Gaza amid humanitarian concerns](https://theprint.in/world/israeli-govt-approves-regular-fuel-deliveries-to-gaza-amid-humanitarian-concerns/1849635/)

Two fuel tankers carrying 60,000 liters of diesel fuel entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing after approval from Israel's war cabinet. The fuel is authorized for use by international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It will support desalination facilities providing water to the southern strip, with oversight led by the United States and Egypt. This decision allows two fuel tankers per day to enter Gaza, providing crucial support to the water and sewage systems that are on the verge of collapse due to a lack of electricity. Additionally, the fuel will be used for UN relief agency trucks, waste disposal, bakeries, hospitals in southern Gaza, and generators for cell phones and internet services. The decision was made in consultation with the Israel Defence Forces and Israel's International Security Academy to ensure it aligns with operational objectives and does not support Hamas. The rationale behind the decision is to prevent the spread of pandemics and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, there has been criticism within the Israeli government, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling for a reversal of the policy. Fuel shortages have worsened water and sewage issues in Gaza, affecting approximately 70% of the population. This move to allow fuel deliveries comes after pressure from the US.

Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, did not have a crisis plan in place when a nationwide network outage occurred, leaving half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours. The company's executive admitted that their defences had failed and they were not prepared for an outage of that scale. Optus had recently conducted scenario simulations, but they did not anticipate a nationwide shutdown because they had alternate connections built into their network. The outage highlighted concerns about the resilience of Australia's telecommunications networks, following a data breach at Optus last year. The government plans to introduce stricter cyber security reporting standards and mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks across all sectors. The outage was caused by a failure of the company's defensive filters, which led to data overload and the inability to send data on alternate routes. The outage lasted for 12 hours as Optus had to physically reboot their routers and core network devices. The CEO of Optus stated that the company followed up on all incidents, but 228 calls to the emergency hotline failed to connect during the outage. The company also discussed their reliance on third-party contractors and the need to evaluate the appropriate level of outsourcing. Singtel, the parent company of Optus, stated that the software upgrade was not the direct cause of the outage.

Asian shares took a pause on Friday, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan easing from a two-month high but still up for the week. The slump in oil prices and softer U.S. economic data weighed on Wall Street, while boosting bonds and impacting the inflation outlook. The sell-off in oil was likely driven by algorithmic and trend-following funds, causing prices to slide to four-month lows. Walmart's announcement of planned price cuts for the holiday season also added to disinflationary concerns. In Japan, the Nikkei added 0.1%, supported by the Bank of Japan's commitment to its loose policy. Chinese blue chips were lower, as Alibaba Group's Hong Kong shares slumped after it abandoned its cloud business spin-off plans. Bond markets reacted positively to the U.S. inflation report, with future expectations of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve increasing.

Efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear program are facing significant challenges, leaving the United States and its allies with limited options. Talks to revive a nuclear deal have stalled, and tougher actions against Iran risk escalating tensions in an already volatile region. Despite Iran's consistent denial of seeking nuclear weapons, confidential reports indicate that the country now possesses enough uranium enriched up to 60% purity to make three bombs. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election further restricting Washington's flexibility, President Joe Biden cannot currently consider a more informal "understanding" with Iran. Iran's stonewalling of the International Atomic Energy Agency has hindered monitoring efforts, and an accommodation with Iran on the nuclear issue is politically unfeasible at this time. Western powers are now likely to focus on a non-binding statement rather than a resolution to avoid pushing Iran to further nuclear escalation. In the coming months, efforts will be made to strengthen oversight of Iran's nuclear program, although it remains uncertain whether Iran will ultimately become a nuclear state.

### [The Democracy Forum holds webinar on ‘Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh – the subcontinental Brotherhood?’](https://theprint.in/world/the-democracy-forum-holds-webinar-on-jamaat-e-islami-bangladesh-the-subcontinental-brotherhood/1848070/)

The Democracy Forum (TDF) recently organized a webinar titled 'Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh - the subcontinental Brotherhood?' to discuss the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and its potential impact on the country's democratic process. The webinar examined the circumstances surrounding the re-emergence of Jamaat-e-Islami as a democratic movement after a decade of political isolation.

Lord Bruce, the TDF President, highlighted the history of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was established in 1941 with the aim of incorporating Islamic ideology into all aspects of state governance. Although Jamaat-e-Islami is considered Bangladesh's most populous and well-organized political movement, it has not been close to exercising power since 2006 due to evidence of violence and intimidation linked to the party. For the past 15 years, Jamaat has been proscribed as a political actor.

During the webinar, various speakers shared their perspectives on Jamaat-e-Islami. Professor Shafi Mostofa discussed Jamaat's history, agenda, and its controversial role in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. Mohammed Sinan Siyech examined Jamaat's transnational connections and organizational structure, while Maidul Islam assessed the party's influence in contemporary Bangladeshi politics and the challenges it faces.

There appears to be a tactical shift within Jamaat's leadership as they consider changing their position from the time of the Bangladesh Liberation War. However, some argue that fundamental positions have not changed despite a softer rhetoric. Dr. Md Nazrul Islam explored the theme of Jamaat and democracy, suggesting that political Islam and democracy are not necessarily incompatible and that Jamaat has shown support for constitutionalism and electoral politics.

Overall, the webinar provided a platform for discussing Jamaat-e-Islami's role in Bangladesh's political landscape and its potential impact on democracy.

Researchers at the University of Rochester's Wilmot Cancer Institute have made a significant advance in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. They have discovered the genetic changes that occur during tumor migration and identified a medication, known as np137, that may block the process. The next step is a clinical trial planned for early 2024 at the University of Rochester to test the drug's safety and effectiveness on pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to the liver. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and has a low survival rate, with the number of cases predicted to rise. The researchers focused on understanding the biology of metastatic pancreatic cancer since the cancer spreads early during its development and the cells become genetically reprogrammed as they migrate to the liver, making them resistant to standard treatment. The trial will likely involve eligible patients taking np137 before surgery, undergoing surgery to remove the cancer, and then continuing with the medication and chemotherapy afterwards. The study was funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

A recent study conducted by researchers at UCL (University College London) has found that a hunger hormone produced in the gut can directly influence the decision-making area of the brain, known as the hippocampus. The study, which was conducted on mice, is the first to demonstrate how hunger hormones can impact brain activity when an animal is thinking about food. The researchers discovered that the ventral hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in decision-making, is sensitive to the levels of hunger hormones in the gut. When the mice were hungry, there was less neural activity in this area, allowing them to eat. Conversely, when the mice were full, activating the ventral hippocampal neurons stopped them from eating. The researchers hope that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of eating disorders and other health outcomes related to diet. They also plan to investigate whether hunger can affect learning and memory.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has reported to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that two experimental smog towers in the city have not been effective in reducing air pollution. The DPCC stated that the operation of these costly air purifiers lacks merit and suggested that the structures be repurposed as a museum for the dissemination of technical information on air pollution control. The report highlighted that the smog tower at Connaught Place, which has been operational for two years at a cost of Rs 25 crore, can only mitigate air pollution by up to 17% within a 100-meter radius. The DPCC argued that considering Delhi's large area, the city would require more than 47,000 such towers, making the cost and maintenance unjustified. The central government also expressed that smog towers are not a solution to the air pollution problem in Delhi-NCR and is against installing more of these air purifiers. The two smog towers were installed in 2021 following directions from the Supreme Court.

The Philippines stated that it is not obligated to inform China about its resupply missions in the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs called on China to remove its illegal structures within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone and be accountable for the damage caused. China has accused the Philippines of illegally entering its waters during resupply missions, while the Philippines asserts that these missions are legitimate. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that China's claim over the South China Sea had no legal basis, a ruling supported by the US Defense Secretary during a meeting with his Manila counterpart. Since 1999, when the Philippines grounded the Sierra Madre ship at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, China has requested its removal based on an alleged agreement that the Philippines denies.

India's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in October to a record level of $31.46 billion. This increase was driven by a rise in imports, particularly in oil, gold, and silver imports ahead of the Diwali festive season. However, analysts believe that this spike in imports is likely to be a temporary outlier, and they expect the trade deficit to moderate considerably in November and December. The easing of oil prices also provides some relief. Despite the high trade deficit in October, economists retain their current account deficit (CAD) estimates, expecting it to normalize from November onwards.

### [Pakistan: Air pollution crisis intensifies in Lahore](https://theprint.in/world/pakistan-air-pollution-crisis-intensifies-in-lahore/1846439/)

Lahore, Pakistan is facing a severe air pollution crisis as the air quality index (AQI) has reached alarming levels. After a brief period of relatively normal air quality, the city saw a sudden spike with a maximum AQI of 401, marking it as extremely unsafe for breathing. Although there was a slight improvement in the afternoon with the AQI dropping to 188, the air quality deteriorated again in the evening, reaching an AQI of 236. As a result, Lahore now ranks third on the list of the most polluted cities globally. The current readings indicate a severe threat to public health.

Different areas of Lahore showed varying levels of air pollution, with Fida Hussain House reporting an AQI of 364 and WWF Pakistan at 231. The decline in air quality during winter months, from October to February, is a common occurrence in Lahore. Crop burning by farmers in the Punjab province contributes to smog, while weather changes trap pollutants in the air for longer periods.

The main contributors to air pollution in Lahore are vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and waste, dust from construction sites, and deforestation. Temperature inversion worsens winter air pollution by preventing the upward movement of pollutants and causing their accumulation.

Experts recommend providing real-time air quality data to the public with greater detail to help individuals protect themselves and contribute to efforts against air pollution. Reducing industrial and vehicular emissions is crucial for improving air quality. Urgent and coordinated efforts are needed to address the root causes of air pollution and protect the health and well-being of Lahore's residents.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Scientists at the Gene Centre Munich have discovered a new mechanism by which cells detect and repair crosslinking damage to single-stranded RNA. Previous research had focused on repairing crosslinking damage to DNA, but this study reveals the harmful effects of such damage on protein synthesis. The researchers used a novel approach to induce and study RNA damage in the absence of DNA damage, leading to the identification of the ribosome as a sensor for crosslinking damage. The findings have implications for the mechanisms of action of commonly used anti-cancer drugs. Aldehydes, which are produced in the body through metabolic processes, are toxic because they bind to macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins and crosslink them.

### [Can a Balanced Advantage Fund Help you Withstand Market Volatility?](https://theprint.in/ani-press-releases/can-a-balanced-advantage-fund-help-you-withstand-market-volatility/1845834/)

Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs) are hybrid mutual fund schemes that dynamically manage their portfolio between equity and debt based on market conditions. These funds aim to optimize returns by shifting between asset classes. BAFs have the flexibility to invest in equity, debt, or have a balanced exposure to both. This allows them to generate returns in different market conditions, making them suitable for investment through all economic cycles.

BAFs can help in volatile markets by adapting to changing conditions. Unlike traditional approaches with fixed allocation percentages, BAFs can capitalize on opportunities and manage risks effectively. They deliver returns in both bull and bear phases, capturing the upside during market booms and cushioning losses during downturns. BAFs also provide downside mitigation by increasing debt exposure during volatile phases, balancing the risk of equities. Additionally, professional fund managers continuously monitor market trends and adjust allocations for optimal risk-adjusted returns.

BAFs overcome the limitations of other hybrid schemes by offering more flexible equity-debt rebalancing parameters. Traditional hybrid funds may fail to adapt to extreme market movements due to allocation constraints. Aggressive hybrid funds with high equity allocation limits may decline sharply during steep corrections, while conservative hybrid funds with lower equity caps may miss out on maximizing upside potential. BAFs, on the other hand, have a dynamic and unconstrained approach, optimizing returns in all market environments.

When choosing a suitable BAF, it is important to track the fund manager's record in navigating different markets, evaluate the extent of allocation shifts between equity and debt over the past 5-10 years, consider the consistency and success of returns across bull and bear phases, and assess factors such as portfolio churn, expense ratios, and the experience of the fund management team.

BAFs provide flexibility and can serve as all-season funds across economic cycles. They are a robust long-term investment choice suitable for various financial needs. It is advisable to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative parameters before selecting a BAF as an investment vehicle.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The first truck carrying a United Nations fuel shipment entered Gaza from Egypt, marking a small step in alleviating the fuel shortages that have been affecting relief efforts in the region. Israel allowed 24,000 liters of diesel fuel to be delivered for UN aid distribution, but not for use at hospitals. The limited delivery of fuel is just 9% of what is needed daily to sustain life-saving activities in Gaza. The lack of fuel has caused the closure of hospitals, bakeries, and sewage pumping stations, as well as threatening to shut down telecoms data centers and connection points. The UN had warned that it may have to halt humanitarian operations if its fuel stocks became fully depleted. However, aid workers say the initial delivery of fuel is not enough to meet the needs of hospitals or aid deliveries. Despite the delivery of food and supplies, the aid distribution has been significantly affected due to the lack of fuel. Israel had previously refused to allow fuel in, fearing it would be used by Hamas. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas began in response to Hamas fighters crossing into southern Israel. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hungary is challenging the European Union's policy towards Ukraine, disagreeing with other EU countries that support bringing Ukraine closer to the bloc and providing more aid amid the Russian invasion. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties with Moscow, believes the EU's strategy of sending aid has failed and opposes starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. Hungary's opposition is the main obstacle to a decision by EU leaders to begin formal membership talks with Ukraine and allocate €50 billion in aid. Hungary argues for a period of reflection and strategic discussion on the EU's policy towards Ukraine before supporting any decisions on Ukraine's accession process or further aid. This dispute highlights Hungary's concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine and its disagreement with the EU over democratic issues and access to funds. EU officials are exploring ways to bypass a Hungarian veto on aid to Ukraine but recognize the significance of supporting Ukraine's security and credibility. The outcome of the December EU summit and the decision on Ukraine's membership talks remain uncertain due to the need for consensus among member states.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Germany's constitutional court has ruled that the government's plan to use unused emergency funds from the pandemic for climate initiatives is unconstitutional, leaving a 60 billion euro ($65 billion) hole in its finances. This decision complicates budget negotiations within Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition and could set a precedent for future fiscal responses to crises. Finance Minister Christian Lindner will face increased scrutiny on spending control, and the ruling may force the government to make spending cuts. The earmarked funds were intended for energy efficiency, renewable electricity subsidies, chip production, and support for energy-intensive companies. The ruling has significant implications for Germany's fiscal policy and support for decarbonization. Germany's 2024 budget and financial plans through 2027 are being finalized this week as the country curbs spending due to COVID-19 and the Ukraine war.

A Russian delegation, led by natural resources minister Alexander Kozlov, visited Pyongyang, North Korea. The visit came as the politically isolated state announced progress in its banned ballistic missile program. The talks between Russia and North Korea focused on the economy, science, and technology. Kozlov emphasized Russia's desire for substantial cooperation with North Korea based on agreements made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, a cultural delegation from North Korea traveled to St. Petersburg for an event. South Korea's intelligence agency stated that North Korea is in the final stages of preparing for the launch of a spy satellite, potentially with technical assistance from Russia. North Korean state media reported successful static tests of new high-thrust solid-fuel engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). These tests are seen as essential for enhancing North Korea's military capabilities in a challenging security environment. Solid-fuel missiles are considered easier to operate and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons. Both North Korea's missile program and its nuclear weapons are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions, leading to imposed sanctions. The US has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in the war with Ukraine, while Moscow is alleged to provide technical military support to North Korea. However, both countries deny these claims and pledge closer military cooperation.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have made significant gains in their war with the army, breaking months of stalemate. These gains have strengthened the RSF's position and influence in talks in Jeddah. While there is speculation about the possibility of Sudan splitting, it remains unclear how the RSF could govern a breakaway territory. Instead, the RSF aims to increase its access to resources, such as gold, and secure its role in any political settlement. The RSF has been expanding its control in various regions, including Darfur and Khartoum, and has expressed its intention to reach Port Sudan. However, there is currently no immediate risk of Sudan splitting. The war between the RSF and the army began after a plan to integrate the two forces fell apart. The RSF has been gradually gaining territory and has recently used drones and longer-range artillery. The army has faced challenges with repairs to its warplanes and fatigue among soldiers. The RSF's advances have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with thousands of casualties and millions displaced. Ceasefire talks in Jeddah have been adjourned without a resolution, with the RSF seeking checkpoints and outposts to formalize its role in Khartoum. The army is under pressure from Bashir loyalists and Islamist militias. The situation remains volatile, and ethnically targeted violence is likely to persist.

### [Central Europe’s defence companies spy African opportunity](https://theprint.in/world/central-europes-defence-companies-spy-african-opportunity/1845170/)

Central European defense companies are aiming to expand their sales of weapons, military equipment, and related services in Africa. Former Warsaw Pact countries, such as the Czech Republic, have a history of supplying weapons to African nations during the Communist era and are now well-positioned to upgrade these systems. The shift towards Western technology by African countries still using Soviet-era equipment provides new opportunities for Central European defense companies. These companies are negotiating deals for guns, ammunition, military equipment, and services with various African nations. Their expertise in maintaining and modernizing Eastern-origin military land systems appeals to African customers who want to reduce reliance on Russian suppliers. With concerns over the reliability of Russian arms, there is potential for Central European defense companies to fill the gap. Russia has become the leading arms seller in sub-Saharan Africa, but the expertise of Czech industry in former Soviet weapons presents a valuable advantage. Polish defense companies have also intensified their talks with African markets, and interest has increased from potential African customers in Poland. The Czech Republic recently sent a trade mission to several African countries, focusing on boosting opportunities for the defense industry. Reopening and strengthening relationships with traditional partners in Africa is a key goal. Defense industry cooperation is seen as an integral part of these efforts. The Czech arms industry's reputation has been enhanced through its efforts to supply Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion in 2022. As African countries using Soviet-style equipment start to view Russia as a problematic supplier, they are turning to Central European alternatives.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent analysis has revealed that government efforts to remove unapproved and banned antibiotic fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs in India have been largely ineffective. The study found that in 2020, the majority of antibiotic formulations sold in India were either unapproved or banned. FDC drugs are combinations of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients in a single drug. While the total number of antibiotic FDC formulations on the market decreased from 574 in 2008 to 395 in 2020, around 70.4% of these formulations were unapproved or banned. Antibiotic resistance is a global concern, making it crucial to address this issue. The study suggests that regular surveys of the market and strengthened enforcement are necessary. Despite regulatory initiatives taken since 2007, hundreds of unapproved antibiotic FDC formulations have remained in the Indian market. Additionally, a considerable portion of antibiotic FDCs sold in India in 2020 were not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The slow progress in removing irrational FDC drugs is attributed to weak and inefficient regulatory enforcement.

According to a study conducted by the University of Adelaide and Oxford University, asbestos exposure led to a higher prevalence of asbestos-related lung cancers among British and Australian navy personnel compared to other armed forces. The study analyzed data from 30,085 British and Australian troops who served in the 1950s and 1960s, when asbestos-containing materials were present on naval vessels. The researchers found that the lung cancer rate was higher in naval personnel, and although smoking remains the primary cause of lung cancer, the excess cases in the navy could not be explained by a higher smoking rate. The study concluded that onboard asbestos exposure was likely the main cause of the increased lung cancer rate. Additionally, asbestosis deaths were observed among sailors, further strengthening the link. The researchers estimated that approximately 27% of lung cancers among Australian seamen and 12% among British seamen were related to onboard asbestos exposure. The study highlights the ongoing risk of asbestos exposure to workers, despite bans and regulatory controls. The researchers suggest that the effects of asbestos exposure may be underestimated unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis. They emphasize the need for strict control measures to protect workers from asbestos and other harmful airborne dusts.

Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), a steel company, has stated that if it can raise between Rs 3000-4000 crore through the monetization of its forged wheel plant and land, as well as ongoing efficiency measures, it will be able to increase production and turn around from losses. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) handles the monetization process as RINL is a divestment candidate. RINL had invested Rs 2000 crore in the wheel plant, which has the capacity to produce one lakh forged train wheels per year. RINL’s CEO, Atul Bhatt, said that if monetization occurs this fiscal year, it will help RINL come back to cash profit through increased production. RINL posted a loss of around Rs 3000 crore in 2022-23 due to factors such as a glut in the steel market, the export tax on steel, and a lack of captive raw material security. Bhatt highlighted a cost disadvantage of Rs 6000 per tonne due to buying iron ore from the open market and an unsustainable debt of around Rs 23000 crore. The monetization plan aims to reduce debt and improve the working capital situation. Bhatt also mentioned measures such as increasing oxygen capacity and switching the import of coking coal. RINL’s substantial land bank is considered attractive as it eliminates the need for prospective buyers to invest in developing new land parcels. The land parcels are currently under the direct ownership of the union government.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new study published in Frontiers in Science raises doubts about the effectiveness of achieving "net-zero" emissions in halting global warming. Net-zero emissions refers to the point at which the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount removed from it. The study argues that there is uncertainty surrounding the estimates that global warming will stop at net-zero, suggesting that there is a chance global warming could continue and intensify after reaching this point. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address this risk. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing global temperatures and highlights the need to limit initial disturbances to the planet in order to mitigate climate risks. The research identifies several processes that could contribute to significant warming after reaching net-zero emissions. The melting of polar ice, for example, leads to increased absorption of solar energy, which further drives up temperatures. The study concludes that political obstacles, rather than technological or physical ones, are currently hindering climate action.

### [Deportation of undocumented Afghans alters Balochistan’s socio-economic landscape: Report](https://theprint.in/world/deportation-of-undocumented-afghans-alters-balochistans-socio-economic-landscape-report/1843724/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The deportation of undocumented Afghan citizens from Pakistan is having a significant impact on the socio-economic dynamics in Balochistan, particularly in the city of Quetta. Many of those being deported are Pashtun, who had integrated into local Pashtun communities. The departure of these individuals has disrupted their lives and affected the communities that had embraced them. The Hazara community in Balochistan, which saw an increase in numbers after the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, is also facing a crisis as undocumented Hazaras have left for Afghanistan. This has exacerbated concerns among those who had fled oppression by the Afghan Taliban. The economic ramifications are being felt in Quetta, where some refugees played a vital role in the city's economy as laborers and consumers. Their departure has led to an economic downturn. The introduction of a passport requirement for crossing into Afghanistan has also disrupted businesses and family connections in Chaman, leading to protests. The social impact of the deportations is significant, as many Afghans had been part of the society for years, marrying and developing community ties. The deportations may strain cross-border kinships, diminish cultural and social contributions, and potentially destabilize local economies. Baloch nationalist parties, who were previously opposed to Afghan refugees, have remained silent on the issue this time. There are allegations that a large number of Afghans have been issued Pakistani identity cards, and there is speculation that these cards will be blocked and cancelled in the next phase, which could inadvertently affect Pakistani citizens in Balochistan. A careful and humane approach is necessary to prevent further disruption to the lives of both Afghan refugees and Balochistan's citizens.

Syria has granted the United Nations (UN) permission to continue delivering aid to opposition-held areas in the country's northwest for another three months. Initially, after an earthquake caused significant casualties in Turkey and Syria, the UN was allowed to provide aid through Turkish border crossings for a period of three months, which has now been extended for a third time until February 13th. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs highlighted the importance of this cross-border operation, as it reaches around 2.5 million people monthly with critical assistance and protection services. Syria's mission to the UN confirmed the extension of the UN's use of the Bab al-Salam and Al Ra'ee crossings. The UN had also been using the Bab al-Hawa crossing since 2014, but authorization from the UN Security Council expired in mid-July. However, shortly after, the Syrian government allowed the UN to continue using Bab al-Hawa for an additional six months. In total, over 4,200 trucks carrying UN aid have utilized these border crossings so far this year.

Israeli tanks have positioned themselves at the gates of Gaza City's main hospital, Al Shifa, resulting in patients, including newborns, dying due to a lack of fuel and power. The siege of the hospital and the lack of resources have caused the death of 32 patients in the last three days. Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra stated that there are still around 650 patients in need of evacuation. Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters by Hamas fighters, an accusation denied by Hamas. President Joe Biden expressed his hope for less intrusive action at the hospital and stressed the need to protect it. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of two-thirds of Gaza's population. Fighting has also occurred at Al Quds hospital, causing it to cease functioning. Israel alleges that terrorists were shot from the hospital entrance in return fire. The conflict has raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on the Israeli-Lebanese border and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militia targets in Syria.

The Brazilian government plans to expand its railway network with a 40 billion reais ($8 billion) fund, funded by removing discounts given to rail companies under previous government contracts. The discounts were given to iron ore miner Vale and logistics companies Rumo and MRS in 2022 under the government of former President Jair Bolsonaro. These contracts did not go through the normal public bidding process, and the companies were allowed to make an advance payment deducting unamortized assets from their owed concession payments. The government claims that the companies owe an additional 40 billion reais ($8.1 billion) in unpaid concession payments. While Rumo has agreed to pay, Vale and MRS are still disputing the matter in court. Once the court's decision is made, the government plans to arrange any payments with the companies. The funds will be used to finance the construction of new railways and extend existing ones, with the goal of increasing rail freight transportation from 17% to 40% of Brazil's total freight, including iron ore.

The government has accused Google of paying billions to ensure its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, alleging it as an abuse of monopoly. Murphy also stated that these payments often result in benefits to users, such as cheaper phones or better data plans. He added that while Microsoft had the majority of preinstalled browser defaults, its Bing search engine only received 15% of search queries. The trial is expected to conclude this week.

### [Rising temperatures, longer monsoon drive Bangladesh’s worst dengue outbreak](https://theprint.in/environment/rising-temperatures-longer-monsoon-drive-bangladeshs-worst-dengue-outbreak/1843678/)

Bangladesh is experiencing its worst-ever outbreak of dengue fever, with a death toll of 1,476 and over 291,000 infected. Experts attribute the severe outbreak to rising temperatures and a longer monsoon season caused by climate change, which create ideal breeding conditions for the dengue-spreading mosquito. This year's death toll is more than five times that of 2022 and the highest since authorities began tracking the disease in 2000. The Aedes mosquito, which spreads dengue, is adapting to the changing climate patterns, leading to the disease's spread in all 64 districts of the country. Vector surveillance is now needed year-round to monitor the disease's spread. There is no specific vaccine or drug for dengue, but early detection and proper medical care can reduce deaths to less than 1% of those infected. Hospitals in Bangladesh are struggling to cope with the influx of patients and a shortage of intravenous fluids.

Hmm, I am not sure.

OPEC stated that oil market fundamentals remained strong and attributed the drop in prices to speculators. The organization slightly raised its 2023 forecast for global oil demand growth and maintained its high prediction for 2024. The report countered negative sentiment around Chinese demand and increased demand growth forecasts for this year. Last week, the US Energy Information Administration lowered its projection for crude oil production and predicted a decrease in demand. Additionally, weak economic data from China raised fears of faltering demand. However, analysts believe that oil prices may have reached a bottom and expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to continue their voluntary supply cuts into next year, limiting downside potential.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices rose slightly as the dollar weakened, and investors are awaiting U.S. inflation data that could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $1,934.25 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,938.50. The upcoming release of U.S. consumer prices index (CPI) data and producer price index data will be closely watched. If the inflation data exceeds expectations, gold may face downward pressure due to the possibility of a rate hike. However, if the data aligns with expectations, gold could trade above $1,950. It's important to note that higher interest rates can reduce the appeal of gold as it doesn't generate yield. The market currently predicts an 86% chance of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in December. Last week, gold prices dipped due to reduced safe-haven demand and a hawkish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Moody's recently changed the outlook on the U.S. government's ratings to "negative" from "stable." Spot silver fell by 1% to $21.99 per ounce, while platinum gained 1.1% to $849.49 and palladium fell by 1% to $953.44, near a five-year low.

### [Researchers give more insight into development of lupus in females](https://theprint.in/science/researchers-give-more-insight-into-development-of-lupus-in-females/1843651/)

In lupus, an autoimmune disease, women are affected nine times more than males. The reasons behind this gender disparity have been unclear, but a recent study by Johns Hopkins Medicine has shed light on the role of the X chromosome and a specific genetic material called X-inactive specific transcript (XIST). The study found that XIST can trigger an immune response involving toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a protein in the immune system. This immune response contributes to the development and severity of lupus in women. The research suggests that XIST may play a role in promoting autoimmunity and could be a potential target for future therapies. Further studies are needed to explore XIST's involvement in other autoimmune conditions that predominantly affect women.

Negotiators at the third round of talks in Nairobi are urged to reach a deal on the world's first treaty to combat plastic pollution. The global plastic waste production is around 400 million metric tonnes per year, with less than 10% being recycled. Approximately 14 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean annually, alongside increasing amounts in landfills. Delegates will discuss potential measures for the treaty, focusing on the entire life cycle of plastics or prioritizing plastic waste management. Kenya advocates for a binding agreement on plastic production and usage and has implemented laws banning certain plastic uses since 2017. The plastic industry and oil and petrochemical exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, oppose curbing plastic use and argue for improved recycling and reuse. Majority of countries support advancing the negotiations, while a smaller group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are attempting to hinder progress.

In addition to this, the EU will also commit funding to help countries meet the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030.

So far, no country has made a specific financial pledge to the fund, although the US has signaled interest in contributing "several millions of dollars".

Presidential front-runner Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia criticized the European Union (EU) over its ban on palm oil imports and claimed that Europeans were also responsible for deforestation during colonial times. The EU recently passed a law to ban imports of commodities linked to forest destruction, including palm oil, which Indonesia is the largest producer of. Prabowo argued that while Indonesia has maintained good relations with Europe, the EU's ban on palm oil has created difficulties for selling other products such as coffee, tea, and cocoa. The EU, previously the third-largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil, did not immediately respond to Prabowo's comments. Prabowo further highlighted that during colonial rule, Europeans forced Indonesians to plant other crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, and cocoa, resulting in the destruction of forests. He emphasized the need for an equal playing field and expressed concern about the impact of the EU's deforestation law on Indonesia's annual exports. A task force comprising the EU, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the second-largest palm oil producer globally, has been formed to discuss the law.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The dollar reached its highest level against the Japanese yen in over a year, boosted by reduced expectations of US interest rate cuts next year. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stated that the government would monitor the currency market and respond accordingly, but this had little immediate impact on the yen. The British pound slightly increased after a reshuffle of key government posts by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Traders in global currency markets were cautious, awaiting the latest US inflation numbers to determine the likelihood of rate cuts next year. While the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen since October 2022, it was last up 0.15%. Last week, Fed policymakers indicated that the battle against inflation was not yet over, leading to a reduction in market rate cut bets and supporting the dollar. The dollar index also saw gains, remaining firm due to last week's increase. Moody's lowering the outlook for US credit had little impact on the market. Japanese data showed that wholesale inflation had slowed, suggesting diminishing pressure on the yen. However, there was still concern about potential intervention from the Japanese government to strengthen the currency. The euro and sterling both gained slightly, with sterling also rising against the euro after news of changes in the UK government.

Medics inside the hospital reported that patients, including newborn babies, were dying due to a lack of fuel. The Gaza health ministry stated that 32 patients had died in the past three days, and around 650 patients were still awaiting evacuation. However, Israel claims that the hospital is being used as a headquarters for Hamas fighters and accuses them of using patients as shields. The conflict has also raised concerns about its potential spread beyond Gaza, with clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon and the United States launching airstrikes on Iran-linked militias in Syria. The ongoing conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and made more than half of the population homeless. The situation at Al Shifa hospital remains dire, with tanks stationed at the gates, Israeli fire targeting the hospital, and limited resources available. Another major hospital in northern Gaza has also stopped functioning. The United Nations observed a minute's silence for the 101 staff members killed so far.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the Congress party's efforts in promoting social justice and its impact on the caste composition of its candidates for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly election. The party has appointed a Dalit leader as its national president and has been advocating for a caste census. However, an analysis of the party's nominated candidates reveals that substantial changes have not been made in its candidate nomination policy.

The Congress has allocated 36% of the tickets to upper castes, which comprise only around 10% of the state's population. In contrast, OBCs, representing more than half of the state's population, have been given only 27% of the tickets. This indicates that while there is a symbolic shift towards social justice, there have been no substantive changes in the candidate nomination policy.

The article also highlights the dominance of certain jatis (castes) among the Congress candidates. More than half of the nominated candidates belong to five jatis: Rajput, Brahmin, Gond, Bhil, and Jatav/Ahirwar. Rajputs and Brahmins make up a significant portion of the nominations, with Rajputs comprising around 14% and Brahmins around 13% of the total candidates.

Gonds and Bhils, as well as Jains, Baniyas, and Gurjars, also receive notable political representation. Among Scheduled Castes, the Jatav/Ahirwar castes have the highest number of nominations. However, the Congress has not been able to implement its aggressive stance on caste issues within the party, as the traditional upper-caste local elite still have influence over nominations.

The article concludes by suggesting that the Congress may face electoral consequences if it fails to address these disparities in caste representation.

### [Why are my kids good around other people and then badly behaved with me?](https://theprint.in/world/why-are-my-kids-good-around-other-people-and-then-badly-behaved-with-me/1842704/)

This article discusses why children often behave well at school or in other settings but exhibit worse behavior at home. It explains that children learn from an early age that their behavior produces outcomes and can be a way to control the actions of others. Sometimes, children are inadvertently rewarded for misbehavior at home through increased attention or getting what they want. In contrast, children may behave better at school because teachers have clear expectations and reward systems in place. The article suggests that parents can help improve their children's behavior at home by establishing routines, setting simple house rules, noticing good behavior, spending regular small amounts of time with their child, and having realistic expectations.

China's increasing presence in the Pacific region has led to mixed perceptions among local populations, according to surveys conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands. While both governments welcome China's engagement, concerns over environmental pollution and perceived lack of benefits from Chinese projects were raised. However, those living near mining operations tended to view them more positively due to financial benefits. Chinese government scholarships improved students' views of China, with participants recommending the program and reporting a positive change in their impressions of the country. In the Solomon Islands, support for closer ties with both China and the US was high among surveyed students, although some expressed concerns about potential debt risks associated with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Non-governmental organizations in the Pacific also raised concerns about human rights violations, governance, debt risks, and environmental pollution related to China's initiatives. The complex and nuanced perceptions of local populations in the Pacific regarding China's influence should be considered by policymakers in the US and Australia as they aim to counter China's growing relationships in the region.

Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that China has been increasing its presence in the Pacific region, particularly in countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands. While the governments of these countries welcome China's engagement, there are mixed perceptions among the local populations. For example, in PNG, concerns about environmental pollution related to the China-owned Ramu NiCo project were expressed by the majority of respondents. However, those living in the mining lease area had a more positive view due to the direct financial benefits they receive. In Solomon Islands, there is support for a closer bilateral relationship with China, but some individuals have concerns about debt risks and Chinese control over resources. It's important for policymakers in the US and Australia to understand these nuanced perceptions as they navigate China's growing influence in the region.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) experienced a significant cyber hack on its U.S. broker-dealer, causing disruption to its operations. The attack was so extensive that the corporate email system stopped working, forcing employees to switch to Google mail. As a result, the brokerage temporarily owed BNY Mellon $9 billion, which was much larger than its net capital. ICBC's New York-based unit received financial support from its Chinese parent to repay BNY Mellon, and manual processing of trades was conducted with the help of the custody bank. ICBC expected the process of setting up secure systems and resuming normal business to take at least until Monday. During this time, clients were asked to temporarily suspend business and clear trades elsewhere. The ransomware attack, claimed by cybercrime gang Lockbit, raises concerns about the resilience of the Treasury market and highlights the importance of cybersecurity. The hack may also influence regulatory discussions surrounding central clearing of Treasury trades. The incident is likely to be a topic of conversation at an upcoming Treasury market conference. Despite being a mid-sized broker, ICBC's systems being paralyzed caused disruptions in the market, leading some market participants to reroute their trades. BNY Mellon played a crucial role in helping sort through the situation and facilitated the clearing of trades manually. ICBC's parent injected capital into the unit to ensure payment to BNY Mellon. Once ICBC's new system is operational, others in the industry will also review its safety measures, potentially causing further delays in returning to normal operations.

### [Payments app Zelle begins refunds for imposter scams after Washington pressure](https://theprint.in/tech/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-for-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure/1842693/)

Banks on the payment app Zelle have made a significant policy change by starting to refund victims of imposter scams. This decision comes in response to concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers and the federal consumer watchdog. Zelle, which is owned by seven major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, began reversing transfers on June 30 for customers who were deceived into sending money to scammers posing as government agencies or financial service providers. The move goes beyond legal requirements, according to Ben Chance, the chief fraud risk officer at Early Warning Services (EWS), the company that owns Zelle.

Previously, banks were only required to reimburse customers for unauthorized payments made by hackers, not for transfers initiated by customers themselves. While Zelle introduced a new reimbursement benefit for specific scam types, it had not previously provided details about its imposter scam refund policy due to concerns that it could encourage false scam claims.

This policy shift represents a significant change from last year when banks argued against refunding transfers that customers were tricked into approving. Zelle has faced criticism after a New York Times report highlighted the prevalence of scams on their platform, with Senator Elizabeth Warren estimating that Zelle users lost $440 million to fraud in 2021 alone.

Impersonator fraud was the most-reported scam across all payment methods in the U.S. in 2022, resulting in $2.6 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Despite concerns that covering the cost of authorized transactions might lead to more fraud, Zelle's owner company, EWS, has implemented a mechanism that allows banks to recover funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender. Additionally, Zelle now requires lenders to implement a tool that detects transfers with risky attributes.

Zelle's changes have satisfied the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) so far, but pressure from lawmakers may lead to further rule changes to protect customers from scams. Zelle faces market pressure to improve its standards of care as it competes with other peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo, which offer purchase protection programs for eligible transactions.

While Zelle's policy change is seen as a positive step, experts emphasize that regulations mandating imposter fraud protections would be better to ensure customer well-being. Payment fraud is expected to be a topic of discussion when bank CEOs appear before the Senate in the future.

The dollar remained strong as traders awaited U.S. inflation data to gauge the Federal Reserve's response to price pressures. The Japanese yen stayed weak, close to a one-year low, amidst speculation of possible intervention by Tokyo. The focus for traders will be on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) numbers, with more Fed speakers expected to leave room for further interest rate hikes. Moody's lowering of the U.S. credit rating outlook had little impact on the market. The yen was pressured by rising U.S. treasury yields and continued dollar strength.

The Japanese yen reached a one-year low against the dollar as traders eagerly awaited U.S. inflation data, which is expected to provide insight into whether the Federal Reserve needs to take further action to control rising prices. Market analysts believe that even if the CPI numbers are softer, the Fed will continue to resist rate cuts, considering inflation remains above target. Moody's recent announcement of lowering its outlook for the U.S. credit rating had little impact on the market. The yen remained under pressure due to increasing U.S. Treasury yields and a strong dollar. Meanwhile, data from Japan indicated that wholesale inflation had slowed below 1% for the first time in over two years, suggesting fading cost pressures that offered little support to the yen. In other news, sterling held steady ahead of UK earnings data, while the euro hovered around $1.0688.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.New Zealand's Prime Minister-elect, Christopher Luxon, stated that he is unlikely to attend the upcoming APEC meeting in San Francisco due to ongoing coalition negotiations. Although Luxon's conservative National Party won the largest share of votes in last month's general election, they require the support of both the right-wing ACT New Zealand and populist New Zealand First Parties to form a majority government. While talks have intensified since the release of final election results on November 3, there is still no set timeline for reaching an agreement. Luxon believes that progress is being made and wants to focus on concluding negotiations and forming a government. However, he expressed a desire to attend APEC to showcase New Zealand as open for business and establish relationships with world leaders. If Luxon doesn't attend, New Zealand will send representatives from the caretaker government and the National Party. The process of forming a government in New Zealand typically takes about a month but can sometimes take longer under the country's mixed member proportional system.

### [Researchers reveal genetics of near healthy tissue help detect lung cancer’s return](https://theprint.in/health/researchers-reveal-genetics-of-near-healthy-tissue-help-detect-lung-cancers-return/1842241/)

New research led by NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Centre suggests that genetic data from healthy tissue near lung tumors may be a better predictor of cancer recurrence than analyzing the tumors themselves. The study, which focused on lung adenocarcinoma, found that analyzing the transcriptome of apparently healthy tissue accurately predicted recurrence 83% of the time, compared to 63% when analyzing tumor tissue. The study also revealed that genes associated with inflammation in adjacent healthy tissue were particularly useful for making predictions. The findings suggest that immunotherapy could be used to combat tumor growth before it becomes detectable by traditional methods. The researchers plan to use their findings to assess recurrence risk in newly treated lung cancer patients.

A study published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mSystems found that diets high in fiber, particularly those that include broccoli sprouts or other cruciferous vegetables, could help mice with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) live longer and improve their well-being. The researchers examined the impact of a broccoli sprout diet on the immune systems of the mice and the microbes in their gut affected by Crohn's disease. They also studied the reduction of Crohn's symptoms and the anti-inflammatory compounds found in broccoli sprouts. The study involved IL-10-ko mice divided into different diet groups and used new healthy mice to trigger symptoms of colitis and Crohn's disease. The researchers examined gut tissues and microbial communities in the intestines of the mice. They found that the mice on the broccoli sprout diet had higher levels of the anti-inflammatory metabolite sulforaphane in their blood, resulting in milder disease symptoms. The study also revealed that younger mice responded better to the diet and had stronger gut bacterial communities compared to adolescent mice.

However, this rapid urban development is putting increased pressure on the planet and its natural resources because concrete and cement, which are key construction materials, contribute approximately 7% of global CO2 emissions. To address this issue, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and industry input from the Global Cement and Concrete Association, has developed a framework to reduce concrete emissions. The framework suggests three key strategies: decarbonizing the manufacturing process, using lower-carbon cement blends, and optimizing the volume of material used in projects. One potential solution for decarbonizing cement production is an electric chemical approach that replaces fossil fuel kilns with an ambient temperature process. This approach aims to achieve true zero carbon and can be a high-performance, low-carbon building material. The journey of developing sustainable cement production technology serves as a lesson that good ideas can come from anywhere.

Higher oil prices resulting from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to lower economic growth and higher inflation, according to Fitch Ratings. The rating agency estimates that world GDP growth would be 0.4 percentage points lower in 2024 and 0.1 percentage points lower in 2025. Fitch's simulations assume average oil prices of $120 per barrel in 2024 and $100 per barrel in 2025. The impact of higher oil prices would dampen GDP growth in most economies, with South Africa and Turkey being the most affected. Fitch also expects higher inflation rates in 2024, followed by corrections in 2025. The potential oil price shock could result in tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets.

Finally, the Miami Heat earned a 117-109 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. Bam Adebayo recorded 26 points and 17 rebounds, while rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. had a season-high 20 points. Jimmy Butler sat out for the Heat due to a personal family issue. Trae Young scored 27 points and had 11 assists for the Hawks, but it wasn't sufficient to secure a win.

Negotiations are underway for the creation of a treaty to address plastic pollution, and officials are divided on whether to limit plastic production or focus on waste management. The world currently produces around 400 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with less than 10% being recycled. The European Union and several countries advocate for binding provisions to reduce plastic production and eliminate problematic plastics, while the plastic industry and oil-exporting nations argue for a focus on recycling and reusing plastics. The United States has shifted its stance, now calling for national plans that align with global goals to reduce plastic pollution. Environmental groups hope the discussions can move past procedural matters and focus on substantive solutions.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A study conducted by researchers from Michigan State University found that there is no reliable association between pet ownership and well-being. The study involved 767 participants who completed online surveys, and while pet owners reported that their pets improved their lives, there was no difference in the well-being of pet owners compared to non-pet owners over time. The study also found that the type of pet, the number of pets, and the quality of the human-pet relationship did not affect the association. The researchers suggested that non-pet owners may have other sources of happiness in their lives. They concluded that while pets may provide positive experiences, they may not have a transformative effect on overall well-being.

### [Diwali car discounts make for a great deal. But don’t drive home a soon-to-be extinct SUV](https://theprint.in/opinion/dashboard/diwali-car-discounts-make-for-a-great-deal-but-dont-drive-home-a-soon-to-be-extinct-suv/1840907/)

The Indian automotive industry has experienced a swift rebound after the challenges of 2020, with consistent monthly sales growth over the past two years. It is predicted that by March 2024, the Indian passenger car market will surpass four million units, making it the world's third-largest car market behind China and the United States.

However, Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor India, Tarun Garg, raises concerns about the current situation. He points out that rival carmakers are offering massive discounts on their flagship products during the Diwali season, suggesting that there may be underlying issues despite the apparent positive growth. Garg predicts a decline in growth as 2024 approaches, marking the end of a period of intense expansion.

Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) indicates that sales of passenger cars in October 2023 grew by 15.87% compared to the previous year. While major manufacturers like Hyundai saw their sales increase by close to 15%, smaller players such as Renault, Nissan, and Citroen experienced significant declines. This could be due to a lack of suitable products, although even established carmakers like Honda have resorted to offering attractive discounts to drive sales growth.

Discounts are not limited to the mainstream market and can also be found in the luxury segment. Luxury carmakers offer attractive loan deals through their finance arms to show volumes, often at rates lower than those offered by banks. There are also instances where dealers are asked to pick up cars to demonstrate monthly volumes, which are then sold off as unregistered vehicles at significant discounts.

The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) has created confusion among Indian consumers. Currently, the EV market offers limited choices, mostly retrofitted variants of internal-combustion engine cars. However, purpose-built EVs are expected to enter the market around 2025-26, providing better options for consumers. Major automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti-Suzuki, Hyundai, and Kia are working on upcoming EV models.

Despite potential economic uncertainty after the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Hyundai remains committed to its plans for a 'Made In India' EV, similar to a C-segment SUV, by 2025. This raises the question of whether buying a new vehicle at this time might lead to owning a car that could become obsolete in a few years.

In summary, while the Indian automotive industry has shown impressive growth, concerns about underlying issues such as discounts, declining sales for some manufacturers, and the impending shift towards EVs raise questions about the future of the market.

### [Bangladeshi Muslims are building a 300-yr-old Kali temple. Now they want Modi’s help](https://theprint.in/ground-reports/bangladeshi-muslims-are-building-a-300-yr-old-kali-temple-now-they-want-modis-help/1841292/)

The 300-year-old Sasan Kali temple in Bangladesh's Magura district was partially destroyed in the 2000 floods. Now, both Muslims and Hindus are coming together to rebuild the temple and are seeking assistance from the governments of Bangladesh and India. The village of Basurdhuljhuri, where the temple is located, serves as a symbol of secularism in a country that has been witnessing communal violence during Hindu festivities.

Every year, journalist Sahidul Hasan Khokon returns to his native village for the Kali pujo at the temple. This year, he and his friends plan to form a committee to restore the temple to its original glory. Despite its current modest appearance, the temple attracts millions of devotees who believe that their wishes will be granted by the goddess Kali.

In 2001, there was no Kali pujo due to the flood, but Muslim neighbors contributed funds and resources to help construct a temporary temple for the Hindus in the village. Now, the community wants to build a proper temple and hopes for support from both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments. They cite a similar project funded by India in Natore district as a precedent.

The Kali temple at Basurdhuljhuri holds historical significance and requires a budget of at least fifteen lakh Bangladeshi Taka for construction. Bengali Hindus in West Bengal and Bangladesh worship Goddess Kali during Diwali, and the Sasan Kali form is revered in certain temples like the one in Basurdhuljhuri.

The story of Hindus and Muslims coming together to rebuild a Kali temple is seen as an example of syncretic culture defeating fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh. Many individuals, such as actress Ashna Habib Bhabna, appreciate this display of unity and hope for the prompt construction of the temple.

For Sahidul Hasan Khokon, supporting the temple's restoration is not only about rebuilding a part of his childhood, but also about defending his belief system in the face of temple attacks. He hopes that both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments will help restore this shared heritage.

A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background. The study focused on English and French participants and found that when paired with someone from the same cultural background, participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs, while those paired with someone from a different cultural background engaged in deeper searches and revised their beliefs in line with evidence. The researchers believe that bringing together people from opposing sides to fact-check contentious social media posts could improve media literacy and civil discourse. However, it may be challenging to get people from opposing sides to engage in such discussions. The researchers plan to conduct future studies on more controversial topics to further explore the effects of mismatched pairs.

### [People dig deeper to fact-check social media posts when paired with someone who doesn’t share their perspective – new research](https://theprint.in/world/people-dig-deeper-to-fact-check-social-media-posts-when-paired-with-someone-who-doesnt-share-their-perspective-new-research/1841997/)

A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background. The study focused on English and French participants and found that when paired with someone from the same cultural background, participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs, while those paired with someone from a different cultural background engaged in deeper searches and revised their beliefs in line with evidence. The researchers believe that bringing together people from opposing sides to fact-check contentious social media posts could improve media literacy and civil discourse. However, it may be challenging to get people from opposing sides to engage in such discussions. The researchers plan to conduct future studies on more controversial topics to further explore the effects of mismatched pairs.

The Maharashtra government is working to identify all Marathas who were once part of the Kunbi caste before the January 2 deadline for their reservation quota. District officials are scrambling to complete the identification process, with more than 300-400 government officials involved in each taluka. The government has directed districts to search various documents and publish Kunbi references found. Afterward, people will be asked to submit claims for caste certificates based on their genealogy. However, there are challenges such as old and delicate records, missing last names, and discrepancies between siblings' castes. Scanning the documents has been a challenge, with smartphone cameras being used due to the issues with regular scanners. The records are in different scripts, so Modi script readers and translators have been employed to identify the word "Kunbi" in various formats. Despite the difficulties, progress is being made, with some districts having already found thousands of Kunbi records.

### [Unlike AAP’s corruption in Delhi, UP’s excise policy is transparent: UP minister Nitin Agarwal](https://theprint.in/india/unlike-aaps-corruption-in-delhi-ups-excise-policy-is-transparent-up-minister-nitin-agarwal-2/1841972/)

The Uttar Pradesh Excise Minister, Nitin Agarwal, has accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi of engaging in corrupt practices that benefit the "liquor mafia." He stated that unlike Delhi, where one person can have more than two liquor shops, Uttar Pradesh restricts individuals to a maximum of two liquor shops. Agarwal highlighted that no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption have occurred during the current term of the Yogi Adityanath-led government. The excise policy of the Delhi government for 2021-22 came under scrutiny, leading to a recommendation for a CBI investigation into alleged irregularities by the Lieutenant Governor. Agarwal criticized the AAP for blaming the BJP and suggested that the leaders responsible for the excise scam were involved with the liquor mafia. Both the CBI and the ED are investigating the excise policy cases.

Agarwal emphasized that the UP excise department differs from Delhi's as it provides a level-playing field and operates on a pro-industry policy. He mentioned that the previous policies were not transparent and favored the liquor mafia. The minister stated that the current government welcomes anyone interested in doing business in the state and highlighted the revenue growth of the excise department since the formation of the BJP government in 2017. The target is to reach a revenue figure of Rs 50,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs 80,000 crore by 2027.

Agarwal also mentioned that there have been no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption in Uttar Pradesh during CM Adityanath's second term. He explained that deaths occur when local-level liquor production involves mixing jaggery with urea, which becomes poisonous if methyl alcohol is added. Agarwal assured that country liquor made in distilleries in Uttar Pradesh is safe. The department targets an annual growth rate of 8-10% and sells one crore cases of country liquor per month. Country liquor contributes 44% to the department's total revenue.

The festive seasons in India can take a toll on the skin, leading to a dull and tired complexion. Winter pollution and indulgence in rich foods can further worsen skin issues. To maintain a glowing complexion, dermatologists recommend taking a vitamin B supplement, drinking plenty of water, and applying moisturizer regularly. Home remedies such as using vinegar and lime juice for dandruff or shampooing with beer can also help. Seeking advice from a dermatologist, especially in areas with heavy pollution, is advised. For specific skin issues, treatments like microdermabrasion and exfoliation creams can be effective. However, it is important not to try new treatments right before important events. Hydration, proper cleansing, and moisturizing are essential steps in a skincare routine. Using a micellar water for makeup removal and a gentle cleanser is recommended. Regular exfoliation and sunscreen application are also important. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for overall skin health. Following these skincare steps can ensure that the skin reflects the joy and brightness of the festive season.

The Chief of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Om Prakash Rajbhar, has stated that his party is prepared for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and has requested five seats from the BJP, their alliance partner, for the general elections. Rajbhar also mentioned that the opposition India bloc does not pose a challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as the constituent parties within the opposition fight among themselves. In response to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's statement on contesting in 65 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajbhar claimed that Yadav wants Narendra Modi to become the prime minister again, as the Congress becoming strong in Uttar Pradesh would weaken the Samajwadi Party. Rajbhar criticized Yadav's PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) strategy, stating that the Samajwadi Party only benefits the Yadavs and not the backward classes. SBSP won six seats in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party and later formally joined the NDA. Rajbhar dismissed the threat of the opposition India bloc, describing it as not a challenge and citing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's controversial comments in the assembly on women. SBSP, with a significant presence among the OBC Rajbhar caste, aims to contest a few parliamentary seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh and contiguous areas of Bihar. Regarding seat-sharing for the 2024 elections, Rajbhar stated that the SBSP has sought three seats in Uttar Pradesh and two in Bihar from the BJP. Although discussions on seat-sharing are yet to be held, the party is laying groundwork in Bihar. Rajbhar did not disclose the specific seats his party has requested. The SBSP was previously in an alliance with the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and won four seats, and Rajbhar served as a minister during Yogi Adityanath's first term. After formally rejoining the NDA in July, there is speculation about Rajbhar's return to the cabinet and the induction of another OBC leader, Dara Singh Chauhan.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has released a white paper blaming the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government for the economic crisis in Pakistan, according to a report by Dawn. The PTI claims that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, their government managed to put the economy on a path of rapid growth. The white paper argues that the PDM government, which came into power through a regime change conspiracy, reversed the economic gains achieved by the PTI-led government and caused more economic damage than natural disasters and the pandemic combined. The white paper highlights that when the PTI took office in 2018, the economy was on the verge of collapse, with various economic indicators such as an overvalued Pakistani rupee and a high current account deficit. The document also criticizes the previous government's mismanagement of the energy sector, particularly in relation to the overbuilding of power supply through imported fuel plants. The white paper states that the PTI government had to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance, which came with tough conditions such as increasing taxes and tariffs. Despite facing a global commodity super cycle that led to higher prices for petroleum products, edible oil, and coal, the PTI government was able to maintain control over inflation rates. The white paper also emphasizes that the PTI government accumulated additional debt compared to the previous government, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In related news, the PTI has canceled its public gathering in Karachi after the district administration denied permission. The PTI described the attitude of the authorities towards the party as unfair and stated that they were being denied a level-playing field.

Three babies died in a neonatal unit in northern Gaza after the hospital went "out of service" due to continuous Israeli fire in the vicinity. The hospital is currently treating 36 babies and providing shelter for around 20,000 displaced people.

The upcoming state assembly elections in Jhabua, a Congress stronghold reserved for scheduled tribes, have not generated much election atmosphere. The incumbent Congress candidate is Vikrant Bhuria, while the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded Bhanu Bhuria as their candidate. Vikrant claims that the BJP government has not done enough to increase employment opportunities in the tribal-dominated region, leading to migration. Bhanu Bhuria alleges that the lack of dams in Jhabua, which could have provided water for irrigation, has contributed to the migration issue. In the 2018 assembly elections, Guman Singh Damor of the BJP defeated Vikrant Bhuria, but subsequently resigned for the Lok Sabha seat.

Former US President Donald Trump has filed a legal motion supporting media requests for live television coverage of his federal trial. Trump argues that prosecutors want the trial held in darkness as part of a politically motivated effort by President Joe Biden's administration to undermine his bid for re-election in 2024. Trump is facing four criminal proceedings, including charges of attempting to defraud the federal government and obstructing Congress by spreading false claims of election fraud. The latest filing by Trump's lawyers endorses media organizations' requests for live television coverage, stating that it would allow the American public to see that the case is a "dreamt-up constitutional charade." Special prosecutor Jack Smith had previously opposed the media requests, citing a federal court rule that prohibits broadcasts of criminal proceedings.

Novo Nordisk has announced new data that suggests the heart protective benefits of its obesity treatment, Wegovy, are not solely due to weight loss. The drug, which has been shown to help patients lose an average of 15% of their weight, also reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from heart disease by 20%, according to early data from the company's select trial. The study found that the cardiovascular benefits of Wegovy appeared almost immediately after starting treatment, suggesting they were not solely a result of weight loss. The drug also demonstrated a reduction in non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death. The study's authors note that while the mechanisms behind Wegovy's cardiovascular protection remain speculative, it has a consistent effect on associated risk factors such as inflammation, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. However, the trial did report adverse side effects, primarily gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, in almost 1,500 patients taking Wegovy compared to 718 patients in the placebo group. Novo Nordisk expects to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits in the U.S. and EU next year.

### [Turbulent winters are coming. Blame El Niño and global warming combo](https://theprint.in/environment/turbulent-winters-are-coming-blame-el-nino-and-global-warming-combo/1841694/)

According to a new forecast from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the climate pattern known as "El Niño" is predicted to intensify over the winter, potentially leading to a winter of extreme weather, particularly in the US. El Niño refers to a rise in sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, which results in warmer-than-average weather globally. After three years of a cooling phase called La Niña, El Niño is returning at a time when the world is already experiencing high temperatures due to climate change. As a result, NOAA predicts warmer-than-average temperatures in wide areas of the US, along with above-average rainfall in some southern states. El Niño's impact extends beyond the Americas, with potential hotter and drier weather in areas like Australia and Indonesia, and increased hurricane activity in the Pacific Ocean. Studies suggest that global warming may lead to stronger El Niño phases, and climate-related risks are a top concern for risk experts. Mitigating and adapting to climate change is seen as the most pressing issue of the next decade.

### [Can taking salt off the table help prevent diabetes? It’s not that simple](https://theprint.in/health/can-taking-salt-off-the-table-help-prevent-diabetes-its-not-that-simple/1841665/)

A new study from Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that salt consumption may be linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the study is an observational study and cannot prove causation, only association. The data used to assess salt intake was based on a simple question, making it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of salt associated with an increased risk. Most salt intake comes from processed foods rather than added at the table. The study also found a weak association between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but did not provide specific recommendations for reducing salt intake. The key takeaway is that maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet are known to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) plans to maintain its diplomatic ties with Israel despite the international outcry over the war in Gaza. The UAE aims to have a moderating influence on Israel's campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. The mounting death toll in Gaza has stirred outrage in Arab capitals, but the UAE has publicly condemned Israel's actions and called for an end to the violence. The UAE is also working to moderate the public positions of other Arab states to facilitate a return to dialogue once the war ends. The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and has no plans to sever diplomatic ties. The UAE's motivation for establishing ties with Israel includes shared concerns over Iran and economic-driven realignment of foreign policy. Despite their close ties, Abu Dhabi has been concerned about Israel's right-wing government's expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and visits to the Al Aqsa mosque compound. The displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan is seen as a red line for Abu Dhabi. The UAE has distanced itself from Hamas, viewing them as a threat to regional stability. They have played a significant role in opposing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Sudan.

### [Study gives more insight into bacterium’s protective role in chronic rhinosinusitis](https://theprint.in/science/study-gives-more-insight-into-bacteriums-protective-role-in-chronic-rhinosinusitis/1841441/)

The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been increasing in Japan and around the world. CRS is an inflammatory condition that causes symptoms like nasal congestion, discharge, trouble breathing, face pain, and loss of smell. Treating CRS is challenging because it presents in various ways. There are two categories: eosinophilic (ECRS) and non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS) CRS. ECRS is associated with higher levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that releases pro-inflammatory substances, in the nasal and sinus tissues.

The rise in CRS is influenced by environmental factors, which in turn are affected by lifestyle changes. The role of the nasal microbiome in the development of ECRS has not been clear. To address this, a research team from the University of Fukui conducted a study on CRS in a Japanese population, specifically focusing on the nasal microbiome. They collected nasal swabs from 143 subjects, including those with ECRS, non-ECRS, and healthy controls.

The researchers found significant differences in the microbiome diversity between the CRS and control groups, indicating the involvement of the nasal microbiome in the disease. Additionally, they observed distinct microbiome compositions between the ECRS and non-ECRS groups. The bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum) was found to be less abundant in patients with ECRS. Metagenomic analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis was greater in patients with non-ECRS compared to ECRS.

Based on these findings, the researchers speculated that LPS produced by F nucleatum may be linked to the pathogenesis of both ECRS and non-ECRS. Further experiments demonstrated that LPS derived from F nucleatum suppressed the expression of ALOX15, an enzyme involved in nasal polyps and eosinophil-related inflammation.

The study concludes that disruptions in the nasal microbiome likely play a crucial role in ECRS. Understanding this could lead to the development of more effective strategies for treating CRS. The researchers believe that the microbiome may also have an impact on other allergic diseases and suggest future studies for probiotic development and lifestyle modifications to prevent chronic sinusitis.

The study revealed that individuals who received a CT screening-based diagnosis of lung cancer had an estimated 81% survival rate after 20 years. Among those diagnosed, 81% had stage I illness, and 87% of them had an 87% long-term survival rate. The study emphasized the importance of routine early screening, as only 21% of lung cancers are currently diagnosed at an early stage in the United States. Additionally, the study highlighted that symptoms mainly occur in late-stage lung cancer, making early screening crucial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for adults aged 50 to 80 with a 20-pack-year smoking history. The researchers involved in the study have been studying the effectiveness of CT screening for lung cancer detection for years, and the study builds upon their previous research.

### [COP28 aims to bolster climate action, reinforcing Paris Agreement as a global cornerstone](https://theprint.in/world/cop28-aims-to-bolster-climate-action-reinforcing-paris-agreement-as-a-global-cornerstone/1841417/)

The article discusses the impact of heatwaves that occurred in July and August of the previous year, causing widespread disruptions such as forest fires, water and food shortages, and hurricanes resulting in numerous deaths. The global momentum for addressing climate change is increasing, and world leaders will discuss effective solutions at COP28, which will be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The conference marks a turning point after the Paris Agreement (COP21) in 2015, where countries committed to limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and making efforts to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Paris Agreement focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting technology transfer and adaptation to carbon-free economies. The agreement's provisions include two review processes until 2025. It entered into force in 2016 after being signed by 195 countries and ratified by 191 out of 197 countries.

COP28 will initiate the first global stocktake of progress made in implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement, measuring countries' efforts to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United Nations emphasizes the need to recalibrate the course due to the significant increase in global temperatures. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledges the challenges faced by developing countries in responding to climate change and calls for funding support.

Air pollution's detrimental impact on health, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO issued new Air Quality Guidelines, emphasizing the need to reduce suffering and save lives through improved air quality.

Fossil fuels are identified as the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions and around 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. To address the climate challenge, emissions must be reduced by nearly half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050. The UN emphasizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, accessible, and sustainable sources of energy.

Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water, waste, and geothermal energy, are highlighted as effective alternatives to fossil fuels. While cleaner energy sources are gaining ground, fossil fuels still dominate global energy production with over 80% contribution.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address climate change, particularly in light of recent extreme weather events and their devastating consequences.

Scientists from the universities of Delaware and Wyoming have found that the layout of cities can help in reducing population exposure to future weather extremes. The design of urban landscapes, including how buildings are spread out or clustered, seems to be more important than the size of a city. The researchers investigated how changes in urban land and population will affect future populations' exposures to weather extremes by the end of the 21st century. Well-planned urban land patterns can reduce population exposures to weather extremes, regardless of the size of a city. The findings encourage researchers and practitioners to reconsider how cities are designed and built to be more resilient to climate risks. The researchers looked at urban areas across the US and predicted their growth by 2100. They analyzed how these urban land changes might affect weather extremes and the number of people potentially exposed to these events. Carefully designed urban land patterns can reduce the increase in risks caused by climate change. The researchers suggest adjusting how cities are built and renovated to consider their natural surroundings and create an integrated human-environment system.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is using its position as an oil producer and host of the upcoming United Nations climate talks to urge secretive state-run oil companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The UAE's effort, called the Global Decarbonisation Alliance, aims to have a significant impact at the COP28 negotiations in Dubai. Led by Sultan al-Jaber, head of this year's climate talks and chief of the UAE's national oil company, the initiative suggests using resources to clean up petroleum production rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels. It seeks to engage national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Colombia's Ecopetrol, which account for half of global crude production and hold 90% of the world's oil and gas reserves. While environmentalists criticize the lack of stringency and inclusion of emissions from oil and gas produced and sold, supporters hope that public and international pressure will encourage these companies to adopt eco-friendly practices. A spokesperson for COP28 confirmed that 20 companies, both national and investor-owned, have already joined the alliance. Critics also express concerns about the leadership of al-Jaber, as his role overseeing negotiations while heading Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) may lack impartiality. Nonetheless, the potential alliance of oil producers represents the first such effort to institutionalize engagement on climate emissions within the industry.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a 20% drop in net profit for the September quarter due to lower oil prices and decreased output. The company's net profit was Rs 10,216 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs 12,826 crore in the same period last year. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline in net profit for ONGC. The decline in profit is mainly attributed to lower oil prices and slightly lower oil and gas production. However, the company expects production to increase in the current quarter with the start of production from a new oilfield in the KG basin. ONGC also faced challenges such as a shutdown in Panna-Mukta for commissioning a new crude oil pipeline and disruptions caused by Cyclone Biparjoy. Despite the current decline in production, ONGC anticipates compensation with the commencement of additional production from new projects.

### [5 green flags that show your employer is serious about making you find ‘purpose’ in work](https://theprint.in/feature/5-green-flags-that-show-your-employer-is-serious-about-making-you-find-purpose-in-work/1841273/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The concept of purpose at work is important to many individuals, with 70% of respondents in a survey stating that their personal sense of purpose is defined by their work. Organizations often use the promise of purpose to attract and retain employees, offering opportunities to contribute to social or ecological causes beyond just completing tasks. However, sometimes employers fail to deliver on this promise, engaging in "purpose-washing" where they make promises but don't follow through with consistent actions.

To determine if an employer's promise of purpose is genuine, there are five green flags to look for. Firstly, the organization should dedicate resources such as time, money, training, and staff towards purpose-driven work. Secondly, they should provide well-being support to protect employees from exploitation and burnout. Thirdly, purpose should be made relevant to all roles within the organization, encouraging collaboration beyond specific departments. Fourthly, diverse representation across gender, race, occupations, and organizational levels can facilitate purpose-driven aims. Lastly, organizations should provide opportunities for employees to see the impact of their work, whether through reports, case studies, or feedback conversations.

While purpose-driven work may be justified by its benefits to the organization and bottom line, solely relying on this justification can disconnect employees from their values over time. Instead, organizations need to redefine what counts as doing business and adapt their operations accordingly. This includes giving autonomy to purpose-driven workers, aligning performance indicators and reward systems with efforts to change, and creating career paths that value and support purpose-driven projects.

Ultimately, purpose can provide meaningful work for those interested in finding solutions to social and ecological challenges. Falling victim to purpose-washing can negatively affect one's career and well-being, so it's crucial to identify companies that demonstrate commitment, authenticity, and support for purpose-driven initiatives.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a rush to extract cobalt, a crucial component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and low-carbon innovations. The country's Katanga region holds more cobalt reserves than the rest of the world combined. However, this exploitation of resources is reminiscent of King Leopold II's brutal reign, during which millions of Congolese lost their lives. Today, the harsh realities of cobalt mining involve hazardous conditions, including child labor and toxic exposure. Companies in the supply chain claim to uphold human rights standards but often fail to address these issues effectively. International coalitions, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), aim to ensure clean supply chains and eliminate child labor in cobalt mining. However, on-ground observations reveal extreme suffering and environmental devastation in the Congo due to cobalt extraction.

Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has issued a warning about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic growth. The agency's Global Economic Outlook predicts that potential disruptions in the Middle East's oil supply due to conflicts could cause oil prices to surge, leading to a significant decrease in global GDP growth and a rise in inflation. Fitch's simulations show that if oil prices reach USD 120 per barrel in 2024 and USD 100 per barrel in 2025, there could be a 0.4 percentage point reduction in world GDP growth in 2024, with a lingering 0.1 percentage point lower growth in 2025. The impact is expected to be felt across the board, with most countries experiencing longer-lasting effects on GDP levels. Inflation rates would also be elevated in 2024, with India, Turkey, and Poland being particularly affected. Fitch highlights the potential ripple effects of an oil price shock, such as tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets. The report emphasizes the intricate web of global economic interdependencies and the vulnerabilities arising from geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions.

However, he emphasizes that the outcome will depend on the performance of the teams on the day. South Africa has approached the tournament with a must-win mentality from the start, and they will continue to do so. Van der Dussen also mentions that South Africa wanted to test themselves by chasing down a total before the semifinal, as their chasing record in the tournament has been poor. They were successful in their recent match against Afghanistan, where Van der Dussen played a crucial unbeaten innings.

The Budhni constituency in Madhya Pradesh is preparing for assembly polls, with BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan facing Congress candidate Vikram Mastal.

The BJP dominates the constituency with their flags and posters, while the Congress' presence is scarce. Although the BJP has chosen not to project Chouhan as its CM face this time, they heavily rely on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity to secure victory. Mastal, known for playing Lord Hanuman in a TV serial, remains optimistic about his chances and claims that people are angry with Chouhan for not doing enough for Budhni. However, supporters of Chouhan believe he will win due to his track record and the development he has brought to the area. Chouhan's son Kartikeya is actively campaigning on his behalf, aiming for a record victory margin. Overall, Budhni seems to have a strong support base for Chouhan, although Mastal is putting up a brave fight.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.
