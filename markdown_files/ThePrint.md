### [Clinical trial in pregnant women aims to detect foetal cardiac defects](https://theprint.in/health/clinical-trial-in-pregnant-women-aims-to-detect-foetal-cardiac-defects/1841011/)

A recent study published in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatology has found a link between high levels of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in pregnant women and foetal atrioventricular block (AVB). Foetal AVB occurs when inflammation and scarring prevent electric signals from reaching the heart's ventricles, leading to lifelong pacing and potential fatality. The incidence of AVB increased with higher levels of these antibodies, particularly in women who had a previous child with AVB. The study also showed that home-based foetal heart rate monitoring can accurately diagnose conduction problems, reducing the need for repeated echocardiograms. The researchers emphasize the importance of monitoring antibody levels in pregnant women to determine the risk and need for surveillance.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Researchers have found that obinutuzumab, an antibody that targets immune cells, is effective in preserving kidney function and preventing flares in patients with lupus nephritis. The study, published in Arthritis & Rheumatology, showed that adding obinutuzumab to lupus nephritis treatment reduced the risk of mortality, decline in kidney function, or treatment failure by 60% compared to standard care. It also lowered the incidence of lupus nephritis relapses by 57% and improved kidney function. Additionally, a higher percentage of obinutuzumab-treated patients achieved complete remission of lupus nephritis without the need for as many glucocorticoids. The findings suggest that obinutuzumab may help preserve kidney survival and improve outcomes for patients with lupus nephritis.

### [South Korea: President Yoon’s war against “fake news” raises concerns over free speech](https://theprint.in/world/south-korea-president-yoons-war-against-fake-news-raises-concerns-over-free-speech/1840994/)

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.
