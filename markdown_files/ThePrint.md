As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices have declined due to the strength of the dollar, and investors are awaiting central bank meetings and U.S. inflation data for further clarity on interest rate trends. Spot gold dropped 0.2% to $1,998.89 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures remained flat at $2,014.80. The stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report has led to a reevaluation of expectations for the Federal Reserve's actions next year, which has put downward pressure on gold. The upcoming U.S. consumer price report and central bank meetings will provide more insights into the future of interest rates. Lower interest rates typically support gold prices. The outcome of these events will determine whether gold can stay above the $2,000 level. Spot silver rose slightly to $23.98 per ounce, while platinum remained steady at $915.31 and palladium fell to $941.11 per ounce.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Australia has announced plans to tighten visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers in an effort to overhaul its migration system, which the government considers to be "broken." This move is expected to reduce Australia's migrant intake by half over the next two years. The decision comes after net immigration was projected to reach a record high in 2022-23 but is now forecasted to decline to pre-COVID levels. The increase in net overseas migration in recent years has been largely driven by international students. The government's targeted reforms aim to put downward pressure on net overseas migration. The new policies include higher English test requirements for international students and the elimination of settings that allowed students to extend their stay in Australia. Additionally, a new specialist visa for highly skilled workers will be introduced with a shorter processing time of one week. These measures are intended to ensure a more sustainable level of migration for Australia.

The almost 200 nations at the U.N. climate summit, led by COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber, are grappling with the issue of whether to call for a reduction in the world's use of oil and gas. A new draft text of the hoped-for final deal is expected to be released by the COP28 presidency. The negotiations intensify as countries advocating for a phase-out of fossil fuels clash with those who see them as crucial for their economies. Some countries argue that the focus should be on reducing climate pollution rather than specifically targeting fossil fuels. Time is running out, as the summit is scheduled to end on Tuesday, and discussions are likely to continue late into Monday night. If fossil fuels are mentioned in the final deal, it would be the first time they are directly addressed in 30 years of U.N. climate talks, which the summit host, the United Arab Emirates, would consider a success. However, opponents such as OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iraq find it challenging to support such a move domestically.

### [Egyptians vote in presidential election overshadowed by Gaza war](https://theprint.in/world/egyptians-vote-in-presidential-election-overshadowed-by-gaza-war/1880576/)

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Egyptians have started voting in a presidential election that is expected to give Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a third term in power. The country is facing economic challenges and a conflict on its border with Gaza. If Sisi wins, his immediate priorities would be addressing inflation, managing the foreign currency shortage, and preventing spillover from the Israel-Gaza conflict. Voting will take place over three days, and results will be announced on December 18. Critics view the election as a sham due to a crackdown on dissent. Sisi led the ousting of Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2013 and has since overseen a crackdown on activists. Despite economic pressures, some voters support Sisi for providing security and stability. The election campaign has been low-key, and some analysts believe it was brought forward to implement economic changes. The International Monetary Fund is in talks with Egypt for additional financing.

Johan Floderus, a Swedish national employed by the European Union, is facing charges in Iran for allegedly spying for Israel and being involved in 'corruption on earth'.

His family has claimed that he was detained without any valid reason or proper legal process. Human rights groups and Western governments have criticized Iran for using arrests on security charges to extract political concessions, while Tehran maintains that such arrests are made in accordance with its criminal code and denies any political motives. Tensions between Sweden and Iran have been high since Sweden arrested a former Iranian official in 2019 for his role in the mass execution and torture of political prisoners during the 1980s.

The European Union's plan to impose a tax on carbon pollution emitted during the production of goods imported from countries like India and China has sparked a debate at the United Nations climate conference in Dubai. The tax, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aims to set a price on carbon emissions associated with energy-intensive products. The EU argues that this creates a level playing field for domestically-manufactured goods and reduces emissions from imports. However, developing countries are concerned that the tax will harm their economies and make trading with the EU too expensive. The EU sees CBAM as crucial for funding and achieving its climate goal of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. A recent study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development found that a carbon tax of $44 per tonne could cut pollution from the supply chain in half. However, it also estimated that poorer countries could lose up to $5.9 billion, while rich countries could make $2.5 billion from the tax. India's government strongly opposes the idea of a carbon tax, although some experts believe that it could have a positive impact in the long run by reducing emissions.

The Christmas pudding has a rich global history, influenced by the British Empire and enjoyed in various parts of the world. It originated from two older dishes, "plum pottage" and "figgy pudding," which were made with a mixture of meats, dried fruits, and spices. Over time, these dishes evolved into the more familiar plum pudding, incorporating ingredients from the British Empire such as French brandy, raisins from the Mediterranean, and citrus from the Caribbean. The Victorians further popularized it as the "Christmas pudding," and it became a centerpiece of the holiday season. The socioeconomic accessibility of the pudding, with affordable ingredients like candied citrus peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and raisins, contributed to its lasting appeal. Versions of Christmas pudding also spread across the British Empire, including in Australia and India. Even after decolonization, the tradition of Christmas pudding continues in various forms and adaptations.

Hmm, based on the provided text, I can tell you that the study mentioned in the article focuses on identifying diets that are effective in lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. It highlights that plant-based diets like the Mediterranean diet and traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Indian cuisines have shown to reduce the risk compared to the Western diet. The study also mentions that certain foods, such as saturated fats, red meat, processed meats, and ultra-processed foods high in sugar and refined grains, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, foods like green leafy vegetables, colorful fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, omega-3 fatty acids, and whole grains are considered protective against Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the study suggests that poverty and the consumption of meat and ultra-processed foods contribute to the rising trend of obesity, which is believed to be a driving force behind dementia.

The Prambanan temple in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is a testament to the deep-rooted cultural and historical ties between India and Southeast Asia. It is a large compound consisting of 240 Hindu temples and is considered Indonesia's largest Hindu temple.

The restoration work is challenging due to the complex structure and the limitations imposed by UNESCO heritage site rules. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu deities Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The Prambanan temple, along with the nearby Borobudur Temple, attracts a significant number of tourists, although Yogyakarta remains relatively unexplored by Indian tourists.

The researchers found the hind legs of two baby dinosaurs in the tyrannosaur's stomach, marking the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered. The tyrannosaur in question was a young Gorgosaurus libratus, weighing about 772 pounds and measuring 13 feet in length at the time of its death. It appears that the tyrannosaur had a preference for the hind limbs of its prey, as only the hind legs of the baby dinosaurs were found in its stomach. The baby dinosaurs belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and were younger than 1-year-old. This discovery provides valuable insights into the feeding behavior of tyrannosaurs during the late Cretaceous period.

Mata ni pachedi is a form of traditional cloth-painting associated with the Vaghri community in western India. It originated around three hundred years ago as a way for the non-dominant caste members to create their own shrines for worship since they were not allowed to enter temples. These paintings depict Hindu goddesses and are narrative in style, showcasing events from mythological texts, epics, religious processions, and historical themes. The paintings are made on rectangular fabric divided into columns, creating a grid for the narrative. Natural colors such as red and black were traditionally used, but now artificial colors are also used. Mata ni pachedi has expanded beyond its ritual aspect and is now used to create decorative consumer goods.

Hmm, visiting a museum can indeed have positive effects on your health. The Association des Médecins francophones du Canada launched a program where patients could receive a doctor's prescription to visit a museum, aiming to promote recovery and well-being for those with chronic illnesses, neurological conditions, cognitive disorders, or mental health problems. While the specific effects of art exposure on health are still being studied, research suggests that regular visits to cultural venues like museums can lower the risk of dementia, depression, and age-related decline in health. Contact with artwork has been shown to potentially lower blood pressure, heart rate, and stress levels. However, it's important to note that the effects may vary depending on the individual and the specific museum experience. So, going to a museum can be a great way to have a pleasant day and potentially contribute to your overall well-being.

This framework aims to make regenerative farming financially viable and scalable. The task force includes companies like Mars, McCain Foods, McDonald's, Mondelez International, PepsiCo, and Waitrose. They are exploring implementation projects in India, the UK, and the US, and are calling for policy changes to support regenerative farming. The global food system currently contributes to GHG emissions and nature loss, so embracing regenerative farming could help address these issues. The task force proposes a four-lever framework, including new funding and sourcing models, common metrics, government policy changes, and creating new revenue streams for farmers. They are also exploring farming projects in different countries to prove the concept. The full plan can be viewed on the Agribusiness Task Force webpage.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank implemented a comprehensive strategy in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) region. They allocated funds for emergency operations, trained medical staff, and strengthened national public health systems. The approach involved reallocating project resources, activating emergency components, and utilizing Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options (CAT DDOs) tailored to each country's situation. The World Bank committed USD 1.9 billion to 18 COVID-19 health response projects in the EAP region. Notable achievements include vaccine distribution in the Philippines and Mongolia, high vaccination rates in Laos, and timely COVID-19 testing. The pandemic had significant economic impacts, pushing more people into poverty and affecting sales, employment, and productivity, particularly for small and medium enterprises. The World Bank responded by deploying over USD 157 billion globally, with a focus on addressing economic, social, and poverty impacts in the EAP region. Collaborations with partners such as COVAX, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), and World Health Organization (WHO) facilitated project preparation and vaccine financing. The EAP Economic Update in April 2023 indicates positive economic recovery in major EAP economies. The World Bank's Evolution Roadmap prioritizes addressing poverty, economic distress, climate change, and pandemics.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is set to launch its Climate Action Catalyst Fund (CACF) on January 1, 2024. The CACF aims to mobilize innovative carbon finance by acquiring carbon credits to encourage investments in transformative mitigation actions in ADB's developing member countries. Unlike traditional carbon market practices, the CACF will provide upfront finance for high-impact climate mitigation actions, ensuring future delivery of carbon credits through long-term transactions. This approach accelerates the decarbonization of economies in Asia and the Pacific. The CACF enables cooperative approaches among nations under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, allowing the transfer of carbon emissions reductions achieved through climate mitigation measures from one country to count towards the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of another. The Swedish Energy Agency has committed to contributing 300 million Swedish krona to the fund, aiming to mobilize over USD 100 million in commitments from various entities. The CACF prioritizes high-quality climate mitigation actions, advanced low-carbon technologies, and sustainable development impacts for local communities in Asia and the Pacific. The launch of the CACF solidifies ADB's role in operationalizing international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

Hmm, it seems like you're looking for a summary of the article about the World Bank's program to address air pollution in India. The program aims to tackle the impact of ambient particulate matter (PM)2.5 pollution, which poses severe health risks to the population. The World Bank's efforts include introducing airshed management tools, developing State-wide Air Quality Action Plans, and creating a Regional Airshed Action Plan for the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The article highlights the alarming levels of PM2.5 pollution in India and its detrimental effects on public health and the economy. The World Bank emphasizes the need for coordinated efforts at the sub-national level and regional cooperation to effectively address air pollution. India has already taken steps to combat air pollution, such as revising air quality standards and promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) sets goals to improve air quality, particularly in cities where pollution standards are not met. The World Bank's involvement in India's Air Quality Management (AQM) is part of a phased strategy, leveraging insights from similar projects in Mexico and China. The focus is on the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain, where pollution intensity is high. The article also mentions the importance of integrating air quality management into government capabilities, business practices, and individual behavior. The World Bank's goal is to reduce air pollution within a generation by implementing successful strategies from other countries. Overall, the World Bank's comprehensive approach aligns with India's commitment to cleaner air and sustainable development.

Hmm, based on the provided text, I can summarize the article for you. The Finnish Twins Cohort Study found that while people who exercise more tend to live longer on average, the direct effect of "leisure time physical activity" on lifespan is not significant. Factors such as genetics, diet, disabilities, education, and wealth may also influence lifespan. The study analyzed data from 11,000 pairs of adult same-sex twins and found that the most active group had a 24% lower death rate compared to the least active group. However, when considering other factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index, the link between exercise and longevity was reduced. The study suggests that exercise may have a smaller role in lifespan than previously thought, but it still has benefits in preventing illness, improving mood, and enhancing overall quality of life.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. President Joe Biden began a fundraising trip in California, where he mocked Donald Trump for claiming he would be a dictator on his first day in office if he were to become president again. Biden referred to Trump as a threat to democracy and did not mention his son's recent criminal charges during the fundraiser. California has traditionally been a significant source of funding for Democrats, and the end of labor strikes in the entertainment industry has unlocked pent-up dollars for fundraising. Biden is expected to participate in fundraisers with notable figures such as Steven Spielberg, Rob Reiner, Barbra Streisand, and Lenny Kravitz. The fundraisers in California and Boston are projected to raise at least $15 million, with a total fourth-quarter haul of around $67 million. Biden also made an announcement in Las Vegas regarding funding for new passenger rail projects. These projects, funded by the infrastructure law, include the nation's first high-speed rail line in California and a high-speed rail corridor between Las Vegas and Southern California. Biden has been traveling across the country to announce new funding tied to his legislative initiatives, aiming to boost his poll ratings and demonstrate his ability to lead the U.S. economy. However, recent public opinion polls suggest limited success in these efforts.

This is not the first camp organized by Jaipur Foot US, as they have previously provided free prostheses to hundreds of differently-abled people in the North East. The parent non-profit organization, Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS), has actively participated in the "India for Humanity" initiative of the Ministry of External Affairs, helping over 2 million differently-abled people globally through international camps. The artificial limbs, known as Jaipur Foot, are provided at a minimal cost to the organization, and the beneficiaries are not charged.

A French court has convicted six teenagers in connection with the beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty in 2020. Paty had shown caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, which caused controversy among some Muslim parents. One of the teenagers falsely accused Paty of asking Muslim students to leave the room before showing the caricatures, but it was proved that she was not present during the class. The other adolescents were found guilty of being part of a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping prepare the attack. Paty was killed by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was subsequently shot dead by the police. The court also found the convicted teenagers guilty of pointing out Paty to the murderer. The heaviest sentence given was six months in prison for one of the adolescents.

According to a post by X CEO Linda Yaccarino on a social media platform, over 10 million people have signed up for X in December. However, the company, previously known as Twitter, is facing a potential loss of up to $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as several major brands have paused their marketing campaigns on the platform. The New York Times reported on this risk. X, which does not regularly disclose user data, has not commented on how the December sign-ups compare to the average or why Yaccarino shared this figure. In July, X's billionaire owner Elon Musk stated that the site had 540 million monthly users.

In November, various companies such as Apple, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Comcast, Lions Gate Entertainment, Paramount Global, and IBM announced that they were halting their advertisements on X. This decision came after Musk faced controversy for agreeing with a user who made false claims about Jewish people inciting hatred against white people. Additionally, a watchdog group called Media Matters discovered ads from major companies appearing next to X posts supporting Nazism. X subsequently filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing them of defamation.

This break surpassed the previous record of 142, set by Mark Allen in 2011. Murphy expressed his excitement and joy, stating that he loves the event and wanted to make a century break.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The Japanese yen experienced a significant surge against the US dollar after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda hinted at a possible shift away from the ultra-low interest rate plan. This speculation arose as Ueda mentioned that policy management would become more challenging in the coming year. The Bank of Japan is the only central bank that has not started tightening its policy, while other central banks like the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are either nearing or at the end of their rate hike cycles. In the US, stocks climbed, led by communication services stocks, and the labor market data showed a slight increase in weekly jobless claims. The focus now turns to the upcoming government payrolls report. European shares closed lower, and global stocks experienced their first advance after three consecutive declines. US Treasury yields remained relatively unchanged, and expectations for a US rate cut in March have increased. Oil prices settled at a six-month low due to concerns about sluggish energy demand in the US and China.

Asian equities attracted significant foreign investment in November, indicating the potential for continued inflows in the coming year. The decrease in U.S. Treasury yields and growing optimism for Federal Reserve rate cuts contributed to this trend. Data from stock exchanges across several Asian countries showed that foreign investors purchased a net $11.16 billion worth of stocks last month, the highest since May. Cooler U.S. inflation and dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials led to notable declines in U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar. This has sparked interest among foreign investors who may have a greater appetite for emerging market assets with lower USD interest rates and a weaker USD. Asian equities have experienced a significant turnaround, receiving a net inflow of $14.03 billion this year, compared to net selling of approximately $57.52 billion in 2022. Taiwanese stocks saw the highest foreign inflows since at least 2008, while South Korean and Indian equities also attracted substantial investments. However, Philippine stocks witnessed only slight inflows after three months of outflows, while Thai and Vietnamese shares experienced outflows.

Universal Pictures' film "Oppenheimer," directed by Christopher Nolan, is set to debut in Japan in 2024, according to local distributor Bitters End. The release had faced uncertainty due to criticism that the movie downplays the devastation caused by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Despite the controversy, the biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the pioneer of atomic bombs, has achieved tremendous global success with over $950 million in box office earnings since its July premiere. The film is also expected to be a strong contender for various film awards. In addition to the controversy surrounding its content, the movie faced backlash for its marketing campaign, which unintentionally linked it to the blockbuster film "Barbie." Fan-produced images featuring the stars of both films alongside nuclear blasts caused offense among many Japanese viewers. Warner Bros., the distributor of "Barbie," issued an apology in response to the backlash. The atomic bombings, which occurred toward the end of World War Two, led to over 200,000 deaths.

GameStop, the video game retailer, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter as competition increased and consumer spending decreased. The company's shift towards an online-focused model was hindered by economic uncertainty and inflation. GameStop's shares fell by nearly 3% in extended trading following the announcement. The results mark the first quarter since Ryan Cohen became GameStop's CEO and chairman. Despite the sales decline, the company managed to achieve breakeven earnings per share and reduced expenses by almost 24%. Analysts believe that GameStop will continue to face challenges and market share losses from mass merchants and e-commerce giants like Amazon.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is visiting Athens with a delegation of ministers for meetings with Greek counterparts in the hopes of improving relations between the two countries. Greece and Turkey have been at odds for years over various issues, including territorial boundaries, energy resources, Cyprus, and defence matters. Although tensions have eased recently, little progress is expected on these longstanding bilateral issues. The leaders will focus on areas of mutual benefit such as the economy, health, education, agriculture, migration, and tourism. Greece is also planning to allow Turkish citizens to apply for a seven-day tourist visa for certain islands close to the Turkish coast as a gesture of goodwill. Both countries want to demonstrate their willingness to mend ties, with Turkey seeking EU membership and Greece aiming to regain stability in the changing geopolitical landscape. Despite the positive rhetoric, some officials believe that little progress will be made on the thorny issues between the two nations.

Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, made a speech to supporters last year, vowing to strike Israel with fighters and rockets. His words turned out to be more than mere rhetoric when Hamas fighters breached Gaza's fence, resulting in the death of around 1,200 people and the taking of over 200 hostages. The attack, known as the "flood of Al-Aqsa," targeted the mosque in Jerusalem and was planned by Sinwar and Hamas' military leader, Mohammed Deif. Sinwar, who spent 23 years imprisoned by Israel before rising to a leadership role in Hamas, is now leading negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps and directing military operations. He has a personal motivation to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Israel considers him and other Hamas leaders to be "living on borrowed time" and is unlikely to end the conflict until Sinwar is captured or killed. Sinwar is described as devoted to Hamas and willing to endure great suffering for his cause.

Britain's Immigration Minister, Robert Jenrick, has resigned from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Cabinet due to disagreements over the government's policy of deporting illegal migrants to Rwanda. Jenrick expressed his belief that the emergency legislation presented by Home Secretary James Cleverly did not go far enough to address the issue. He argued for a clear piece of legislation that would limit legal challenges to the government's immigration policy. Sunak responded by stating that the proposed bill would be the toughest ever introduced by the UK government. The move is seen as a setback for Sunak as he prepares for the 2024 general election. The opposition Labour Party criticized the Conservatives for presiding over a "chaotic" government. The Safety of Rwanda Bill will be tabled in the House of Commons, aiming to control the borders and deter dangerous journeys across the English Channel.

Israeli troops have intensified their offensive into southern Gaza, leading to tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians seeking refuge in the city of Rafah near the Egyptian border. However, fears remain as options for refuge dwindle and the Israeli bombardment continues. At least nine people were killed in an Israeli shelling incident in Rafah. This latest exodus adds to the already large number of displaced Palestinians who have fled from northern Gaza to the south during the two-month-long conflict between Israel and Hamas. The displaced Palestinians are now trapped near the fortified Egyptian border, despite Israel's claims of safety in the area. Israeli forces have entered Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, for the first time, targeting Hamas' military and administrative rule. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that they are encircling the house of Hamas leader Yahya Al-Sinwar. Fierce combat has been reported, with Israeli bombings intensifying overnight and tanks battling Palestinian militants in various areas. The humanitarian crisis worsens as hundreds of thousands of homeless people desperately seek shelter in the diminishing safe areas designated by Israel. The situation has caused a lack of tents, hindering aid distribution. Amid the conflict, Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with dead and wounded, and supplies are running out. Both sides are accused of committing serious rights violations, prompting calls for immediate humanitarian ceasefires from world leaders and a resolution at the United Nations Security Council.

The general secretary of the Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisation (FABO) UK, Pankaj Shamkunwar, praised Dr BR Ambedkar as a progressive thinker and emphasized his contributions to Indian democracy. He highlighted that the Constitution, which forms the foundation of Indian democracy, guarantees fundamental rights and principles based on equality, fraternity, and freedom. According to Shamkunwar, Dr Ambedkar's major contribution lies in women's empowerment and education, noting that Dalit women are now competing on par with other women in the country. These remarks were made during a memorial event organized by the Indian High Commission in the UK to commemorate Babasaheb Dr BR Ambedkar's 68th Parinirvan Divas.

Acting High Commissioner to India in the UK, Sujit Ghosh, acknowledged Ambedkar's commitment to liberty, equality, and fraternity, which laid the foundation for democratic India. He stated that Dr Ambedkar played a crucial role as a visionary leader, social reformer, and principal architect of the Indian Constitution. Ghosh mentioned that Ambedkar's focus on justice and dedication to these principles guided the framing of the Constitution, aiming to dismantle social hierarchies. He also commended Ambedkar's recognition of education as a powerful equalizer, breaking caste barriers and fostering self-worth among marginalized communities.

Dr BR Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, and was an Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer. He fought against social discrimination towards Dalits and advocated for women's and workers' rights. Considered the architect of the Indian constitution, Ambedkar passed away on December 6, 1956. In addition to his legal and political pursuits, he earned doctorates in economics from Columbia University and the University of London. Ambedkar led a satyagraha in Mahad in 1956, advocating for the rights of the untouchable community to access the main water tank of the town. The 'Poona Pact' agreement, signed on September 25, 1932, between Ambedkar and Madan Mohan Malaviya, secured increased legislative representation for the depressed class.

Ambedkar was one of the seven members on the committee responsible for drafting the Indian Constitution after independence. In 1990, he posthumously received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor.

### [GameStop misses revenue estimates on faltering videogame demand](https://theprint.in/tech/gamestop-misses-revenue-estimates-on-faltering-videogame-demand/1875408/)

GameStop, a videogame retailer, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter due to reduced consumer spending in an uncertain economy. The company's shift towards an online-focused business model was hampered by sticky inflation and high borrowing costs, which resulted in uneven spending in the gaming industry. Despite the revenue miss, GameStop managed to post adjusted breakeven earnings per share, surpassing analysts' estimates of a loss. Ryan Cohen, the top investor who joined as CEO and chairman in September, has adjusted the company's strategy, relying more on physical stores for customers to pick up online orders. GameStop's revenue for the quarter was $1.08 billion, falling short of the estimated $1.18 billion. The company's stock price dropped nearly 1% in after-hours trading.

Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has granted loading windows this month to two vessels destined for India, under spot deals for crude oil with Italy's ENI and U.S.-based Chevron. This follows a temporary relief of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. Indian refiners such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corp, and HPCL-Mittal Energy (HMEL) have been actively seeking Venezuelan crude cargoes since the sanctions were eased in October. Some refiners have made purchase agreements with trading houses that have access to Venezuelan oil, while others are planning to buy directly from PDVSA's partners.

Ukraine's Defense Minister, Rustem Umerov, met with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon to discuss Ukraine's strategic goals and long-term vision for its military. The Biden administration has been warning Congress that it is running out of time and money to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. In October, the administration requested nearly $106 billion from Congress, but the package was rejected by Republican lawmakers who control the House. Despite this setback, Austin announced an additional aid package for Ukraine, including air defense munitions. The US has been meeting with industry leaders to find ways to support Ukraine's military, which has depleted its artillery fighting Russian forces faster than its Western allies can provide assistance. President Biden warned that a victory for Russia over Ukraine would leave Moscow in a position to attack NATO allies. While Congress has approved over $110 billion for Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022, no additional funds have been approved since Republicans took over the House in January. The postponement of US assistance being debated in Congress was described by Ukraine's chief of staff as a "big risk" that could lead to Ukraine losing the war.

The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched ballistic missiles over the Red Sea, which were intercepted and shot down by Israel's Arrow air defense system. The missiles did not enter Israeli airspace or pose a threat to civilians. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they targeted military sites in the Eilat area. This is not the first time the Houthis have fired missiles at Eilat during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israel has successfully intercepted four ballistic missiles and used fighter jets to neutralize cruise missiles and drones launched by the Houthis. The Houthis, supported by Iran, are part of the "axis of resistance" against Israel, together with Hamas. They have expressed support for the Palestinians and issued threats against Israel. Iran has warned that Israel could face broader threats if it continues its war against Gaza. In a separate incident, Houthi-fired ballistic missiles struck three commercial ships in the Red Sea, and US warships shot down three drones in self-defense during the attack.

The Coast Guard continues to investigate the sheen and has not identified any damage or leaks after surveying the pipelines.

The United States has determined that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing have been committed by warring parties in Sudan, specifically the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The conflict, which began in April, has resulted in the displacement of over 6.5 million people, over 10,000 deaths, and severe economic devastation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for an end to the conflict and for those responsible for atrocities to be held accountable. The RSF has been accused of leading ethnic massacres, looting, rape, and imprisonment of civilians, while the army has conducted intense air and artillery strikes on residential areas. The determination made by the United States does not automatically lead to punitive actions, but it emphasizes the need to address the ongoing crisis. The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions related to the conflict but has not directly targeted the army and RSF. However, Blinken stated that future determinations are possible as more information becomes available.

The Group of Seven (G7) countries have announced a direct ban on Russian diamonds starting from January 1, with phased-in restrictions on indirect imports from around March 1. The G7 plans to implement a traceability-based verification and certification mechanism for rough diamonds within the group by September 1, 2024. However, the ban excludes diamonds for industrial use, and there is no mention of tracing polished stones or specifying carat size. Belgium, which houses the world's main diamond hub in Antwerp, has expressed satisfaction with the G7's adoption of the central principles of its proposal. The announcement is seen as an opportunity for Antwerp's diamond sector to further develop into a center for "clean" diamonds.

U.S. President Joe Biden and the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries held a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where they expressed solidarity and agreed on a new ban on Russian diamonds. The ban will prohibit non-industrial diamonds from Russia by January and Russian diamonds sold by third countries from March. Additionally, the leaders discussed tightening controls on Russia's use of the international financial system and imposing more sanctions to enforce a price cap on Russian oil. In the meeting, Zelenskiy called for continued support for Ukraine, stressing the importance of maintaining consolidation, interaction, and support for those whose freedom is under attack. The G7 members had previously pledged in May to restrict exports to Russia that could fund its war effort in Ukraine. The impact of the $60 price cap on Russian crude oil implemented by Western nations has diminished, prompting them to explore ways to strengthen implementation.

The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has commended the Manipur government's decision to lift the long-standing ban on liquor, citing positive effects on tax revenues and the fight against illegal alcohol and drug-related issues. CIABC's Director General, Vinod Giri, urged Bihar to follow a similar path, emphasizing potential economic growth, prevention of hooch tragedies, and generation of substantial revenues amounting to Rs 10,000 crore per year. Giri highlighted that lifting the prohibition in Manipur would boost state revenues, curb the illegal liquor trade, and address social challenges. He called on the Bihar government to reconsider its prohibition policy, which has negatively impacted development, led to hooch-related deaths, and fostered the growth of illicit liquor. Giri suggested responsible lifting of prohibition, such as employing women in liquor factories for economic empowerment and implementing a special cess on liquor sales to fund de-addiction and rehabilitation centers. He dismissed proposed door-to-door surveys on prohibition and pointed out that other states like Haryana, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh have experienced unsuccessful bans. Giri advocated for a pragmatic approach like Gujarat's, which permits alcohol sales to non-domiciles and exempts Special Economic Zones from the ban. The CIABC represents the interests of the Indian Alcoholic Beverage Industry, promoting responsible practices and advocating for a balanced approach to liquor regulations.

Negotiations on the European Union's first-ever regulations for artificial intelligence (AI) are reaching a critical stage. The outcome of these discussions could serve as a model for other governments crafting their own AI rules. The main challenge lies in accommodating technologies like ChatGPT, which was not considered when the initial draft of the law was created. ChatGPT's versatility and generative capabilities have sparked debates on how it should be regulated. Proposals include documenting the training data and capabilities of AI systems, mitigating potential risks, and allowing external audits. France, Germany, and Italy argue for self-regulation to compete with dominant U.S. companies. Additionally, there is disagreement about the use of AI by law enforcement agencies, with EU lawmakers seeking to protect citizens' rights while member states want flexibility for national security purposes. A final agreement on the legislation could be reached soon or lead to provisional agreements pending further technical meetings.

Israeli troops engaged in intense battles with Hamas in the city of Khan Younis, causing Palestinian civilians who were already displaced from the north to search for refuge elsewhere. Israeli warplanes also conducted heavy bombardments across Gaza in an effort to eliminate Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that they were encircling the house of Yahya Al-Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, and it was only a matter of time before they capture him. As the ground offensive expanded into southern Gaza, hospitals became overwhelmed with dead and wounded, and supplies were running low. The article mentions the killing of Palestinians in Rafah and the increasing difficulty for the displaced population to find safe areas. Both sides are accused of committing serious rights violations. Israel claims it tries to avoid civilian casualties, while Hamas denies using civilian buildings for cover. The article also notes the use of improvised explosive devices by Hamas fighters. The death toll in Gaza since the start of the conflict is disputed, and Israel reported 85 soldiers killed. Israel has been informing civilians in advance to evacuate areas where it plans to operate. The United States urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and minimize harm to civilians.

Italy has officially withdrawn from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) after four years of participation. The decision was communicated to Beijing three days before it was reported by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. Italy became the first major Western country to join the BRI in 2019, despite concerns from the US about China's influence over critical infrastructure and technology. The withdrawal was carried out through the cancellation of the agreement by the Italian government, which was accompanied by promises of strategic friendship. Both countries chose not to make public statements about the cancellation. Financial difficulties faced by the BRI project may have contributed to Italy's decision. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had previously expressed her intention to leave the BRI, citing a lack of significant benefits for Italy. This decision does not compromise relations with China, according to Meloni.

As a close friend and development partner, India provided relief assistance to support the country's efforts in relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.

The British government has promised to prevent a recurrence of the injustices suffered by the families of the 97 victims of the Hillsborough crush in 1989, but has rejected calls for new legislation. The tragedy occurred when Liverpool fans were overcrowded in a fenced-in enclosure at the Hillsborough soccer ground during an FA Cup semi-final. Initially, the police blamed the supporters themselves, but an inquest in 2016 concluded that the fans were unlawfully killed and that the police were to blame. A government-commissioned report called for a charter for bereaved families, and the government has now signed the "Hillsborough Charter" to provide better support to such families in the event of disasters. However, campaigners for a "Hillsborough Law" argue that the measures do not go far enough and lack the families' support.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah criticized India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for the ongoing dispute in Kashmir, claiming that two of Nehru's decisions were "historic blunders." Shah mentioned a letter from Nehru to Sheikh Abdullah where he admitted that he felt the decisions to escalate the issue to the United Nations and agree to a ceasefire with Pakistan in 1948 were mistakes. The Bills discussed in the Lok Sabha were later passed, but the Opposition briefly walked out after Shah's remarks. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill aims to increase the number of seats in the legislative assembly and provide representation for various groups. The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill provides quotas for jobs and education. Shah also argued that Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was at the "root of terrorism" and presented statistics indicating a decline in terror incidents after its abrogation. He further criticized Nehru, suggesting that delaying the 1948 ceasefire by three days could have resulted in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir being part of India.

The sugar output in Maharashtra is expected to be low due to below-average rainfall in sugarcane-growing areas this year. Despite this, the mills are focused on producing sugar rather than diverting the crop for ethanol production. The decision was made during a meeting with stakeholders, as sugar prices are currently high. The sugar commissionerate had previously estimated that 1,022 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane would be available for crushing in the next season, with 103.58 lakh metric tonnes of sugar to be produced. It also suggested that 15 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane could be diverted for ethanol production. The reduced sugarcane production may result in a shorter sugar production season.

Risks associated with the rapid development of AI have become a key concern for policymakers worldwide. Although there is a general consensus on the need for AI regulation, a global plan for oversight is still in progress. Edwards cautioned that firms should use AI carefully to avoid alienating the public, as a lack of trust in AI could hinder its adoption and limit societal benefits and innovation.

The Punjab Universities Laws (Amendment) Bill intends to replace the governor with the chief minister as the chancellor of state-run universities. The Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill aims to establish an independent mechanism for selecting and appointing suitable candidates for the director general of police position.

SEBI has observed numerous cases of regulatory violations by AIFs, including avoiding recognition of non-performing assets. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shares these concerns. SEBI is currently investigating cases involving AIF misuse amounting to 150 billion to 200 billion rupees ($1.8 billion to $2.4 billion) and plans to enforce a code of conduct to prevent such practices. They have also proposed that all AIF liabilities and assets be held in dematerialized form for increased transparency.

India's overnight index swap (OIS) market is indicating that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will not rush to cut interest rates, even if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts lowering rates early next year. The odds of the Fed's first rate cut in March have increased to 63%, while the RBI is expected to keep rates unchanged until mid-2024. This is reflected in India's OIS rates, which have only dropped modestly over the past six weeks. Market participants anticipate shallow rate cuts by the RBI due to strong economic growth and the need to control inflation. Inflation concerns are resurfacing in India, with retail inflation expected to exceed the RBI's tolerance limit. As a result, there is no room for the RBI to suggest any dovishness, and swap markets have not altered their rate cut expectations.

Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio is planning to spin off its battery manufacturing unit in a bid to reduce costs and improve efficiency, according to anonymous sources. Led by experienced engineers from Apple and Panasonic, the nascent battery unit will seek external investors and could be spun off by the end of the year. Nio intends to continue in-house research and development on batteries but plans to outsource all manufacturing. The company currently purchases batteries from CATL and CALB Group. The spin-off aligns with Nio's strategy to turn profitable sooner, as it aims to develop and manufacture some batteries internally while outsourcing production to other suppliers. This move will involve the transfer of top engineers to the new firm and the merging of some staff into other departments. Nio hired these engineers to facilitate mass production of large cylindrical cells similar to Tesla's 4680 at a planned plant in China's Anhui province. The assets to be spun off may include the planned plant, testing equipment, and intellectual property. Nio reported a loss of $637.06 million in Q3 and aims to improve profitability over the next three years by deferring its plan to bring battery production in-house. The company has also undertaken measures to reduce costs, including trimming its workforce and deferring long-term investments. Nio is expanding abroad and considering building a dealer network in Europe to accelerate sales growth.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced his authorization for oil exploration in a disputed area with Guyana, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) barring Venezuela from changing the status quo in the region. Maduro's decision follows a referendum where voters rejected the ICJ's jurisdiction over the dispute and supported creating a new state in the territory. State oil company PDVSA and state iron and steel maker CVG will establish divisions for the contested region. In response, Guyana plans to report Maduro's actions to the United Nations and the ICJ, calling Venezuela an "outlaw nation." The maritime border between the two countries is also under dispute. Exxon Mobil has been producing oil off Guyana's coast since 2019, and Guyana recently received bids for new exploration licenses. Despite the tensions, Guyana's president reassured investors that their investments are secure, with support from international partners and the community. Analysts suggest that Maduro's move may be aimed at gauging his government's support ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Santiago Bausili, an Argentine economist and ally of the incoming Economy Minister Luis Caputo, is expected to become the governor of Argentina's central bank under President-elect Javier Milei. Bausili previously held roles in the finance sector under Mauricio Macri's administration and worked for Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan. His appointment could help moderate Milei's libertarian proposals. Milei had initially favored Emilio Ocampo as his dollarization adviser, but has since shifted towards a more pragmatic approach focused on reducing the fiscal deficit. Milei's team did not respond to a request for comment on Bausili.

### [Rupee to gauge dollar’s recovery even as economic data drives US yields lower](https://theprint.in/india/rupee-to-gauge-dollars-recovery-even-as-economic-data-drives-us-yields-lower/1873909/)

The Indian rupee is expected to open unchanged amid a rebound in the US dollar, despite a decline in US Treasury yields due to lower-than-expected job openings in October. Non-deliverable forwards suggest the rupee will open around 83.36-83.37. The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped to 4.16% after data showed job openings at their lowest level in over two and a half years. Weakness in the data led to speculation that the US Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as March. The rupee's movement is currently influenced by speculation about the Reserve Bank of India's response rather than economic fundamentals. The RBI likely sold US dollars on Tuesday to limit the rupee's decline. Despite increased equity inflows, the rupee has been unable to strengthen. The dollar index has ticked up to 103.97, recovering after a recent sharp fall, driven by dovish comments from a European Central Bank official and safe-haven demand amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. Investors are awaiting further information on the US labor market from jobless claims data and the non-farm payrolls report.

Israel's military launched a fierce assault on the main city in southern Gaza, marking the most intense combat since its ground invasion began to eliminate Hamas five weeks ago. The US urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties. Israeli forces, supported by warplanes, reached the heart of Khan Younis and surrounded the city, engaging in violent clashes with Hamas fighters. The battles were the most intense since the collapse of the truce between Israel and Hamas. Hamas claimed to have killed or wounded eight Israeli troops and destroyed 24 military vehicles, while the Israeli military reported two troop deaths and 83 since the start of the ground operation. Gaza health officials said many civilians were killed in an Israeli strike, but the exact toll could not be confirmed. Israel initiated its campaign in response to an attack by Hamas fighters on Israeli towns, resulting in numerous casualties and hostages. The US continued to pressure Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and reduce harm to civilians. President Joe Biden accused Hamas of rape and mutilation during their assault on Israel, which Hamas denounced as false accusations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mentioned claims of sexual assault in a meeting with families of returned hostages. Hostage releases have stalled, with Hamas refusing further releases until Israel's aggression stops. Additionally, the US imposed visa bans on individuals involved in violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant condemned settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.

The NAO assessed the country's resilience against four extreme weather risks - droughts, surface water flooding, storms, and high temperatures - and found that more needs to be done to prepare for and develop resilience to such events. The report urges the government to increase its focus on reducing these risks and making the system more resilient. It also calls for accelerated investment in climate and wider resilience, with implementation by 2028 instead of the current target of 2030. The absence of an effective strategy and targets makes it difficult for the government to make informed decisions on investment.

### [Motor racing-FIA compliance probe kicks up a storm in F1](https://theprint.in/sport/motor-racing-fia-compliance-probe-kicks-up-a-storm-in-f1/1873836/)

Formula One's governing body, the FIA, has launched a compliance probe following reports that a team boss received confidential information from an employee of the commercial rights holder. While the principal was not named, media outlets identified him as Mercedes' Toto Wolff, whose wife Susie leads the all-female F1 Academy. The FIA stated that its compliance department is investigating the matter, which drew a strong response from Mercedes and Susie Wolff. They rejected the allegations and expressed surprise that they learned about the investigation through a media statement rather than direct communication from the FIA. Formula One's owners, Liberty Media, also expressed confidence in their team and claimed that no unauthorized disclosure had been made to a team principal. Reports suggest that conflict of interest concerns were raised by some team bosses last year when Shaila Ann-Rao, who had previously worked as an adviser to Wolff, was appointed as the FIA's interim head of Formula One.

Sexual assaults in the Canadian military have seen a significant increase in 2022 compared to 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Around 1,960 members of the military, or 3.5% of the total, reported being sexually assaulted by fellow armed forces personnel, up from 1.6% in 2018. The majority of complaints (75%) were made by women. The military has faced longstanding pressure regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by senior officers. A survey conducted by Statscan revealed that 64% of victims did not report the incidents they experienced due to a belief that it would not make a difference. General Wayne Eyre, chief of the defense staff, expressed disappointment at the prevalence of sexual misconduct and acknowledged the need for substantial efforts to address the issue. An official investigation in the previous year recommended external civilian authorities to handle sex crime investigations due to the unsatisfactory handling of offenses by military courts over the past two decades.

The Biden administration is urging Israel to minimize civilian deaths in its offensive in southern Gaza. U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have publicly called for a more surgical approach to avoid heavy casualties. However, the U.S. is not willing to take stronger measures such as restricting military aid or harshly criticizing Israel. The U.S. believes that private negotiations are effective in influencing Israeli actions. Israel has faced international pressure, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems unmoved. The United States provides significant military aid to Israel, giving it leverage over the conduct of the war against Hamas. However, the Biden administration is cautious about reducing aid due to potential risks and political implications. While some progressive Democrats push for setting conditions on military aid and an immediate ceasefire, Biden is also concerned about pro-Israel voters and the upcoming presidential election. The fighting between Israel and Hamas resumed after a seven-day pause, resulting in a soaring death toll. Israel accuses Hamas of using human shields, while critics point out civilian casualties caused by intense airstrikes.

The restrictions will target those who commit acts of violence or restrict civilians' access to essential services. Family members of these individuals may also be affected. President Joe Biden and other U.S. officials have urged Israel to take action against violence by Israeli settlers towards Palestinians in the West Bank.

Greek referees and match officials have announced that they will not officiate any Super League matches starting from the upcoming weekend. They are protesting against what they deem to be dangerous working conditions. Greek football has been plagued by crowd trouble, corruption allegations, and match-fixing, leading to dwindling attendances. Referees often face violent attacks from fans, with some having their homes and vehicles set on fire. Recently, referee Andreas Gamaris had his shop firebombed, while another referee, Tasos Papapetrou, allegedly received death threats. The referees state that they have been targeted and made scapegoats for shifting responsibilities, enduring bullying, threats, and physical attacks. Club presidents also openly criticize specific referees, sometimes even before matches. In previous seasons, foreign referees were brought in to ensure top division matches could proceed.

Singh stated that it is inappropriate for a senior leader like Thakur to make such statements and suggested that if there is any truth to the allegations, the BJP can investigate through the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which are under the central government. Singh also advised Thakur to reflect on why his party lost power in Himachal Pradesh one year ago. Thakur had targeted Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel regarding the Mahadev app scam case after the Congress' defeat in Chhattisgarh elections.

The United States, Canada, Kenya, and 60 other countries have made a pledge to significantly reduce cooling-related emissions at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai. This commitment, known as the Global Cooling Pledge, focuses on cutting emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning, with a goal of reducing these emissions by at least 68% compared to 2022 levels by 2050. The pledge also includes targets such as establishing minimum energy performance standards by 2030. The increase in demand for cooling due to rising temperatures, growing populations, and higher incomes has led to a surge in cooling emissions, which are expected to reach between 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050. The pledge aims to address this issue and increase access to sustainable cooling solutions. However, some challenges remain, with India, a country that is likely to experience significant growth in cooling demand, not yet joining the pledge. The progress on meeting the goals of the pledge will be monitored annually until 2030.

Greek olive growers, including Panagiotis Tsafaras, are facing an increase in thefts as olive prices rise during a poor harvest. Tsafaras has been robbed twice, losing over a tonne of olives in one incident. Other producers in Greece have resorted to installing cameras, GPS trackers, and considering private security measures. The thieves strike at night, using rods or silent electric chainsaws to steal the olives. The decline in olive production, due to unfavorable weather conditions, has caused wholesale prices to double to 8-9 euros per liter. Retail prices have reached up to 14 euros, making the crop an attractive target for thieves. Greek police have confirmed a spike in olive and olive oil thefts across the country this year.

Indonesia's parliament has passed a revision to its internet law, aiming to address concerns that certain articles were being used to suppress government opposition. The amendment introduces stricter requirements for the defamation article of the electronic information and transaction law (ITE), including a higher burden of proof in prosecutions, and reduces the maximum penalty for defamation from four years to two. However, critics argue that the revision does not go far enough in safeguarding freedom of speech, as it fails to prevent misuse of the law by offended officials seeking extra protection. Human rights activists have long called for changes to the 2008 law, citing its vague and potentially misused articles. This development follows the sentencing of singer and opposition figure Ahmad Dhani under the ITE law in 2019 for insulting political rivals online.

Barra did not comment on whether regulators treated Cruise more harshly than Tesla Autopilot and did not reveal funding details until assessments are complete. Last month, Cruise suspended all driverless and supervised car trips in the US and expanded a safety review following an accident.

### [Israel considers flooding Gaza tunnels with seawater- WSJ](https://theprint.in/world/israel-considers-flooding-gaza-tunnels-with-seawater-wsj/1872251/)

Israel has reportedly assembled a system of pumps to potentially flood tunnels used by Hamas in the Gaza strip, according to U.S. officials cited by the Wall Street Journal. The pumps, located near the Al-Shati refugee camp, are capable of moving thousands of cubic meters of water per hour and could render the tunnels inoperable within weeks. It remains unclear whether Israel would use the pumps before the release of all hostages held by Hamas. While Reuters cannot verify the details of the report, a U.S. official stated that it made sense for Israel to neutralize the tunnels. The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the flooding plan but acknowledged its efforts to dismantle Hamas's capabilities using various tools. Israel had informed the United States about this option, though it is unknown how close they are to carrying out the plan. No final decision has been made yet.

The film "Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce" premiered at the top of the U.S. box office, earning $21.8 million during the typically slow first weekend of December. This marks the first time a movie has crossed the $20 million mark on this particular weekend since 2003. The release date was strategically chosen as it is historically a dead zone for the box office. The film gives fans of Beyonce, known as the Beyhive, a chance to experience her concert tour even if they couldn't get tickets to the sold-out shows. The film received praise for its behind-the-scenes look at Beyonce's world tour and her candid discussions about fame, motherhood, and being a Black woman in the music industry. Although the box office results fell short of Taylor Swift's opening weekend earnings, experts believe it will still boost music downloads and provide a more affordable alternative to attending live concerts.

AT&T has announced that it has chosen Ericsson to build a telecom network in the United States using ORAN (open radio access network) technology. This new network will cover 70% of AT&T's wireless traffic by late 2026. ORAN technology promises to reduce costs for telecom operators by using cloud-based software and equipment from multiple suppliers, rather than relying on proprietary equipment from companies like Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei. While some telecom providers have tested ORAN technology, mass adoption has been slow. However, new networks by Dish and Japan's Rakuten are already using Open RAN. AT&T has spent six months analyzing Open RAN and has looked at multiple vendors before choosing Ericsson. The company plans to invest around $14 billion over the next five years for this project. Winning the Open RAN deal will make Ericsson the largest supplier to AT&T, potentially overshadowing Nokia. Nokia shares fell on speculation that they might lose the AT&T contract. Ericsson has agreed to open up its interfaces, which were previously proprietary, across its footprint. AT&T expects fully integrated Open RAN sites operating with Ericsson and Fujitsu by 2024, and by 2025, their network will have equipment from multiple suppliers. AT&T views this move as a game-changer for the industry.

### [Exclusive-France, US to propose ban on private finance to coal-fired plants at COP28 – sources](https://theprint.in/world/exclusive-france-us-to-propose-ban-on-private-finance-to-coal-fired-plants-at-cop28-sources/1852985/)

France, with support from the United States, plans to propose a halt to private financing for coal-based power plants at the upcoming U.N. climate conference. This plan, called the "New Coal Exclusion Policy," was communicated to India earlier this month. However, India and China are opposed to any efforts to block the construction of coal-fired power stations due to their energy needs. The proposal aims to dry up private funding for coal power by setting coal-exit standards for finance firms, tracked by regulators and rating agencies. The U.S., European Union, and Canada have expressed concerns about private international financing supporting new coal capacity in developing nations. About 490 gigawatts of new coal capacity is planned or under construction, mainly in India and China. India, where 73% of electricity is produced using coal, intends to resist committing to a fossil fuel phase-out or phase-down at the conference. Instead, it may focus on reducing emissions from other sources and urge developed nations to become carbon negative by 2050.

The three governments support mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct for foundation models of AI, while opposing untested norms.

The developers of foundation models would have to define model cards containing relevant information about the model's functioning, capabilities, and limits. An AI governance body could be established to develop guidelines and ensure compliance. Initially, no sanctions would be imposed, but a system of sanctions could be implemented in case of violations. Germany's economy ministry emphasizes that AI applications, not the technology itself, should be regulated. The German and Italian governments will further discuss AI-related issues in upcoming meetings.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！Oil prices rose over 2% on Monday as the OPEC+ group is expected to announce further supply cuts at an upcoming meeting. Brent crude futures settled at $82.32 a barrel, up 2.1%, while West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) gained 2.3% to $77.60, and January futures rose 1.8% to $77.83. The rebound follows four straight weeks of decline and speculation that OPEC+ may consider additional supply cuts. Some analysts believe deeper cuts may be necessary due to falling speculative positioning, declining timespreads, and higher-than-expected inventories. Oil prices have dropped nearly 20% since September, driven by record-high crude output in the US and concerns over demand growth, particularly from China. Additionally, traders are monitoring signs of a possible US recession in 2024 and evaluating the impact of the ongoing conflict in Israel on oil supply.

According to the Delhi BJP, property registration has been halted by sub-registrars in Delhi following a NCT of Delhi RERA order. However, a senior revenue department officer has stated that no directions to stop property registrations have been issued. Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva criticized the AAP government and asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to clarify if the RERA order applies to properties constructed before or after November 20. Sources in the Delhi government said that RERA falls under the central government's jurisdiction and accused the BJP of misleading the public. The Delhi BJP claimed that the RERA order limits the number of dwelling units allowed in certain plot sizes, which contradicts the large number of properties in Delhi with additional units. The RERA had directed that building plans indicate the total number of dwelling units that can be constructed on the plot. The report mentions the presence of unauthorised colonies in Delhi and raises concerns about their future legality under the RERA order.

This will enable them to supply larger quantities of food and other essentials to 41 workers who have been trapped for eight days. Previously, a four-inch tube was being used to supply dry fruit, medicines, and oxygen to the workers. The new pipeline will allow for the delivery of food items like roti and sabji. The director of NHIDCL called this the "first breakthrough" and stated that the workers can now hear and experience the rescue efforts. The collapsed tunnel is located in Silkyara village in Uttarkashi district and is part of the Char Dham all-weather road project.

Javier Milei, a radical libertarian, has been elected as the president of Argentina, receiving a wide margin of votes in a run-off election. This outcome reflects a desire for change and a rejection of the peronist government, which has overseen soaring inflation and increasing poverty. Despite Milei's significant voter support, he will face challenges due to his limited presence in regional governments and congress, and he may have to moderate his plans for economic reforms such as dollarization. Milei's election comes at a time of economic crisis for Argentina, and his proposed reforms could help address the country's fiscal issues. However, he will need the support of more moderate conservatives to implement his plans. Milei, a 53-year-old economist, has been compared to Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro due to his abrasive style and desire to slash government spending.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The article discusses the issue of explicit content on TikTok and its potential harm to young users. Despite efforts to moderate content, TikTok's focus seems to be on user engagement rather than creating a safe environment. The automated moderation system is not always accurate, leading to the removal of beneficial LGBTQ+ and sex education content while explicit content slips through. Users also employ tactics like "algospeak" to avoid filters. Harmful content on TikTok promotes unhealthy attitudes towards sex, perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes, and can influence vulnerable young boys with misogynistic views. The platform's promotion of idealistic and sexualized content also negatively affects the self-perception of young women and queer youth. However, TikTok offers an opportunity for informative and inclusive sex education content. Social media platforms face challenges in effectively moderating harmful content, and regulatory bodies like Australia's eSafety Commissioner play a role in pressuring platforms to remove such content. It is important for parents to equip young users with media literacy skills and actively monitor their online activities. Rather than solely restricting app usage, open discussions, building trust, and educating oneself and children about online risks are more effective approaches.

### [The future of transport is electric](https://theprint.in/world/the-future-of-transport-is-electric/1851557/)

The article discusses the need for countries to implement effective policies to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. Currently, transport emissions have been increasing at a rate of 1.7 percent per year since 1990, making it the sector with the highest emissions growth. Road vehicles contribute the most to these emissions, accounting for 74.5 percent.

While the global EV market has experienced significant growth in recent years, adoption rates vary across different regions. The article highlights successful government policies in China, Europe, and the US that have incentivized consumers to switch to EVs through subsidies, rebates, and tax discounts. For example, Norway has achieved a 79 percent market share for EVs by providing financial incentives and other benefits such as lower tolls and access to bus lanes.

The article suggests that alongside EV incentives, higher taxes on polluting vehicles can further encourage the transition to electric transport. Many European Union countries already levy car taxes based on carbon dioxide emissions. Feebate systems, which impose levies on high-emission vehicles and provide rebates for low-emission vehicles, are also effective in discouraging the purchase of polluting vehicles.

In addition to incentives and taxes, the phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles and the implementation of fuel efficiency standards are recommended. Over 35 countries have announced plans to electrify or phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. Fuel efficiency standards set limits on vehicle emissions and encourage the production of low or zero-emission vehicles.

To support the widespread adoption of EVs, the report suggests the need for robust charging infrastructure. Currently, only 13 percent of the estimated 100 million chargers needed by 2030 are in place. Accessible chargers can alleviate range anxiety concerns and make EVs more affordable by reducing the need for larger batteries.

The article concludes by emphasizing that a comprehensive set of consistent policies is crucial for achieving emissions reduction goals and transitioning to cleaner transport. It highlights the importance of not solely relying on EVs but also implementing strategies to change travel behavior, such as reducing car usage, promoting e-bikes and e-scooters, and improving walkability and public transport access.

Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of getting the policy mix right to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles and achieve global commitments for net zero emissions by 2050.

The indigenous ZThe prototype of the Zorawar light tank, designed for mountain warfare, will be unveiled in December 2023. Following this, it will undergo development trials and then user trials, likely in March next year. The Indian Army has chosen Cummins, an American company, for the engines of these tanks due to clearance issues faced with German companies. The Zorawar tank is specifically designed for high-altitude operations and aims to counter Chinese armoured deployments in such terrains. Weighing 25 tonnes, the tank will have greater mobility and accuracy compared to Chinese Type 15 tanks deployed along the Ladakh border. The need for a light tank arose as the existing T72s and T90s are more suitable for plains and deserts and lack maneuverability. The tank will feature a 105 mm gun made by a Belgium-based firm, active protection against incoming attacks, integrated UAVs, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and situational awareness technology. The Defense Acquisition Council approved the project worth Rs 16,000 crore in December 2022, and the DRDO will manufacture 59 of the 354 light tanks being procured.

The third round of United Nations negotiations for a treaty to control plastic pollution has received over 500 proposals from participants. Some see this as progress, while Greenpeace calls it "chaos". Negotiators have until the end of next year to reach a deal addressing the 400 million tonnes of plastic waste produced annually. The plastics industry and oil exporters advocate for promoting recycling and reusing, while environmental campaigners and certain governments believe in reducing production. Greenpeace emphasizes that the United States and the European Union should show greater leadership. The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) believes that the proposals reflect the robustness of the talks. Canada, Kenya, and the European Union support limiting plastic production, while a coalition of Russia and Saudi Arabia emphasizes recycling. Only less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled, and at least 14 million tonnes end up in the ocean each year. Two more rounds of negotiations will occur next year to finalize the deal.

The petitioner claims that SEBI failed to comply with the court's direction to submit the final conclusion/report. The application also refers to a report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) regarding the Adani Group's alleged investments through "opaque" Mauritius funds. The focus of the plea is on strengthening the regulatory system to protect investors and their investments in the share market. The petitioner argues that SEBI's objection to a necessary timeline for the investigation goes against the need for an efficient regulatory mechanism. Delays in investigations can lead to the disappearance of evidence and reduce investor confidence. The expert committee appointed by the court is still working on the matter, and the application calls for an independent body to investigate the new disclosures. The court had granted time until August 14 for SEBI's probe and emphasized the need for expeditious completion. SEBI has completed its investigation in most matters but is awaiting information from tax havens. The regulator will take appropriate action based on the investigation's outcome. An interim report by the expert committee found no evident pattern of manipulation but highlighted regulatory constraints. The Adani Group stocks faced allegations of fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation, which the group denies.

Targeted groups may include domestic workers, rickshaw drivers, waste pickers, gardeners, and construction workers. The DAY-NULM, launched in 2013, aims to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting self-help groups, skill development, self-employment training, and homeless shelters. The ministry is considering a shift towards entrepreneurship development, market linkages, standardizing norms for identifying the urban poor, and providing social benefits to all NULM beneficiaries. This move follows the success of the PM Street Vendor's AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme, which provided loans to street vendors affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although nearly 8.7 lakh self-help groups have been formed under DAY-NULM, experts suggest targeting a wider range of occupational groups and adopting income-generating schemes to address the challenges faced by the urban poor. Creating self-help groups in urban areas is more challenging due to the transient nature of migrant workers. The ministry is planning to focus on entrepreneurship development in the next phase of the mission, aiming to empower individuals with business knowledge and assistance.

Previously, India had high import duties on cars, but now it aims to adopt a model similar to Apple's. However, some manufacturers are concerned about the government's plans, arguing that any duty reduction should be limited to components and for a specific time frame. Despite the potential benefits for EV adoption in India, there are doubts about whether Tesla's dealership-free model will resonate with Indian consumers. Other carmakers are also catching up with Tesla, and a duty reduction on electric cars would benefit not only Tesla but also BMW and other German carmakers.

### [Analysis-In Mexico, gender balance push puts political parties in unfamiliar bind](https://theprint.in/world/analysis-in-mexico-gender-balance-push-puts-political-parties-in-unfamiliar-bind/1850111/)

Mexico's gender parity rules are starting to reshape the country's political landscape. The National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) recently selected Clara Brugada as its Mexico City mayoral candidate, bypassing the male frontrunner Omar Garcia Harfuch to meet new gender parity requirements. The move highlights the challenges faced in implementing equal candidacies for women in top political positions in Mexico. Efforts to circumvent the rules have led to controversies such as disqualifying men who falsely claimed to be transgender women. However, gender quotas have resulted in significant advancements for women, including a 50-50 split in Congress and an increase in women governors. Mexico's push for gender parity is likely to lead to its first woman president next year. While parity is crucial, critics argue that having capable leaders is equally important for effective governance.

However, their support for the movement has waned over time, highlighting a potential warning sign for the upcoming presidential election. While some members of the family still plan to vote for the Peronists, others will cast blank votes. The Peronist movement, which has ruled Argentina for a significant portion of its history, is facing strong competition from a radical libertarian candidate, Javier Milei. The country is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis, with high inflation, poverty, and an impending recession. Many blame the Peronists for these issues, leading even traditional supporters to become apathetic. The Cepernic family's declining political fervor reflects a broader trend of resignation and disillusionment among the Argentine population. Despite their historical ties to Peronism, they feel that the movement no longer represents their aspirations.

The study highlights the importance of getting enough sleep in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that sleep restriction can elevate the risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and disordered glucose metabolism. The current study focused on women and found that a prolonged, mild restriction of sleep increased women's blood glucose and insulin levels. Insulin resistance rose by 14.8% among both pre- and postmenopausal women, with more severe effects for postmenopausal women. The researchers also found that changes in body weight did not explain the changes in insulin and glucose levels. Further studies are planned to understand how sleep deficiency affects metabolism in both men and women and explore sleep interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention efforts.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！According to an article by Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM), the Global Listed Infrastructure (GLI) sector remains resilient in the face of short-term challenges and shows a promising long-term outlook. Although GLI experienced underperformance in 2023 compared to global equity markets, it still demonstrates solid fundamentals across various infrastructure sectors. The four major industry categories within GLI—Utilities, Energy Infrastructure, Communications, and Transportation—show positive trends in terms of revenue and profitability. The Communications sector, specifically the US wireless tower subsector, faces some challenges with stagnant cash flow growth in 2023. However, European tower operators and global data center companies enjoy strong fundamental trends. Despite current valuations being at odds with the fundamental backdrop, GLI companies are well-positioned to maintain margins. The defensive sectors of Utilities and Communications offer attractive valuations, and regulatory constructs help infrastructure companies navigate higher interest costs effectively. GLI has historically outperformed global equities during economic downturns, and certain sectors within GLI, such as freight rail and energy infrastructure, are poised for a positive recovery in the event of a modest economic downturn. As the global economy potentially re-accelerates in 2024, GLI is expected to benefit. Growth areas in infrastructure, such as the energy transition and renewables, have not been fully rewarded in 2023, but a more stable economic and financing environment is likely to create opportunities and potentially lead to a re-rating of companies involved in these themes. In the long term, GLI demonstrates its strength with low earnings volatility, stable cash flows, a higher relative income component compared to global equities, and attractive returns. Overall, the MSIM Global Listed Infrastructure Team highlights the resilience of GLI and its potential as a lucrative investment option in the evolving financial landscape.

The relocation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Khan Younis and those who fled from Gaza City would exacerbate the already dire humanitarian crisis. Israel aims to annihilate Hamas after its incursion into Israel and subsequent assault on Gaza City, resulting in the death of over 12,000 people, including 5,000 children. Israel dropped leaflets urging evacuation from Khan Younis, suggesting an imminent military operation. However, moving westward could provide faster access to humanitarian aid near the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The war in Gaza shows no signs of abating despite international calls for ceasefires or humanitarian pauses. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks and increase aid in response to mounting pressure. Meanwhile, violence escalated in the West Bank, with at least five Palestinians killed in an Israeli strike.

X's CEO, Linda Yaccarino, stated that the company has been clear about its efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. Musk later clarified that accounts promoting extreme violence would be suspended. Advertisers have become concerned about X since Musk purchased the platform and expressed intentions to loosen content moderation rules.

This has led to a shortage of produce, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and carrots. Many farms near the Gaza Strip and the Lebanese border have been devastated by Hamas terrorists, and the situation is further exacerbated by the return of Thai agricultural workers to their home country. To address the shortage of workers, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Employment Service have launched an initiative to pair unemployed Israelis with farms in need of extra hands.

The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned six individuals affiliated with the Iran-aligned militia group Kata'ib Hizballah (KH). US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the KSS's terrorist activities have threatened the lives of US and global coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria. Blinken also noted that Iran has supported KSS, KH, and other Iran-aligned militia groups with training, funding, and sophisticated weapons. The investigation into the Hamas massacre at the Re'im music festival on October 7 has revised the death toll to 364, with 40 festival attendees being taken hostage in Gaza. The investigation suggests that Hamas was allegedly unaware of the music festival prior to the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the IDF does not plan to keep soldiers inside Gaza after the war, and stressed the need for a civilian administration in Gaza committed to ending funding for terrorism.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Biden administration's efforts to negotiate an ambitious Asia trade deal are facing challenges, according to trade experts and business groups. The administration aimed to complete key chapters of its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) initiative trade "pillar" but encountered resistance from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, who were unwilling to commit to strong labor and environmental standards with binding enforcement provisions. Despite completing non-binding pillars on clean energy cooperation and anti-corruption measures, the lack of trade outcomes overshadowed these achievements. Some experts believe that election-year pressures make a deal unlikely, similar to the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2016. The administration had hoped to limit the scope of the IPEF trade pillar to avoid political blowback but faced skepticism from stakeholders due to its lack of ambition. Trade deals typically take a long time to negotiate, and the tight deadline ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit was seen as a constraint. Meanwhile, China expressed interest in aligning with Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) standards, signaling its desire to expand high-standard free trade areas.

Israel has warned Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to relocate westward away from the line of fire and closer to humanitarian aid, indicating a potential attack on Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north. The Israeli government aims to protect civilians from being caught in the crossfire but such a move could worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the area. Israel has vowed to destroy the Hamas militant group controlling Gaza since their attack into Israel on October 7th that resulted in many deaths and hostages taken. The Israeli assault on Gaza City has left two-thirds of its population homeless, leading to fears of permanent displacement. Gaza health authorities report over 12,000 deaths, including 5,000 children, although these figures are not frequently updated due to data collection challenges. Despite international calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pauses, the conflict shows no signs of abating. Israel has agreed to allow fuel trucks into Gaza and increase aid as per the United Nations' requests amid concerns of starvation and disease. The Al Shifa hospital, a primary target in Israel's ground assault, is under scrutiny for alleged use by Hamas as a command headquarters, although hospital staff deny these claims. A premature baby and an elderly captive from Israel have died recently, further deepening the humanitarian crisis.

Two fuel tankers carrying 60,000 liters of diesel fuel entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing after approval from Israel's war cabinet. The fuel is authorized for use by international organizations, particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It will support desalination facilities providing water to the southern strip, with oversight led by the United States and Egypt. This decision allows two fuel tankers per day to enter Gaza, providing crucial support to the water and sewage systems that are on the verge of collapse due to a lack of electricity. Additionally, the fuel will be used for UN relief agency trucks, waste disposal, bakeries, hospitals in southern Gaza, and generators for cell phones and internet services. The decision was made in consultation with the Israel Defence Forces and Israel's International Security Academy to ensure it aligns with operational objectives and does not support Hamas. The rationale behind the decision is to prevent the spread of pandemics and address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, there has been criticism within the Israeli government, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling for a reversal of the policy. Fuel shortages have worsened water and sewage issues in Gaza, affecting approximately 70% of the population. This move to allow fuel deliveries comes after pressure from the US.

Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, did not have a crisis plan in place when a nationwide network outage occurred, leaving half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours. The company's executive admitted that their defences had failed and they were not prepared for an outage of that scale. Optus had recently conducted scenario simulations, but they did not anticipate a nationwide shutdown because they had alternate connections built into their network. The outage highlighted concerns about the resilience of Australia's telecommunications networks, following a data breach at Optus last year. The government plans to introduce stricter cyber security reporting standards and mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks across all sectors. The outage was caused by a failure of the company's defensive filters, which led to data overload and the inability to send data on alternate routes. The outage lasted for 12 hours as Optus had to physically reboot their routers and core network devices. The CEO of Optus stated that the company followed up on all incidents, but 228 calls to the emergency hotline failed to connect during the outage. The company also discussed their reliance on third-party contractors and the need to evaluate the appropriate level of outsourcing. Singtel, the parent company of Optus, stated that the software upgrade was not the direct cause of the outage.

Asian shares took a pause on Friday, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan easing from a two-month high but still up for the week. The slump in oil prices and softer U.S. economic data weighed on Wall Street, while boosting bonds and impacting the inflation outlook. The sell-off in oil was likely driven by algorithmic and trend-following funds, causing prices to slide to four-month lows.

In Japan, the Nikkei added 0.1%, supported by the Bank of Japan's commitment to its loose policy.

Efforts to rein in Iran's nuclear program are facing significant challenges, leaving the United States and its allies with limited options. Talks to revive a nuclear deal have stalled, and tougher actions against Iran risk escalating tensions in an already volatile region. Despite Iran's consistent denial of seeking nuclear weapons, confidential reports indicate that the country now possesses enough uranium enriched up to 60% purity to make three bombs. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election further restricting Washington's flexibility, President Joe Biden cannot currently consider a more informal "understanding" with Iran. Iran's stonewalling of the International Atomic Energy Agency has hindered monitoring efforts, and an accommodation with Iran on the nuclear issue is politically unfeasible at this time. Western powers are now likely to focus on a non-binding statement rather than a resolution to avoid pushing Iran to further nuclear escalation. In the coming months, efforts will be made to strengthen oversight of Iran's nuclear program, although it remains uncertain whether Iran will ultimately become a nuclear state.

Hmm, I am not sure.

The discussions between Jordan and Israel regarding exchanging solar power for energy have halted due to the ongoing ground offensive in Gaza. Safadi dismissed Israel's claim that Hamas had a command node under the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City as "ridiculous" and an "insult to intelligence."

### [The Democracy Forum holds webinar on ‘Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh – the subcontinental Brotherhood?’](https://theprint.in/world/the-democracy-forum-holds-webinar-on-jamaat-e-islami-bangladesh-the-subcontinental-brotherhood/1848070/)

The Democracy Forum (TDF) recently organized a webinar titled 'Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh - the subcontinental Brotherhood?' to discuss the rise of Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and its potential impact on the country's democratic process. The webinar examined the circumstances surrounding the re-emergence of Jamaat-e-Islami as a democratic movement after a decade of political isolation.

Lord Bruce, the TDF President, highlighted the history of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was established in 1941 with the aim of incorporating Islamic ideology into all aspects of state governance. Although Jamaat-e-Islami is considered Bangladesh's most populous and well-organized political movement, it has not been close to exercising power since 2006 due to evidence of violence and intimidation linked to the party. For the past 15 years, Jamaat has been proscribed as a political actor.

During the webinar, various speakers shared their perspectives on Jamaat-e-Islami. Professor Shafi Mostofa discussed Jamaat's history, agenda, and its controversial role in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence. Mohammed Sinan Siyech examined Jamaat's transnational connections and organizational structure, while Maidul Islam assessed the party's influence in contemporary Bangladeshi politics and the challenges it faces.

There appears to be a tactical shift within Jamaat's leadership as they consider changing their position from the time of the Bangladesh Liberation War. However, some argue that fundamental positions have not changed despite a softer rhetoric. Dr. Md Nazrul Islam explored the theme of Jamaat and democracy, suggesting that political Islam and democracy are not necessarily incompatible and that Jamaat has shown support for constitutionalism and electoral politics.

Overall, the webinar provided a platform for discussing Jamaat-e-Islami's role in Bangladesh's political landscape and its potential impact on democracy.

Researchers at the University of Rochester's Wilmot Cancer Institute have made a significant advance in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. They have discovered the genetic changes that occur during tumor migration and identified a medication, known as np137, that may block the process. The next step is a clinical trial planned for early 2024 at the University of Rochester to test the drug's safety and effectiveness on pancreatic cancer that has metastasized to the liver. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and has a low survival rate, with the number of cases predicted to rise. The researchers focused on understanding the biology of metastatic pancreatic cancer since the cancer spreads early during its development and the cells become genetically reprogrammed as they migrate to the liver, making them resistant to standard treatment. The trial will likely involve eligible patients taking np137 before surgery, undergoing surgery to remove the cancer, and then continuing with the medication and chemotherapy afterwards. The study was funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

### [Researchers find how hunger hormones impact decision-making brain area to drive behavior](https://theprint.in/health/researchers-find-how-hunger-hormones-impact-decision-making-brain-area-to-drive-behavior/1847958/)

A recent study conducted by researchers at UCL (University College London) has found that a hunger hormone produced in the gut can directly influence the decision-making area of the brain, known as the hippocampus. The study, which was conducted on mice, is the first to demonstrate how hunger hormones can impact brain activity when an animal is thinking about food. The researchers discovered that the ventral hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in decision-making, is sensitive to the levels of hunger hormones in the gut. When the mice were hungry, there was less neural activity in this area, allowing them to eat. Conversely, when the mice were full, activating the ventral hippocampal neurons stopped them from eating. The researchers hope that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of eating disorders and other health outcomes related to diet. They also plan to investigate whether hunger can affect learning and memory.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has reported to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that two experimental smog towers in the city have not been effective in reducing air pollution. The DPCC stated that the operation of these costly air purifiers lacks merit and suggested that the structures be repurposed as a museum for the dissemination of technical information on air pollution control. The report highlighted that the smog tower at Connaught Place, which has been operational for two years at a cost of Rs 25 crore, can only mitigate air pollution by up to 17% within a 100-meter radius. The DPCC argued that considering Delhi's large area, the city would require more than 47,000 such towers, making the cost and maintenance unjustified. The central government also expressed that smog towers are not a solution to the air pollution problem in Delhi-NCR and is against installing more of these air purifiers. The two smog towers were installed in 2021 following directions from the Supreme Court.

The easing of oil prices also provides some relief. Despite the high trade deficit in October, economists retain their current account deficit (CAD) estimates, expecting it to normalize from November onwards.

Lahore, Pakistan is facing a severe air pollution crisis as the air quality index (AQI) has reached alarming levels. After a brief period of relatively normal air quality, the city saw a sudden spike with a maximum AQI of 401, marking it as extremely unsafe for breathing. Although there was a slight improvement in the afternoon with the AQI dropping to 188, the air quality deteriorated again in the evening, reaching an AQI of 236. As a result, Lahore now ranks third on the list of the most polluted cities globally. The current readings indicate a severe threat to public health.

Different areas of Lahore showed varying levels of air pollution, with Fida Hussain House reporting an AQI of 364 and WWF Pakistan at 231. The decline in air quality during winter months, from October to February, is a common occurrence in Lahore. Crop burning by farmers in the Punjab province contributes to smog, while weather changes trap pollutants in the air for longer periods.

The main contributors to air pollution in Lahore are vehicle and industrial emissions, smoke from brick kilns, burning of crop residue and waste, dust from construction sites, and deforestation. Temperature inversion worsens winter air pollution by preventing the upward movement of pollutants and causing their accumulation.

Experts recommend providing real-time air quality data to the public with greater detail to help individuals protect themselves and contribute to efforts against air pollution. Reducing industrial and vehicular emissions is crucial for improving air quality. Urgent and coordinated efforts are needed to address the root causes of air pollution and protect the health and well-being of Lahore's residents.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Scientists at the Gene Centre Munich have discovered a new mechanism by which cells detect and repair crosslinking damage to single-stranded RNA. Previous research had focused on repairing crosslinking damage to DNA, but this study reveals the harmful effects of such damage on protein synthesis. The researchers used a novel approach to induce and study RNA damage in the absence of DNA damage, leading to the identification of the ribosome as a sensor for crosslinking damage. The findings have implications for the mechanisms of action of commonly used anti-cancer drugs. Aldehydes, which are produced in the body through metabolic processes, are toxic because they bind to macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins and crosslink them.

Euro zone banks are facing significant financial losses as a result of tech contractors failing to meet their obligations, according to the European Central Bank (ECB). In a recent survey conducted by the ECB, it was found that banks lost €148 million ($160.59 million) in 2022 due to the "unavailability or poor quality of outsourced services," marking a 360% increase from the previous year. The ECB also identified shortcomings in banks' approaches to cyber risks, including hacks, outdated systems, and inadequate outsourcing arrangements. The report highlights the need for banks to properly manage risks arising from reliance on service providers and ensure their IT and cybersecurity risk management aligns with supervisory expectations. The ECB emphasized the importance of addressing these issues to prevent further financial losses and protect against cyber threats.

### [Can a Balanced Advantage Fund Help you Withstand Market Volatility?](https://theprint.in/ani-press-releases/can-a-balanced-advantage-fund-help-you-withstand-market-volatility/1845834/)

Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs) are hybrid mutual fund schemes that dynamically manage their portfolio between equity and debt based on market conditions. These funds aim to optimize returns by shifting between asset classes. BAFs have the flexibility to invest in equity, debt, or have a balanced exposure to both. This allows them to generate returns in different market conditions, making them suitable for investment through all economic cycles.

BAFs can help in volatile markets by adapting to changing conditions. Unlike traditional approaches with fixed allocation percentages, BAFs can capitalize on opportunities and manage risks effectively. They deliver returns in both bull and bear phases, capturing the upside during market booms and cushioning losses during downturns. BAFs also provide downside mitigation by increasing debt exposure during volatile phases, balancing the risk of equities. Additionally, professional fund managers continuously monitor market trends and adjust allocations for optimal risk-adjusted returns.

BAFs overcome the limitations of other hybrid schemes by offering more flexible equity-debt rebalancing parameters. Traditional hybrid funds may fail to adapt to extreme market movements due to allocation constraints. Aggressive hybrid funds with high equity allocation limits may decline sharply during steep corrections, while conservative hybrid funds with lower equity caps may miss out on maximizing upside potential. BAFs, on the other hand, have a dynamic and unconstrained approach, optimizing returns in all market environments.

When choosing a suitable BAF, it is important to track the fund manager's record in navigating different markets, evaluate the extent of allocation shifts between equity and debt over the past 5-10 years, consider the consistency and success of returns across bull and bear phases, and assess factors such as portfolio churn, expense ratios, and the experience of the fund management team.

BAFs provide flexibility and can serve as all-season funds across economic cycles. They are a robust long-term investment choice suitable for various financial needs. It is advisable to evaluate both quantitative and qualitative parameters before selecting a BAF as an investment vehicle.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The first truck carrying a United Nations fuel shipment entered Gaza from Egypt, marking a small step in alleviating the fuel shortages that have been affecting relief efforts in the region. Israel allowed 24,000 liters of diesel fuel to be delivered for UN aid distribution, but not for use at hospitals. The limited delivery of fuel is just 9% of what is needed daily to sustain life-saving activities in Gaza. The lack of fuel has caused the closure of hospitals, bakeries, and sewage pumping stations, as well as threatening to shut down telecoms data centers and connection points. The UN had warned that it may have to halt humanitarian operations if its fuel stocks became fully depleted. However, aid workers say the initial delivery of fuel is not enough to meet the needs of hospitals or aid deliveries. Despite the delivery of food and supplies, the aid distribution has been significantly affected due to the lack of fuel. Israel had previously refused to allow fuel in, fearing it would be used by Hamas. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas began in response to Hamas fighters crossing into southern Israel. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hungary is challenging the European Union's policy towards Ukraine, disagreeing with other EU countries that support bringing Ukraine closer to the bloc and providing more aid amid the Russian invasion. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties with Moscow, believes the EU's strategy of sending aid has failed and opposes starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. Hungary's opposition is the main obstacle to a decision by EU leaders to begin formal membership talks with Ukraine and allocate €50 billion in aid. Hungary argues for a period of reflection and strategic discussion on the EU's policy towards Ukraine before supporting any decisions on Ukraine's accession process or further aid. This dispute highlights Hungary's concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine and its disagreement with the EU over democratic issues and access to funds. EU officials are exploring ways to bypass a Hungarian veto on aid to Ukraine but recognize the significance of supporting Ukraine's security and credibility. The outcome of the December EU summit and the decision on Ukraine's membership talks remain uncertain due to the need for consensus among member states.

This decision complicates budget negotiations within Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition and could set a precedent for future fiscal responses to crises. Finance Minister Christian Lindner will face increased scrutiny on spending control, and the ruling may force the government to make spending cuts.

The visit came as the politically isolated state announced progress in its banned ballistic missile program. The talks between Russia and North Korea focused on the economy, science, and technology. Kozlov emphasized Russia's desire for substantial cooperation with North Korea based on agreements made by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, a cultural delegation from North Korea traveled to St. Petersburg for an event. South Korea's intelligence agency stated that North Korea is in the final stages of preparing for the launch of a spy satellite, potentially with technical assistance from Russia. North Korean state media reported successful static tests of new high-thrust solid-fuel engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). These tests are seen as essential for enhancing North Korea's military capabilities in a challenging security environment. Solid-fuel missiles are considered easier to operate and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons. Both North Korea's missile program and its nuclear weapons are prohibited by UN Security Council resolutions, leading to imposed sanctions. The US has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in the war with Ukraine, while Moscow is alleged to provide technical military support to North Korea. However, both countries deny these claims and pledge closer military cooperation.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan have made significant gains in their war with the army, breaking months of stalemate. These gains have strengthened the RSF's position and influence in talks in Jeddah. While there is speculation about the possibility of Sudan splitting, it remains unclear how the RSF could govern a breakaway territory. Instead, the RSF aims to increase its access to resources, such as gold, and secure its role in any political settlement. The RSF has been expanding its control in various regions, including Darfur and Khartoum, and has expressed its intention to reach Port Sudan. However, there is currently no immediate risk of Sudan splitting. The war between the RSF and the army began after a plan to integrate the two forces fell apart. The RSF has been gradually gaining territory and has recently used drones and longer-range artillery. The army has faced challenges with repairs to its warplanes and fatigue among soldiers. The RSF's advances have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, with thousands of casualties and millions displaced. Ceasefire talks in Jeddah have been adjourned without a resolution, with the RSF seeking checkpoints and outposts to formalize its role in Khartoum. The army is under pressure from Bashir loyalists and Islamist militias. The situation remains volatile, and ethnically targeted violence is likely to persist.

### [Central Europe’s defence companies spy African opportunity](https://theprint.in/world/central-europes-defence-companies-spy-african-opportunity/1845170/)

Central European defense companies are aiming to expand their sales of weapons, military equipment, and related services in Africa. Former Warsaw Pact countries, such as the Czech Republic, have a history of supplying weapons to African nations during the Communist era and are now well-positioned to upgrade these systems. The shift towards Western technology by African countries still using Soviet-era equipment provides new opportunities for Central European defense companies. These companies are negotiating deals for guns, ammunition, military equipment, and services with various African nations. Their expertise in maintaining and modernizing Eastern-origin military land systems appeals to African customers who want to reduce reliance on Russian suppliers. With concerns over the reliability of Russian arms, there is potential for Central European defense companies to fill the gap. Russia has become the leading arms seller in sub-Saharan Africa, but the expertise of Czech industry in former Soviet weapons presents a valuable advantage. Polish defense companies have also intensified their talks with African markets, and interest has increased from potential African customers in Poland. The Czech Republic recently sent a trade mission to several African countries, focusing on boosting opportunities for the defense industry. Reopening and strengthening relationships with traditional partners in Africa is a key goal. Defense industry cooperation is seen as an integral part of these efforts. The Czech arms industry's reputation has been enhanced through its efforts to supply Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion in 2022. As African countries using Soviet-style equipment start to view Russia as a problematic supplier, they are turning to Central European alternatives.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent analysis has revealed that government efforts to remove unapproved and banned antibiotic fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs in India have been largely ineffective. The study found that in 2020, the majority of antibiotic formulations sold in India were either unapproved or banned. FDC drugs are combinations of two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients in a single drug. While the total number of antibiotic FDC formulations on the market decreased from 574 in 2008 to 395 in 2020, around 70.4% of these formulations were unapproved or banned. Antibiotic resistance is a global concern, making it crucial to address this issue. The study suggests that regular surveys of the market and strengthened enforcement are necessary. Despite regulatory initiatives taken since 2007, hundreds of unapproved antibiotic FDC formulations have remained in the Indian market. Additionally, a considerable portion of antibiotic FDCs sold in India in 2020 were not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The slow progress in removing irrational FDC drugs is attributed to weak and inefficient regulatory enforcement.

According to a study conducted by the University of Adelaide and Oxford University, asbestos exposure led to a higher prevalence of asbestos-related lung cancers among British and Australian navy personnel compared to other armed forces. The study analyzed data from 30,085 British and Australian troops who served in the 1950s and 1960s, when asbestos-containing materials were present on naval vessels. The researchers found that the lung cancer rate was higher in naval personnel, and although smoking remains the primary cause of lung cancer, the excess cases in the navy could not be explained by a higher smoking rate. The study concluded that onboard asbestos exposure was likely the main cause of the increased lung cancer rate. Additionally, asbestosis deaths were observed among sailors, further strengthening the link. The researchers estimated that approximately 27% of lung cancers among Australian seamen and 12% among British seamen were related to onboard asbestos exposure. The study highlights the ongoing risk of asbestos exposure to workers, despite bans and regulatory controls. The researchers suggest that the effects of asbestos exposure may be underestimated unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis. They emphasize the need for strict control measures to protect workers from asbestos and other harmful airborne dusts.

### [RINL hopes asset monetisation may garner Rs 3000-4000cr](https://theprint.in/economy/rinl-hopes-asset-monetisation-may-garner-rs-3000-4000cr/1844458/)

Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), a steel company, has stated that if it can raise between Rs 3000-4000 crore through the monetization of its forged wheel plant and land, as well as ongoing efficiency measures, it will be able to increase production and turn around from losses. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) handles the monetization process as RINL is a divestment candidate. RINL had invested Rs 2000 crore in the wheel plant, which has the capacity to produce one lakh forged train wheels per year. RINL’s CEO, Atul Bhatt, said that if monetization occurs this fiscal year, it will help RINL come back to cash profit through increased production. RINL posted a loss of around Rs 3000 crore in 2022-23 due to factors such as a glut in the steel market, the export tax on steel, and a lack of captive raw material security. Bhatt highlighted a cost disadvantage of Rs 6000 per tonne due to buying iron ore from the open market and an unsustainable debt of around Rs 23000 crore. The monetization plan aims to reduce debt and improve the working capital situation. Bhatt also mentioned measures such as increasing oxygen capacity and switching the import of coking coal. RINL’s substantial land bank is considered attractive as it eliminates the need for prospective buyers to invest in developing new land parcels. The land parcels are currently under the direct ownership of the union government.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A new study published in Frontiers in Science raises doubts about the effectiveness of achieving "net-zero" emissions in halting global warming. Net-zero emissions refers to the point at which the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is equal to the amount removed from it. The study argues that there is uncertainty surrounding the estimates that global warming will stop at net-zero, suggesting that there is a chance global warming could continue and intensify after reaching this point. The article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address this risk. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing global temperatures and highlights the need to limit initial disturbances to the planet in order to mitigate climate risks. The research identifies several processes that could contribute to significant warming after reaching net-zero emissions. The melting of polar ice, for example, leads to increased absorption of solar energy, which further drives up temperatures. The study concludes that political obstacles, rather than technological or physical ones, are currently hindering climate action. It argues for collaborative efforts among climate experts to better understand the impact of various processes and improve warming predictions.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The deportation of undocumented Afghan citizens from Pakistan is having a significant impact on the socio-economic dynamics in Balochistan, particularly in the city of Quetta. Many of those being deported are Pashtun, who had integrated into local Pashtun communities. The departure of these individuals has disrupted their lives and affected the communities that had embraced them. The Hazara community in Balochistan, which saw an increase in numbers after the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, is also facing a crisis as undocumented Hazaras have left for Afghanistan. This has exacerbated concerns among those who had fled oppression by the Afghan Taliban. The economic ramifications are being felt in Quetta, where some refugees played a vital role in the city's economy as laborers and consumers. Their departure has led to an economic downturn. The introduction of a passport requirement for crossing into Afghanistan has also disrupted businesses and family connections in Chaman, leading to protests. The social impact of the deportations is significant, as many Afghans had been part of the society for years, marrying and developing community ties. The deportations may strain cross-border kinships, diminish cultural and social contributions, and potentially destabilize local economies. Baloch nationalist parties, who were previously opposed to Afghan refugees, have remained silent on the issue this time. There are allegations that a large number of Afghans have been issued Pakistani identity cards, and there is speculation that these cards will be blocked and cancelled in the next phase, which could inadvertently affect Pakistani citizens in Balochistan. A careful and humane approach is necessary to prevent further disruption to the lives of both Afghan refugees and Balochistan's citizens.

The Brazilian government plans to expand its railway network with a 40 billion reais ($8 billion) fund, funded by removing discounts given to rail companies under previous government contracts. The discounts were given to iron ore miner Vale and logistics companies Rumo and MRS in 2022 under the government of former President Jair Bolsonaro. These contracts did not go through the normal public bidding process, and the companies were allowed to make an advance payment deducting unamortized assets from their owed concession payments. The government claims that the companies owe an additional 40 billion reais ($8.1 billion) in unpaid concession payments. While Rumo has agreed to pay, Vale and MRS are still disputing the matter in court. Once the court's decision is made, the government plans to arrange any payments with the companies. The funds will be used to finance the construction of new railways and extend existing ones, with the goal of increasing rail freight transportation from 17% to 40% of Brazil's total freight, including iron ore.

Murphy also stated that these payments often result in benefits to users, such as cheaper phones or better data plans. He added that while Microsoft had the majority of preinstalled browser defaults, its Bing search engine only received 15% of search queries. The trial is expected to conclude this week.

Bangladesh is experiencing its worst-ever outbreak of dengue fever, with a death toll of 1,476 and over 291,000 infected. Experts attribute the severe outbreak to rising temperatures and a longer monsoon season caused by climate change, which create ideal breeding conditions for the dengue-spreading mosquito. This year's death toll is more than five times that of 2022 and the highest since authorities began tracking the disease in 2000. The Aedes mosquito, which spreads dengue, is adapting to the changing climate patterns, leading to the disease's spread in all 64 districts of the country. Vector surveillance is now needed year-round to monitor the disease's spread. There is no specific vaccine or drug for dengue, but early detection and proper medical care can reduce deaths to less than 1% of those infected. Hospitals in Bangladesh are struggling to cope with the influx of patients and a shortage of intravenous fluids.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Gold prices rose slightly as the dollar weakened, and investors are awaiting U.S. inflation data that could impact the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Spot gold increased by 0.4% to $1,934.25 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.1% to $1,938.50. The upcoming release of U.S. consumer prices index (CPI) data and producer price index data will be closely watched. If the inflation data exceeds expectations, gold may face downward pressure due to the possibility of a rate hike. However, if the data aligns with expectations, gold could trade above $1,950. It's important to note that higher interest rates can reduce the appeal of gold as it doesn't generate yield. The market currently predicts an 86% chance of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in December. Last week, gold prices dipped due to reduced safe-haven demand and a hawkish tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Moody's recently changed the outlook on the U.S. government's ratings to "negative" from "stable." Spot silver fell by 1% to $21.99 per ounce, while platinum gained 1.1% to $849.49 and palladium fell by 1% to $953.44, near a five-year low.

### [Researchers give more insight into development of lupus in females](https://theprint.in/science/researchers-give-more-insight-into-development-of-lupus-in-females/1843651/)

In lupus, an autoimmune disease, women are affected nine times more than males. The reasons behind this gender disparity have been unclear, but a recent study by Johns Hopkins Medicine has shed light on the role of the X chromosome and a specific genetic material called X-inactive specific transcript (XIST). The study found that XIST can trigger an immune response involving toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a protein in the immune system. This immune response contributes to the development and severity of lupus in women. The research suggests that XIST may play a role in promoting autoimmunity and could be a potential target for future therapies. Further studies are needed to explore XIST's involvement in other autoimmune conditions that predominantly affect women.

Presidential front-runner Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia criticized the European Union (EU) over its ban on palm oil imports and claimed that Europeans were also responsible for deforestation during colonial times. The EU recently passed a law to ban imports of commodities linked to forest destruction, including palm oil, which Indonesia is the largest producer of. Prabowo argued that while Indonesia has maintained good relations with Europe, the EU's ban on palm oil has created difficulties for selling other products such as coffee, tea, and cocoa. The EU, previously the third-largest buyer of Indonesian palm oil, did not immediately respond to Prabowo's comments. Prabowo further highlighted that during colonial rule, Europeans forced Indonesians to plant other crops such as tea, coffee, rubber, and cocoa, resulting in the destruction of forests. He emphasized the need for an equal playing field and expressed concern about the impact of the EU's deforestation law on Indonesia's annual exports. A task force comprising the EU, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the second-largest palm oil producer globally, has been formed to discuss the law.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The dollar reached its highest level against the Japanese yen in over a year, boosted by reduced expectations of US interest rate cuts next year. Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki stated that the government would monitor the currency market and respond accordingly, but this had little immediate impact on the yen. The British pound slightly increased after a reshuffle of key government posts by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Traders in global currency markets were cautious, awaiting the latest US inflation numbers to determine the likelihood of rate cuts next year. While the dollar rose to its highest level against the yen since October 2022, it was last up 0.15%. Last week, Fed policymakers indicated that the battle against inflation was not yet over, leading to a reduction in market rate cut bets and supporting the dollar. The dollar index also saw gains, remaining firm due to last week's increase. Moody's lowering the outlook for US credit had little impact on the market. Japanese data showed that wholesale inflation had slowed, suggesting diminishing pressure on the yen. However, there was still concern about potential intervention from the Japanese government to strengthen the currency. The euro and sterling both gained slightly, with sterling also rising against the euro after news of changes in the UK government.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the Congress party's efforts in promoting social justice and its impact on the caste composition of its candidates for the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly election. The party has appointed a Dalit leader as its national president and has been advocating for a caste census. However, an analysis of the party's nominated candidates reveals that substantial changes have not been made in its candidate nomination policy.

The Congress has allocated 36% of the tickets to upper castes, which comprise only around 10% of the state's population. In contrast, OBCs, representing more than half of the state's population, have been given only 27% of the tickets. This indicates that while there is a symbolic shift towards social justice, there have been no substantive changes in the candidate nomination policy.

The article also highlights the dominance of certain jatis (castes) among the Congress candidates. More than half of the nominated candidates belong to five jatis: Rajput, Brahmin, Gond, Bhil, and Jatav/Ahirwar. Rajputs and Brahmins make up a significant portion of the nominations, with Rajputs comprising around 14% and Brahmins around 13% of the total candidates.

Gonds and Bhils, as well as Jains, Baniyas, and Gurjars, also receive notable political representation. Among Scheduled Castes, the Jatav/Ahirwar castes have the highest number of nominations. However, the Congress has not been able to implement its aggressive stance on caste issues within the party, as the traditional upper-caste local elite still have influence over nominations.

The article concludes by suggesting that the Congress may face electoral consequences if it fails to address these disparities in caste representation.

### [Why are my kids good around other people and then badly behaved with me?](https://theprint.in/world/why-are-my-kids-good-around-other-people-and-then-badly-behaved-with-me/1842704/)

This article discusses why children often behave well at school or in other settings but exhibit worse behavior at home. It explains that children learn from an early age that their behavior produces outcomes and can be a way to control the actions of others. Sometimes, children are inadvertently rewarded for misbehavior at home through increased attention or getting what they want. In contrast, children may behave better at school because teachers have clear expectations and reward systems in place. The article suggests that parents can help improve their children's behavior at home by establishing routines, setting simple house rules, noticing good behavior, spending regular small amounts of time with their child, and having realistic expectations.

China's increasing presence in the Pacific region has led to mixed perceptions among local populations, according to surveys conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands. While both governments welcome China's engagement, concerns over environmental pollution and perceived lack of benefits from Chinese projects were raised. However, those living near mining operations tended to view them more positively due to financial benefits. Chinese government scholarships improved students' views of China, with participants recommending the program and reporting a positive change in their impressions of the country. In the Solomon Islands, support for closer ties with both China and the US was high among surveyed students, although some expressed concerns about potential debt risks associated with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Non-governmental organizations in the Pacific also raised concerns about human rights violations, governance, debt risks, and environmental pollution related to China's initiatives. The complex and nuanced perceptions of local populations in the Pacific regarding China's influence should be considered by policymakers in the US and Australia as they aim to counter China's growing relationships in the region.

Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that China has been increasing its presence in the Pacific region, particularly in countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon Islands. While the governments of these countries welcome China's engagement, there are mixed perceptions among the local populations.

However, those living in the mining lease area had a more positive view due to the direct financial benefits they receive. In Solomon Islands, there is support for a closer bilateral relationship with China, but some individuals have concerns about debt risks and Chinese control over resources.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) experienced a significant cyber hack on its U.S. broker-dealer, causing disruption to its operations. The attack was so extensive that the corporate email system stopped working, forcing employees to switch to Google mail. As a result, the brokerage temporarily owed BNY Mellon $9 billion, which was much larger than its net capital. ICBC's New York-based unit received financial support from its Chinese parent to repay BNY Mellon, and manual processing of trades was conducted with the help of the custody bank. ICBC expected the process of setting up secure systems and resuming normal business to take at least until Monday. During this time, clients were asked to temporarily suspend business and clear trades elsewhere. The ransomware attack, claimed by cybercrime gang Lockbit, raises concerns about the resilience of the Treasury market and highlights the importance of cybersecurity. The hack may also influence regulatory discussions surrounding central clearing of Treasury trades. The incident is likely to be a topic of conversation at an upcoming Treasury market conference. Despite being a mid-sized broker, ICBC's systems being paralyzed caused disruptions in the market, leading some market participants to reroute their trades. BNY Mellon played a crucial role in helping sort through the situation and facilitated the clearing of trades manually. ICBC's parent injected capital into the unit to ensure payment to BNY Mellon. Once ICBC's new system is operational, others in the industry will also review its safety measures, potentially causing further delays in returning to normal operations.

### [Payments app Zelle begins refunds for imposter scams after Washington pressure](https://theprint.in/tech/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-for-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure/1842693/)

Banks on the payment app Zelle have made a significant policy change by starting to refund victims of imposter scams. This decision comes in response to concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers and the federal consumer watchdog. Zelle, which is owned by seven major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, began reversing transfers on June 30 for customers who were deceived into sending money to scammers posing as government agencies or financial service providers. The move goes beyond legal requirements, according to Ben Chance, the chief fraud risk officer at Early Warning Services (EWS), the company that owns Zelle.

Previously, banks were only required to reimburse customers for unauthorized payments made by hackers, not for transfers initiated by customers themselves. While Zelle introduced a new reimbursement benefit for specific scam types, it had not previously provided details about its imposter scam refund policy due to concerns that it could encourage false scam claims.

This policy shift represents a significant change from last year when banks argued against refunding transfers that customers were tricked into approving. Zelle has faced criticism after a New York Times report highlighted the prevalence of scams on their platform, with Senator Elizabeth Warren estimating that Zelle users lost $440 million to fraud in 2021 alone.

Impersonator fraud was the most-reported scam across all payment methods in the U.S. in 2022, resulting in $2.6 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Despite concerns that covering the cost of authorized transactions might lead to more fraud, Zelle's owner company, EWS, has implemented a mechanism that allows banks to recover funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender. Additionally, Zelle now requires lenders to implement a tool that detects transfers with risky attributes.

Zelle's changes have satisfied the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) so far, but pressure from lawmakers may lead to further rule changes to protect customers from scams. Zelle faces market pressure to improve its standards of care as it competes with other peer-to-peer payment platforms like PayPal and Venmo, which offer purchase protection programs for eligible transactions.

While Zelle's policy change is seen as a positive step, experts emphasize that regulations mandating imposter fraud protections would be better to ensure customer well-being. Payment fraud is expected to be a topic of discussion when bank CEOs appear before the Senate in the future.

The Japanese yen reached a one-year low against the dollar as traders eagerly awaited U.S. inflation data, which is expected to provide insight into whether the Federal Reserve needs to take further action to control rising prices. Market analysts believe that even if the CPI numbers are softer, the Fed will continue to resist rate cuts, considering inflation remains above target. Moody's recent announcement of lowering its outlook for the U.S. credit rating had little impact on the market. The yen remained under pressure due to increasing U.S. Treasury yields and a strong dollar. Meanwhile, data from Japan indicated that wholesale inflation had slowed below 1% for the first time in over two years, suggesting fading cost pressures that offered little support to the yen. In other news, sterling held steady ahead of UK earnings data, while the euro hovered around $1.0688.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the situation as dire and perilous, with patient fatalities increasing significantly. Hospitals are struggling to cope with constant gunfire and bombing. Israel claims that Hamas has placed command centers under and near the hospitals, but Hamas denies this. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that Al-Quds hospital is also out of service, lacking medicine, food, and water. Three U.N. agencies expressed horror at the attacks on healthcare facilities, with half of Gaza's hospitals now closed.

New research led by NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Centre suggests that genetic data from healthy tissue near lung tumors may be a better predictor of cancer recurrence than analyzing the tumors themselves. The study, which focused on lung adenocarcinoma, found that analyzing the transcriptome of apparently healthy tissue accurately predicted recurrence 83% of the time, compared to 63% when analyzing tumor tissue. The study also revealed that genes associated with inflammation in adjacent healthy tissue were particularly useful for making predictions. The findings suggest that immunotherapy could be used to combat tumor growth before it becomes detectable by traditional methods. The researchers plan to use their findings to assess recurrence risk in newly treated lung cancer patients.

### [Cement industry’s new ‘EV’ – A new low-carbon tech is here](https://theprint.in/feature/cement-industrys-new-ev-a-new-low-carbon-tech-is-here/1842157/)

The construction of cities equivalent to the size of New York City every month is being driven by population growth and urbanization. However, this rapid urban development is putting increased pressure on the planet and its natural resources because concrete and cement, which are key construction materials, contribute approximately 7% of global CO2 emissions. To address this issue, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and industry input from the Global Cement and Concrete Association, has developed a framework to reduce concrete emissions. The framework suggests three key strategies: decarbonizing the manufacturing process, using lower-carbon cement blends, and optimizing the volume of material used in projects. One potential solution for decarbonizing cement production is an electric chemical approach that replaces fossil fuel kilns with an ambient temperature process. This approach aims to achieve true zero carbon and can be a high-performance, low-carbon building material. The journey of developing sustainable cement production technology serves as a lesson that good ideas can come from anywhere.

Higher oil prices resulting from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East could lead to lower economic growth and higher inflation, according to Fitch Ratings. The rating agency estimates that world GDP growth would be 0.4 percentage points lower in 2024 and 0.1 percentage points lower in 2025. Fitch's simulations assume average oil prices of $120 per barrel in 2024 and $100 per barrel in 2025. The impact of higher oil prices would dampen GDP growth in most economies, with South Africa and Turkey being the most affected. Fitch also expects higher inflation rates in 2024, followed by corrections in 2025. The potential oil price shock could result in tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A study conducted by researchers from Michigan State University found that there is no reliable association between pet ownership and well-being. The study involved 767 participants who completed online surveys, and while pet owners reported that their pets improved their lives, there was no difference in the well-being of pet owners compared to non-pet owners over time. The study also found that the type of pet, the number of pets, and the quality of the human-pet relationship did not affect the association. The researchers suggested that non-pet owners may have other sources of happiness in their lives. They concluded that while pets may provide positive experiences, they may not have a transformative effect on overall well-being.

### [Diwali car discounts make for a great deal. But don’t drive home a soon-to-be extinct SUV](https://theprint.in/opinion/dashboard/diwali-car-discounts-make-for-a-great-deal-but-dont-drive-home-a-soon-to-be-extinct-suv/1840907/)

The Indian automotive industry has experienced a swift rebound after the challenges of 2020, with consistent monthly sales growth over the past two years. It is predicted that by March 2024, the Indian passenger car market will surpass four million units, making it the world's third-largest car market behind China and the United States.

However, Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor India, Tarun Garg, raises concerns about the current situation. He points out that rival carmakers are offering massive discounts on their flagship products during the Diwali season, suggesting that there may be underlying issues despite the apparent positive growth. Garg predicts a decline in growth as 2024 approaches, marking the end of a period of intense expansion.

Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) indicates that sales of passenger cars in October 2023 grew by 15.87% compared to the previous year. While major manufacturers like Hyundai saw their sales increase by close to 15%, smaller players such as Renault, Nissan, and Citroen experienced significant declines. This could be due to a lack of suitable products, although even established carmakers like Honda have resorted to offering attractive discounts to drive sales growth.

Discounts are not limited to the mainstream market and can also be found in the luxury segment. Luxury carmakers offer attractive loan deals through their finance arms to show volumes, often at rates lower than those offered by banks. There are also instances where dealers are asked to pick up cars to demonstrate monthly volumes, which are then sold off as unregistered vehicles at significant discounts.

The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) has created confusion among Indian consumers. Currently, the EV market offers limited choices, mostly retrofitted variants of internal-combustion engine cars. However, purpose-built EVs are expected to enter the market around 2025-26, providing better options for consumers. Major automakers like Tata Motors, Mahindra, Maruti-Suzuki, Hyundai, and Kia are working on upcoming EV models.

Despite potential economic uncertainty after the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Hyundai remains committed to its plans for a 'Made In India' EV, similar to a C-segment SUV, by 2025. This raises the question of whether buying a new vehicle at this time might lead to owning a car that could become obsolete in a few years.

In summary, while the Indian automotive industry has shown impressive growth, concerns about underlying issues such as discounts, declining sales for some manufacturers, and the impending shift towards EVs raise questions about the future of the market.

### [Bangladeshi Muslims are building a 300-yr-old Kali temple. Now they want Modi’s help](https://theprint.in/ground-reports/bangladeshi-muslims-are-building-a-300-yr-old-kali-temple-now-they-want-modis-help/1841292/)

The 300-year-old Sasan Kali temple in Bangladesh's Magura district was partially destroyed in the 2000 floods. Now, both Muslims and Hindus are coming together to rebuild the temple and are seeking assistance from the governments of Bangladesh and India. The village of Basurdhuljhuri, where the temple is located, serves as a symbol of secularism in a country that has been witnessing communal violence during Hindu festivities.

Every year, journalist Sahidul Hasan Khokon returns to his native village for the Kali pujo at the temple. This year, he and his friends plan to form a committee to restore the temple to its original glory. Despite its current modest appearance, the temple attracts millions of devotees who believe that their wishes will be granted by the goddess Kali.

In 2001, there was no Kali pujo due to the flood, but Muslim neighbors contributed funds and resources to help construct a temporary temple for the Hindus in the village. Now, the community wants to build a proper temple and hopes for support from both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments. They cite a similar project funded by India in Natore district as a precedent.

The Kali temple at Basurdhuljhuri holds historical significance and requires a budget of at least fifteen lakh Bangladeshi Taka for construction. Bengali Hindus in West Bengal and Bangladesh worship Goddess Kali during Diwali, and the Sasan Kali form is revered in certain temples like the one in Basurdhuljhuri.

The story of Hindus and Muslims coming together to rebuild a Kali temple is seen as an example of syncretic culture defeating fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh. Many individuals, such as actress Ashna Habib Bhabna, appreciate this display of unity and hope for the prompt construction of the temple.

For Sahidul Hasan Khokon, supporting the temple's restoration is not only about rebuilding a part of his childhood, but also about defending his belief system in the face of temple attacks. He hopes that both the Bangladeshi and Indian governments will help restore this shared heritage.

A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology found that people are more likely to fact-check social media posts and revise their initial beliefs when paired with someone from a different cultural background.

The need for the SC to pass an order on seizing devices from journalists is stressed, urging action rather than preaching. J&K Police's adoption of GPS-enabled ankle trackers is seen as a smart move for Indian policing. Angelo Mathews' dismissal in cricket is justified as Bangladesh embraces a more aggressive approach. Air pollution continues to be a topic of debate, with calls for a strategy to tackle dust and demonstrate commitment.

The Maharashtra government is working to identify all Marathas who were once part of the Kunbi caste before the January 2 deadline for their reservation quota. District officials are scrambling to complete the identification process, with more than 300-400 government officials involved in each taluka. The government has directed districts to search various documents and publish Kunbi references found. Afterward, people will be asked to submit claims for caste certificates based on their genealogy. However, there are challenges such as old and delicate records, missing last names, and discrepancies between siblings' castes. Scanning the documents has been a challenge, with smartphone cameras being used due to the issues with regular scanners. The records are in different scripts, so Modi script readers and translators have been employed to identify the word "Kunbi" in various formats. Despite the difficulties, progress is being made, with some districts having already found thousands of Kunbi records.

### [Unlike AAP’s corruption in Delhi, UP’s excise policy is transparent: UP minister Nitin Agarwal](https://theprint.in/india/unlike-aaps-corruption-in-delhi-ups-excise-policy-is-transparent-up-minister-nitin-agarwal-2/1841972/)

The Uttar Pradesh Excise Minister, Nitin Agarwal, has accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi of engaging in corrupt practices that benefit the "liquor mafia." He stated that unlike Delhi, where one person can have more than two liquor shops, Uttar Pradesh restricts individuals to a maximum of two liquor shops. Agarwal highlighted that no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption have occurred during the current term of the Yogi Adityanath-led government. The excise policy of the Delhi government for 2021-22 came under scrutiny, leading to a recommendation for a CBI investigation into alleged irregularities by the Lieutenant Governor. Agarwal criticized the AAP for blaming the BJP and suggested that the leaders responsible for the excise scam were involved with the liquor mafia. Both the CBI and the ED are investigating the excise policy cases.

Agarwal emphasized that the UP excise department differs from Delhi's as it provides a level-playing field and operates on a pro-industry policy. He mentioned that the previous policies were not transparent and favored the liquor mafia. The minister stated that the current government welcomes anyone interested in doing business in the state and highlighted the revenue growth of the excise department since the formation of the BJP government in 2017. The target is to reach a revenue figure of Rs 50,000 crore in the current financial year and Rs 80,000 crore by 2027.

Agarwal also mentioned that there have been no deaths due to spurious liquor consumption in Uttar Pradesh during CM Adityanath's second term. He explained that deaths occur when local-level liquor production involves mixing jaggery with urea, which becomes poisonous if methyl alcohol is added. Agarwal assured that country liquor made in distilleries in Uttar Pradesh is safe. The department targets an annual growth rate of 8-10% and sells one crore cases of country liquor per month. Country liquor contributes 44% to the department's total revenue.

The festive seasons in India can take a toll on the skin, leading to a dull and tired complexion. Winter pollution and indulgence in rich foods can further worsen skin issues. To maintain a glowing complexion, dermatologists recommend taking a vitamin B supplement, drinking plenty of water, and applying moisturizer regularly. Home remedies such as using vinegar and lime juice for dandruff or shampooing with beer can also help. Seeking advice from a dermatologist, especially in areas with heavy pollution, is advised. For specific skin issues, treatments like microdermabrasion and exfoliation creams can be effective. However, it is important not to try new treatments right before important events. Hydration, proper cleansing, and moisturizing are essential steps in a skincare routine. Using a micellar water for makeup removal and a gentle cleanser is recommended. Regular exfoliation and sunscreen application are also important. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for overall skin health. Following these skincare steps can ensure that the skin reflects the joy and brightness of the festive season.

The Chief of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Om Prakash Rajbhar, has stated that his party is prepared for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and has requested five seats from the BJP, their alliance partner, for the general elections. Rajbhar also mentioned that the opposition India bloc does not pose a challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as the constituent parties within the opposition fight among themselves. In response to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav's statement on contesting in 65 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Rajbhar claimed that Yadav wants Narendra Modi to become the prime minister again, as the Congress becoming strong in Uttar Pradesh would weaken the Samajwadi Party. Rajbhar criticized Yadav's PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) strategy, stating that the Samajwadi Party only benefits the Yadavs and not the backward classes. SBSP won six seats in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party and later formally joined the NDA. Rajbhar dismissed the threat of the opposition India bloc, describing it as not a challenge and citing Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's controversial comments in the assembly on women. SBSP, with a significant presence among the OBC Rajbhar caste, aims to contest a few parliamentary seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh and contiguous areas of Bihar. Regarding seat-sharing for the 2024 elections, Rajbhar stated that the SBSP has sought three seats in Uttar Pradesh and two in Bihar from the BJP. Although discussions on seat-sharing are yet to be held, the party is laying groundwork in Bihar. Rajbhar did not disclose the specific seats his party has requested. The SBSP was previously in an alliance with the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and won four seats, and Rajbhar served as a minister during Yogi Adityanath's first term. After formally rejoining the NDA in July, there is speculation about Rajbhar's return to the cabinet and the induction of another OBC leader, Dara Singh Chauhan.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has released a white paper blaming the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government for the economic crisis in Pakistan, according to a report by Dawn. The PTI claims that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, their government managed to put the economy on a path of rapid growth. The white paper argues that the PDM government, which came into power through a regime change conspiracy, reversed the economic gains achieved by the PTI-led government and caused more economic damage than natural disasters and the pandemic combined. The white paper highlights that when the PTI took office in 2018, the economy was on the verge of collapse, with various economic indicators such as an overvalued Pakistani rupee and a high current account deficit. The document also criticizes the previous government's mismanagement of the energy sector, particularly in relation to the overbuilding of power supply through imported fuel plants. The white paper states that the PTI government had to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance, which came with tough conditions such as increasing taxes and tariffs. Despite facing a global commodity super cycle that led to higher prices for petroleum products, edible oil, and coal, the PTI government was able to maintain control over inflation rates. The white paper also emphasizes that the PTI government accumulated additional debt compared to the previous government, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In related news, the PTI has canceled its public gathering in Karachi after the district administration denied permission. The PTI described the attitude of the authorities towards the party as unfair and stated that they were being denied a level-playing field.

Three babies died in a neonatal unit in northern Gaza after the hospital went "out of service" due to continuous Israeli fire in the vicinity. The hospital is currently treating 36 babies and providing shelter for around 20,000 displaced people.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the burden of expectations and individual records carried by cricket players Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. It questions the notion that they prioritized personal milestones over the team's success, suggesting that this accusation arises only when they approach a century. The article argues that intent cannot be judged based on a player's stroke play from 80 to 100, just as a bowler shouldn't be faulted for leaking runs in search of a wicket. The obsession with records in cricket is highlighted, with numerous examples mentioned, including Tendulkar's records. It emphasizes that Kohli understands the fans' obsession but states that breaking records isn't what truly drives his cricket. The article also addresses the criticism faced by players who are deemed good enough only for quick innings and argues that match situations and team requirements take precedence over personal milestones. It concludes by suggesting that individual records can coexist with team victories and questions whether fans can accept a Kohli century in a World Cup final loss.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that over 800 people have been killed and more than 4.8 million people displaced in the past six months due to armed insurgency in Ardamata, Sudan's West Darfur region. The UN warns that the escalating violence in Darfur raises concerns of a repeat of the atrocities committed two decades ago. The conflict has resulted in the destruction of close to 100 shelters and extensive looting, including UNHCR relief items. In the past, thousands were killed and millions displaced during fighting between government forces and rebel groups in Darfur. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide has warned that continued fighting, including attacks based on ethnicity, could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. The UN refugee agency expresses alarm over reports of sexual violence, torture, arbitrary killings, extortion, and targeting of specific ethnic groups. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, urges an immediate end to the fighting and respect for civilians to avoid another catastrophe. Since mid-April, over 4.8 million people have been displaced within Sudan, with an additional 1.2 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Over 8,000 people have fled to Chad in the last week alone, according to UNHCR.

Novo Nordisk has announced new data that suggests the heart protective benefits of its obesity treatment, Wegovy, are not solely due to weight loss. The drug, which has been shown to help patients lose an average of 15% of their weight, also reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from heart disease by 20%, according to early data from the company's select trial. The study found that the cardiovascular benefits of Wegovy appeared almost immediately after starting treatment, suggesting they were not solely a result of weight loss. The drug also demonstrated a reduction in non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death. The study's authors note that while the mechanisms behind Wegovy's cardiovascular protection remain speculative, it has a consistent effect on associated risk factors such as inflammation, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. However, the trial did report adverse side effects, primarily gastrointestinal disorders like nausea and vomiting, in almost 1,500 patients taking Wegovy compared to 718 patients in the placebo group. Novo Nordisk expects to have Wegovy's label updated to include the heart benefits in the U.S. and EU next year.

### [Turbulent winters are coming. Blame El Niño and global warming combo](https://theprint.in/environment/turbulent-winters-are-coming-blame-el-nino-and-global-warming-combo/1841694/)

According to a new forecast from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the climate pattern known as "El Niño" is predicted to intensify over the winter, potentially leading to a winter of extreme weather, particularly in the US. El Niño refers to a rise in sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, which results in warmer-than-average weather globally. After three years of a cooling phase called La Niña, El Niño is returning at a time when the world is already experiencing high temperatures due to climate change. As a result, NOAA predicts warmer-than-average temperatures in wide areas of the US, along with above-average rainfall in some southern states. El Niño's impact extends beyond the Americas, with potential hotter and drier weather in areas like Australia and Indonesia, and increased hurricane activity in the Pacific Ocean. Studies suggest that global warming may lead to stronger El Niño phases, and climate-related risks are a top concern for risk experts. Mitigating and adapting to climate change is seen as the most pressing issue of the next decade.

### [Can taking salt off the table help prevent diabetes? It’s not that simple](https://theprint.in/health/can-taking-salt-off-the-table-help-prevent-diabetes-its-not-that-simple/1841665/)

A new study from Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that salt consumption may be linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the study is an observational study and cannot prove causation, only association. The data used to assess salt intake was based on a simple question, making it difficult to accurately estimate the amount of salt associated with an increased risk. Most salt intake comes from processed foods rather than added at the table. The study also found a weak association between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but did not provide specific recommendations for reducing salt intake. The key takeaway is that maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet are known to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) plans to maintain its diplomatic ties with Israel despite the international outcry over the war in Gaza. The UAE aims to have a moderating influence on Israel's campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. The mounting death toll in Gaza has stirred outrage in Arab capitals, but the UAE has publicly condemned Israel's actions and called for an end to the violence. The UAE is also working to moderate the public positions of other Arab states to facilitate a return to dialogue once the war ends. The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and has no plans to sever diplomatic ties. The UAE's motivation for establishing ties with Israel includes shared concerns over Iran and economic-driven realignment of foreign policy. Despite their close ties, Abu Dhabi has been concerned about Israel's right-wing government's expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and visits to the Al Aqsa mosque compound. The displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan is seen as a red line for Abu Dhabi. The UAE has distanced itself from Hamas, viewing them as a threat to regional stability. They have played a significant role in opposing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Sudan.

### [Study gives more insight into bacterium’s protective role in chronic rhinosinusitis](https://theprint.in/science/study-gives-more-insight-into-bacteriums-protective-role-in-chronic-rhinosinusitis/1841441/)

The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been increasing in Japan and around the world. CRS is an inflammatory condition that causes symptoms like nasal congestion, discharge, trouble breathing, face pain, and loss of smell. Treating CRS is challenging because it presents in various ways. There are two categories: eosinophilic (ECRS) and non-eosinophilic (non-ECRS) CRS. ECRS is associated with higher levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that releases pro-inflammatory substances, in the nasal and sinus tissues.

The rise in CRS is influenced by environmental factors, which in turn are affected by lifestyle changes. The role of the nasal microbiome in the development of ECRS has not been clear. To address this, a research team from the University of Fukui conducted a study on CRS in a Japanese population, specifically focusing on the nasal microbiome. They collected nasal swabs from 143 subjects, including those with ECRS, non-ECRS, and healthy controls.

The researchers found significant differences in the microbiome diversity between the CRS and control groups, indicating the involvement of the nasal microbiome in the disease. Additionally, they observed distinct microbiome compositions between the ECRS and non-ECRS groups. The bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F nucleatum) was found to be less abundant in patients with ECRS. Metagenomic analyses showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis was greater in patients with non-ECRS compared to ECRS.

Based on these findings, the researchers speculated that LPS produced by F nucleatum may be linked to the pathogenesis of both ECRS and non-ECRS. Further experiments demonstrated that LPS derived from F nucleatum suppressed the expression of ALOX15, an enzyme involved in nasal polyps and eosinophil-related inflammation.

The study concludes that disruptions in the nasal microbiome likely play a crucial role in ECRS. Understanding this could lead to the development of more effective strategies for treating CRS. The researchers believe that the microbiome may also have an impact on other allergic diseases and suggest future studies for probiotic development and lifestyle modifications to prevent chronic sinusitis.

A recent study published in Radiology found that low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening can significantly increase the cure rate for early-stage lung cancer over a 20-year period. The study revealed that individuals who received a CT screening-based diagnosis of lung cancer had an estimated 81% survival rate after 20 years. Among those diagnosed, 81% had stage I illness, and 87% of them had an 87% long-term survival rate. The study emphasized the importance of routine early screening, as only 21% of lung cancers are currently diagnosed at an early stage in the United States. Additionally, the study highlighted that symptoms mainly occur in late-stage lung cancer, making early screening crucial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for adults aged 50 to 80 with a 20-pack-year smoking history.

The article discusses the impact of heatwaves that occurred in July and August of the previous year, causing widespread disruptions such as forest fires, water and food shortages, and hurricanes resulting in numerous deaths. The global momentum for addressing climate change is increasing, and world leaders will discuss effective solutions at COP28, which will be held in Dubai from November 30 to December 12. The conference marks a turning point after the Paris Agreement (COP21) in 2015, where countries committed to limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and making efforts to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The Paris Agreement focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting technology transfer and adaptation to carbon-free economies. The agreement's provisions include two review processes until 2025. It entered into force in 2016 after being signed by 195 countries and ratified by 191 out of 197 countries.

COP28 will initiate the first global stocktake of progress made in implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement, measuring countries' efforts to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The United Nations emphasizes the need to recalibrate the course due to the significant increase in global temperatures. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres acknowledges the challenges faced by developing countries in responding to climate change and calls for funding support.

Air pollution's detrimental impact on health, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO issued new Air Quality Guidelines, emphasizing the need to reduce suffering and save lives through improved air quality.

Fossil fuels are identified as the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions and around 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. To address the climate challenge, emissions must be reduced by nearly half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050. The UN emphasizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean, accessible, and sustainable sources of energy.

Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water, waste, and geothermal energy, are highlighted as effective alternatives to fossil fuels. While cleaner energy sources are gaining ground, fossil fuels still dominate global energy production with over 80% contribution.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for urgent action to address climate change, particularly in light of recent extreme weather events and their devastating consequences.

### [Urban land pattern may hold key to reduce exposure to weather extremes, study finds](https://theprint.in/india/urban-land-pattern-may-hold-key-to-reduce-exposure-to-weather-extremes-study-finds/1841368/)

Scientists from the universities of Delaware and Wyoming have found that the layout of cities can help in reducing population exposure to future weather extremes. The design of urban landscapes, including how buildings are spread out or clustered, seems to be more important than the size of a city. The researchers investigated how changes in urban land and population will affect future populations' exposures to weather extremes by the end of the 21st century. Well-planned urban land patterns can reduce population exposures to weather extremes, regardless of the size of a city. The findings encourage researchers and practitioners to reconsider how cities are designed and built to be more resilient to climate risks. The researchers looked at urban areas across the US and predicted their growth by 2100. They analyzed how these urban land changes might affect weather extremes and the number of people potentially exposed to these events. Carefully designed urban land patterns can reduce the increase in risks caused by climate change.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is using its position as an oil producer and host of the upcoming United Nations climate talks to urge secretive state-run oil companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The UAE's effort, called the Global Decarbonisation Alliance, aims to have a significant impact at the COP28 negotiations in Dubai. Led by Sultan al-Jaber, head of this year's climate talks and chief of the UAE's national oil company, the initiative suggests using resources to clean up petroleum production rather than transitioning away from fossil fuels. It seeks to engage national oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Colombia's Ecopetrol, which account for half of global crude production and hold 90% of the world's oil and gas reserves. While environmentalists criticize the lack of stringency and inclusion of emissions from oil and gas produced and sold, supporters hope that public and international pressure will encourage these companies to adopt eco-friendly practices. A spokesperson for COP28 confirmed that 20 companies, both national and investor-owned, have already joined the alliance. Critics also express concerns about the leadership of al-Jaber, as his role overseeing negotiations while heading Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) may lack impartiality. Nonetheless, the potential alliance of oil producers represents the first such effort to institutionalize engagement on climate emissions within the industry.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) reported a 20% drop in net profit for the September quarter due to lower oil prices and decreased output. The company's net profit was Rs 10,216 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs 12,826 crore in the same period last year. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline in net profit for ONGC. The decline in profit is mainly attributed to lower oil prices and slightly lower oil and gas production. However, the company expects production to increase in the current quarter with the start of production from a new oilfield in the KG basin. ONGC also faced challenges such as a shutdown in Panna-Mukta for commissioning a new crude oil pipeline and disruptions caused by Cyclone Biparjoy. Despite the current decline in production, ONGC anticipates compensation with the commencement of additional production from new projects.

### [5 green flags that show your employer is serious about making you find ‘purpose’ in work](https://theprint.in/feature/5-green-flags-that-show-your-employer-is-serious-about-making-you-find-purpose-in-work/1841273/)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The concept of purpose at work is important to many individuals, with 70% of respondents in a survey stating that their personal sense of purpose is defined by their work. Organizations often use the promise of purpose to attract and retain employees, offering opportunities to contribute to social or ecological causes beyond just completing tasks. However, sometimes employers fail to deliver on this promise, engaging in "purpose-washing" where they make promises but don't follow through with consistent actions.

To determine if an employer's promise of purpose is genuine, there are five green flags to look for. Firstly, the organization should dedicate resources such as time, money, training, and staff towards purpose-driven work. Secondly, they should provide well-being support to protect employees from exploitation and burnout. Thirdly, purpose should be made relevant to all roles within the organization, encouraging collaboration beyond specific departments. Fourthly, diverse representation across gender, race, occupations, and organizational levels can facilitate purpose-driven aims. Lastly, organizations should provide opportunities for employees to see the impact of their work, whether through reports, case studies, or feedback conversations.

While purpose-driven work may be justified by its benefits to the organization and bottom line, solely relying on this justification can disconnect employees from their values over time. Instead, organizations need to redefine what counts as doing business and adapt their operations accordingly. This includes giving autonomy to purpose-driven workers, aligning performance indicators and reward systems with efforts to change, and creating career paths that value and support purpose-driven projects.

Ultimately, purpose can provide meaningful work for those interested in finding solutions to social and ecological challenges. Falling victim to purpose-washing can negatively affect one's career and well-being, so it's crucial to identify companies that demonstrate commitment, authenticity, and support for purpose-driven initiatives.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a rush to extract cobalt, a crucial component in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and low-carbon innovations. The country's Katanga region holds more cobalt reserves than the rest of the world combined. However, this exploitation of resources is reminiscent of King Leopold II's brutal reign, during which millions of Congolese lost their lives. Today, the harsh realities of cobalt mining involve hazardous conditions, including child labor and toxic exposure. Companies in the supply chain claim to uphold human rights standards but often fail to address these issues effectively. International coalitions, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), aim to ensure clean supply chains and eliminate child labor in cobalt mining. However, on-ground observations reveal extreme suffering and environmental devastation in the Congo due to cobalt extraction.

Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has issued a warning about the impact of higher oil prices on global economic growth. The agency's Global Economic Outlook predicts that potential disruptions in the Middle East's oil supply due to conflicts could cause oil prices to surge, leading to a significant decrease in global GDP growth and a rise in inflation. Fitch's simulations show that if oil prices reach USD 120 per barrel in 2024 and USD 100 per barrel in 2025, there could be a 0.4 percentage point reduction in world GDP growth in 2024, with a lingering 0.1 percentage point lower growth in 2025. The impact is expected to be felt across the board, with most countries experiencing longer-lasting effects on GDP levels. Inflation rates would also be elevated in 2024, with India, Turkey, and Poland being particularly affected. Fitch highlights the potential ripple effects of an oil price shock, such as tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets. The report emphasizes the intricate web of global economic interdependencies and the vulnerabilities arising from geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has criticized the governors of Punjab and Tamil Nadu for delaying approval of bills passed by their respective state legislatures. The court warned Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit against "playing with fire" and expressed concern over his Chennai counterpart, who was accused of withholding assent to 12 bills. The court emphasized that as the titular head of the state, the governor cannot question the validity of an assembly session or indefinitely delay decisions on bills. It cited Article 200 of the Constitution, which outlines the governor's options when presented with a bill. The court also questioned the Punjab government for repeatedly adjourning the budget session instead of proroguing it. In a similar case, the court deemed the delay by Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi in granting assent to bills a "matter of serious concern" and sought a response from the central government.

### [South Korea: President Yoon’s war against “fake news” raises concerns over free speech](https://theprint.in/world/south-korea-president-yoons-war-against-fake-news-raises-concerns-over-free-speech/1840994/)

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing criticism for allegedly suppressing free speech by targeting news outlets and journalists critical of his government. His allies have labeled this as an "existential threat" to South Korea. Yoon's party leader has even called for the death penalty in a case of "high treason" against a Korean news outlet that published articles critical of the president. Yoon, a former prosecutor, is employing lawsuits, state regulators, and criminal investigations to clamp down on what he deems disinformation, primarily targeting news organizations. This has led to repeated raids on journalists' homes and newsrooms accused of spreading "fake news." Critics argue that Yoon is using defamation suits and mobilizing prosecutors and regulators to suppress speech instead of fighting disinformation. Many South Koreans are proud of their hard-won democracy and free press, but there are concerns about censorship and democratic backsliding under Yoon's 18-month-old presidency. The crackdown intensified in September when an independent news organization was singled out for its report last year. South Koreans increasingly turn to YouTube and other online sources for news due to distrust of traditional media. Defamation charges in South Korea can result in fines or imprisonment up to seven years. The government's definition of fake news raises questions about drawing boundaries between disinformation and free speech.
