### [Putin in Mongolia amid ICC arrest warrant: Is the country defying international law?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/russian-president-vladimir-putin-visits-mongolia-amid-icc-arrest-warrant-is-the-country-defying-international-law-13811066.html)

Vladimir Putin's visit to Mongolia, a country legally obligated to arrest him due to an active ICC warrant for war crimes, has sparked international controversy. 

While Ukraine and international organizations are urging Mongolia to uphold its obligations, Russia maintains that all aspects of the visit have been discussed and agreed upon. 

Mongolia's critical dependence on Russia for energy and infrastructure complicates its position, forcing it to balance international legal commitments with its own national interests.  The visit coincides with several key events, including the anniversary of a historical Soviet-Mongolian victory and the potential expansion of a Russian gas pipeline through Mongolia, highlighting the country's strategic importance in Russia's energy plans. 



The situation presents a dilemma for Mongolia, which is trying to maintain its image as a neutral mediator while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of its powerful neighbors.

### [Will Israel’s biggest protests mark the end of Benjamin Netanyahu’s rule?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-protests-strike-benjamin-netanyahu-rule-future-13811077.html)

Massive protests erupted in Israel following the recovery of six hostage bodies from Gaza.  The protesters, angered by the prime minister's handling of the situation, blame Netanyahu for the deaths and demand his resignation.

A general strike called by the Histadrut trade union brought the country to a standstill for several hours.  Demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu's home and the US embassy, chanting slogans and holding signs calling for his removal. 

While Netanyahu maintains his commitment to ending Hamas's threat and asserts control over the Philadelphi Corridor, he faces growing criticism from both the opposition and within his own cabinet. Experts believe that  Netanyahu's  stubborn stance stems from fear of losing his coalition partners and concerns about his legacy.

AP Dhillon, a Canadian rapper of Indian origin, rose to fame with chart-topping songs like "Majhail" and "Brown Munde." He gained further recognition through his Amazon Prime documentary series, "AP Dhillon: First of a Kind."

The gang has a history of  criminality, including the murder of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala.  The Bishnoi gang has issued threats on social media, alleging that Dhillon's connection with Salman Khan makes him a target.  They allege that Salman will meet a "dog's death" if he doesn't stay within his limits. 


Salman Khan has also been targeted by the Bishnoi gang, who feel he killed a blackbuck, which is revered by the Bishnoi community.

### [Is chicken tikka masala British? Tracing the origin of the dish amid row over TasteAtlas' ranking](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/chicken-tikka-masala-british-indian-origin-tasteatlas-rankings-13810942.html)

Chicken tikka masala's origins continue to be debated, despite its widespread popularity in the UK.  Often cited as the inventor, Ali Ahmed Aslam, a Pakistani-Scottish chef, claimed to have created the dish in 1972 at his Glasgow restaurant, Shish Mahal, to accommodate a customer's preference for sauce with their chicken tikka. 

However, other claims attribute the dish to Indian chefs in the 1950s and even earlier. Some believe it evolved from Indian butter chicken, while others suggest Bangladeshi chefs in the UK in the 1960s developed it to suit British palates.  The debate highlights the complex interplay of culinary traditions and cultural influences in the evolution of food.

### [Are you a symbiosexual? The new sexual identity that everyone's talking about](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-symbiosexual-new-sexual-identity-13810901.html)

A new study published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour explores symbiosexuality, a phenomenon where individuals are attracted to couples rather than single people.  The study, conducted at Seattle University,  found that people who identify as symbiosexuals are drawn to the energy and dynamics within existing relationships.

Participants in the study described a genuine desire for the "whole" of the relationship, seeking validation and intimacy from multiple partners.  They tend to be extroverted and less prone to jealousy. 

Symbiosexuality, distinguished from polyamory, values the unique dynamics of each relationship.  Further research is underway to understand the mental health implications and relationship satisfaction associated with this evolving sexual identity.  Researchers hope to reduce stigma and expand the understanding of desire within sexuality studies.

Additionally, elephant dung is being burned to deter wolves from populated areas. A specialized task force comprising forest, police, and fire departments is tracking the wolves using thermal drones and CCTV cameras. The situation has triggered panic in neighboring Bihar, but experts criticize media sensationalization of the attacks and advise villagers to be vigilant and take precautions.

### [‘How can house be demolished’: What is ‘bulldozer justice’ that Supreme Court has come down on?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bulldozer-justice-supreme-court-criticism-explained-13810871.html)

The Supreme Court of India has criticized the practice of 'bulldozer justice,' where properties of accused individuals are demolished.  The court emphasized that even convicted individuals cannot have their houses demolished without following proper legal procedures. It stressed the need for guidelines to ensure that concerns regarding this practice are addressed. 

While the court acknowledged that illegal constructions should be removed, it clarified that there should be due process and no blanket demolishing of properties solely based on accusations. 



'Bulldozer justice' has been used in several states, notably Uttar Pradesh, following claims of criminal activity or communal violence. This practice has drawn criticism from legal experts and human rights organizations, who argue it violates the principles of natural justice and punishes families for the alleged actions of one individual.

NASA's DART mission, which impacted the asteroid Dimorphos in 2022, may create the first human-made meteor shower called the Dimorphids.  

Debris from the collision, estimated at over 2 million pounds, could reach Earth and Mars within the next decade.  While not posing a risk to Earth, these fragments could create a faint meteor shower, primarily visible from the southern hemisphere around May. 

Scientists used data from the LICIACube satellite to simulate the debris trajectories.

 The European Space Agency's Hera mission, launching in October, will further investigate the DART impact and the resulting debris cloud.

The Hema Committee report in Malayalam cinema, which exposed sexual harassment, has prompted calls for the release of a similar report on the Telugu film industry (Tollywood).  A sub-committee report on sexual harassment in Tollywood, submitted to the Telangana government in 2022, has remained unpublished.  The Tollywood report followed a protest by actress Sri Reddy highlighting abuse in the industry.  

Telugu actresses, including Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Lakshmi Manchu, have urged the government to release the findings, citing the need to establish a safe working environment for women in the industry.  The sub-committee found issues like unequal pay, lack of written contracts, and poor working conditions, but specifics about harassment were not detailed in the report. Despite its availability, the report faces a lack of urgency from both industry stakeholders and the government.

The deaths of six more hostages held by Hamas following the October 7 attack have  intensified public pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal for their release. The hostages, identified as Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi, and Master Seargant Ori Danino, were found dead with gunshot wounds in a tunnel in southern Gaza.  

This latest tragedy has ignited protests across Israel, with organizers estimating 500,000 people joined nationwide demonstrations demanding Netanyahu make a deal with Hamas. The families of hostages, including Goldberg-Polin’s parents who had campaigned internationally for his release, have expressed outrage and accused the government of prioritizing other objectives over saving their loved ones.  

Within Israel's government, tensions are mounting with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant clashing with Netanyahu over his approach to the negotiations. Gallant, along with other security officials, has warned that time is running out and accused Netanyahu of  putting political calculations ahead of the hostages' lives. A  general strike, the first since the start of the war, is planned for Monday in a show of solidarity with the hostages' families. 

While Netanyahu blames Hamas for the stalled negotiations and maintains his stance on "total victory,"  the public outcry and internal dissent signal a possible turning point in his strategy.

### [How Pakistan’s Peshawar has emerged as mpox 'epicentre'](https://www.firstpost.com/health/pakistan-peshawar-mpox-epicentre-13810742.html)

Pakistan's Peshawar city is emerging as a potential epicenter for the mpox virus, with five cases reported, most recently a traveler returning from  the Gulf. This rise in cases has prompted concerns about the virus's spread from travellers from West Asia. Officials are increasing screening measures at airports and are working to monitor the situation closely.  The mpox virus was declared a global health emergency by the WHO due to the emergence of a new strain, clade lb, which appears to be spreading rapidly. 

While no cases of clade lb have been reported in Pakistan, other Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines have also reported cases. Countries like India, China, Japan, and South Korea are on high alert and have intensified surveillance measures.  UNICEF is working with global partners to secure mpox vaccines for affected countries.

### [How the Canada border is becoming the preferred choice for Indians to illegally enter the US](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/canada-border-indians-us-illegal-immigration-donkey-route-13810764.html)

A record number of Indians, 5,152 in June alone, attempted to illegally enter the US through the Canada-US border, surpassing the number using the traditional Mexico route. This surge is attributed to Canada's accessible visa process and relatively unguarded border stretches, making it a preferable alternative to more perilous "donkey routes". While Canada offers a safer pathway, experts warn of its risks, citing the tragic case of an Indian family who perished near the border during a blizzard. Indians, mostly from Gujarat and Punjab, are seeking a better economic future in the US, driven by factors like limited job opportunities and a struggling agricultural sector in India.

John, in turn, refuted these accusations and accused the party leadership of silencing her and creating an unsafe environment.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has secured a historic victory in the state election of Thuringia, marking the first time a far-right party has won a state election in post-World War II Germany. This victory comes on the heels of a strong second-place finish in neighboring Saxony. 

The AfD's success is attributed to growing dissatisfaction with the national government, particularly in eastern Germany, where the party's anti-immigration stance and opposition to policies such as climate change measures have resonated with voters. 

The far-right party's rise poses a significant challenge to the stability of the national coalition government led by Chancellor Scholz. Although other parties like Sahra Wagenknecht's BSW have also gained traction, the AfD's success underscores a deepening political divide in Germany.

Eating quickly can have several negative impacts on our health.  It can lead to excessive gas and bloating due to increased air intake and gas production.  Rushed eating also requires our stomach to produce more acid for digestion, causing discomfort and indigestion.  

Moreover, quickly eating prevents our brains from receiving  fullness signals from leptin, leading to overeating. Studies link fast eating to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, elevated triglyceride levels, and metabolic syndrome. 

Slowing down and chewing thoroughly allows for proper digestion,  regulates fullness cues, and ultimately contributes to better overall health.

The Netflix series "IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack" has sparked controversy for using Hindu names like Bhola and Shankar for the Pakistani terrorists involved in the 1999 hijacking. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya accuses the makers of legitimizing the terrorists' criminal intent, while historian Hindol Sengupta criticizes the show for glorifying them. 

Veteran journalist Vir Sanghvi alleges that the series serves as propaganda for Pakistan's ISI and portrays a whitewashed version of the hijacking. The series' creators, however, defend the use of these names, stating they were the aliases used by the hijackers throughout the incident. They cite sources, including the author of a book on the hijacking, who corroborate this claim. 


The Ministry of External Affairs also stated in 2000 that the hijackers were known by these aliases to the passengers.

Several studies, including the UK Million Women Study, have shown a correlation between height and an increased risk of developing cancer.  Taller individuals have a higher chance of developing cancers of the pancreas, large bowel, uterus, ovary, prostate, kidney, skin (melanoma), and breast. 

Two main theories attempt to explain this link:  a higher number of cells in taller individuals, potentially leading to more opportunities for genetic mutations, and elevated levels of the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). While research supports both explanations, further investigation is needed to fully understand the relationship between height and cancer risk.


Despite the slight elevated risk, it's crucial to remember that many factors influence cancer development. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, a healthy weight, sun safety, limited alcohol consumption, and not smoking, significantly reduces cancer risk, outweighing the impact of height.

A recent study suggests that cats may exhibit grieving behaviors after the loss of a fellow pet. Researchers observed changes in behavior like increased vocalization, attention-seeking, and reduced appetite in cats following the death of a companion animal. The strength of the bond and daily interactions between the cats were found to be factors influencing these behaviors.  While this study builds on previous research hinting at grief-like responses in cats, it's important to note that owner observations might be subjective and influenced by their own grief.  The study didn't investigate whether cats grieve for their human owners, leaving that question open for further research.

The increased use of Ozempic and similar weight-loss drugs is significantly impacting the fashion industry, particularly the second-hand luxury market. 

More people are selling larger clothing sizes as they experience weight loss due to these medications, leading to a surge in plus-size apparel listings on resale platforms like Poshmark and Vestiaire Collective.  This trend is also reflected in reports from brands like Lafayette 148 and Rent the Runway, where customers are buying smaller sizes.

However, this shift poses a challenge for resale platforms as they struggle to manage the surplus of larger clothing sizes and align their inventory with the changing demand.  This imbalance could result in unsold items ending up in landfills, highlighting the environmental implications of this trend.

Japan, known for its dedication to work, is promoting a four-day workweek to address a labor shortage.  While the government endorsed the idea in 2021, adoption has been slow. Companies are reluctant to change the prevailing culture that values long hours and dedication. 

Despite challenges, the government is encouraging businesses to adopt shorter workweeks through initiatives offering support and success stories. Some companies, including fast-fashion retailer Uniqlo and electronics giants, have successfully implemented four-day schedules.

 Advocates argue the change leads to reduced stress, improved well-being, and allows for a more balanced life, benefiting both employees and the company.  Critics, however, point out that some individuals may end up working just as many hours for less pay.

Recent studies suggest that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, may offer benefits beyond its original use for type 2 diabetes and weight loss. Research indicates that semaglutide could potentially slow down the ageing process.

Studies involving thousands of participants found that semaglutide may reverse kidney disease, prevent heart failure, lower high blood pressure, and reduce the risk of death from COVID-19. It also appears to reduce inflammation, potentially benefiting a variety of age-related diseases. 

Experts suggest that semaglutide, which mimics the hormone GLP-1, could become a "multi-purpose drug" protecting against a broad spectrum of health threats.  However, as with any medication, consultation with a doctor is crucial due to potential side effects.

### [How low birth rate in South Korea has forced it to turn to foreign nannies](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-low-birth-rate-in-south-korea-has-forced-it-to-turn-to-foreign-nannies-13809840.html)

South Korea's historically low fertility rate has prompted a pilot program to allow 100 Filipino nannies into the country to address a childcare shortage. The program aims to make affordable childcare accessible to families, particularly dual-income households, potentially encouraging higher birth rates.  

The nannies will work under an E-9 visa and be employed for six months in Seoul. While the government hopes this program will ease the childcare burden, concerns remain about the cost for families, along with criticism regarding labor standards and potential exploitation of foreign workers.  

Successful completion of the pilot program could lead to its expansion, but evaluation and addressing concerns regarding illegal immigration and fair treatment of workers are necessary before a full-scale implementation.

### [How Taliban's harsh new laws are setting women back decades](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-talibans-harsh-new-laws-are-setting-women-back-decades-13810007.html)

Following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, initial hopes for a more moderate regime have been dashed.  The Taliban leadership, under Hibatullah Akhundzada, has issued over 50 decrees, severely restricting social and individual freedoms. 

Women face particularly harsh restrictions, including bans on education beyond the age of 12, movement outside the home, and even speaking in public.  Public executions, flogging, and stoning are also back, reminiscent of the Taliban's 1990s rule.  

A Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (PVPV) has been established to enforce these laws, which empower the morality police to punish "vice" and un-Islamic behavior.  

These measures have effectively eliminated any distinction between the present regime and its previous, ostracized iteration.   The Taliban's recent actions raise serious concerns about human rights and the future of Afghanistan.

He returned in 1960, signing the Indus Water Treaty, a landmark agreement on water sharing.

Rajiv Gandhi later visited in both 1988 and 1989, hoping to improve relations. Atal Bihari Vajpayee made two significant trips – one in 1999  by bus to Lahore, resulting in the landmark Lahore Declaration, and another in 2004, emphasizing SAARC cooperation. Narendra Modi's unexpected visit in 2015, on the occasion of Sharif's birthday, was a positive step towards stronger bilateral ties.  

Each visit has had its successes and challenges, but all have been attempts to foster dialogue and peace in the often-contentious relationship between the two nations.

Upcoming regional elections in eastern Germany are being closely watched by Russia. Pro-Moscow parties, particularly the AfD and the new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), are expected to perform well. These parties align with Russian interests by opposing NATO, expressing skepticism towards the European Union, and calling for normalized relations with Russia, including an end to sanctions. Putin, who spent time in East Germany during his KGB days, sees a potential opportunity to regain influence in the region. 

The AfD and BSW's success could signify a shift in Germany's foreign policy, potentially weakening European unity and impacting NATO's stance against Russia. Putin's support for these parties reflects a strategic effort to undermine Western influence and reassert Russia's standing in Europe.

Alleged audio recordings of phone calls from the authority of Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College to the parents of a murdered doctor have sparked controversy.  The recordings, purportedly made on August 9th, reveal changing statements from a hospital official, raising questions about whether the institution initially attempted to conceal the crime.

The calls describe the doctor's condition as "a little ill," then "very critical," and finally, leading to the revelation that she had "died by suicide" or "passed away."  The last call occurred with the presence of police and hospital authorities.

These revelations have prompted accusations of insensitivity and a cover-up attempt by the hospital. The probe, initially handled by the Kolkata police, is now in the hands of the CBI following a directive from the Calcutta High Court.  The authenticity of the recordings is yet to be independently verified, and hospital officials have remained silent.  The case has drawn scrutiny from the Supreme Court and High Courts, leading to investigations into the delay in filing a formal complaint and the potential mishandling of evidence. The parents of the victim claim they were made to wait for three hours before learning about their daughter's death.

India has been seeking Holck's extradition for years to try him for his role in the case where a plane carrying weapons was dropped over Purulia, West Bengal.

In addition to promoting Trump, these fake accounts spread misinformation on various issues, including the recent assassination attempt against Trump, Kamala Harris's ethnicity, and US military aid to Ukraine. X has taken down a majority of these accounts, but the incident highlights the platform's vulnerability to manipulation and the spread of false information.

### [What is the tree-felling case that Chief Justice DY Chandrachud has taken up?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-tree-felling-case-that-chief-justice-dy-chandrachud-has-taken-up-13809364.html)

Two Supreme Court benches were handling different aspects of a contempt case against the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) regarding alleged unauthorized tree-cutting in Delhi's Ridge area. This resulted in a potential judicial standoff as one bench issued a contempt notice in April, while another bench took up a separate petition in May. 

The conflict arose due to concerns over potential contradictory judgments and a lack of adherence to judicial propriety. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of the DDA's environmental impact assessment and accusations of covering up the extent of tree felling.  

To prevent further conflict and ensure judicial coherence, Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud intervened and formed a new bench to take over the case,  with himself presiding over the hearing.

Two journalists from the now-defunct Hong Kong outlet Stand News, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam, are awaiting the verdict in a landmark sedition case.  This is Hong Kong's first such case involving media since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. 

They are charged with conspiracy to publish seditious materials under a colonial-era law increasingly used to target dissent following the 2019 anti-government protests.  Stand News, known for its critical reporting, was shut down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets. The prosecution alleges that the outlet acted as a political platform and published seditious articles, while the defense maintains that Stand News upheld freedom of speech.  



 The case has drawn international attention and is seen as a test of press freedom in Hong Kong.

Already, 157 animals have been culled, providing over 56,800 kilograms of meat for the relief program. This drastic measure highlights the dire situation facing Namibia and the region due to the ongoing drought.

### [What is Trump-flation? Why are economists worried about it?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-trump-flation-why-are-economists-worried-about-it-13809135.html)

The term "Trump-flation" refers to concerns about inflation potentially rising if Donald Trump wins a second term.  Economists worry about this because of several of Trump's stated policies, including imposing tariffs on imports, weakening the dollar, and potentially pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.  

These policies could lead to higher consumer prices. A 20% tariff on China, for example, could cost US households an additional $1,700 to $2,350 per month. Some economists believe that Trump's policies could lead to a surge in inflation, potentially echoing the situation in Turkey under President Erdogan, where inflation reached 85%. 

However, some argue that Trump's focus on tax cuts and replacing them with tariffs on international trade could be beneficial. They point out that income taxes are also a type of trade tax, and it's a matter of preference whether to tax domestic or international trade. Ultimately, the potential impact of Trump's policies on inflation remains a subject of debate.

The National Federation of Republican Assemblies (NFRA), a conservative organization, has sparked controversy by citing the 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court ruling to argue that Vice President Kamala Harris is ineligible to run for president. The NFRA claims that Harris, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy do not meet the Constitution's “natural-born citizen” requirement.

Their argument hinges on a strict interpretation of the clause, suggesting that only those born on US soil to two US citizen parents qualify. This stance draws on originalist legal philosophies and cites several Supreme Court cases, including Dred Scott,  which is widely considered one of the worst rulings in US history.

The NFRA's position has been widely criticized as legally flawed and racially insensitive. Legal experts argue that their interpretation contradicts established precedents and would have disqualified several early US presidents. 
Critics also point out that invoking Dred Scott to challenge a woman of color's eligibility for president resembles racial dog-whistling. While the NFRA claims their actions are solely based on legal arguments, the timing and targeting of their claim against Harris raise questions about its political motives, particularly in light of their endorsement of Donald Trump.

Maricopa County, Arizona, containing Phoenix and 4.5 million residents, holds significant weight in national elections.  

This was once a reliably Republican county, but its political landscape is shifting.  The 2020 election saw Biden defeat Trump, hinting at a trend towards more centrist leanings and fueled by a growing Hispanic population that tends to vote Democratic.

While the county still leans Republican, a significant portion of voters are unaffiliated, making the outcome of elections more unpredictable. Maricopa County also has a high early voting rate, adding complexity to the vote counting process.

Jashimuddin Rahmani, the leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), has been released from prison in Bangladesh. Rahmani was convicted for abetting the murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in 2013. The ABT is responsible for the killings of several other bloggers, writers, and activists in Bangladesh. Rahmani is known for his extremist views and support of Al Qaeda. He has authored books promoting violence against non-believers.
 
Experts believe that Rahmani's release poses a threat to India as the ABT has been attempting to establish a jihadi network in the country. They have allegedly collaborated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba to carry out attacks in India's northeast. The Indian authorities have arrested several ABT members in recent months.

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in 2014 remains a mystery, but Australian scientist Vincent Lyne proposes a new theory.  Lyne suggests the plane is located in a deep trench at the eastern end of the Broken Ridge in the Southern Indian Ocean, a site he believes was deliberately chosen by the pilot.

He bases his theory on a flight path generated from the pilot’s home simulator that intersects with the coordinates of this trench. Lyne argues that damage to the plane’s wings and flaps points to a “controlled ditching” rather than a catastrophic crash.  

While official investigations focused on the 7th arc, where the last satellite communication occurred, Lyne believes the evidence points to the deep trench as the final resting place of MH370.

Dutta was in contact with Sanjay Roy, the only person arrested in the case, on the day the body was found.  Suspicions arose due to alleged favors Dutta extended to Roy, including access to police quarters and a motorcycle, which Roy wasn't entitled to.  

Dutta also had connections to the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, who is also under CBI investigation. Photos of Dutta and the former principal together have surfaced on social media.

Israeli forces successfully rescued Farhan Al-Qadi, a 52-year-old Bedouin Israeli, from Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza. Held captive since October 7, he was found alive and in stable condition, marking the first time a hostage has been rescued alive from these tunnels. Guided by intelligence, special forces discovered Al-Qadi alone, leading to speculation that his captors fled upon realizing Israeli troops were nearby.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Al-Qadi, who expressed overwhelming relief and gratitude.

Al-Qadi, a father of 11, was working as an unarmed guard at the time of his abduction. His rescue brought immense joy to his family, who had endured a year of uncertainty. Al-Qadi's brother described the experience as "bringing him back from the dead," detailing the brutal conditions of captivity, including constant darkness and witnessing another hostage die. He had reportedly lost significant weight and suffered from untreated injuries. 


The rescue highlights the ongoing plight of hostages in Gaza, with 104 still held captive, and 34 presumed dead, following the October 7 attacks. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum emphasizes the need for more than just military operations to secure the release of the remaining hostages.

A phone conversation took place between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden. While India's readout mentioned discussions about the situation in Bangladesh, the US readout did not. 

India clarified that it's common practice for separate press releases to be issued following conversations, and the omission doesn't necessarily mean an issue wasn't discussed. Some geopolitical experts suggest the US's omission reflects growing unease with Bangladesh, while others believe the US focused mainly on Modi's recent visit to Ukraine. 


The US silence on Bangladesh, particularly concerning minority safety, has drawn attention.  Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, alleged in a reported undelivered speech that she was pressured by the US to allow a naval base on St. Martin's Island.



The situation in Bangladesh remains a point of contention, with differing perspectives on the US's role and stance.

Over 260 dinosaur footprints have been discovered in Brazil and Cameroon, separated by the Atlantic Ocean. These tracks, dating back to the Early Cretaceous period, provide insights into the environment of the Gondwana supercontinent. The footprints, consistent in age and shape, suggest a family of predators roamed both continents before they split apart.  

The majority of the fossils belong to three-toed theropod dinosaurs, with some possibly belonging to sauropods and ornithischians. Both regions where the footprints were found were once connected, forming a land bridge that allowed dinosaurs to travel between Africa and South America.  

The tracks offer valuable information about dinosaur behavior, including their gait, social interactions, and the environments they inhabited.

The report's findings have sparked controversy, with opposition parties accusing the ruling CPI(M) government of a cover-up and inaction. They point to alleged links between prominent figures in the industry and the ruling party, and question the government's delay in releasing the report. 

The government has defended its actions, stating it is committed to taking action against those implicated and implementing the report's recommendations.

The document has faced criticism for being outdated, unrealistic, and overly simplistic in its approach to complex issues.  Experts and lawmakers argue that it emphasizes control over understanding and facing sexual development, potentially perpetuating harmful rape myths.

### [UK takeaways crisis: The rising cost of fish and chips, other fast foods, explained](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-takeaways-crisis-rising-cost-of-fish-and-chips-other-fast-foods-explained-13808818.html)

The average price of fish and chips in the UK has risen by 52% over the past five years, reaching £9.88 in July 2024. This increase is higher than other popular takeaway meals like pizza, Indian, or Chinese food.  

Rising costs for chip shop owners, including energy, imported seafood, and potatoes, are the main drivers of this price surge.  Other factors contributing to the increase are tariffs on Russian seafood imports and the UK government's ban on single-use plastic packaging. The cost of living crisis has further exacerbated these pressures.

### [From Australia to Poland, how visa changes are making studying abroad more difficult and expensive](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/from-australia-to-poland-how-visa-changes-are-making-studying-abroad-more-difficult-and-expensive-13808782.html)

Disruptions in the international student visa landscape are impacting Indian students significantly.

 Australia has reduced its student intake by 20,000, barred loopholes extending visas, doubled student visa fees, and tightened English language requirements.  This, coupled with a crackdown on dependent visas,  has led to a steep decline in Indian student visa approvals and applications.

The UK has barred students from bringing their families unless they are on research programs or government-funded scholarships and tightened rules around post-study work visas.  This coupled with uncertainty surrounding the Graduate Route, has also dampened interest from Indian students.

 New Zealand has doubled its student visa fees, citing the need for a sustainable immigration system. Poland has tightened visa rules after a scandal involving student visa misuse for work purposes in the Schengen area. 

Canada, meanwhile, is capping study permits and reducing permanent residency nominations, potentially impacting 70,000 international students due to  changes in post-graduation work permit eligibility.

### [Could Ukraine's new homegrown weapon bypass Western restrictions and hit deep into Russia?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/ukraine-new-homegrown-weapon-bypass-western-restrictions-russia-13808775.html)

Ukraine has unveiled its new long-range weapon, the "Palianytsia," a domestically developed missile-drone hybrid with a range of up to 700 kilometers.  The weapon, named after a type of Ukrainian bread, was created to counter Russia's dominance in the skies and to bypass Western restrictions on using long-range missiles against targets deep inside Russia. 

The Palianytsia has been used in its first strike, targeting a Russian military base in occupied territory.  Ukrainian officials believe it will be a game changer, allowing them to strike deeper into enemy territory and erode Russia's military infrastructure. The weapon's development, which took about 18 months, was driven by the need to effectively respond to Russia's relentless bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure.

### [What’s the controversy surrounding Bangladesh floods and India’s Farakka barrage?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/bangladesh-floods-india-farakka-barrage-treaty-ganga-water-sharing-13808771.html)

Flooding in Bangladesh, which has resulted in 23 deaths and displacement of millions, has sparked accusations against India. 

 Bangladeshi reports claim the opening of the Farakka barrage in West Bengal is partially responsible for the deluge.  

India has refuted these allegations, stating that the barrage is not a dam and operates in accordance with the 1996 Ganga Water Treaty. 

The treaty ensures that a certain amount of water is released downstream from Farakka, particularly during specific periods.  

Indian officials have emphasized that the barrage operates to divert water for navigability in Calcutta port and does not directly cause flooding in Bangladesh.

### [Will men be wiped out from Earth? The case of disappearing Y chromosomes](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-men-be-wiped-out-from-earth-the-case-of-disappearing-y-chromosomes-13808746.html)

A recent study suggests the Y chromosome, responsible for male development, is shrinking and may eventually disappear. This is due to the chromosome's loss of genes over time and its inability to undergo genetic recombination. While this raises questions about the future of male humans, some species, like spiny rats, have evolved alternative sex determination mechanisms after losing their Y chromosome.  This suggests that even if the Y chromosome disappears, humans might evolve new ways to determine sex, potentially leading to diverse human species in the future.

Mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing an increase in the United States. Cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a rare but severe disease, have been reported in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont. The disease causes brain inflammation and can be fatal. West Nile virus, spread by Culex mosquitoes, has also affected the former top US infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. 

Dengue and malaria, typically found in tropical regions, are also becoming more common in the US due to factors like global warming.  Dengue, known for causing severe muscle and joint pain, carries a high risk globally with millions of infections occurring annually. Malaria, a parasitic disease, infects hundreds of millions globally, primarily in Africa. Although primarily found in tropical regions, warming temperatures are expanding the reach of these mosquito-borne diseases.

A newly formed student group, Paschimbanga Chhatra Samaj, organized a protest march in Kolkata demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the recent rape-murder case of a trainee doctor. The march, called "Nabanna Abhijan," aimed to reach the state secretariat.  

The group, while claiming to be apolitical, faced accusations from the ruling Trinamool Congress of having BJP backing. The BJP denied the allegations, stating they supported the movement but were not organizing it.  Police called the march illegal and deployed significant security measures, including tear gas and water cannons, to prevent the students from reaching their destination. The situation escalated, leading to stone-throwing by protesters and forceful dispersal by police.

Telegram, with approximately 700 million users globally, has positioned itself as a platform prioritizing user privacy and data protection. It gained notoriety following the 2015 Paris attacks when ISIS utilized the app to spread propaganda and recruit members. Despite claims of taking down numerous ISIS accounts, experts argue that Telegram is ineffective in curbing the group's online activity, as new channels can be easily created. 

The app's strong encryption features, while appealing to many, have also attracted criminal and terrorist organizations.  Concerns over Telegram's role in facilitating terrorist activities have heightened following CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France over allegations of money laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorism support.

Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has sparked international outrage by stating that he would build a synagogue at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem if he had the authority.  The compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, is the third holiest site in Islam and is highly contested. 

Ben-Gvir's comments have drawn criticism from both Israeli and international leaders, who argue that his actions threaten regional stability. The site has been a flashpoint for conflict for decades, with numerous clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian worshippers.  Current arrangements stipulate that the Islamic Waqf controls the compound's internal affairs while Israel manages external security. However, Israeli actions, such as allowing Jewish visitors and prohibiting prayer, have been condemned by Muslims.  Ben-Gvir's previous visits to the site have also caused significant controversy.

Anti-India sentiment is rising in Bangladesh following recent floods and the provision of shelter for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after her ouster.  Protests erupted at an Indian visa centre in Satkhira as applicants expressed frustration over processing delays and alleged harassment. The demonstrators voiced anger at what they perceive as India's role in the flooding and criticized the Indian visa application process. While the Indian High Commission addressed the situation with Bangladesh's foreign ministry, the incident highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations.  

The situation has been further complicated by allegations of election rigging and India's alleged complicity in supporting Hasina's regime, which has fueled distrust among the Bangladeshi populace. Despite diplomatic efforts to mend relations, the "India Out" sentiment persists, posing a challenge to the smooth functioning of bilateral ties.

The recent exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah has raised concerns about a potential wider conflict. Lebanon, already grappling with economic and political turmoil, is facing a precarious situation.  Unlike the 2006 war, Lebanon is hosting a large Syrian refugee population, further straining its resources. The country's infrastructure is fragile, and its ability to cope with a major humanitarian crisis is limited. 

Hezbollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since 2006, raising fears of a more destructive conflict. The possibility of a wider war with Hezbollah’s involvement adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile situation in the region.

Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, has eluded capture by Israeli and American intelligence despite significant efforts and advanced technology.  Sinwar's use of a human courier network, reminiscent of Osama bin Laden's tactics, has made him one of the most difficult targets in history. He has moved his operations underground, relying on Gaza's extensive tunnel system for shelter and communication. Sinwar's direct involvement in the October 7 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of many Israelis, makes his capture a priority for Israel and the US. While they have collaborated extensively, including deploying ground-penetrating radar to map the tunnel network, Sinwar has continued to evade detection.

The Maldives is facing its worst financial crisis ever, with usable dollar reserves reaching a negative balance for the first time.

The government, while striving to reassure the public,  has faced criticism for lack of transparency and is exploring measures like raising fees and taxes to bolster dollar revenue.  Experts suggest the government might have to utilize the Sovereign Development Fund if the crisis deepens.

Maharashtra has become the first state to implement the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for its employees.  The UPS guarantees a fixed pension after retirement, calculated at half the employee's average basic pay over the last year of service for those who have served for 25 years. It offers inflation indexation and a lump sum payment upon retirement.  Contributions are split between the employee (10%) and the government (18.5%). 

This differs from the National Pension Scheme (NPS) which, despite also providing a pension,  links returns to the stock market, making the pension amount variable. NPS contributions are split between the employee (10%) and the government (14%). NPS subscribers can choose their risk level and benefit from tax deductions.

Hezbollah launched over 320 Katyusha rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for the death of a senior commander.  These rockets, first developed by the Soviet Union during World War II, are known for their ability to deliver a large number of explosives over a wide area, creating a destructive "storm of fire." While lacking precision, their sheer volume makes them effective weapons, particularly in terrorizing enemy troops. 

Hezbollah's arsenal also includes a variety of other rockets and missiles, such as Iranian-made Raad, Fajr, and Zilzal rockets, as well as  Kornet anti-tank missiles.  The group is estimated to possess a significant number of these weapons, potentially up to 130,000 rockets and missiles.

### [Massaging the fascia is the latest social media trend. But does it really work?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/massaging-the-fascia-is-the-latest-social-media-trend-but-does-it-really-work-13806238.html)

One popular trend on social media promotes facial fascial massage as a treatment for wrinkles and sagging.  This technique aims to lengthen collagen molecules, release pressure on fascia, and improve circulation. However, there's no scientific evidence to support the claims that facial fascial massage can alter facial features or tissue structure.

As we age, our collagen production decreases and bone structure changes, leading to wrinkles and sagging. While facial massage may temporarily improve skin appearance, it's unlikely to reverse these natural aging processes. The massaging action itself can potentially break down collagen and stimulate fibroblasts, but the effects on collagen production are likely minimal and unlikely to significantly reduce wrinkles. 


Focusing on sun protection, hydration, and a healthy diet is a more effective approach to maintaining youthful skin compared to facial fascial massage.

The "hushed hybrid" trend sees managers quietly allowing employees to work remotely despite return-to-office mandates.  This arises from employee preference for flexibility,  with research indicating benefits like improved productivity and lower quit rates. 

However, this practice can create a two-tier workforce, breed resentment, and erode trust in leadership. It can also lead to cultural inconsistencies and conflict.  Companies are urged to clearly communicate flexible work policies, understand employee needs, and adopt a transparent approach to hybrid work that considers individual team requirements.

The human brain often filters out the nose from our visual field. However, examining the nose, like other body parts, can reveal skin conditions and internal diseases. Acne vulgaris and rosacea are common skin conditions affecting the nose, with rosacea sometimes leading to rhinophyma, thickening of the nose skin. Sarcoidosis, causing lupus pernio, can also affect the nose, while lupus pernio is a skin rash associated with lupus, an autoimmune disease. Trigeminal trophic syndrome, a rare condition damaging the facial nerve, can cause nose skin sensation changes.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency due to the spread of mpox, a viral disease originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The virus, which had initially affected primarily Africa, has now spread to Europe and Southeast Asia. This global spread has led to a wave of misinformation online. 

One common misconception is that mpox is related to shingles or the Covid-19 vaccine. Medical experts clarify that mpox and shingles are caused by different viruses and that mpox predates Covid vaccines.  Another misconception is that mpox only affects gay men, but experts emphasize that close, skin-to-skin contact, not sexual orientation, is the primary mode of transmission.  

Claims about a readily available miracle drug for mpox circulating online are also refuted. While some medications may show promise, none have undergone rigorous clinical trials specifically for mpox. Lastly, the WHO has denied ordering any lockdowns in response to the mpox outbreak.

The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, representing 10,000 engineers, conductors, and dispatchers, went on strike with CN and CPKC after contract negotiations failed. The primary sticking points are scheduling practices and concerns about fatigue-related safety.  The union argues the companies want to shift away from  a km-based pay system to an hourly one, potentially leading to longer working hours and increased safety risks. 

The railroads, on the other hand, claim their offers maintain current work rules and comply with safety regulations, while offering wage increases comparable to recent industry deals. Both believe binding arbitration would be the best way to resolve the dispute.

A complete shutdown of both CN and CPKC, which control most of Canada's rail freight, poses a significant threat to the economy. The stoppage could result in billions of dollars in losses, disrupt the movement of crucial goods, and impact industries like agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation. The situation is drawing international attention due to its potential to impact US businesses and supply chains, given the significant cross-border trade reliant on Canadian railroads.

### [Kolkata rape-murder case: Was the crime scene altered?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/kolkata-rape-murder-case-was-the-crime-scene-altered-13807156.html)

The CBI filed a status report with the Supreme Court regarding the alleged rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The report stated the crime scene may have been tampered with and highlighted inconsistencies in the West Bengal Police's handling of the case, including initially stating it was a suicide and later claiming it was murder. The report also noted a delay in informing the police about the discovery of the body and raised concerns about the credibility of initial police procedures.

The Supreme Court questioned the reasons for the delay in filing an FIR and the lack of crime scene security until after the post-mortem. 

The CBI is investigating Sanjoy Roy, a Kolkata Police volunteer, as the primary suspect based on CCTV footage and his confession. The case sparked protests from doctors across India, leading the Supreme Court to initiate a National Task Force to address safety concerns for medical professionals.

### [India's Chandrayaan-3 unveils lunar secrets: Did the Moon once host a magma ocean?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-isro-chandrayaan-3-unveils-lunar-secrets-did-moon-once-have-a-magma-ocean-13807149.html)

India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has provided compelling evidence supporting the theory that the Moon was once covered by a vast ocean of magma.  The Pragyan rover's data revealed a consistent presence of ferroan anorthosite, a key mineral, suggesting a shared geological history across the lunar south pole. This discovery aligns with previous missions and strengthens the Lunar Magma Ocean hypothesis. 

The rover also detected magnesium-rich minerals, indicating that material from deeper within the Moon may have been brought to the surface, possibly due to the impact that formed the South Pole-Aitken Basin. 


These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the Moon's formation and evolution, highlighting the global processes that shaped its crust. Chandrayaan-3 cements India's position as a major player in space exploration.

Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, has been using the word "damn" frequently during his recent campaign appearances. This isn't a new tactic for Walz, as he has consistently incorporated the word into his public speaking for many years. Despite potential negative perceptions associated with profanity, Walz's use of "damn" hasn't hindered his electoral success, suggesting a calculated effort to appear relatable and authentic. This approach has historical precedents in American politics, with many previous leaders, from Andrew Jackson to Lyndon Johnson, utilizing profanity in their public and private discourse. While journalists often highlight these instances, the societal tolerance for profanity has arguably increased, particularly among younger generations. Walz's continued use of "damn" will be interesting to observe as the campaign progresses, as it remains to be seen if he maintains this approach or adjusts his language.

Some worry that children may develop stronger attachments to their companions than their own parents, raising questions about the true meaning of "parental" care.

### [Can Taylor Swift sue Donald Trump for sharing AI-generated endorsement? What does the law say?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-taylor-swift-sue-donald-trump-for-sharing-ai-generated-endorsement-what-does-the-law-say-13806602.html)

Donald Trump used AI-generated images of Taylor Swift to falsely suggest she endorsed him for the 2024 election. Swift has not endorsed any candidate this year and previously opposed Trump in 2020 with strong social media statements against him.

The NO FAKES Act and the ELVIS Act offer legal avenues for Swift, but the effectiveness of these laws in this specific case is unclear.  Some experts suggest that a cease-and-desist letter would be a more practical approach, while others believe a lawsuit might not be worth the cost and effort.

### [Excessive screen time can cause ‘digital dementia’. What is this condition?](https://www.firstpost.com/health/excessive-screen-time-can-cause-digital-dementia-what-is-this-condition-13806465.html)

Digital dementia, while not a formally recognized diagnosis, refers to cognitive decline potentially linked to excessive technology use. Studies suggest a correlation between increased screen time and risks of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.  Excessive screen time can negatively impact memory, attention span, learning capacity, and mental health.  Symptoms may mirror those of traditional dementia, such as short-term memory loss and difficulty focusing. 

The constant multitasking and rapid information processing associated with technology overuse may strain cognitive functions. Additionally, blue light emitted from screens can disrupt sleep patterns, further hindering cognitive performance.  


Preventing digital dementia involves managing screen time and engaging in activities that challenge cognitive function.  Limiting passive media consumption, prioritizing real-world interactions, and incorporating brain-boosting activities like puzzles, reading, and learning new skills can help mitigate the potential risks.

Experts are concerned about the virus's rapid mutation and spread, exacerbated by a long incubation period and vague initial symptoms, making containment difficult. The shortage of vaccines is a major obstacle, as demand greatly exceeds available supply. 


Key measures to control the outbreak include widespread testing, community education focusing on broader transmission routes, and accelerated development and distribution of vaccines. Urgent action is needed to prevent this epidemic from escalating into a global pandemic.

### [Why extreme weather in Pakistan has given rise to 'monsoon brides'](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-extreme-weather-in-pakistan-has-given-rise-to-monsoon-brides-13805367.html)

Since the devastating floods of 2022 in Pakistan, a concerning trend has emerged: "monsoon brides."  Families in rural Sindh, struggling to recover from the floods' economic impact, are marrying off their young daughters to escape poverty.  These marriages often involve men significantly older than the girls. While the families believe they are securing a better future for their daughters, the reality is often harsh. The girls experience limited opportunities and face difficult circumstances, with many returning to live with their parents due to their husbands' unemployment. This trend underscores the vulnerability of young girls in the face of climate-related disasters and the urgent need for sustainable solutions to address poverty and empower women.

A US court has ruled that Tahawwur Rana is eligible for extradition to India to face trial for his role in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. The court rejected Rana's appeal based on insufficient evidence and the "non bis in idem" (double jeopardy) clause. 

Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian businessman, was convicted in the US for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks and for supporting a plot to attack a Danish newspaper. According to US authorities, he aided his childhood friend David Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks, by providing him with a cover story and financial support for his surveillance activities in India. 


 India has been seeking Rana's extradition since 2019, and the Biden administration has supported the request.  Rana still has the option to appeal the decision.

Two NASA astronauts, Commander Barry Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, are currently stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) awaiting a return trip to Earth.  Their original spacecraft, the Boeing Starliner, experienced technical difficulties, leaving their return date uncertain.  

Nasa and Boeing are assessing the Starliner's safety, and a decision could be made soon. If deemed safe, their stay may be short. If not, they face a potential six-month wait. Research suggests that  waiting can be psychologically challenging, distorting our perception of time and increasing stress.  Being busy and having clear information about the situation can help manage the waiting period. Interestingly, studies on people in Antarctica show that constant activity can make time feel like it passes quickly. This might offer hope for the stranded astronauts.

Child marriage remains legal in 37 US states despite global efforts to eradicate it.  Over 300,000 children have been married in the US since 2000, with girls most often targeted.  Legal exceptions like parental consent and judicial approval allow the practice to persist, even in states that have banned child marriage outright. This legal loophole makes it difficult for child brides to escape abusive relationships.  Child marriage has severe consequences for victims, including increased risk of poverty, dropping out of school, and experiencing domestic and sexual violence.  Despite growing momentum to ban child marriage nationwide, opposition from various groups continues to hinder progress.  Advocates argue that a uniform federal law setting a minimum age for marriage is essential to protect minors.

Mpox, a viral infection related to smallpox, has been declared a global health emergency by the WHO.  The current outbreak is the worst ever in Africa, with over 27,000 cases and 1,100 deaths since January 2023.

The WHO is concerned about the virus spreading beyond Africa, with cases recently reported in Sweden and Pakistan.  There is no vaccine specifically for mpox, although the smallpox vaccine is licensed for use in severe cases.

Ukraine has launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region, capturing over 1,000 square kilometers of territory and 74 towns and settlements.  

The operation,  orchestrated by Ukraine's top military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, marks the deepest Ukrainian penetration into Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.   

Syrskyi, nicknamed "the butcher," is a veteran commander with extensive battlefield experience who led the defense of Kyiv and the successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv in 2022. 

President Zelenskyy has stated that Ukraine's strategic goals are being achieved in the Kursk region, but emphasized that Kyiv does not intend to hold onto the captured territory and offered to cease raids in exchange for a "just peace" from Russia.

India is celebrating its 78th Independence Day, marking the country's freedom from British rule in 1947.  

While the Prime Minister hoists the flag at the Red Fort, the right for Chief Ministers to do the same in their states was granted in 1974. This was due to the efforts of DMK leader M Karunanidhi who, in a battle for state autonomy, argued that elected Chief Ministers should have the same privilege as the Prime Minister.  

Karunanidhi's persistent campaigning, including letters to then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, led to the government's acceptance of his suggestion. As a result, Karunanidhi became the first Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to unfurl the national flag at Fort St. George on Independence Day, 1974. This change was significant as it reinforced the autonomy of states within India's federal structure.Karunanidhi, known for his strong advocacy for Dravidian rights, viewed this as a step towards respecting state identities within a united India.

Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin has been removed from office by the Constitutional Court for an ethics violation.

August 15 marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president, and his family members.   

The decision to scrap the holiday has been met with mixed reactions, with some attributing it to the public anger directed at Hasina and the recent violence that included the desecration of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and the toppling of Rahman's statue.

Both India and Pakistan gained independence on August 15, 1947, according to the Indian Independence Act.  Pakistan's founding father, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, affirmed August 15 as Pakistan's Independence Day in his historic address. Historical records, including Jinnah's oath-taking ceremony and Pakistan's first postage stamps, corroborate this. 

Due to logistical constraints during the power transfer, Viceroy Lord Mountbatten officially handed over power to Pakistan in Karachi on August 14, but this does not change the legal date of independence.  

Pakistan shifted its Independence Day to August 14 in 1948, likely to distinguish itself from India. This decision was likely made by political leaders aiming to establish  a unique national identity for the newly formed country.

India's path to independence was paved by a series of pivotal struggles. The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, triggered by British policies and religious sensitivities, marked the first major uprising against colonial rule. The Swadeshi Movement, sparked by the partition of Bengal, promoted Indian-made goods and fostered national identity. Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha, a campaign of non-violent resistance against oppressive land laws, established Satyagraha as a cornerstone of the independence struggle.  The Non-Cooperation Movement, launched in 1920, sought to weaken British rule through mass civil disobedience, culminating in the Salt Satyagraha, a dramatic act of defiance against the salt tax. The Quit India Movement of 1942, with its resounding "Do or Die" call, intensified the pressure for independence, ultimately leading to India's freedom on August 15th, 1947.

### [Explained: Why are multinational corporations fleeing Pakistan?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-why-are-multinational-corporations-fleeing-pakistan-13804087.html)

Multinational corporations are leaving Pakistan in large numbers due to a multitude of factors. Economic instability, a complex regulatory environment, high taxation, and political turmoil are all contributing to a decline in investor confidence. Companies like TotalEnergies, Telenor, and Shell Oil have  already scaled back or exited the Pakistani market,  highlighting the severity of the situation. This trend raises concerns about Pakistan's future ability to attract foreign direct investment and its overall economic prospects. 

To reverse this exodus, Pakistan needs to create a more stable and predictable business environment.  This requires addressing issues such as regulatory uncertainty, repatriation of profits, and political instability.  Without these changes, Pakistan risks further economic decline and continued disillusionment among foreign investors.

Iran is reported to be planning a retaliation attack against Israel following the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.  

The US has heightened its military presence in the region, deploying a missile submarine and an aircraft carrier strike group. Experts believe Iran will likely launch a drone and missile attack similar to the one it carried out in April, but may limit the scale to avoid escalating into a full-scale war. Some analysts suggest Iran might coordinate its response with Hezbollah.

While Iran insists its retaliation is unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire, international pressure is mounting to prevent a wider conflict. Experts say both sides may strive to avoid a major confrontation, while also seeking to demonstrate their strength and deter future aggression. Iran's actions are perceived to be aimed at signaling its unwavering resolve and capability.

Elon Musk announced that X was the target of a massive DDOS attack, preventing his scheduled interview with former President Donald Trump. The attack aimed to take the platform offline by overwhelming it with traffic. Musk stated that X was working to mitigate the attack and would proceed with a smaller live audience or post the conversation later.  Despite the technical difficulties, the interview ultimately took place and covered topics like Trump's interactions with world leaders and his critique of Democrats' policies.

Donald Trump made numerous inaccurate or misleading claims during a conversation with Elon Musk on X. He exaggerated border crossing numbers, misrepresented Vice President Kamala Harris's role, and made unsubstantiated claims about other countries releasing criminals into the US.  Trump's assertions on energy policy, the economy, and climate change were also flawed, including downplaying the threat of rising sea levels and inflating inflation rates.  He continued to make false claims about the 2020 election and the Biden administration's targeting of him politically. Additionally, Trump provided inaccurate information about nuclear weapon possession and misrepresented the amount of aid European countries have provided to Ukraine.

Elon Musk and Donald Trump recently had a two-hour interview on X, which garnered attention for Trump's apparent lisp. Many viewers commented on his speech, sparking discussions and speculation about his health.  The lisp raised concerns about Trump's fitness for office, especially considering his age (78) and previous health questions.  A recent survey showed that a majority of Americans believe Trump is too old to run for president.  Despite assurances from his doctor and Trump's own claims of vitality, there's a lack of transparency regarding Trump's health status.  This lack of information contrasts with his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whose age is less of a concern for the Democratic Party.

The interaction also included Trump's praise for world leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un, acknowledging their toughness and strategic acumen. Finally, Trump's return to X (formerly Twitter) ahead of the interview signifies a potential boost in his reach and communication platform.

The end of the Olympic Games often brings a sense of emptiness, known as "Olympic comedown," for athletes. This phenomenon stems from the abrupt shift from a high-pressure, highly stimulating environment to the normalcy of everyday life. 

Athletes experience a decrease in adrenaline, which they get from training and competition, leading to feelings similar to withdrawal.  They also face an existential crisis as their identity, largely defined by their sport, is challenged.  

It's crucial for athletes to prepare mentally and physically for this transition.  Recognizing and accepting the end of the competition cycle, taking time to celebrate achievements, and engaging in enjoyable activities outside of sport are essential coping mechanisms.

Trump and Republicans are targeting Kamala Harris' laugh, using derogatory nicknames like "Laughing Kamala" to undermine her. They claim her laughter is inappropriate and try to portray her as unhinged. This tactic is reminiscent of past attacks on women in power, such as Hillary Clinton's "cackle," which were criticized as misogynistic. 

Experts suggest that voters are more aware of such tactics today. Some argue that Harris' laughter is a display of strength and authenticity, contrasting with Trump's perceived lack of humor and emotional control. Supporters view it as a joyful expression, while critics perceive it as unprofessional and unbecoming of a leader.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor claimed that statues at a memorial complex in Bangladesh depicting the Pakistani army's surrender to the Indian Army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War have been "destroyed" by "anti-India vandals." He cited images appearing to show broken statues. However, this claim has been challenged, with some pointing out that the statues themselves are designed to depict people lying down as a symbol of the atrocities committed during the war. They argue that the images shared by Tharoor show the intended artistic representation, not vandalism.

### [Independence Day 2024: How India and Pakistan divided money, military and an elephant amid partition](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-india-pakistan-assets-partition-13803755.html)

The Partition of India in 1947 led to a massive task of dividing assets between India and Pakistan. A committee, the Partition Council, was formed with representatives from both sides to oversee the division. 

A significant challenge was splitting the military, with two-thirds staying in India and one-third going to Pakistan. The division was not without its tensions, as exemplified by the case of the Brigade of Gurkhas and the exchange of troops between units. 

Financial assets were divided according to the Partition agreement, with Pakistan receiving 17.5%. The process of exchanging currency and settling debts proved complex and controversial, with both countries claiming outstanding payments. Beyond military and financial assets, movable assets like furniture and even light bulbs were divided in an 80-20 ratio. 

Even animals were included in the division, as illustrated by the case of Joymoni, an elephant whose ownership was a subject of dispute.  The Partition Council successfully navigated these intricate challenges, ultimately achieving a division of assets despite the complexities and difficulties inherent in the process.

India is home to a significant population of Asian elephants, but these majestic creatures face a growing threat from train collisions. In the past decade, at least 200 elephants have perished in such accidents. 

To address this issue, authorities are implementing various safety measures.  Tamil Nadu has deployed an AI-based surveillance system to alert authorities of elephant movement near tracks, while the national government plans to roll out a similar system across a 700-km stretch. States are also constructing wildlife overpasses to provide safe passage for elephants. 

Despite these efforts, challenges remain.  The vast network of Indian Railways, coupled with development priorities, frequently intersects with elephant corridors, increasing the risk of collisions. Experts suggest further measures such as reducing night-time train operations, ensuring adequate food and water within forests, and implementing strict speed controls in areas prone to accidents.

The ongoing Hindenburg vs Adani Group saga intensifies with fresh allegations from Hindenburg Research. The US-based firm claims that Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband, Dhaval Buch, had stakes in offshore entities linked to the Adani family, potentially constituting a conflict of interest. 

Hindenburg cites "whistleblower documents" to support its claim, alleging that these funds were used for financial irregularities within the Adani Group. Sebi chief Madhabi Buch and her husband vehemently deny the allegations, asserting the transparency of their financial dealings and highlighting that their investments predate Buch's appointment at Sebi. They claim they sold off their stakes in 2018 upon the CIO's departure from the fund and reiterate their commitment to ethical conduct, labelling Hindenburg's accusations as baseless.  

The Hindenburg report, however, raises concerns about a potential conflict of interest given Buch's role in overseeing investigations related to the Adani Group. This new development has triggered a decline in Adani Group stocks, with investors losing billions of rupees amid market uncertainty.

A recent study by the American Cancer Society found that Gen X and millennials are at increased risk for 17 types of cancer compared to older generations. This includes cancers of the small intestine, thyroid, kidney, and pancreas.

Binge drinking, particularly among millennial women, was also identified as a contributing factor to liver and esophageal cancer rates.  The study highlights the importance of understanding the causes of these rising cancer rates to develop effective prevention strategies. However, the study also noted positive trends, such as a decrease in lung and melanoma cancer rates, demonstrating the impact of public health campaigns promoting smoking cessation and sun-safe practices.

### [Cats vs toddlers: Are Chinese youth choosing pets over kids?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-pet-population-young-children-report-13802532.html)

A Goldman Sachs report predicts that China's urban pet population will surpass the number of young children by 2030.  The report attributes this trend to declining birth rates in China, with urban pet ownership projected to reach 70 million by 2030, compared to a child population under four years old of less than 40 million. This boom in pet ownership is expected to fuel a significant growth in the pet food market, reaching $12 billion by 2030.  The report also notes that cat ownership is predicted to surpass dog ownership due to space constraints.  
China's shrinking population and declining birth rates are a major concern, driven by factors such as economic instability, pandemic effects, and the high cost of raising a family.   To combat this, the government is implementing various incentives to encourage childbirth, but young people cite financial concerns as a primary deterrent.

### [The Netherlands has prisons that are too ‘empty’. Here's why](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-netherlands-has-prisons-that-are-too-empty-heres-why-13802844.html)

The Netherlands is facing a unique problem: severely underpopulated prisons. This is due to remarkably low crime rates and a focus on rehabilitation over punishment.  The country has implemented shorter sentences for non-violent crimes, with many serving less than three months.  There is a strong belief that prison can be more detrimental than beneficial.  

The Dutch system emphasizes alternatives like electronic tagging and specialized mental health treatment programs to reduce recidivism.  As a result, the prison population has been dramatically reduced, leading to the closure of numerous facilities and their repurposing for other societal needs.

### [Can mayonnaise hold the key to unlocking nuclear fusion? Scientists think so...](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-mayonnaise-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-nuclear-fusion-scientists-think-so-13802920.html)

Researchers at Lehigh University are using mayonnaise to study the challenges of nuclear fusion.  Mayonnaise, which behaves like a solid until subjected to pressure, mimics the behavior of plasma, the charged state of matter involved in fusion.  

The research focuses on understanding how hydrodynamic instabilities, particularly the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, affect fusion reactions. These instabilities can reduce the efficiency of fusion energy production.

By studying how mayonnaise flows and becomes unstable under pressure, the researchers aim to develop strategies to predict, control, and potentially suppress these instabilities in actual fusion experiments.  This knowledge could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of fusion energy generation.
