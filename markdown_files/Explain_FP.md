### [What happens with unused gift cards each year?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-happens-with-unused-gift-cards-each-year-13544762.html)

As GPT-3.5, I can provide you with a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the popularity of gift cards during the holiday season and highlights the issue of unused or forgotten gift cards. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans are expected to spend nearly $30 billion on gift cards this holiday season, with restaurant gift cards being the most popular choice. However, many gift cards end up unused or forgotten, with an average value of $187 per person, totaling $23 billion. 

Under federal law, gift cards cannot expire for five years from the time of purchase or the last time money was added to them. Some states have even longer expiration periods. It is still advisable to use gift cards promptly, as some cards may start accruing inactivity fees after a year of non-use, and the value of the card may decrease due to inflation. Additionally, if a retail store closes or goes bankrupt, the gift card may become worthless.

If you have a gift card that you don't want, you can consider selling it on websites like CardCash or Raise, although you may not receive the full face value. It's also worth noting that when a gift card goes unused, the retailer can use the money right away, but they also have to account for the possibility of the gift card being redeemed. Some states require retailers to work with unclaimed property programs to return money from unspent gift cards to consumers.

To claim unspent gift card money, you can check with your state's unclaimed property program. They have websites like MissingMoney.com where you can search for any unclaimed property, including cash from gift cards.

### [Where did Santa Claus come from?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/where-did-santa-claus-come-from-13536602.html)

The origins of the beloved gift-giver figure, Santa Claus, can be traced back to St. Nicholas, a man who lived in the fourth century. St. Nicholas was known for his Christian faith and acts of generosity, such as providing dowries for three impoverished sisters. His legacy sparked various traditions across Europe, with December 6th becoming his feast day. Over time, the figure of St. Nicholas evolved into Santa Claus, influenced by cultural and religious shifts. The red Santa suit and related apparel that we are familiar with today are the result of modern-day marketing in the English-speaking world. Despite the transformation, the core values of generosity, compassion, and the joy of giving have remained intact in the figure of Santa Claus.

Chinese researchers claim to have developed a hydrogen therapy that could potentially reverse age-related changes in the body and prevent geriatric diseases like Alzheimer’s. This therapy involves delivering a high concentration of hydrogen molecules using a scaffold implant developed with nanotechnology, which is reported to be 40,000 times more effective than other delivery methods. The implant can provide a slow and consistent release of hydrogen for about a week, with initial tests showing promising results in repairing bone defects in older mice. The researchers believe that this method could have broad-spectrum anti-ageing properties and potential applications for treating other age-related conditions and diseases.

During the Winter Session proceedings at the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, two individuals, identified as Manoranjan D and Sagar Sharma, jumped into the chamber and released coloured smoke from gas canisters, while two others – Amol Shinde and Neelam Devi – were detained from the premises as they yelled slogans and released yellow-coloured gas.

The group meticulously planned the incident and was connected through a club known as the 'Bhagat Singh Fan Club'. The Ministry of Home Affairs has constituted an enquiry panel to investigate the breach and recommend improvements to security at the Parliament.

### [Why billionaires from across the world are moving businesses to Abu Dhabi](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-billionaires-from-across-the-world-are-moving-businesses-to-abu-dhabi-13495322.html)

Abu Dhabi has become a preferred choice for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) to park their assets. Thousands of billionaires have set up special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in Abu Dhabi, making it a top choice for billionaires. The emirate offers advantages such as tax treaties with other countries to minimize tax bills, mechanisms to protect assets from foreign interference, and long-term residency options. Other traditional havens like the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands have faced increased scrutiny, making Abu Dhabi more attractive. Additionally, Abu Dhabi's cultural attractions and business opportunities contribute to its appeal for HNWIs.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's supporters have reported that he has been missing for nearly a week and his lawyers have been unable to contact him. Navalny, known for his criticism of Putin and currently serving a 30-year prison term, was last reported to be in a corrective penal colony in the Vladimir region near Moscow. His absence comes in the wake of Putin declaring his candidacy for re-election next March, raising concerns about political motives behind Navalny's disappearance. The timing of his absence is seen as linked to Putin's bid for a fifth term in power. Navalny's aides suspect political control from the Kremlin and his supporters have initiated an anti-Putin campaign. The White House has expressed concern over Navalny's disappearance, and Navalny's continued confrontation against Putin has led to multiple jail terms and allegations of fresh charges.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the possibility of Saudi Arabia acquiring control of Heathrow Airport in London. The country's sovereign wealth fund recently purchased a 10% stake in the airport, and there are reports that other major investors, such as Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial, may also be considering selling their shares. However, it is still uncertain whether Saudi Arabia will end up owning Heathrow. The article mentions that Qatar, China, and Singapore's sovereign wealth funds also own stakes in the airport and are unlikely to sell. On the other hand, pension funds from Quebec, Australia, and the UK's Universities Superannuation Scheme may be considering selling their shares. The implications of this potential development are not yet clear. The article also mentions that Heathrow's passenger numbers have increased after the COVID-19 pandemic, but the airport has still faced financial losses. Please note that as GPT-3.5, I provide factual information based on the given text, and the article does not mention any specific implications of Saudi Arabia potentially acquiring control of Heathrow.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha for alleged "unethical conduct" and "serious misdemeanors" based on a report from the Ethics Committee.

Hmm, based on the provided text, it seems that there is limited research on how climate extremes might change after reaching net zero CO₂ emissions. However, the study mentioned in the text suggests that temperatures would respond differently in various parts of the world, and heat extremes might continue to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. It also mentions that regions with higher human development index, such as North America and western Europe, may experience larger reductions in heat extremes compared to regions with a lower rank, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. It is important for humanity to work towards achieving net zero CO₂ emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

The United States has experienced the highest number of mass shootings in 17 years, surpassing the previous record set last year. In Dallas, a 21-year-old man killed four people, including a 1-year-old boy, before fatally shooting himself. In Vancouver, Washington, a man shot his wife, their two adult daughters, and his brother before taking his own life. These incidents were recorded as the 40th and 41st mass killings in the country this year. So far, at least 211 people have died in such incidents in 2023. The majority of mass shootings occurred in private homes or shelters rather than public places. The worst attack of the year took place in Lewiston, where 18 people were killed by a US Army reservist and firearms instructor. The increase in mass shootings is attributed to easy access to firearms. Different organizations have varying definitions for mass shootings, resulting in discrepancies in reported numbers. President Joe Biden has pledged to address gun violence, but finding solutions to prevent these incidents remains a challenge.

The Telegraph newspaper has alleged that Apollo Hospitals, India's biggest private hospital group, is involved in an illegal "cash for kidney" racket. The investigation claims that impoverished individuals from Myanmar are lured to Apollo Hospital in Delhi to sell their kidneys to wealthy patients worldwide. The hospital group has vehemently denied the allegations and called them false. The Ministry of Health in India is also investigating the matter. The racket involves forging identity documents and creating fake family ties between donors and patients. The hospital's authorization committee is described as a facade, with minimal scrutiny of the donor-recipient relationship. Apollo denies the allegations and states that they follow strict procedures, including genetic testing, to ensure compliance with applicable laws. The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) has initiated a probe into the matter.

The article discusses the ongoing tension between India and the US regarding the alleged plot to assassinate Khalistan terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on US soil. US principal deputy national security advisor Jonathan Finer met with high-ranking Indian officials to discuss the matter, acknowledging India's establishment of a committee to investigate the plot. The article also mentions Finer's participation in discussions aimed at strengthening coordination between the US and India in various areas, such as technology cooperation and regional policy alignment. The US reiterated its seriousness in the matter and stated that it will wait for the results of India's investigation. The article provides details about the alleged plot, including plans to target multiple individuals in the US and Canada. India has designated Pannun as an "individual terrorist," and his group Sikhs for Justice has been banned in India.

Despite facing some criticism within the party for his autocratic style, Reddy received support from senior party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. Ultimately, it was Rahul Gandhi's decision to select Reddy as the chief minister.

Pakistan is currently facing a severe economic crisis with high unemployment, soaring inflation, and unaffordable food and essentials. Amidst this, a general election is scheduled for February. However, there have been delays in releasing funds for the election. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) requested Rs 51 billion but agreed upon Rs 47 billion. The finance ministry assured the ECP of releasing Rs 17 billion after concerns were raised. Political parties fund their campaigns through application fees collected from candidates and donations from non-members. The cost of the upcoming elections is estimated to be significantly higher compared to previous elections. The economic situation in Pakistan is dire, with rising inflation and job losses. Despite this, millions are being spent on elections, adding to the uncertainty of the future.

Thousands of protesters in New Zealand demonstrated against the newly elected conservative-led coalition government, organized by the Maori Party. The protests were a response to what they perceived as "anti-Maori" policies. The demonstrations caused traffic jams and resulted in two arrests in Auckland. Maori Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi criticized Prime Minister Christopher Luxon's administration, stating that their policies would regress New Zealand back to the 1800s. The protesters called for the protection of the Treaty of Waitangi, which safeguards Indigenous rights. Luxon's government plans to review the treaty and potentially make changes to modern laws based on it. They also intend to make changes to the Maori Health Authority. Luxon defended his government's commitment to improving outcomes for both Maori and non-Maori citizens. The ACT Party leader criticized the protests, describing them as divisive and showing disrespect for equal rights. The National Party won the largest proportion of the vote in the recent elections, forming a coalition with New Zealand First and ACT parties. The Maori Party secured six seats in Parliament.

### [US is struggling to send Ukraine money. Here’s what this means for conflict](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-is-struggling-to-send-ukraine-money-heres-what-this-means-for-conflict-13468122.html)

The US is warning that it may run out of money to provide weapons and equipment to Ukraine by the end of 2023. The White House's budget director, Shalanda Young, sent a letter to the US House Speaker stating that without congressional action, the flow of US weapons and equipment to Ukraine would be cut off, severely impeding Ukraine's ability to fight on the battlefield. The lack of funds for Ukraine is due to domestic US politics, with hard-right lawmakers opposing new funding for Ukraine. Despite President Joe Biden's request for $106 billion in national security funding, including support for Ukraine, Congress has been unable to secure the necessary funds. The US has already provided at least $40 billion in security aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022, but most of the money remains in the United States and has been spent on replacing military hardware sent to Kyiv. The failure to agree on more funding not only puts Ukraine's gains at risk but also increases the chance of Russian military victories.

### [Did Hamas make millions by betting against Israel stock market before 7 Oct attack?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/did-hamas-make-millions-in-profit-by-betting-against-israel-stock-market-before-7-october-attack-13466842.html)

A study conducted by researchers from Columbia University and New York University suggests that some traders may have had prior knowledge of the deadly Hamas attack on Israel in October. The study, titled "Trading on Terror," found significant short-selling of shares before the attacks, indicating that traders bet against the Israeli economy and made profits by short-selling on the Israel stock exchange. The researchers found that short interest in the MSCI Israel Exchange Traded Fund spiked on October 2, and short selling of Israeli securities on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange increased dramatically just before the attack. The paper provides an example of Bank Leumi, a TASE-listed company, where millions of shares were sold short, yielding profits of millions of dollars. The study suggests that traders who were informed about the coming attacks profited from them. While it is difficult to determine who made the profits, the researchers caution against linking it back to Hamas, as there are various possibilities. The Israel Securities Authority is currently investigating the matter.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced measures to reduce the number of migrants arriving through legal means in an effort to address record net migration figures. The move comes as official estimates reveal a record high of 745,000 net migrations to the UK in 2022, surpassing the number of individuals leaving the country. The new measures include increasing the minimum salary for skilled foreign workers applying for a visa to work in the UK. Other key measures announced include restrictions on bringing family dependents, new limitations on the Health and Care visa, an increase in the NHS surcharge, cracking down on cut-price labor, and restrictions on allowing dependents to enter the UK. These actions are being taken ahead of the upcoming general election, where immigration is expected to be a key issue. The Conservative government, led by Boris Johnson, had promised to reduce net migration numbers but has seen an increase since the UK formally left the EU in January 2020. The urgency to address this issue is heightened by pressure from MPs and lagging behind the Labour party in opinion polls.

The article discusses the impact of cyclonic storm 'Michaung' in Chennai, India. The storm has caused heavy rainfall and resulted in at least five deaths. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned of heavy to very heavy rainfall in north-coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Chennai experienced severe waterlogging, with areas like Wallajah Road, Mount Road, and Anna Salai being inundated. The popular Marina Beach was also flooded, causing road blockages. The Tamil Nadu government declared a public holiday in several districts. The article briefly mentions the conversation between Amit Shah and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu regarding the intense rains and the Indian Army's rescue efforts in affected areas. Cyclone Michaung is expected to make landfall in Andhra Pradesh's Bapatla, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. The rainfall in Chennai is attributed to the cyclone, which is swirling in the Bay of Bengal.

### [The COP28 chief is dead wrong. Science says we need to quickly do away with fossil fuels](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/the-cop28-chief-is-dead-wrong-science-says-we-need-to-quickly-do-away-with-fossil-fuels-13465232.html)

The article discusses the claim made by the president of COP28 that there is no scientific evidence supporting the need to phase out fossil fuels to limit global heating to 1.5°C. However, the author argues that there is a wealth of scientific research demonstrating the necessity of a fossil fuel phase-out to combat climate change. The author refers to their own publication in Nature, which highlights that a significant portion of coal, oil, and gas needs to remain underground to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also emphasizes the urgency of shifting away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero CO₂ emissions by the early 2050s. Additional studies and analyses support the conclusion that a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels is essential. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of a fair and orderly transition, with developed countries phasing out fossil fuels and providing support to developing countries for the switch to cleaner technologies.

### [Can the dodo be brought back from the dead?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-the-dodo-be-brought-back-from-the-dead-13465002.html)

A biotech firm called Colossal Biosciences is partnering with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation to potentially bring back the extinct dodo bird. The company has sequenced the genomes of the dodo, as well as two other birds closely related to it. They plan to use cells called primordial germ cells (PGCs) to create a chicken and rooster with the physical traits of a dodo. These altered PGCs will be placed into the embryos of the chickens, and if successful, their offspring will have the characteristics of the dodo. However, there are technical challenges to overcome, and bringing back the dodo does not address the issues that led to its extinction originally. The company believes that rewilding the animals and returning them to their natural habitat is crucial. It is important to note that de-extinction is not a solution to the present-day extinction crisis.

Three Palestinian students, Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdel Hamid, and Tahseen Ahmed, were shot and critically injured while walking home from dinner in Vermont. The Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee believes they were targeted because they were wearing traditional keffiyehs and speaking Arabic. The keffiyeh is a square-shaped cotton headdress worn by Palestinian men and has become a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity. It has a historic connection to the fishing traditions of Palestinian coastal communities. The keffiyeh gained political connotations during the Arab Revolt against the British in 1936 and became synonymous with Palestinian solidarity in the 1960s, popularized by Yasser Arafat. Over the years, it has been banned, co-opted by fashion brands, and worn in protests and demonstrations worldwide.

Gunshots were fired outside the home of Punjabi actor and singer Gippy Grewal in Canada. The gang of Lawrence Bishnoi, who is accused in the murder case of Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala, claimed responsibility for the attack on Facebook. They also mentioned Gippy's association with Salman Khan and threatened both of them. Gippy Grewal is a popular actor and Punjabi singer, known for his hit albums and movies. He has faced struggles early in his career but has achieved success through hard work. The attack on Gippy's home is believed to be related to his proximity to Salman Khan, who was previously threatened by Lawrence Bishnoi over the killing of a blackbuck. Salman has been given high-level security due to these threats. However, Gippy denies having any friendship with Salman and says he has only met him twice at public events.

### [Why Russia has put Meta's spokesman on its wanted list](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-russia-has-put-metas-spokesman-on-its-wanted-list-13435042.html)

Russia has escalated its crackdown on social media by declaring Meta Platforms spokesperson Andy Stone a wanted figure on unspecified charges. This comes after Russia designated Meta as "extremist," which could lead to criminal investigations and fines against users. The clampdown intensified following Russia's Ukraine offensive, with Stone finding himself on the interior ministry's wanted list without explicit details. Media outlets reported that Stone was put on the list in February 2022, but no related statements were made at the time. In March, Russia's federal Investigative Committee opened a criminal investigation into Meta for allegedly inciting violence against Russians. Western social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have been blocked in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been formally barred from entering the country.

Gunmen attacked the main barracks in the capital city of Freetown, overran detention centers, and captured a police car. The identity of the attackers is unknown. President Julius Maada Bio declared a nationwide curfew in response to the attacks. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and explosions in various parts of the city. Some prisoners were released or abducted during the attack on the detention centers. Security forces have pushed the attackers to the outskirts of Freetown. President Bio assured the nation that most of the leaders of the attack had been arrested and calm was restored. The motives and identity of the attackers remain unclear. The incident is not officially referred to as an attempted coup, but the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) described it as a plot to disturb the peace and constitutional order of the country. President Bio was re-elected for a second term earlier this year amid criticism of economic conditions and allegations of election irregularities.

### [China pneumonia outbreak: Could it spread to India?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/china-pneumonia-outbreak-could-it-spread-to-india-other-countries-13433772.html)

A spike in respiratory illness in China has raised concerns about the possibility of another pandemic. The illness, similar to pneumonia, is affecting children, particularly in Beijing and Liaoning. India has issued a health advisory and taken precautionary measures due to reports of rising cases in China. Chinese health authorities attribute the increase in infections to the end of COVID-19 restrictions, the arrival of the cold season, and the circulation of known pathogens. India is closely monitoring the situation but currently sees a low risk to its population. Doctors advise people to follow standard hygiene practices such as wearing masks, maintaining cleanliness, and washing hands. The outbreak in China is linked to mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacteria that primarily affects children. While the outbreak remains contained, experts predict a rise in respiratory illnesses worldwide during the winter months. Vaccines and treatments are available to combat the illness if it spreads to other countries. Hospitals in Beijing have been overwhelmed with patients, but Chinese health officials claim the surge is caused by common viruses and bacteria rather than a novel virus. The World Health Organization has requested information from China regarding the rise in respiratory illnesses.

### [Slept on chairs, hours of wait for bathroom: What hostages went through during 50 days of captivity in Gaza](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/slept-on-chairs-hours-of-wait-for-bathroom-what-hostages-went-through-during-50-days-of-captivity-in-gaza-13433602.html)

The article discusses the conditions and experiences of hostages who were released after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 50 days. The hostages were fed irregularly, mainly eating rice and bread, and lost weight during their captivity. They slept on rows of chairs pushed together and sometimes had to wait for hours to use the bathroom. Information about their confinement was tightly controlled, but some family members shared details about their loved ones' experiences. The article also mentions the devastation caused by Israel's offensive on Gaza and the cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel, which includes the release of hostages. Some of the released hostages appeared to have been held underground, experienced psychological tolls, and needed medical care. Despite the challenges they faced, some of the hostages displayed resilience and were able to walk, speak, and even solve puzzles shortly after their release.

### [Uttarkashi tunnel collapse: Will vertical drilling help in rescuing the 41 labourers?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uttarkashi-tunnel-collapse-vertical-drilling-rescue-trapped-labourers-13433392.html)

Rescue efforts are still underway to retrieve 41 workers who are trapped inside the collapsed Silkyara-Barkot tunnel in Uttarkashi district. After a drilling machine broke down, authorities have now resorted to vertical drilling as the next best approach. The rescue teams have already drilled 20 meters out of the required 86 meters. The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) managing director estimates that vertical drilling will be completed by Thursday if no obstacles arise.

Vertical drilling involves creating boreholes from above to create earth shafts through which the trapped individuals can be evacuated. However, some experts have expressed concerns about this method due to the potential for vibration and falling debris.

Alongside vertical drilling, officials have developed alternative plans such as horizontal drilling and sideways drilling, with different timeframes for each. As a last resort, manual drilling may be used to remove pieces of the broken equipment from the rubble.

Inside the tunnel, efforts are being made to maintain the morale of the trapped laborers by providing them with home-cooked food, medicines, and other essentials through a small pipe. A communication system has been established, allowing families to occasionally talk to the workers. Concerns have been raised about the workers' well-being, including the possibility of insomnia, hypoxia, and post-traumatic stress disorder due to their prolonged confinement.

The article also mentions that the National Disaster Management Authority plans to start manual drilling soon with the help of Indian Army engineers, rat miners, and technicians. The Border Roads Organisation has constructed a road near the site to facilitate the rescue operation. Additionally, local officials have reached out to the trapped workers to inquire about their health and provide updates on the ongoing rescue efforts.

Community campaigners in the UK are fighting to prevent the deportation of Gurmit Kaur, a 78-year-old widow who has lived in the country for 14 years. Despite an internet petition with over 65,000 signatures urging her to stay, her application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK was denied. Gurmit Kaur, originally from India, has no family to return to in India and is estranged from her children in the UK. She has become an active member of the local community, volunteering at food banks and receiving support from the Sikh community in Smethwick. The decision to deport her has sparked widespread support, but the UK Home Office maintains that Kaur can re-adjust to life in India. Campaigners are calling for her status, as well as that of all undocumented migrants in the UK, to be regularized to protect them during the pandemic.

Elon Musk could face significant financial losses as dozens of major brands, such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery, have paused their marketing campaigns on his social media platform, X, following his support for an antisemitic post. According to internal documents viewed by The New York Times, over 200 ad units from companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft have either halted or considered pausing their ads on the platform. Since Musk's takeover of X in October 2022, advertisers have been leaving due to reduced content moderation, resulting in a surge of hate speech. It is estimated that the company could lose $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year. X has filed a lawsuit against Media Matters, claiming defamation after the organization reported that major corporations' ads appeared alongside antisemitic and pro-Hitler content on Musk's platform. Musk denies being antisemitic and referred to Media Matters as "evil." The lawsuit alleges that Media Matters manipulated data to falsely associate ads with extremist posts. In response to an antisemitic remark on X, Musk faced backlash for endorsing the assertion that Jewish communities incite hatred against Whites. The White House condemned his engagement with the conspiracy theory. Musk later stated that he wished only the best for humanity.

The Indian government has taken steps to address the high cost of treating rare diseases by encouraging local pharmaceutical companies to produce medicines. Eight drugs for six rare diseases are expected to be available on the market by March 2024. The prices of these medications have dropped significantly compared to their imported counterparts, making them more affordable for patients. The diseases that will be targeted include Gaucher's disease, Wilson's disease, Tyrosinemia type 1, Dravet/Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Phenylketonuria, and Hyperammonemia. Some of these medications are off-patent, allowing for lower-cost alternatives to be developed. In addition to these rare diseases, efforts are being made to develop an oral hydroxyurea solution for treating sickle cell disease in children. The prevalence of rare diseases in India is estimated to affect 6% to 8% of the population, with around 8.4 crore to 10 crore Indians impacted.

The article also mentions the importance of projecting a leader for the party's electoral success. The elections in Rajasthan will take place on November 25, and the results will be announced on December 3.

King Charles III has received tens of millions of pounds from deceased individuals in recent years, which has been used to renovate his properties. The money comes from the estates of people who died without a will or next of kin under a feudal system called bona vacatia. The Duchy of Lancaster, which receives the funds, claims to donate the revenue to charity after deducting costs. However, only a small portion is actually used for charitable purposes, with the rest being used to refurbish the King's properties, which are then leased out. This practice has been criticized by some, as many of the deceased were living in poor conditions. Charles III's reign has so far been characterized by continuity rather than major reforms or controversy. It remains to be seen what impact this revelation will have.

A new report by the Autonomy campaign group suggests that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could enable a four-day workweek without reducing pay. The study, titled GPT-4 (Day Week): Great Britain Edition, examines the potential impact of AI on lives and livelihoods in the UK. According to the report, if AI is used properly, nearly 9 million people in the UK could enjoy a four-day workweek by 2033, while an additional 28 million workers could see their hours reduced by 10%. These figures represent around 28% and 88% of the UK's labor force respectively. The study used population data, workforce information, an artificial intelligence exposure index, and productivity predictions to make these projections. It also simulated scenarios based on AI increasing productivity by 20%. The report recommends that public and private sector employers take advantage of this opportunity to improve the lives of millions of people and become leaders in adopting workplace AI. A similar study conducted in the US by Autonomy indicated that around 35 million Americans could also enjoy a four-day workweek by 2033. However, some skeptics question the unproven and speculative benefits of large language models (LLMs) like AI and highlight concerns around issues such as prejudice, racism, and data leaks.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend the virtual BRICS-plus meeting where leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa discussed the Israel-Hamas war. The meeting was called by South Africa, the current chair of the group, who accused Israel of war crimes and genocide in Gaza. While South Africa took a strong stance against Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the crisis on failed diplomacy by the United States, and Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar attended the meeting on behalf of PM Modi and emphasized the need for de-escalation, humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages. PM Modi's absence was attributed to prior commitments and ongoing political campaigning. India's abstention from the UN General Assembly vote on a ceasefire resolution was seen as a pro-Israeli stance, although India has maintained a nuanced position throughout the crisis, condemning terrorism while also supporting the socio-economic welfare of the Palestinian people.

China has reportedly created its own 'near-space' command, following the establishment of the United States' Space Force in 2019. The new command operates alongside China's army, air force, navy, and rocket branches, reporting directly to the top level of the military and having access to hypersonic weapons. Researchers claim that near-space is a hotly-contested zone that can determine the outcome of future battles. The unit would focus on targeting opposing nations' rocket sites to curtail their anti-satellite missile capabilities. Experts suggest that China's investment in near-space technologies is expected given the country's military challenges. The US is concerned about China's rapid development in space and aims to establish rules and partnerships with countries like Japan to counter Chinese aggression.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Unit 504, a secretive spy unit similar to Mossad, has played a significant role in Israel's ground offensive in Gaza. The unit focuses on military operations and has been involved in exposing how Hamas uses hospitals in Gaza for militant activities. Trained operatives carry out highly classified operations, including interrogating Palestinians, providing intelligence to the IDF, and gathering information about Hamas tunnels and weapons depots. Unit 504 has flagged numerous terrorist sites for IDF operations and developed virtual reality technology to assist soldiers. Additionally, the unit has helped in civilian evacuations by sending messages and flyers urging them to flee to safer areas.

Scientists believe that dinosaurs may exist on another planet, despite the fact that they have been extinct on Earth for over 65 million years. A recent study suggests that a "Jurassic World" could currently exist on a different planet. By investigating materials present during the dinosaur era but not on modern Earth, scientists may be able to discover evidence of this kind of life. The study highlights the significance of oxygen levels, as Earth had higher oxygen content during the age of the dinosaurs, around 30%. Today, the percentage of oxygen has settled at 21%. Specific telescopes can detect conditions similar to those experienced by dinosaurs, indicating the potential presence of complex life on distant planets. Another indicator of complex life is whether a planet is in the Phanerozoic period, which encompasses most of Earth's history with complex life forms. Scientists hope that finding planets with increased oxygen content will make the search for intriguing life forms easier and potentially lead to the discovery of other dinosaurs.

Delhi's water minister, Atishi, has raised concerns about an impending severe drinking water shortage in the city. She accused Delhi's chief secretary of halting funds to the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), leading to unpaid staff and a lack of funds for essential operations. Atishi warned of potential dirty water, sewer overflow, and the risk of an epidemic in many areas. Delhi requires 1,300 MGD of water, but the DJB can only provide 1,000 MGD, causing shortages in multiple areas. The city's water crisis is attributed to population growth, drought, mismanagement, and urbanization that neglected natural water resources. Unregulated extraction of water and illegal borewells worsen the situation. The government plans to divert funds to the DJB, install tube wells, recharge groundwater, and use treated wastewater for various purposes.

North Korea has launched six satellites since 1998, with two successfully reaching orbit. The country plans to launch another satellite, despite previous failed attempts. Japan and South Korea criticize this move, as it violates the UN ban on Pyongyang's missile development. North Korea aims to develop advanced satellites and military reconnaissance satellites, using dual-nozzle liquid-fueled engines. The United States and its allies consider these satellite tests as violations of UN resolutions. North Korea sees its space program as its sovereign right. The launch of satellites could enhance North Korea's intelligence capabilities and demonstrate its space power. It could also reduce tensions if it verifies that the US and its allies are not planning an attack.

China and Saudi Arabia have entered into their first currency swap agreement, worth $6.93 billion, in a move to strengthen financial cooperation and promote trade and investment. The three-year agreement can be extended by mutual consent. A currency swap is a financial arrangement where two parties exchange a specified amount of one currency for another at an agreed-upon rate, aiming to reduce risk and access foreign currency. China aims to reduce its reliance on the US dollar, while Saudi Arabia seeks to increase foreign investment and diversify its economy. Experts believe that the United States should not be concerned about this agreement, as China's use of currency swap lines differs from the US, and the dollar remains crucial for global trade and monetary policy. Although the deal may not be significant in size, it holds symbolic importance due to Saudi Arabia's position as the world's leading oil exporter. China has a vast network of currency swap arrangements with around 40 countries but typically does not disclose detailed terms.

### [Subrata Roy’s death: What happens to Sahara’s Rs 25,000 crore funds with SEBI?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/subrata-roys-death-what-happens-to-saharas-rs-25000-crore-funds-with-sebi-13411912.html)

Subrata Roy, the founder of Sahara Group, passed away in Mumbai at the age of 75. This has brought attention to the issue of over Rs 25,000 crore in undistributed funds that have been with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for more than a decade. The legal troubles for Sahara Group started in the early 2010s when SEBI ordered two of its firms to repay money to investors raised through illegal bonds. The Supreme Court later upheld SEBI's order, asking Sahara to deposit around Rs 24,000 crore with SEBI. Subrata Roy even served over two years in jail for failing to appear in court. SEBI has issued refunds totaling Rs 138.07 crore to some investors, but there are still unclaimed funds of over Rs 25,000 crore. The government is exploring options to transfer these funds to the Consolidated Fund of India, but it is too early to do so as new registrations for claims are still taking place. SEBI has launched a refund portal to facilitate repayment to investors, and once this process is complete, the possibility of transferring funds to the Consolidated Fund of India will be examined.

### [The sad tale of Budhni Manjhiyain, Nehru’s ‘tribal wife’, who died in exile](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/budhni-manjhiyain-nehru-tribal-wife-who-passes-away-ostracised-life-13411532.html)

Budhni Manjhiyain, an 80-year-old woman from the Santhal tribe, passed away at her residence near Panchet in Jharkhand. What made her unique was her connection to Jawaharlal Nehru, the former Prime Minister of India. In 1959, Nehru visited Dhanbad in West Bengal to inaugurate a dam, and he insisted that a woman from the project be part of the ceremony. Budhni, along with another tribal member, was selected to welcome Nehru. However, when Nehru garlanded Budhni at the event, it caused controversy within the tribal community. They believed that Budhni had married Nehru by accepting the garland, which led to her excommunication from the community. Budhni then sought shelter in Panchet, where she faced numerous challenges but eventually found employment with the Damodar Valley Corporation. In 1985, Rajiv Gandhi met with her and helped reinstate her job. Budhni worked until her retirement in 2005. After her passing, there have been calls for a monument in her honor and for pension support for her daughter.

The workers trapped inside the collapsed Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi district are facing challenges in their battle for survival. The rescue operation has been ongoing for 10 days, with various agencies working to find a way to evacuate the workers. A drilling machine broke down over the weekend, causing a temporary halt in the operation, but an alternative strategy called "top down" drilling was adopted. Meanwhile, the stranded workers are being provided with water, oxygen, and cooked meals, along with dry fruits, antidepressants, and multivitamins. The government is expanding their food supply to include items like bananas, apple slices, daliya, and khichdi. Rescuers are using a six-inch pipe to send these supplies to the workers. The trapped workers have also been encouraged to engage in activities like yoga, walking, and conversations with their loved ones to maintain high morale. Sanitation needs are being taken care of, and there is a natural water source inside the tunnel. Despite the difficulties, the workers' spirits remain resilient. The latest developments include the arrival of robotics machines from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the establishment of an alternative lifeline for evacuation.

Microsoft has hired OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to lead a new advanced AI research team, marking a significant development in the partnership between the two companies. OpenAI, originally founded as a non-profit organization in 2015, later transformed into a "capped profit" company. In 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI to support the commercialization of its technologies. OpenAI's most notable achievement is the launch of GPT-3, a powerful language model with 175 billion parameters. Microsoft also developed a supercomputer exclusively for training large OpenAI models and integrated GPT-4 into its consumer products. The article mentions that Altman was recently dismissed from his CEO position at OpenAI, which led to unrest among the company's staff. Despite these developments, OpenAI's planned IPO worth $90 billion may face uncertainties.

Yemen's Houthi militia group, known as the Houthis, has hijacked a cargo ship called Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea. The ship was en route to India from Turkey and had 25 crew members on board. The Houthis released a video of the hijacking, stating that all ships associated with Israel would be considered legitimate targets. The article provides background information about the Houthis, who are Zaydi Shiites and have gained power in northern Yemen since 2014. They are supported by Iran, similar to Hamas and Hezbollah. In response to the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, the Houthis declared their support for Hamas and launched several missile attacks towards Tel Aviv. The hijacking of the ship is seen as a continuation of their anti-Israel stance. The ship has been taken to a port area in Yemen, and various countries, including Japan and Israel, have called for its release. The United States also denounced the seizure, emphasizing it as a violation of international law. The hijacking has significant implications and could escalate the Israel-Palestine conflict, potentially involving the United States and Iran.

Opposition politicians in Albania set off smoke flares and disrupted a parliamentary session to prevent the voting on the 2024 budget. Members of the Democratic Party protested against what they see as increasing authoritarian rule by the governing Socialists. The opposition wants to establish investigation commissions to look into suspected corruption cases involving Prime Minister Edi Rama and other high-ranking officials. The Socialists argue that the opposition's demands do not meet constitutional requirements. The unrest began after former Prime Minister Sali Berisha, leader of the Democratic Party, was charged with corruption. The opposition protests are expected to escalate further.

### [TikTok has a problem of sexual explicit material. How children are at risk](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/tiktok-has-a-problem-of-sexual-explicit-material-how-children-are-at-risk-13409902.html)

The rise of TikTok has brought concerns about explicit content and the safety of young users to the forefront. Despite efforts to moderate content, TikTok's focus appears to be on maximizing user engagement and traffic rather than creating a safe environment. The platform relies on both automated and human moderation, but the automated system is not always precise, leading to the removal of beneficial content and the presence of harmful content. User tactics such as "algospeak" further complicate content moderation. TikTok's promotion of explicit and harmful content can put young users at risk, and it has been criticized for suppressing educational content related to the LGBTQ+ community while allowing harmful content to remain visible. The platform's age-verification process is easily bypassed, allowing explicit content creators to promote themselves. This content can perpetuate harmful attitudes towards sex and consent, particularly affecting young boys' mental health. The promotion of idealistic and sexualized content also harms the self-perception of young women and queer youth. While TikTok offers an opportunity to spread educational content about sex, such content may not receive the same engagement as more explicit videos. Self-regulation by social media platforms is not enough, and regulatory bodies need to step in. Parents should actively monitor their child's TikTok activity if they allow access, and efforts should be focused on equipping young users with media literacy skills.

### [Sweet Pain: Why drinking red wine may give you a headache](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/sweet-pain-why-drinking-red-wine-may-give-you-a-headache-13409722.html)

A recent study conducted by scientists from the University of California suggests that the compound quercetin found in red wine may be the cause of headaches experienced by some individuals. Quercetin, a compound and flavanol found in fruits and vegetables, is produced by grapes in response to sunlight. When combined with alcohol and consumed, quercetin blocks the metabolism of acetaldehyde in the body, leading to its accumulation and causing inflammation, which results in headaches. The study also plans to test their theory through a clinical trial using wines with varying levels of quercetin. If successful, this research could potentially help consumers select wines with lower levels of quercetin to avoid headaches.

Israel's ground offensive in Gaza continues, with reports of raids on hospitals and attacks on schools. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have deployed a mixed-gender battalion called the "Shahar" Battalion, which includes both men and women combat soldiers. This is not the first time women have served in combat positions in the IDF, as they have been part of the forces since the War of Independence in 1948. The IDF currently has at least five mixed-gender battalions, including the Caracal Battalion, the Baradalas, and the Lions of Jordan Valley.

The Shahar Battalion, led by Lt Col Yarden, is involved in search-and-rescue operations in Gaza City's Shati Camp. Around 40% of the troops in this unit are women, and they undertake various tasks alongside their male counterparts, such as breaching buildings and searching for Hamas weaponry. The Caracal Battalion has previously engaged in combat, killing around 100 Hamas terrorists during an attack in October. Other mixed-gender units, like Bardelas and Caracal, are deployed along the border with Egypt, while the Lions of Jordan Valley focus on protecting the northern Jordan Valley border.

Despite their contributions and achievements, coed units in the IDF have faced criticism from some rabbis, former commanders, and conservative voices in the country. Concerns about physical strength differences and maintaining traditional notions of modesty have been raised. However, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has defended these units, stating that female and male combat soldiers are equal in the IDF.

Rescue operations to save 41 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel in Uttarakhand have entered their ninth day. A five-point plan has been devised, including drilling from three sides to reach the trapped workers. The plan involves drilling a vertical hole from the top of the hill where the workers are trapped, as well as drilling a small tunnel from the Barkot side. The rescue efforts were temporarily halted when an auger machine developed a snag, but operations have since resumed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand that the workers will be evacuated safely. The rescue operation is challenging due to the non-uniform soil strata in the Himalayan region. The workers are being provided with multivitamins, antidepressants, and dry fruits to support their well-being.

A study conducted by Oxfam reveals that the richest one percent of the global population, amounting to 77 million people, are responsible for 16 percent of total global CO2 emissions resulting from their consumption. This group includes billionaires, millionaires, and individuals earning over $140,000 per year. The report suggests that addressing climate change requires tailored government policies since not everyone is equally accountable. The study also highlights the alarming disparity between the carbon footprints of the rich and the poor, with the top one percent emitting more carbon than the bottom 66 percent combined. In addition, high-income countries contribute significantly more to consumption-based CO2 emissions compared to low-income nations. The report emphasizes the need for progressive climate policies that place greater responsibility on those who emit the most, including measures such as taxing frequent air travel or non-green investments. Furthermore, the study shows that marginalized communities, women, and developing countries bear a disproportionate burden in terms of economic and physical vulnerability to extreme weather events. Oxfam insists that addressing extreme wealth through taxation can provide the necessary resources to tackle inequality and the climate crisis simultaneously.

Several BJP leaders and industrialists praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this achievement, while economists and analysts welcomed the reports. However, experts refuted the news, stating that India's GDP is around $3.45 trillion as of June. India aims to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025.

Joe Biden turned 81 today, making him the oldest sitting president in American history. His age is a significant concern for American voters, especially among young voters. Despite his vigorous schedule and jokes about his age, polls consistently show that Biden's age is the greatest concern for voters. While Donald Trump is only slightly younger than Biden, voters are less concerned about his age. Biden has struggled to change public perception on his age, despite his efforts to make light of it. Polls show that a majority of people believe Biden is too old to serve a second term. However, some analysts argue that age should not matter and that there are many people in their 80s who are perfectly capable of being president. Biden's age is likely to face even more scrutiny during the 2024 election campaign. Republicans have also focused their criticism on Vice President Kamala Harris, who would assume the presidency if anything were to happen to Biden.

The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government in India has imposed a ban on the production, storage, distribution, and sale of all halal-certified food, medicines, and cosmetic items within the state, with the exception of products intended for export. This action was taken after an FIR (First Information Report) was filed against certain organizations for allegedly issuing forged halal certificates to boost sales. Halal refers to products that are permissible according to Islamic law, while haram refers to forbidden items. The criteria for halal meat involve specific conditions for animal slaughter. The ban on halal products in UP is based on the argument that halal certification creates confusion and violates public trust, as well as the assertion that some companies were involved in a criminal conspiracy targeting a particular community. The halal certification process in India is carried out by private companies recognized by Muslim consumers and regulators in Islamic countries. The ban has received mixed reactions, with some companies denying the allegations and expressing their intention to take legal action.

The TikTok profile Daily Believer has gained a large following by using computer-generated Jesuses to engage viewers and promise blessings in exchange for likes, comments, and shares. This approach is similar to the prosperity gospel, which teaches that faith in God will bring material wealth and happiness. The Daily Believer's content appeals to a wide range of Christian groups and has the potential to generate revenue through the TikTok Creator Fund. By framing their requests as coming from the Son of God, the Daily Believer has transformed viewer engagement into a religious act with the promise of divine reward. However, the content seems to be aimed at those who already consider themselves Christian and offers little persuasion or explanation of why someone should become a Christian. Overall, the Daily Believer represents a new expression of an ancient religious motivation – the desire for worldly health, wealth, and reward.

Iranian-backed militias have been launching attacks on US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria since mid-October. These attacks have resulted in minor injuries to US personnel, mostly traumatic brain injuries. The US has responded with limited military strikes in an attempt to dissuade the militants without escalating the conflict. The attacks have primarily been carried out by suicide drones or rockets and have caused little damage. The militias responsible for the attacks have rebranded themselves as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and have targeted US military bases in Syria and Iraq. The Biden administration has dispatched more troops and military equipment to the region to deter further attacks. However, critics argue that the US response has been insufficient and has failed to deter the militias. The US has focused its retaliatory airstrikes in Syria rather than Iraq to avoid alienating the Iraqi government.

Colombian popstar Shakira is set to go on trial in Barcelona for allegedly evading €14.5 million in taxes. Prosecutors are seeking an eight-year jail term and a fine of nearly €24 million. The case centers around where Shakira lived between 2012 and 2014, with Spanish authorities claiming she primarily resided in Spain during that time. They allege that she listed the Bahamas as her primary residence until 2015. Shakira denies any wrongdoing and asserts that she was leading a "nomadic life" until 2014, earning most of her money from international tours. She has already paid all taxes owed to the Spanish government during her claimed residency in the Bahamas.

### [Dogs, robots and sponge bombs: How Israel is tracking and destroying Hamas tunnels](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/hamas-terror-tunnels-dogs-robots-sponge-bombs-israel-tracking-destroying-13398122.html)

Israel is intensively targeting Hamas and its tunnel network in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been conducting airstrikes and raids on the Gaza Strip, including at the Al-Shifa Hospital, which they claim houses a Hamas command center. The IDF is determined to destroy the labyrinth of tunnels built by Hamas, known as the "Gaza Metro," which serve as hiding places for militants, weapons storage, and command centers.

To locate these tunnels, Israel is employing various technologies such as surveillance drones, satellites, and ground-penetrating radar. However, the rubble caused by Israeli bombardment may hinder the use of satellite data. Mapping and destroying the tunnels pose additional challenges. The IDF is using attack dogs, unmanned vehicles, and robots to map the tunnels' intricate paths and is avoiding sending troops without prior mapping due to potential booby traps left by Hamas.

To seal off and destroy the tunnels, the IDF is utilizing innovative methods such as exploding gel and sponge bombs that expand rapidly and harden to seal gaps or tunnel entrances. Additionally, the tunnels are equipped with wires and cables for electricity, internet, telephones, and military communication.

Hamas began constructing these tunnels in the mid-1990s, and they have become a vital asset for the group in Gaza, contributing to its strength compared to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The tunnels vary in size and can accommodate cars and trucks, while most are deep enough to resist bunker-busting bombs. They also likely contain observation and detection devices to aid in targeting Israeli forces.

The IDF has already destroyed 130 shafts but did not provide a specific count for demolished tunnels. The ongoing operation aims to dismantle Hamas and its extensive tunnel network in Gaza.

Indian nurse Nimisha Priya, who is currently in Yemen, has been sentenced to death for killing a Yemeni national named Talal Abdo Mahdi. The Yemeni Supreme Court has rejected appeals against her death sentence, making it unlikely that she will be able to avoid prison. Priya had asked Mahdi for assistance in opening a clinic in Yemen, but their relationship deteriorated over time. In 2017, Priya gave Mahdi a sedative injection to retrieve her passport, but he died from a drug overdose. She then sought help from another nurse to dispose of his body. Priya and the other nurse were arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 2017, and Priya was later given a death sentence in 2018. Priya's mother and a domestic help from Kerala have appealed to the Delhi High Court to allow them to visit Yemen and negotiate with the deceased's relatives using blood money, which could potentially commute Priya's sentence. However, Priya claims she is unable to pay the required amount. The Indian government is offering consular support but has limited power in the legal matter.

Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has been the focus of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Israeli forces raided the hospital, claiming that it is being used by Hamas for military purposes. Civilians, including patients, health workers, and displaced people seeking refuge, remain trapped inside the hospital. The Israeli soldiers entered the hospital with tanks and other military vehicles, preventing anyone from leaving. Inside the hospital, Israeli troops reportedly engaged with Hamas members and found an operational command center and weapons belonging to Hamas. The IDF spokesperson stated that Hamas had systematically used the hospital for military operations. Hamas denies these claims and describes them as lies and propaganda. The safety of the patients in the hospital is at risk, as they are without power, water, and oxygen. Doctors have been forced to perform surgeries without proper anesthesia. International organizations have condemned Israel's actions and called for the protection of medical staff and patients. The World Health Organization has deemed the Israeli incursion into the hospital as totally unacceptable.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Houthi movement in Yemen has fired a US drone, raising concerns of a regional escalation after formally declaring war on Israel. The Iran-linked militia, controlling parts of Yemen, vowed to continue assaulting Israel, potentially targeting Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The attacks are seen as a show of support for Hamas and reflect the Houthis' anti-Western sentiment. While most of their attacks have been intercepted by Israeli air defenses, they pose a threat due to the Houthi's growing arsenal of long-range ballistic missiles, smaller cruise missiles, and suicide drones. The strikes could complicate peace talks between the Houthis and the Saudi government.

He built a massive financial empire starting with a small loan in 1978, but faced numerous legal challenges as the business grew. Despite battling court cases and regulators, Roy continued to expand his empire. The Sahara Group's portfolio included financial services, real estate, hotels, an IPL cricket team, and a Formula One racing team. However, allegations were made that the funds collected by Sahara actually belonged to politicians, cricketers, and Bollywood stars. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) launched a probe into Sahara's activities after receiving complaints about undisclosed convertible bonds. The legal battle between Sahara and SEBI became protracted, eventually leading to Roy being sent to Tihar jail. While the case was ongoing, Sahara continued to collect funds, claiming that all investors received their money back with returns. Eventually, Sahara deposited over ₹24,000 crore with SEBI. Currently, SEBI has managed to refund only about ₹138 crore, while the remaining corpus in SEBI's account exceeds ₹25,000 crore.

Forty labourers have been trapped inside a tunnel in Uttarkashi, India for five days. Fellow workers staged a protest at the site of the accident due to the slow pace of rescue operations. The delay in rescuing the trapped labourers is attributed to landslides, loose rocks, and technical problems. The hilly terrain and soft rocks in the region have made digging difficult. The use of an auger machine to install steel pipes failed, prompting the arrival of a new machine from Delhi. Despite the challenges, efforts are being made to provide the trapped workers with food and oxygen through a pipe. Family members remain skeptical about the progress of the rescue operation. Experts question the cause of the tunnel collapse and suggest inadequate investigations and faulty construction practices as potential reasons. Uttarakhand is constructing the 4.5-km tunnel as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Char Dham project.

The Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the largest and most advanced hospital in the Gaza Strip, has ceased functioning due to a lack of power and water supply. Israeli troops from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recently raided the hospital, claiming that Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, was using it as a command center for military operations and hostages. The hospital officials and the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry have denied these allegations. The IDF stated that they are conducting a targeted operation against Hamas inside the hospital based on intelligence information. The raids have put the patients, staff, and displaced civilians seeking shelter at the hospital at risk. The IDF spokesperson referred to the hospital as the "beating heart" of Hamas. Israel claims that Hamas is using hospitals to conceal weapons and operate command centers, while Hamas denies these accusations. The legality of the raids is being questioned, as hospitals are afforded special protections during times of war unless they are being used by combatants to hide fighters or store weapons.

Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has made a surprising political comeback as the country's new foreign secretary. The move by current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is seen as a risky gamble, as his ruling Conservative Party trails behind the Opposition Labour Party in the opinion polls. Sunak's decision to bring back Cameron is viewed as a desperate attempt to unite the Conservative Party and appeal to moderates. However, critics argue that it may give the impression that Sunak couldn't find enough competent people within his own party. Cameron's return has been labeled as bizarre and desperate by Scotland's political party, the Scottish Greens. The article also highlights that Cameron's appointment comes at a critical time, with looming Brexit challenges, tensions with China, Russia's war in Ukraine, and Israel's conflict with Hamas. Overall, Cameron's political comeback raises questions about the direction of UK politics and the effectiveness of Sunak's leadership.

India is considering allowing the recruitment of transgender individuals into the Armed Forces, joining 19 other countries that already permit trans soldiers. While India has made progress in providing equal rights to the LGBTQ+ community, including allowing women in the military, transgenders are currently not permitted to serve. A study group has been formed to examine the implications and potential challenges of this move. Some concerns include housing, administrative issues, and the impact on opportunities for others. Various countries around the world, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Canada, Israel, the UK, and New Zealand, have already accepted transgender soldiers into their armed forces. The United States has had a complex history with transgender service members, with a ban imposed by former President Donald Trump later reversed by President Joe Biden.

The article discusses the link between air pollution and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. After Diwali, air pollution levels spiked in several cities in India, including Delhi and Mumbai. These cities continue to rank among the most polluted in the world. The World Health Organization estimates that over 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, with a significant number in low- and middle-income countries like India. A researcher explains that Indians' susceptibility to diabetes is due to their low body mass index but high proportion of fat. Type 2 diabetes occurs when blood glucose levels are too high, and it is the most common type of diabetes. A study conducted in India found that inhaling polluted air, specifically fine particulate matter (PM2.5), increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. The study analyzed data from over 12,000 adults in Delhi and Chennai from 2010 to 2017 and found that exposure to PM2.5 led to elevated blood sugar levels and a higher risk of diabetes. Experts suggest that air pollution heightens the risk of diabetes through increased oxidative stress and damage to the pancreas's beta cells, which decrease insulin production. Additionally, air pollution has been linked to insulin resistance and inflammation, impacting glucose metabolism and cardiovascular health. The article also mentions the indirect link between air pollution and diabetes, as pollution levels often lead to a sedentary lifestyle due to limited outdoor activities.

She is currently 34 weeks pregnant and is expecting twins, with one baby in each uterus. This unique pregnancy has attracted attention and has become the focus of a case study. The likelihood of having twins in each uterus is extremely rare, and the pregnancy is considered high risk. A team of experts will be involved in monitoring the delivery procedure, as each uterus may contract at different times. The classification of the newborns is still debated in medicine. Despite the excitement of having two new family members, Kelsey and her husband have decided that this will be their last pregnancy. A double uterus, also known as a double cervix, is a rare condition where the two small tubes that normally unite to create the uterus do not join completely, resulting in separate organs.

The situation at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza is dire as Israel's ongoing attack on the Hamas-controlled enclave has led to a healthcare crisis. The hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility, has stopped functioning and essential units have collapsed. Tanks and armored vehicles are positioned near the hospital, trapping thousands of displaced individuals inside. With power cuts and a lack of fuel, the hospital is struggling to save lives. At least 32 patients, including three newborn babies, have died due to the siege and power outage. Babies requiring intensive care are at great risk as incubators are shut off, and doctors resort to wrapping them in foil and keeping them next to hot water for warmth. The lack of electricity, food, water, and equipment further complicates efforts to save newborns. The hospital is overwhelmed, with infants transmitting viruses to each other due to inadequate infection control measures. The dire conditions have left doctors and nurses emotionally and physically exhausted. Alongside the infants, there are around 7,000 people sheltering at the hospital, including patients and medical staff. Bodies are piling up, and dogs have resorted to eating corpses. The World Health Organization warns that the hospital is nearly a cemetery. Israel has accused Hamas of operating a command center under the hospital, but these claims have been denied by Hamas and Gaza health ministry officials who believe it is propaganda to justify attacks on health facilities. Despite international calls for protection, the Israeli onslaught continues.

Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has been named as the foreign secretary, a highly unusual move for a former leader and non-lawmaker. Cameron resigned in 2016 after advocating for Britain to remain in the European Union during the Brexit referendum. He will be appointed to the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament. While Cameron's return to government is not unprecedented, it has raised concerns about accountability. During his tenure, Cameron implemented austerity measures and held the Brexit vote, both of which continue to have a significant impact on the UK. He also fostered closer ties with China, which has since been criticized. Cameron was recently embroiled in a lobbying scandal, prompting calls for tighter regulations. The appointment of Cameron as foreign secretary has been seen as a gamble by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, with some questioning Cameron's accountability as he serves as an appointed Lord rather than an elected lawmaker.

### [World Diabetes Day 2023: Does too much salt really enhance the risk of type 2 diabetes?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/does-too-much-salt-really-enhance-the-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-13356012.html)

A new study conducted by researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans suggests that there may be a link between salt consumption and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study, which followed around 400,000 adults for nearly twelve years, found that approximately 13,000 participants developed type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to note that this study only suggests an association between salt use and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and further research is needed to establish a causal relationship. The study also faced limitations in terms of data quality, as the assessment of salt use was based on a simple question that did not provide detailed information about the amount of salt associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. While reducing salt intake is generally recommended for overall health, it is important to focus on known factors that reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and eating a healthy diet.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.China and Pakistan are conducting a joint naval exercise in the northern Arabian Sea called Sea Guardian-3, which is the largest-ever joint exercise between the two countries. The exercise aims to enhance their strategic partnership and defense cooperation. It will involve training courses such as formation maneuvering, search and seizure operations, joint search and rescue, and anti-submarine warfare. Experts believe that China and Pakistan's common interests lie in safeguarding strategic sea lanes and contributing to peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region. The Chinese navy has deployed several assets including a destroyer, frigates, a submarine, and a supply ship, while Pakistan has contributed nine vessels, helicopters, fighter jets, and marines. India has expressed concern about China's increased naval activity in the Indian Ocean and its growing closeness with Pakistan. China's ability to project naval power in distant waters and its establishment of ports in the Indian Ocean region have raised alarm bells for India. Furthermore, China's support in modernizing Pakistan's navy is seen as an attempt to challenge India's naval strength and change the status quo in the region.

### [How Britain’s ex-PM David Cameron has returned from political wilderness](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/britain-ex-pm-david-cameron-foreign-secretary-political-wilderness-rishi-sunak-conservative-party-13383982.html)

British prime minister Rishi Sunak surprised the country by appointing former prime minister David Cameron as the new Foreign Secretary. This decision was part of a Cabinet reshuffle that also saw Home Secretary Suella Braverman being replaced by James Cleverly. Cameron, who kept a low profile since his resignation in 2016, returns to politics after working in business and writing his memoirs.

David Cameron rose through the ranks of the Conservative party and became the youngest prime minister in 200 years in 2010, leading a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His tenure was marked by issues such as spending cuts and the divisive Brexit referendum. He campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU but ultimately lost the vote and resigned, handing over power to Theresa May.

The significance of Cameron's return lies in the rarity of a non-lawmaker taking on a senior government post and a former prime minister holding a Cabinet job. Despite previous differences between Cameron and Sunak, the new foreign secretary expressed his support for the prime minister and his desire to be part of a strong team. This unexpected appointment is seen as an opportunity for Sunak to gain attention and bridge divides within the Conservative political family.

While moderates in the party welcome Cameron's inclusion, the Labour party criticized Sunak, calling the move a "last gasp act of desperation." They argue that Cameron's appointment shows a lack of talent and ideas within the government. Overall, Cameron's return is expected to have an impact on the upcoming general election and help Sunak focus on international challenges, given his experience and relationships with world leaders.

### [UK PM fires Suella Braverman: The many controversies of the ex-home secretary](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-fires-suella-braverman-controversies-ex-home-secretary-13383762.html)

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has fired Home Secretary Suella Braverman due to her controversial remarks on the police's handling of pro-Palestinian protesters. Braverman had accused the police of bias and claimed that they were going easy on pro-Palestinian demonstrators while being stern with right-wing protesters. She also faced backlash for defending a proposal to stop charities from providing tents to the homeless, calling homelessness a "lifestyle choice." Additionally, Braverman made comments about asylum seekers pretending to be homosexual or transgender to receive special treatment and stay in the UK, drawing criticism from human rights activists. She also stoked controversy by claiming that child grooming gangs in the UK were mostly British-Pakistani men, which was found to be significantly misleading. Braverman had previously lost her job as home secretary for breaching the ministerial code but was reappointed by Sunak shortly afterward. She also made remarks on Indian immigrants that almost derailed trade deal talks between India and the UK. Braverman is known for her controversial stance on immigration and asylum seekers, including supporting the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda. She has used strong language, referring to the arrival of asylum seekers as an "invasion."

Suella Braverman, the home secretary of the United Kingdom, has been sacked by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak due to controversial comments she made about the police's handling of a pro-Palestine march. In an article published in The Times, Braverman accused the police of bias and leniency towards pro-Palestinian demonstrators. This led to anger from opposition lawmakers and members of the Conservative Party, prompting Sunak to ask her to leave government. This decision came as part of a major Cabinet reshuffle, with James Cleverly confirmed as the new home secretary and former PM David Cameron returning as foreign secretary. This is not the first time Braverman has been asked to step down from the same position. She had previously resigned in October last year for sending confidential information through a private email address. Braverman's sacking has been welcomed by rivals, while supporters express sadness at her departure. The government hopes that this cabinet reshuffle, including the return of Cameron, will improve the prospects of the Conservative Party.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The United States is hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco. The main focus of the summit is a meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping, with expectations for announcements and agreements to be made.

APEC is a forum to promote trade and economic development among nations around the Pacific Ocean. It has been effective in reducing tariffs and easing business relations. However, the trade landscape has changed, with the US focusing on economic competition with China. The summit may face tensions due to the Israel-Hamas war, and there could be political participation intrigue involving Taiwan and Hong Kong. The leaders may not have matching outfits for the traditional "family photo" this year.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The main hospitals in the Gaza Strip, Al Shifa Hospital and Al-Quds, have been forced to shut down due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Shifa has been without water for three days and is no longer functioning as a hospital. This adds to the already dire situation, as 20 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are said to be "no longer functioning." Hospitals in Gaza have become targets of Israeli forces, and the entry of aid has been restricted. Despite Israel offering fuel to Al-Shifa hospital, it was not enough to sustain its operations. The lack of power has caused multiple deaths, with patients in intensive care unable to receive the necessary care. Both Al-Shifa and Al Quds hospitals have run out of power, putting patients' lives at risk. Israel claims that Hamas has military assets under hospitals, justifying their attacks, but international laws state that hospitals should be protected and respected in times of conflict. The Geneva Conventions provide special protection to civilian hospitals, but this protection can be lost if armed groups use the hospital for hostile activities. Israel has faced criticism and pressure to comply with international laws and stop attacking hospitals.

San Francisco is preparing to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference, a major meeting of international leaders. The city is making significant efforts to clean up its downtown areas that have been affected by issues such as drug use, homelessness, litter, and crime. Streets are being cleaned, potholes repaired, and police officers deployed to ensure safety during the summit. San Francisco hopes to project an image of being a place for business and investment, aiming to counter the negative perceptions that have arisen in recent years. However, while some areas appear pristine, the underlying problems of drug use and mental illness still persist in certain parts of the city. San Francisco has faced criticism from conservative media outlets and Chinese language media, labeling it as a "mecca of crime" and a "ghost town." City officials view the APEC summit as an opportunity to reshape the narrative about San Francisco and showcase its efforts to address issues like homelessness and drug addiction. They hope that visitors will experience the positive aspects of the city and tell the whole story. The city has also implemented initiatives such as opening a nighttime shelter for homeless people and offering free or reduced rent on empty retail space to encourage business growth. Despite ongoing criticisms, San Francisco's restaurant scene remains vibrant, with numerous upscale eateries attracting customers.

Recent studies have shown that sleep regularity, rather than sleep duration, is crucial for longevity and overall health. Getting six hours of sleep regularly was found to be better for reducing the risk of premature death compared to getting irregular eight hours of sleep. Inconsistent sleep patterns have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other health problems. Individual sleep requirements vary, and while health authorities provide guidelines, each person's unique needs should be taken into account. Quality of sleep is just as important as duration for brain function. Instead of strictly following the eight-hour rule, experts suggest listening to one's body and prioritizing quality sleep.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of rules that govern marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and other personal issues applicable to all Indian residents regardless of religious beliefs. A committee led by retired Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai is expected to submit a comprehensive report on the UCC to Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. The state government is considering calling a special session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly to enact the UCC bill. The committee's report emphasizes equal rights for daughters living on ancestral properties and gender equality but does not advocate for raising the age at which women can get married. The proposed laws focus on consistency in personal laws, including child custody, maintenance, divorce, property rights, and inter-state property rights. The draft bill also seeks to ban polygamy and allows live-in couples to register their relationship. The Union government may use the report as a model when developing the UCC Bill for nationwide implementation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made the UCC a prime focus for upcoming elections and aims to promote uniformity and law reform. Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, two other BJP-ruled states, have also initiated the process of implementing the UCC.

The Delhi government is considering artificial rain as a solution and has agreed to cover the entire cost. IIT-Kanpur is reportedly ready to produce artificial rain through cloud seeding by spraying particles of salts on clouds. The declining air quality in Delhi is due to crop residue burning in neighboring states.

A new study conducted by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Penn State University has found that flexible working can have positive effects on heart health and reduce the risk of cardiac events. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at the impact of work environment on heart health and surveyed employees from an IT company and a long-term care company. The researchers assigned each employee a cardiometabolic risk score (CRS) and found that while flexible work did not improve the employees' CRS overall, it did show reductions in those who started with a higher baseline CRS. Older employees, especially those over 45, were more likely to see a reduction in their heart risk profiles. The study highlights the importance of working conditions and their impact on health, particularly for low- and middle-wage workers who have less control over their schedules and job demands. Overall, the study suggests that implementing flexible work policies could be beneficial for employees' heart health.

"Fried rice syndrome," a type of food poisoning caused by the bacteria Bacillus cereus, has returned to public attention after an incident involving the death of a student who consumed noodles left unattended for five days. The bacteria can multiply when food is left unrefrigerated for long periods of time. The term "fried rice syndrome" originated from the first documented cases connected to cooked white rice that wasn't refrigerated and was subsequently used to make fried rice dishes at restaurants. The bacteria thrives in pre-cooked starchy foods like rice and pasta, and its ideal growth temperature range is between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The symptoms of the syndrome resemble other gastrointestinal disorders, and treatment usually involves hydration and rest. To prevent food poisoning, it is advised to avoid eating leftovers and to ensure proper storage and cooling of cooked food.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has allowed the use of "green crackers" during the Diwali festival to address concerns about air pollution. Green crackers are considered eco-friendly and cause less air and noise pollution compared to traditional fireworks. They were developed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and have smaller shells, no ash, and reduced usage of raw materials. These crackers also release water vapor, which acts as a dust suppressant. There are three types of green crackers: SWAS, SAFAL, and STAR. Experts, however, are skeptical about their environmental friendliness, as even with a 30% reduction in particulate matter levels, the pollution caused by these crackers would still be high. Some manufacturers claim that green crackers cannot function without barium, which contradicts the requirements set by NEERI. The effectiveness of the restrictions on firecrackers and the clarity on the production of green crackers remain questionable. It is advisable to celebrate Diwali with candles and diyas instead of fireworks if unsure about the green credentials of the crackers.

Qatar has also provided financial support to Palestinians in Gaza and has been involved in previous negotiations, such as the release of prisoners and hosting peace talks. Despite the challenges, Qatar aims to establish itself as a diplomatic player and promote peace in the region.

Light to moderate rain showers were observed in Delhi and surrounding regions, providing some relief from the severe air pollution. The timing of the rainfall is significant as the city government plans to use cloud seeding for artificial rain. The air quality index (AQI) improved in various areas after the rain, with some locations moving from the severe category to the moderate or satisfactory categories. Rain is known to help cleanse the air by capturing and removing pollutants like particulate matter. However, its impact on pollution is more significant for larger particles. The Delhi government aims to implement artificial rain through cloud seeding technology to address air pollution. Factors such as wind speed and temperature also play a role in improving AQI. Wind can aid in dispersing particulate matter, while temperature inversion can trap pollutants near the ground. Efforts are being made to tackle air pollution in different regions of India, including addressing stubble burning and implementing measures to curb pollution in Mumbai.

An environmentalist in Israel is using birds of prey, such as eagles and vultures, to assist the army in locating dead bodies. Ohad Hatzofe of Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority tracks the migration patterns of these birds using GPS devices. The data collected by Hatzofe has helped locate four corpses so far. Birds of prey have a strong sense of smell and can detect dead bodies from a distance. The idea to involve these birds in the search for human remains came from a unit within the Israeli army responsible for locating missing soldiers. The program led by Hatzofe tracks endangered griffon vultures, eagles, and other birds of prey to study their migratory patterns, feeding habits, and environmental challenges. One of the tracked birds, a sea eagle, was found near Beeri, just outside the Gaza Strip, and its data led to the recovery of four bodies. Dozens of people are still missing after a Hamas attack on Beeri, which resulted in numerous casualties. The use of birds of prey has aided in locating bodies and providing closure for families affected by the conflict.

The panel recommended severe punishment and urged the government to conduct an institutional inquiry. Moitra argued that she was not given a fair chance to defend herself and criticized the leak of the report to the media. The next steps involve presenting the report to the Speaker, who will table it in the House. A debate may take place, and if a motion for voting on Moitra's expulsion is passed, she will be expelled from the House. Moitra can challenge this decision in court. The incident has also prompted the Ethics Committee to recommend the framing of new rules to check unruly conduct of MPs. This is the first instance of the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee recommending the expulsion of an MP.

Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the ongoing shortage of lamination papers in Pakistan, which has resulted in significant delays in passport issuance. Despite being warned about the shortage, passport offices continue to receive applications, causing a backlog of unprinted passports. The shortage is affecting thousands of Pakistanis who are unable to obtain new passports, jeopardizing their plans to travel abroad for study, work, or vacation. The Directorate General of Immigration and Passports has extended the delivery period for passports due to the increase in applications. The backlog of unprinted passports is estimated to be around seven lakh. The shortage is primarily attributed to economic woes faced by citizens, leading them to seek job opportunities abroad. Additionally, the relaxation of travel restrictions has encouraged more people to travel for religious or tourism purposes. The inefficiency of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports has frustrated applicants, with some having to cancel their plans due to the unavailability of passports. The government is working to resolve the issue and minimize the backlog, but there is uncertainty about when the situation will improve.

### [Can smartwatch save lives by detecting heart attacks?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/can-smartwatch-save-lives-by-detecting-heart-attacks-13370832.html)

A 42-year-old man in the UK, Paul Wapham, used his smartwatch to call his wife when he experienced chest pain during a run. His wife rushed him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a heart attack caused by a blocked artery. This incident highlights how smartphones and smartwatches can play a role in saving lives and improving users' health by monitoring heart rate and detecting irregularities. Other incidents include a woman in the US whose Apple Watch warned her about an increased heart rate, leading to the diagnosis of a severe condition, and a Reddit user whose mother's Apple Watch automatically called emergency services after she collapsed from a ruptured aorta. Smartwatches from companies like Apple, Samsung, Withings, Fitbit, and AliveCor are equipped with features to record heart rate, physical activity, and even perform electrocardiograms (ECG). While they are not as accurate as hospital ECG machines, they can detect fluctuations in heartbeat and prompt users to seek medical care. Studies have shown that ECG monitors on smartwatches are 93% - 95% accurate at identifying different types of heart attacks. However, experts caution that more research is needed before fully relying on smartwatches for early detection of heart attacks. There are concerns that people may be unnecessarily worried about minor heart arrhythmias and seek unnecessary testing and treatment. Smartwatches should be seen as supplementary devices and not replacements for medical tests conducted in healthcare settings.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar Assembly recently passed a bill increasing reservation for deprived castes from 50 to 60 percent in government jobs and educational institutions, bringing the total reservation in Bihar to 75 percent. This decision by the Bihar government goes beyond the 50 percent cap on reservation set by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1992 judgment in the Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case, also known as the Mandal Commission verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that reservation for the backward class should be capped at 50 percent and that economic backwardness alone cannot be a criteria for reservation. Since the 1992 verdict, several states, including Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and now Bihar, have passed laws to exceed the 50 percent cap. In 2019, the Centre also introduced a 10 percent reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) over and above the existing 50 percent reservation for SCs, STs, and OBCs. The Supreme Court upheld the 103rd Constitution Amendment of 2019, which introduced the EWS reservation, in a ruling in November 2022. The Bihar government's decision to increase reservation to 75 percent is based on a comprehensive caste survey conducted by the Nitish Kumar government. The survey provided data that will be used to introduce more measures for the upliftment of socially, educationally, and economically backward sections of society in Bihar.

The obesity drug market is expected to grow significantly, with predictions of it becoming a $100 billion industry by 2030. The rise of these drugs may also impact the food and pharmaceutical industries, as consumers make more nutritious choices and opt for weight-loss drugs instead of certain medications.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the evolving plans for Israel's security role in the Gaza Strip following its intensified campaign against Hamas militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed the intention to maintain overall security responsibility in Gaza once Hamas is removed from power. However, the article highlights that this could be seen as a form of military occupation by the Palestinians and the international community, potentially complicating efforts to hand governing responsibility to the Palestinian Authority or friendly Arab states.

The presence of Israeli forces in Gaza is likely to fuel an insurgency, similar to the period from 1967 to 2005 when two Palestinian uprisings occurred, leading to the rise of Hamas. The United States, Israel's biggest ally, acknowledges these consequences but suggests that Israel might control the territory for a transition period.

There is currently no long-term plan for Gaza, according to Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's War Cabinet. Any plan would have to address Israel's security needs and aim to replace the Hamas regime while ensuring security superiority for Israel.

The article also provides historical context, mentioning that Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War. After decades of military rule, the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority as an autonomous government in the West Bank and Gaza. However, the Palestinian Authority lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, leaving it with administrative powers and Israel with overall security control.

Various suggestions are discussed, including maintaining an over-the-horizon presence with moderate Palestinians handling security inside Gaza and Israeli intervention only when necessary. Another option is creating a buffer zone along the border or considering the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. The article references the lessons learned from Israel's experiences in Lebanon and the challenges it faced after withdrawing its forces.

Ultimately, the future of Gaza and its residents remains uncertain, with mixed messages from Israel about its plans for the region.

Dhanteras is considered an auspicious day to buy gold because it is believed that Goddess Lakshmi blesses people with wealth and well-being on this day. Jewellers often offer discounts during Dhanteras. However, experts recommend that gold should not make up more than 10 to 15 percent of an investor's portfolio.

Japan's criminal underworld is utilizing social media platforms to recruit individuals, including teenagers and retirees, for illegal activities. These recruits, often low-income citizens, are enticed by the promise of financial gain. One such individual, Risa Yamada, stumbled upon a job listing on social media and was hired to impersonate a police officer. She successfully obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars from Japan's elderly population through phone scams. The proliferation of online platforms, including encrypted messaging apps like Telegram and Signal, allows criminal gangs to connect with potential recruits anonymously. Damage caused by these illegal operations has increased by 30% in 2022, amounting to over 37 billion yen. The anonymity offered by social media platforms enables criminals to assemble groups for robberies and fraud schemes effortlessly. Recruits receive instructions via messaging apps and are rewarded for their work without feeling guilty because they don't physically interact with anyone. The consequences of these crimes became evident when a 90-year-old woman was assaulted and killed by individuals hired through online advertisements. These criminal organizations exploit and dispose of their recruits, using them as pawns. Police have been working to remove criminal ads from social media platforms and have offered rewards for information on these gangs. Only a small percentage of those arrested for organized fraud held high-ranking gang positions.

### [How the abortion vote in Ohio may affect Joe Biden's 2024 campaign](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-the-abortion-vote-in-ohio-may-affect-joe-bidens-2024-campaign-13367172.html)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Ohio residents have voted in favor of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution, with 56.1% voting in favor and 43.9% against. This comes after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade last year. The inclusion of abortion rights in the constitution means that the state's proposed restriction on abortions after six weeks cannot be implemented. Advocates for abortion access are now focusing on the 2024 election and whether the issue can help President Joe Biden overcome likely opponent Donald Trump. The wins for Democrats and abortion-rights campaigners in Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia were seen as a boost for Biden's re-election campaign. However, recent polls have shown Biden trailing Trump, and concerns about his age and inflation persist among voters. Democrats hope to use the highly emotional issue of abortion as a central weapon in their strategy for the 2024 election.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra is facing possible expulsion from the Lok Sabha, as the Ethics Committee has labeled her conduct in the cash-for-query scandal as "unethical" and "heinous." The committee has recommended her disqualification from the House. The 500-page report accuses Moitra of sharing parliamentary credentials with unauthorized individuals and accepting cash and amenities from businessman Darshan Hiranandani. The panel also suggests that the government should investigate the money trail between Moitra and Hiranandani. While the committee's findings will be presented to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, there may be a dissent note from Congress members of the panel. Moitra has denied any wrongdoing and criticized the line of questioning during the hearing. The Speaker will ultimately decide whether to expel Moitra. If expelled, it could lead to further confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition, and Moitra may pursue legal action.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The University Grants Commission (UGC) in India has announced regulations for foreign universities to establish and operate campuses in the country. These rules grant autonomy to foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) in terms of their admission processes and fee structures, while the UGC retains the authority to monitor their operations. The aim is to bring an international dimension to higher education in India and ensure that the education provided by these campuses is on par with the main campuses of the respective universities. Foreign institutions seeking to establish campuses in India should meet certain criteria, including securing a position within the top 500 in global rankings and possessing expertise in a particular area. The regulations also state that foreign universities cannot offer programs online or in open and distance learning modes, but they can provide up to 10% of lectures in online mode. Collaboration between multiple universities to set up campuses in India is allowed, and foreign institutions are not required to pay annual fees to the UGC. They can provide scholarships and fee concessions to Indian students. Prior approval from the UGC is necessary for starting new courses, and campuses have autonomy in recruiting faculty and staff.

Georgia must also meet several conditions, including aligning with EU foreign policy sanctions against Russia, pushing back against disinformation and political polarization, and ensuring a free and fair election in 2024. The recommendation for Moldova to join the EU has also been made, with the country being described as a "frontrunner" for membership. The commission has also suggested that membership talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina should begin once certain conditions are met. The final decision on these recommendations will be made by the 27 national EU leaders in mid-December, with unanimity required. The process of joining the EU can take up to a decade, and the countries must fulfill various conditions related to reforms and alignment with EU standards.

### [Hate returning to the office? This new workplace trend, coffee badging, is for you](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/coffee-badging-workplace-trend-return-to-office-hr-managers-hybrid-working-13364712.html)

The latest work trend called "coffee badging" is gaining attention, but not for positive reasons. Coffee badging involves employees showing up at the office, grabbing a coffee, socializing briefly with colleagues, and then leaving. It is a form of presenteeism where employees make a brief appearance at the office to earn recognition without actually being productive. A recent report found that 58% of hybrid workers in the US have engaged in coffee badging. The practice is seen as a subtle form of protest against returning to the office and can create a toxic work culture. Employees may feel pressured to be physically present in order to be noticed and rewarded. Coffee badging can also lead to reduced collaboration and undermine work culture. Managers are concerned about the impact of this trend on productivity and employee engagement. To address coffee badging, companies should offer more flexible work models and encourage open communication between employees and employers.

The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has led to companies facing backlash and being caught in the politics of the war. Luxury fashion brand Dior received criticism on social media after reports emerged that it replaced Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid with Israeli model May Tager in its latest ad campaign. Turkey's Parliament reportedly removed Coca-Cola and Nestle products from menus due to their alleged support for Israel, marking the first time a government or major organization has targeted global brands over the conflict. UK-based retail brand Marks and Spencer faced outrage for posting a photo on Instagram of Christmas party hats in the colors of the Palestinian flag burning in a fireplace, leading to an apology and removal of the post. Starbucks faced calls for boycotts after its union expressed solidarity with Palestinians, leading to a lawsuit between the company and the union. McDonald's also faced criticism after one of its Israel-based franchises offered free food to personnel of the Israeli military, while McDonald's Malaysia donated funds for humanitarian aid in Gaza. Companies in the United States have been pressured to respond to the conflict, with employees at Google and Amazon calling on their bosses to take a public stand. The conflict has evoked divisions among employees, with Arab and Muslim workers feeling dismissed while Jewish employees worry about rising antisemitism. Companies are struggling to find a stance that is accepted by both sides, as they face criticism for being either too pro-Israeli or sympathetic towards Palestinians. This article also mentions how companies responded during the Russia-Ukraine war, with many suspending sales or closing operations in Russia due to pressure and sanctions.

### [Trump leading Biden in polls: Could the Republican return to the White House?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/trump-leading-biden-in-polls-could-the-republican-return-to-the-white-house-13365172.html)

According to a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll, President Joe Biden is trailing former President Donald Trump in nearly every swing state, raising concerns among Democrats about the possibility of Trump being re-elected in 2024. The swing states in question include Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan, which account for a significant number of electoral votes. The poll shows that Biden is leading only in Wisconsin, while Trump has an average lead of 48% to 44% in the other states [[SOURCE 1]].

The polls also indicate that registered voters have concerns about Biden's age and his handling of the economy. A majority of those polled, including 71% of registered voters and 54% of Biden's own supporters, believe that Biden is "too old." Additionally, swing state voters favor Trump over Biden when it comes to handling the economy, with a 59% to 37% margin [[SOURCE 1]].

Furthermore, the polls suggest that Biden's multiracial and multigenerational coalition may be weakening. Young voters, who heavily supported Biden in the 2020 election, now only favor him by a slim margin of one percent. Biden's advantage with Hispanic voters has also decreased to single digits. In addition, black voters, a core demographic for Biden, are registering 22% support for Trump in these swing states, which is unprecedented for a Republican candidate [[SOURCE 1]].

Despite these poll results, it is important to note that the 2024 election is still a year away, and predictions made at this stage may not accurately reflect the final outcome. Experts caution against panicking based on early polls and emphasize that the economy and other factors can significantly influence voter perceptions over time. The Biden camp remains confident and points to past examples where polls underestimated the eventual outcome, such as Barack Obama's victory in 2012 [[SOURCE 1]].

In conclusion, while recent polls show Biden trailing Trump in swing states and raise concerns about his age and handling of the economy, it is too early to make definitive predictions about the 2024 election. The polls serve as a warning to Democrats about the work they need to do to maintain support and address concerns among key voter groups. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the state of the economy and how voters perceive the candidates in the coming months [[SOURCE 1]].

### [AQI at Delhi’s Anand Vihar touches 999 again. How hazardous is this for health?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-anand-vihar-aqi-999-hazardous-for-health-air-pollution-13364102.html)

Delhi is once again experiencing severe air pollution as the Air Quality Index (AQI) reached the 'severe' level. The situation is particularly critical in Anand Vihar, where the AQI recorded a staggering 999. This level of pollution poses significant health risks to residents, with even healthy individuals vulnerable to respiratory issues. Experts compare the current air quality to smoking 25-30 cigarettes a day. An AQI of 500 indicates the worst air quality and has severe health impacts. However, some stations in Delhi cannot report beyond 999 on the pollution measurement metric. Anand Vihar's high pollution levels can be attributed to factors such as vehicular pollution, dust, emissions from nearby industries, and the Ghazipur landfill. The primary pollutant in the area is PM10. The hazardous particulate matter PM2.5 and other pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone further increase the risk of respiratory problems and other health issues. The situation calls for immediate action to address this ongoing environmental crisis.

Scientists have expressed concern about a new variant of the COVID-19 virus known as JN.1. This variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant, also called 'Pirola,' which originated from Omicron. JN.1 has undergone a mutation that allows it to bind more strongly to human cells and increase transmissibility. It was first detected in Luxembourg and has since been found in several other countries. While JN.1 currently accounts for less than 0.1% of COVID-19 cases, experts believe it could become more prevalent, especially during the upcoming winter season. However, current vaccines are expected to be effective against this variant, as they target the spike protein that JN.1 possesses. Scientists emphasize the importance of a layered approach, including vaccination and mitigation strategies, to combat evolving variants. The emergence of JN.1 before winter has raised concerns due to historical surges in COVID-19 cases during colder months. The World Health Organization has warned of concerning trends and urged increased vaccinations and surveillance. Overall, while JN.1 presents some risks, experts believe that existing measures can help protect against severe disease.

The Indian government has issued an advisory to social media platforms regarding deepfake content after a video featuring actress Rashmika Mandanna went viral. The government has highlighted the legal provisions that cover such content, including Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, which covers punishment for cheating by personation using computer resources. India's laws for copyright protection can also be used against individuals creating deepfakes using copyrighted works. However, there is a growing need for specific legislation to tackle the challenges posed by deepfakes, especially in cases related to pornography.

China has introduced regulations around deepfakes, requiring users' consent for the use of their images and prohibiting the dissemination of fake news. South Korea has made it illegal to distribute deepfakes that could cause harm to public interest, with offenders facing imprisonment or fines. In the United States, there is no national legislation specifically addressing deepfakes, but a bill called the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act has been introduced to protect individuals from deceptive political messages and deepfake pornography. The UK, Australia, France, and the European Union are also considering or implementing laws to combat deepfake content.

The recent incidents of deepfake videos have highlighted the dangers of synthetic media, particularly in the context of adult content featuring Indian actresses. India is ranked as the sixth most vulnerable country to deepfake pornography according to a State of Deepfakes report.

The Supreme Court has extended the ban on polluting firecrackers to all states in India, not just the Delhi-NCR region. However, the court clarified that green crackers are allowed. These green crackers were developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in 2018 to reduce pollution levels. Green crackers have a smaller carbon footprint and contain fewer harmful chemicals compared to traditional crackers. They cause 30% less air pollution and emit less noise. The court's decision means that all states, including Rajasthan, must take steps to minimize air and noise pollution during the festival season and beyond. Some states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, and West Bengal have already imposed restrictions on the sale and use of firecrackers, with some allowing only green crackers.

Sweden is on track to become Europe's first smoke-free nation, with less than 5% of its population smoking every day. This achievement is attributed to a combination of factors, including strict anti-smoking laws, public health campaigns, and the use of a product called snus. The smoking rate in Sweden has steadily declined over the years, thanks to measures such as smoking bans in restaurants and public places. The Swedish government has also implemented high taxes on cigarettes while reducing taxes on snus, which is a smokeless tobacco product. Snus is a highly addictive nicotine product that is placed under the upper lip. It has been popular in Sweden for over 200 years and is considered a part of Swedish culture. While snus is seen as a less harmful alternative to smoking, health authorities remain cautious about its potential risks, including cardiovascular issues and harm to pregnant women. Overall, Sweden's success in reducing smoking rates can be attributed to a combination of tobacco control measures and public awareness campaigns [[2]](https://www.scholarcy.com/)

The concept of "glimmers" is gaining popularity on social media, particularly TikTok. Coined by Deb Dana in her book "The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy," glimmers refer to small moments that bring feelings of connection, calmness, and joy. They serve as the opposite of triggers, which can send our bodies into fight, flight, or freeze mode. Glimmers have a soothing effect on our nervous system, promoting a sense of safety and relaxation. Recognizing and seeking out glimmers regularly can be beneficial, especially for those who have experienced trauma, as it helps in managing triggers. There are two types of glimmers: self-regulating (activities like reading or walking in nature) and co-regulating (interactions with others like laughing with friends or talking to a therapist). Glimmers offer a sense of safety and connectedness, allowing us to cope during challenging times. Sharing glimmers with someone else can deepen acceptance and connection. It is important not to shy away from acknowledging and embracing feel-good emotions, as they contribute to overall well-being. Exploring and cultivating glimmers is worth a try for everyone.

### [Weed is NOT the remedy: Why marijuana is bad for your heart health](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/weed-is-not-the-remedy-why-marijuana-is-bad-for-your-heart-health-13359782.html)

Two recent studies have found a link between regular marijuana use and an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. The first study presented by the American Heart Association (AHA) found that regular marijuana users had a 34% higher risk of developing heart failure compared to non-users. The study also found that the risk decreased when participants had coronary artery disease. The second study assessed marijuana users with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes and found that 20% experienced a serious cardiac or neurological event while receiving medical attention. Additionally, marijuana users with cardiovascular risk factors had a higher rate of heart attacks compared to non-users. The use of marijuana among senior citizens is on the rise, with a 2020 study showing an increase in usage between 2015 and 2018. The American Heart Association advises against smoking or vaping any chemical, including cannabis products, due to potential risks to the heart, lungs, and blood vessels.

### [First Rashmika, now Katrina deepfake: How big is the problem in India and beyond](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rashmika-mandanna-katrina-kaif-deepfakes-how-big-is-the-problem-in-india-world-13360732.html)

A deepfake video of Indian actor Rashmika Mandanna wearing a low-cut top in a lift has caused concern in India. The manipulated video, created using Artificial Intelligence (AI), has led to calls for legal action against those responsible. This incident highlights the growing problem of deepfakes, particularly their use to harm women. Deepfakes use AI to create or alter media in a way that makes it difficult to determine authenticity. While deepfakes can have positive applications, such as realistic visual effects in movies, they are predominantly used for non-consensual pornographic content. Reports indicate that 98% of all online deepfake videos target women, and there has been a significant increase in their numbers. Deepfake technology poses risks beyond pornography, including crimes, scams, and influencing key events like elections. A company called DeepMedia predicts that 500,000 video and audio deepfakes will be shared on social media this year. India is ranked as the sixth most vulnerable country to deepfake pornography. Although India currently lacks specific laws addressing deepfakes, there are legal provisions that can address the issue. The government has issued an advisory to social media platforms, citing the Information Technology Act, 2000. The United States is ranked as the second most susceptible nation to deepfake adult content, with concerns rising ahead of the presidential elections. Other countries, such as China, Japan, the UK, and South Korea, have taken steps to regulate or criminalize deepfakes. Tech companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft are also developing tools to detect AI-generated content.

Scientists at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) have developed "green crackers" as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional firecrackers. These green crackers emit about 30% less pollution and do not contain barium compounds, which are known to pollute the air and cause noise. There are three types of green firecrackers: safe water releaser, safe thermite cracker, and safe minimal aluminium cracker. Green crackers are also cheaper and make less noise than conventional firecrackers. They can be recognized by a QR code and green logo indicating certification from NEERI.

### [Will handle Gaza for 'indefinite period', says Netanyahu. Will it go West Bank way?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/will-handle-gaza-for-indefinite-period-says-netanyahu-will-it-go-west-bank-way-13359522.html)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly hinted at the possibility of Israel occupying Gaza in an interview with ABC News. He stated that Israel would have an indefinite security responsibility for Gaza, as they have witnessed the eruption of Hamas terror when they haven't had that responsibility. Netanyahu also rejected calls for a ceasefire without the release of over 200 hostages taken by Hamas.

In terms of the West Bank, it is a parcel of land east of Israel that borders Jerusalem. Israel captured the West Bank during the 1967 war and has since built settlements there, which are considered illegal by the United Nations and much of the international community. The West Bank is home to millions of Palestinians who view it as their spiritual home and the capital of a Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank, while Israeli settlers argue that the settlements enhance Israel's national security.

The article raises questions about what will happen in Gaza once Israel gains complete control. Experts suggest that this remains uncertain, and replacing Hamas with another governing body poses challenges. The leaked plan from the Israeli government mentioned options such as handing over control to the Palestinian Authority or establishing a local regime. However, these options were discarded due to their inability to deter further attacks. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has indicated that assuming power in Gaza would require a comprehensive political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

It is yet to be seen if Netanyahu will pursue a similar settlement policy in Gaza as he has in the West Bank. The article concludes by mentioning the potential cessation of relief operations in the Gaza Strip by the UNRWA due to the lack of fuel supplies, putting thousands at risk. Additionally, there is scrutiny on Netanyahu's role in the intelligence failure preceding the Hamas attack, which resulted in significant casualties in Israel.

### [What is artificial rain and could it be the answer to Delhi’s pollution woes?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-air-quality-pollution-what-is-artificial-rain-iit-kanpur-cloud-seeding-13358812.html)

The air quality in Delhi, India continues to be poor, causing respiratory problems among the residents. To address this issue, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has been working on a technique to induce artificial rains and reduce pollutants and dust in the city. The institute successfully carried out a test for producing artificial rain through cloud seeding and has obtained the necessary permissions from government authorities. Artificial rain can provide relief from air pollution for up to a week, but specific meteorological conditions are required for the process to work. IIT Kanpur needs permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and Special Protection Group (SPG) to fly an aircraft over the National Capital. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique that involves adding chemicals to clouds to increase precipitation, either by causing ice crystals to grow or by making particles larger to fall faster. It has been used for various purposes, such as mitigating droughts, hail damage, forest fires, and improving air quality. However, the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still debated among scientists. In addition to these efforts, the Delhi government plans to implement an odd-even scheme for private vehicles between November 13 and 20, where vehicles with odd registration numbers will be allowed on odd dates and vice versa. The Supreme Court has also directed states neighboring Delhi to take immediate measures to halt stubble burning by farmers, which contributes to the worsening air quality.

China has been cracking down on a cyber scam known as "pig butchering," which involves con artists luring victims into fake romantic relationships and then convincing them to invest in fraudulent bitcoin schemes. These scams are operated by strong Chinese syndicates based in Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar. The scams can be lengthy, with the con artists courting their victims for months before convincing them to make large investments. Many of these con artists are also victims of human trafficking, having been tricked into false job ads and imprisoned in prison-like complexes. Investment fraud is the fastest-growing scam globally, with Chinese citizens losing billions of dollars each year. In response, Chinese authorities have conducted mass arrests and launched joint operations with neighboring countries to catch suspects. Despite these efforts, experts warn that these criminal groups will continue to exploit vulnerable areas around the world.

WeWork India stated that it operates independently from WeWork Global and will not be affected by the bankruptcy filing. WeWork China also announced that it will not participate in the strategic reorganization in the US and Canada.

The Indian government has launched a new wheat flour scheme called "Bharat Atta" ahead of the Diwali festival. The scheme aims to reduce food inflation and provide reasonably priced wheat flour to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. Bharat Atta is a fortified wheat flour made with a blend of rice, wheat, and pulses. It will be sold through various retail outlets, including Mother Dairy, NAFED, and NCCF, as well as 800 mobile vans and 2,000 outlets run by these agencies. The initiative follows a pilot sale of 18,000 tonnes of wheat flour at Rs 29.50 per kilo, which has now been reduced to combat inflation. India continues to face high cereal inflation, with the rate of cereal inflation still in double digits. The government plans to limit exports of wheat and rice to ensure adequate supply and reasonably priced access for its population of 1.4 billion people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also announced plans to introduce a free food grains program to protect consumers from rising food inflation.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel-Hamas war has been ongoing for over a month, with Israel intensifying its airstrikes in Gaza and making advances with tanks and soldiers. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, over 10,000 people have died, including 4,104 children. There are growing calls for Israel to stop, with the Arab world and the United States pressing for a ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has mentioned considering "tactical little pauses" for aid entry or hostage release but rejected a general ceasefire during an interview with ABC News.

A humanitarian pause is a temporary halt in fighting for humanitarian reasons, allowing for the passage of aid or displaced people. It can promote obligations under international humanitarian law, such as evacuating the wounded or facilitating the passage of relief. On the other hand, a ceasefire is a general suspension of hostilities agreed upon by both sides involved in the conflict, often leading to a permanent settlement. In the case of the Israel-Hamas war, a ceasefire would involve the withdrawal of tanks and troops from Gaza and the release of hostages by Hamas.

Several countries, including Russia and major United Nations bodies, have called for a ceasefire in Gaza due to the dire situation. However, the US has rejected these calls, stating that a ceasefire would leave Hamas in place to regroup and repeat attacks. Instead, the US supports humanitarian pauses to protect civilians, deliver aid, and enable the defeat of Hamas. The UK and the European Union have also not backed a ceasefire, focusing on advocating for humanitarian pauses.

Netanyahu has consistently refused a ceasefire until Hamas releases its captives in Gaza. He expressed willingness to consider humanitarian pauses for aid and hostage movements but ruled out a general ceasefire.

Overall, the article discusses the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the difference between humanitarian pauses and ceasefires, and the positions of various countries regarding a cessation of hostilities.

The recent Israeli-Hamas conflict has had a devastating impact on the employment situation in Gaza, with over 60% of jobs lost since the conflict began. This amounts to a total of 182,000 jobs lost in the small Palestinian territory. The occupied West Bank has also lost an estimated 24% of its employment, or 208,000 jobs, as a result of the war's spillover effects. The International Labour Organisation warns that if the conflict continues, the repercussions on the Palestinian labour market will worsen and reverberate for many years to come. In addition to job losses, rising poverty is a major concern in Gaza, where more than 80% of the population already lives below the poverty level. The UN agency estimates that job losses in Gaza and the West Bank result in a daily income loss of $16 million. The economic future for Gaza was already bleak before the war, and the recent fighting has only worsened the situation. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts a short but steep recession followed by a hesitant rebound and a return to normal economic performance by 2025.

### [Is Delhi’s odd-even scheme to battle air pollution even effective?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-odd-even-car-scheme-air-pollution-effective-13357202.html)

The article discusses the implementation of the odd-even rule in Delhi as a measure to combat air pollution. The rule allows cars with either odd or even number plates to ply on alternate days. The scheme was first introduced in Delhi in 2016 and is applied only to private vehicles, with some exemptions for certain categories. While reducing the number of vehicles can help reduce pollution levels, experts have differing opinions on the effectiveness of the scheme. Some studies have shown a reduction in particulate matter levels, while others argue that the scheme has been ineffective due to people changing their travel schedules and increased exempted vehicle activity. The severity of air pollution in Delhi has led to the implementation of various measures, including the odd-even scheme, but a long-term holistic approach is needed. Doctors have reported an increase in respiratory problems among residents, highlighting the need for immediate action.

### [Want to boost productivity? Try getting angry at work](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/anger-boost-productivity-study-workplace-motivator-goals-13355892.html)

A new study has found that anger can actually be a powerful motivator for productivity and meeting goals. The American Psychological Association conducted a survey of over 1,000 people and found that anger usually evoked the best performance compared to other emotions. The study also examined surveys from the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections and found that people who said they would be angry if their preferred candidate lost were more likely to vote. Experts say that the findings are important, especially for women in the workplace who are often conditioned to believe they cannot be "emotional." The study suggests that anger and frustration with the status quo can be tools for innovation and creativity. However, it is important to note that excess anger can be detrimental to cognitive functioning. Overall, the study adds to the growing evidence that a mix of positive and negative emotions promotes well-being, and using negative emotions as tools can be effective in certain situations.

A deepfake video featuring actor Rashmika Mandanna has gone viral on social media, prompting concerns about the spread of misinformation and the role of AI. The video, which was doctored to replace the face of another individual with Mandanna's, has garnered strong reactions from Mandanna herself, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, and superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Chandrasekhar reminded social media platforms of their legal obligations to combat misinformation, while Bachchan called for strong legal action against deepfakes. Deepfakes are realistic but fake images, voices, or videos created using AI and deep learning algorithms. They have been a growing concern, with numerous instances involving celebrities going viral in the past. Deepfake fraud is when scamsters use AI to duplicate the sound or faces of an intended victim's friends or family to manipulate them into transferring money. Indians, in particular, are falling victim to deepfake scams, with many unable to distinguish between real and AI voices. To protect oneself from such scams, establishing a codeword with close friends and family, being cautious of unknown calls, and verifying information through alternative means are recommended.

India is in the process of formulating its National Security Strategy (NSS) after years of discussion and no progress. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) has started collecting inputs from various ministries and departments to draft the strategy, which will then be presented to the Cabinet for approval.

It will address traditional and non-traditional challenges such as economic security, information warfare, and environmental concerns. The need for an NSS has been emphasized by military and strategic circles, who believe it will provide a comprehensive framework for addressing security-related matters and guide defense reforms. However, there have been hesitations in releasing an NSS document due to concerns about revealing India's stance to potential adversaries. Countries like the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, and Pakistan have already formulated their own national security strategies.

### [Discrimination is Bad for Business: How it destroys motivation at work](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/discrimination-is-bad-for-business-how-it-destroys-motivation-at-work-13331092.html)

A new study published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour suggests that workplace discrimination can lead to reduced effort and productivity among employees. The study involved nearly 1,200 participants who were placed in experiments designed to mimic work settings. Participants were told that their manager would award a bonus based on their performance, and some were informed that there were two types of employees: blue and red. One-third of the participants were told that the manager had a bias against blue employees, another third were told the manager was biased in their favor, and the rest received no information about bias. The study found that participants who knew their managers discriminated against them or favored them completed fewer tasks than those in the control group. The researchers also found that discrimination can worsen over time, with disadvantaged workers showing the largest decline in effort. Additionally, the study showed that discrimination can lead to behavior by employees that strengthens negative stereotypes or spreads discriminatory stereotypes to new managers. The findings suggest that workplace discrimination can have negative effects on productivity and may hurt firms' bottom lines more than previously assumed. Future research is needed to understand how bias operates in different contexts, such as race, gender, sexuality, or parental status.

A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck a remote region in northwestern Nepal, resulting in at least 128 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The death toll is expected to rise as communication has been cut off in many areas. Nepal is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the boundary of two tectonic plates, the Asian and Indo-Australian plates. The collision of these plates created the Himalayan Mountains and causes frequent earthquakes. Nepal's flimsy buildings and growing population contribute to the vulnerability of the country. Some of the deadliest earthquakes in Nepal's history include a 8.2 magnitude earthquake in 1934 that killed over 10,000 people and a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 that killed around 9,000 people.

### [What are the huge mysterious blobs near Earth’s core?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-the-huge-mysterious-blobs-near-earths-core-13342672.html)

A new study suggests that the two continent-sized blobs of strange material discovered deep near the Earth's center in the 1980s may be the remains of a prototype planet that had a massive influence on Earth billions of years ago. These blobs, known as Large Velocity Provinces (LLVPs), have a higher density than the surrounding areas and are estimated to be slightly denser than the surrounding mantle rock. The theory proposes that the blobs were formed by a severe collision between the early Earth and a smaller planet called Theia, which also resulted in the formation of the moon. However, scientists are still looking for evidence to support this theory and suggest that studying moon rocks could provide further insights.

### [Why are prices of olive oil rising in Europe? Can it impact India?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-are-prices-of-olive-oil-rising-in-europe-can-it-impact-india-13342082.html)

The price of olive oil has seen a significant increase, with prices rising by about 75% since January 2021. This rise in price is due to factors such as drought and harsh weather damaging olive crops in major producing countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal. As a result, the cost of olive oil has reached record levels, making it more expensive for consumers. In addition to olive oil, potato prices have also seen a staggering rise. These increases in food prices have put a burden on poorer families who are struggling to keep up with inflation. The European Trade Union Confederation has noted that wages are failing to keep up with the rising costs of basic food items, forcing more people to rely on food banks. Despite falling annual inflation rates, food inflation remains high at 7.5%. The olive oil sector is facing its own challenges, including drought, higher temperatures affecting flowering, and inflation affecting fertilizer prices. The shortage of supply is impacting markets and households globally, including India where the cost of imported olive oil has increased by 22%. Consumers in India are reconsidering their choices and opting for alternative cooking oils due to the surging costs of olive oil. The high prices are expected to continue until at least June 2024.

Japan ranked lowest for employees' well-being in a recent global survey, while Turkey topped the list. The survey, conducted by the McKinsey Health Institute, evaluated workers' physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being. Japanese respondents reported low scores in all categories, with 30% reporting social health, 74% reporting physical health, 24% reporting spiritual health, and 42% reporting mental health. The report suggests that Japan's high levels of stress and lack of workplace satisfaction contribute to its low ranking. India ranked second in the survey but reported high rates of burnout symptoms. Over 50% of workers worldwide exhibit signs of burnout, which increases their likelihood of quitting their jobs. The survey also found that demands at work, such as dealing with toxic behaviors or role ambiguity, are more predictive of burnout symptoms than enablers. Employers are encouraged to prioritize their employees' overall health to improve workforce performance and work-life balance.

A powerful jet stream over the Atlantic is causing planes to travel faster from the United States to Europe. Jet streams are bands of strong wind that influence weather, air travel, and the atmosphere. They are created when warm and cold air masses collide, creating an air current. Jet streams can reach speeds of up to 442 kilometers per hour. When an airplane flies in the same direction as a jet stream, it gets an extra push and travels faster. Airlines have been using jet streams to reduce flight times, with some flights arriving at their destinations earlier than expected. However, jet streams can also cause turbulence and require extensive planning for arrival times. The current jet stream over the Atlantic is expected to strengthen a potential storm called Storm Ciaran.

### [How ‘white hydrogen’ deposits found in France could save Earth](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-white-hydrogen-deposits-found-in-france-could-save-earth-13327552.html)

Scientists have discovered a large supply of hydrogen, known as "white hydrogen," in northeastern France. White hydrogen is a greener energy source than solar or wind power, as it only produces water when burned. It can be used as a substitute for steel, shipping, and aviation. The discovery was made when methane concentrations in the earth's crust were being evaluated, and hydrogen concentrations increased as scientists dug deeper. This discovery is significant because it shows that large amounts of hydrogen can naturally occur without requiring energy-consuming procedures. White hydrogen is predicted to be more affordable than green hydrogen, costing around one US dollar per kilogramme. It has the potential to help combat the climate crisis and transform the clean energy market. Organizations are currently drilling to find hydrogen resources, and startups are exploring the possibility of selling white hydrogen.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK have developed a blood test that, when combined with a digital mental health assessment, can provide an improved diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The blood test alone can diagnose up to 30% of patients with bipolar disorder, but it is even more effective when used in conjunction with the online assessment. This combination can help differentiate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which have similar symptoms but require different treatments. The blood test is still in the proof of concept stage, but it has the potential to be a valuable complement to existing psychiatric diagnosis methods. Up to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder, and the blood test could help ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment. The research team used samples and data from the delta study, conducted in the UK between 2018 and 2020, to identify bipolar disorder in patients previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The blood test and online assessment combination significantly improved diagnostic outcomes for people with bipolar disorder, especially in cases where the diagnosis was not obvious.

The air quality in Delhi is expected to fluctuate between the "poor" and "very poor" categories for the next four to five days. This is due to crop residue burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana. Stubble burning in Punjab has been listed as one of the biggest contributors to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, there has been a decrease in stubble burning incidents in Haryana this year. Data from NASA shows that farm fires have been at a low level this year, possibly due to a delayed burning season and excess rainfall. The air quality situation in Delhi is monitored by NASA, and it deteriorates every year during late October and November.

Eight former Indian Navy veterans have been sentenced to death in Qatar after being arrested last August. The Ministry of External Affairs has expressed shock at the verdict and is exploring all legal options. The charges against the veterans have not been revealed, but media reports suggest they have been accused of spying for Israel on Qatar's submarines.

The scam involves alleged irregularities in the public distribution system and distribution of food grains during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The arrest is seen as a blow to Banerjee as Mallick is a key leader with significant influence over the state's Matua community, which can impact poll results in about 50 constituencies. This comes as several other TMC leaders have been arrested or investigated for corruption.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari, the owner of 'Baap of Chart', from the securities market. SEBI claims that Ansari misled investors and influenced them to deal in securities, making Rs 17.2 crore in the process. Ansari, who presents himself as a stock market expert on social media, offered educational courses and conducted workshops to train investors. SEBI alleges that he made buying/selling recommendations under the guise of educational courses and promised guaranteed returns. The regulator also accused Ansari of using theatrics and showmanship to induce investors to trade in securities. Additionally, SEBI found that Ansari incurred losses in stock trading despite claiming to provide strategies for high profits. Along with Ansari, four other directors of Golden Syndicate Ventures were also involved in non-registered investment advisory services, according to SEBI. The regulator has ordered Ansari and others to cease acting as investment advisors and deposit the Rs 17.2 crore within 15 days.

### [Why are ‘free’ seats on flights in India so hard to find?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/centre-airlines-free-paid-seats-flights-india-dgca-rules-13299942.html)

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs in India has warned domestic airlines and online travel aggregators for engaging in "unfair" trade practices. The ministry highlighted issues such as misleading claims of "free mandatory web check-in" and not allowing customers to board with confirmed tickets. A survey found that 47% of respondents had to pay for a seat of their choice in the last year, and 51% did not get any free seat and were charged an additional fee for seat allocation. The ministry has called for a meeting with CEOs of airlines and travel portals to address these concerns. Airlines in India charge passengers for seat selection, with fees ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 1,000 depending on the location of the seat. In 2013, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation allowed airlines to charge consumers for extra services, including preferential seats, but this norm was struck down in 2015. Last March, a Parliamentary panel criticized airlines for charging different fares for seat allocation and asked the government to monitor fare pricing. Despite an increase in consumer complaints, the Indian government does not intend to intervene in the pricing mechanism of airlines.

Gun violence in America has become a significant problem, with an average of 43,375 deaths per year attributed to guns. Despite efforts to implement gun reform, including a recent gun safety package signed by President Joe Biden, gun ownership remains a contentious issue in the country. Many argue in favor of owning firearms, leading to laws that expand gun ownership in several states.

### [Why Israel has heeded to US' request of delaying its Gaza invasion](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-israel-has-heeded-to-us-request-of-delaying-its-gaza-invasion-13298582.html)

Israel has reportedly agreed to delay its planned invasion of Gaza in order to allow the United States to deploy missile defenses to protect US troops in the region. Both Israel and the Biden administration are focused on trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The US is rushing nearly a dozen air-defense systems to the area, and has also advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault as it works to free more hostages and prepare for a potential wider conflict. Israel is taking into account the need for humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages. The threat to US troops is a top concern, as they are expected to be targeted by militant groups once an invasion begins. Israeli officials acknowledge that some hostages may have already been killed in retaliatory air raids, and they believe a solution for the hostages will become practically impossible once a ground invasion takes place. Egypt has been urged to pressure Hamas to release all detained women and children if they want to reach a solution. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas in response to the recent attack on civilians by militants. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has warned Hamas, stating that modern Jews have different capabilities than in the past.

### [What is the nuclear test ban treaty that Russia is withdrawing from?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-the-nuclear-test-ban-treaty-that-russia-is-withdrawing-from-13297992.html)

Russia has passed legislation to withdraw from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a landmark accord that prohibits nuclear weapons tests. The CTBT, agreed upon in 1996, aims to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons by banning any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion worldwide. Currently, 187 states have signed the treaty, with 178 ratifying it in their parliaments. Of the nine countries with nuclear weapons, Britain and France have both signed and ratified the treaty, while the United States, Israel, and China have signed but not ratified it. Russia had previously signed and ratified the treaty but is now withdrawing its ratification. The treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests, with no country conducting such a test since the 1990s except for North Korea. The treaty also established a global network of observation posts to detect signs of nuclear explosions. While Russia claims it does not plan to conduct a test unless the US does so first, some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now. A resumption of nuclear testing could prompt other countries to follow suit and potentially lead to a new arms race.

Israel has intensified its bombing campaign in southern Gaza, causing fear among the Palestinians who had evacuated there.

Since October 7th, over 6,500 Palestinians have died as a result of Israeli strikes. Israel ordered the evacuation of Gazans to the south in order to move civilians away from Hamas targets concentrated in the north. However, many Palestinians feel betrayed and angry as they are still being targeted in the south.

A recent article discusses the impact of social media, particularly Instagram, on teenagers. The article highlights a lawsuit filed against Meta (formerly Facebook) by 41 states and the District of Columbia, alleging that the company intentionally designed Facebook and Instagram with features that harm teens and young users. Internal research from Meta in March 2020 showed that Instagram is harmful to teen girls' body image and well-being, but the company ignored these findings. Numerous studies have shown that the more often teens use Instagram, the worse their overall well-being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, mood, and body image. Two key features of Instagram make it particularly risky for teens: the ability to follow celebrities and peers who present unrealistic body images and curated impressions of a perfect life, and the emphasis on pictures of the body, leading users to focus on how they look to others. These factors contribute to negative social comparisons, envy, lowered self-esteem, and increased body dissatisfaction among teens. Body dissatisfaction during the teen years is a predictor of later eating disorder symptoms. The article suggests that parents can help by talking to their teens about appearance versus reality, encouraging face-to-face interactions with peers, and promoting active engagement with their bodies instead of focusing on selfies. The article raises concerns about how Meta will handle these damaging results and compares their approach to Big Tobacco's denial of the harmful effects of its products.

Experts are concerned that thousands of penguins and seals in Antarctica could be wiped out by a deadly variant of bird flu known as avian flu. British scientists discovered the virus in brown skuas, a scavenger bird, on Bird Island, part of the British overseas possession of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The virus is believed to have been brought to Antarctica by birds migrating from South America, where it has already caused significant deaths among seabirds and sea lions. The H5N1 strain of avian flu is highly pathogenic and causes significant mortality in poultry. While the virus is difficult to spread from animals to humans, there are concerns that if a person with the flu contracts this bird flu, it could lead to serious consequences. Researchers fear that the disease could result in catastrophic breeding failure and have a devastating impact on many wildlife species in Antarctica. Ongoing disease surveillance programs are recommended to identify new and emerging pathogens.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening as Israel continues its attacks on the region, and a United Nations agency may be forced to stop aid operations due to a shortage of fuel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) currently provides aid to 600,000 displaced Gazans and has called for a humanitarian "pause" in fighting. Hospitals are on the verge of shutting down due to the lack of fuel supplies, and the healthcare system is at its worst stage in history. The World Health Organization warns that patients dependent on dialysis and premature babies are at risk of dying without a stable supply of electricity. Israel has ruled out allowing fuel into Gaza, claiming that Hamas would use it for its operational infrastructure and rocket attacks. Israel suggests that the UN ask Hamas for fuel supplies, as they claim Hamas has stored fuel in advance. Israel is also in a diplomatic row with the UN after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments about the attack by Hamas on Israel not happening in a vacuum. Israel has asked Guterres to resign and plans to deny visas to UN officials.

### [How cybercriminals are scamming people who want to donate to Israel, Gaza victims](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/israel-hamas-war-cybercrime-fake-donations-charities-fraud-13293872.html)

Scammers are taking advantage of the Israel-Hamas war by sending deceptive emails and creating fraudulent websites to solicit donations. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has identified over 500 scam emails and fake websites that exploit people's willingness to help those affected by the conflict. The scammers pose as charitable organizations and use emotive language to entice people to click on a fake website link and make donations. They even offer options like using cryptocurrencies for transactions. Additionally, there are suspicious accounts on social media platforms asking for donations, but these are likely scams as well. To avoid getting scammed, it is important to thoroughly scrutinize donation pages, check the legitimacy of charitable organizations, and cross-check names to avoid mistaken identity.

### [Is India planning to take action against Canada on terror funding?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/india-canada-row-fatf-terror-funding-khalistani-terrorists-13293542.html)

India is reportedly considering moving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) against Canada for its soft stance towards Khalistani terrorists. The FATF is a global watchdog that combats money laundering and terror financing. India has accused Canada of providing safe space to terrorists despite sharing evidence. The FATF conducts regular evaluations of countries' performance on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, and countries that do not meet the standards can be placed on the grey or black lists. India may present evidence of terror funding and financing emanating from Canada to the FATF. The India-Canada diplomatic row has escalated, with Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats from India and India suspending visa services to Canadians.

### [Why melting of West Antarctic ice shelves cannot be avoided despite carbon emissions cuts](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-melting-of-west-antarctic-ice-shelves-cannot-be-avoided-despite-carbon-emissions-cuts-13291192.html)

A new study suggests that regardless of efforts to reduce emissions, a significant portion of Antarctica will be lost in the future. The research indicates that the rate at which the warming Southern Ocean melts the West Antarctic ice sheet will accelerate over the course of this century, leading to increased sea-level rise and potential consequences for coastal communities worldwide. The study used a regional ocean model to predict ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea, the most vulnerable sector of the ice sheet. The results show a rapid increase in ocean warming and ice-shelf melting, even under the best-case scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5°C. The findings suggest that rapid ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea is now inevitable until at least 2100, regardless of international policies on fossil fuels. Melting ice shelves contribute significantly to sea-level rise, and while it is difficult to determine exact figures without considering other factors such as glacier flow and snow accumulation, increased ice-shelf melting is expected to accelerate sea-level rise. The West Antarctic ice sheet is already losing about 80 billion tonnes of ice per year and has enough ice to cause up to 5 meters of sea-level rise. However, there is still hope for the longer term, as simulations show that under the 1.5°C scenario, ice-shelf melting may start to plateau by the end of the century, suggesting that further changes in the 22nd century could still be preventable. The article emphasizes the need for courage and adaptation in facing climate change and protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels.

### [Are tensions between Netanyahu and military delaying Israel's invasion?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-tensions-between-netanyahu-and-military-delaying-israels-ground-invasion-13292532.html)

Israel has not yet launched a ground invasion on Gaza, despite announcing its urgency. The reasons for the delay include talks on the release of hostages held by Hamas, international pressure, and political-military differences. The Biden administration is urging Israel to postpone a ground conflict in Gaza and is sending military assets to express support for Israel and prevent others from joining the conflict. Hamas has held over 200 captives since attacking Israel on October 7th. Israeli authorities believe that a deal for hostages will be impossible once a ground invasion occurs. There are tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF (army), with disagreements and accusations of failing to prevent the attack by Hamas militants. The presence of US military personnel in Israel aims to prevent any move that could endanger the hostages, including Americans. International leaders are urging caution and fear that a ground operation could escalate the conflict and involve other countries like Iran-backed Hezbollah.

Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old Israeli grandmother, was held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza. After being released, she shared her abduction ordeal and shed light on the treatment of captives by Hamas. Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released after being held captive for 16 days. Lifshitz described being beaten during the journey into Gaza and being tied to a motorcycle. Once in captivity, she and the other hostages were provided with mattresses, food, access to medical care, and were treated well overall. Lifshitz praised the militants for their treatment, stating that they took care of their needs and were concerned about hygiene. She also criticized the Israeli government for security lapses. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are gathering intelligence from Lifshitz's account as they prepare to respond to the Hamas attack. The decision to put Lifshitz in front of the cameras has received criticism, with some viewing it as a propaganda win for Hamas. Hamas claims to have over 200 hostages, and the release of Lifshitz and Cooper follows the release of two Israeli-American women. The US has reportedly asked Israel to delay its ground invasion to facilitate the release of more hostages.

The Israeli army is urging residents of the Gaza Strip to provide information about hostages held by Hamas in exchange for financial rewards. The army dropped leaflets containing the message from aircraft during airstrikes. The leaflets also provided contact information for sending information about the hostages. So far, four female hostages have been released through negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Israeli military is using various methods, including surveillance and interrogating captured Hamas militants, to determine the whereabouts of the captives. Israel is preparing for a potential ground invasion to free the hostages and eliminate Hamas. The exact location of the hostages is unknown, and it's unclear whether they are all held by Hamas or other extremist groups. The presence of dual nationals among the hostages further complicates the situation. Over 220 people were kidnapped by Hamas militants during an attack on southern Israel in early October.

China and Bhutan have pledged to resolve their boundary dispute, which could have implications for India. The dispute between China and Bhutan dates back to 1950 when China occupied Tibet and refused to recognize the dividing line between Tibet and Bhutan. The two countries have been engaged in boundary talks since 1984, focusing on three disputed areas. In 2017, India and China had a standoff over the Doklam plateau, which is considered an undisputed territory of Bhutan by India. The region holds great security importance for India as it threatens the Siliguri Corridor, a vital stretch connecting the Indian mainland to the Northeast. There are concerns in New Delhi that a deal between Bhutan and China could involve swapping Doklam for disputed territories in the north. India believes that China's claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is a way to pressure Bhutan into handing over Doklam. Tensions remain high between India and China over the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with no agreement reached on troop disengagement at key friction points. Resolving the dispute over Doklam is linked to the conflict on China and India's shared border, particularly regarding Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as an extension of South Tibet.

### [How China is targeting Canadian lawmakers through ‘spamouflage'](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-china-is-targeting-canadian-lawmakers-through-spamouflage-13288882.html)

A bot network linked to China has been accused of launching a "spamouflage" misinformation campaign targeting Canadian lawmakers. The network used thousands of messages on social media accounts to accuse members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of criminal and ethical infractions. The campaign involved the dissemination of propaganda across various platforms, combining spam-like content with more ordinary, human-interest style posts. The bot network also circulated misinformation about other events, such as the Hawaiian wildfires and Japan's Fukushima water release. The goal of the campaign was to discredit and denigrate targeted MPs and silence criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. China has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and called the accusations a "blatant smear campaign." Canada has expressed concern that the campaign could discourage MPs from carrying out their duties and speaking out on important issues.

### [How Hezbollah will decide whether Lebanon enters the war](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-hezbollah-will-decide-whether-lebanon-enters-the-israel-hamas-war-13287972.html)

The Israeli military conducted airstrikes on two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were preparing to launch rockets and anti-tank missiles against Israel. As tensions between Israel and Hamas continue to escalate, there is a risk that Lebanon, already on the brink of economic and political collapse, could be drawn into the conflict. Hezbollah has been preparing to join the fight since Hamas launched a surprise assault, resulting in increased attacks by the Shiite militant group. Israel is evacuating residents along the border with Lebanon in anticipation of a ground invasion of Gaza, and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate if Israeli forces enter Gaza. The decision of whether Hezbollah fully joins the war will shed light on its priorities: the well-being of Lebanon or acting as a proxy for Iran. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has spilled into Lebanon since 1948, with the displacement of Palestinians leading to tensions and conflict. The rise of Hezbollah, which formed in 1982 with Iranian and Syrian support, has significantly impacted Lebanon's political landscape. Despite the fractured political system and weak state, Lebanon managed to retain some stability until it experienced a severe economic crisis in 2019, followed by the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The political system remains in gridlock, and Hezbollah has emerged as a defender of the current political system. The decision of whether Lebanon enters the war rests with Hezbollah and, by extension, Iran. If Hezbollah joins the war, it could lead to further regional conflict and push Lebanon closer to collapse.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In Gujarat, at least 10 people have died while participating in Garba, a traditional dance performed during the Navratri celebrations. The victims ranged from teenagers to middle-aged individuals, with the youngest being a 13-year-old boy. The cause of these deaths is believed to be heart attacks, possibly due to pre-existing medical conditions, prolonged fasting, poor eating habits, and a lack of awareness about heart health issues in India. Some experts also speculate that COVID-19 may be a contributing factor, although this has been refuted by former chief minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel. Similar incidents have been reported in the past, highlighting the need for individuals to be aware of their health and not push their physical limits during such celebrations. It is important to stay hydrated and take breaks to prevent cardiac strain. COVID-19 has been linked to increased risks of blood clotting, heart failure, and other heart-related issues. An analysis of these deaths is necessary to determine the exact causes and prevent future incidents.

The Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission was initially delayed due to weather conditions and was later halted just seconds before lift-off due to an anomaly detected by the ground support computer. The issue was quickly resolved, and the launch took place at 10 am. The objective of the test flight was to showcase the performance of the crew escape system, and it lasted a total of 532 seconds. The crew module successfully separated from the rocket and descended through parachutes, landing in the Bay of Bengal. This test flight is significant for India's first human spaceflight project as it tests the safety mechanisms for the Gaganyaan crew in case of an emergency.
