### [How a simple blood test could help diagnose bipolar disorder](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-a-simple-blood-test-could-help-diagnose-bipolar-disorder-13323932.html)

Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK have developed a blood test that, when combined with a digital mental health assessment, can provide an improved diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The blood test alone can diagnose up to 30% of patients with bipolar disorder, but it is even more effective when used in conjunction with the online assessment. This combination can help differentiate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which have similar symptoms but require different treatments. The blood test is still in the proof of concept stage, but it has the potential to be a valuable complement to existing psychiatric diagnosis methods. Up to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder, and the blood test could help ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment. The research team used samples and data from the delta study, conducted in the UK between 2018 and 2020, to identify bipolar disorder in patients previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The blood test and online assessment combination significantly improved diagnostic outcomes for people with bipolar disorder, especially in cases where the diagnosis was not obvious.

### [In Graphics | The fascinating history of Halloween](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/in-graphics-the-fascinatng-history-of-halloween-13325482.html)

Halloween, observed on October 31st, has evolved from its origins as the Samhain festival of the ancient Celts. It is now a widely celebrated non-religious holiday in Europe and North America. The festival originally involved lighting fires and dressing up in costumes to repel ghosts and spirits. In the eighth century, the church incorporated some of Samhain's rituals into its own practices and repositioned November 1st as All Saints Day. The day before All Saints Day became known as Halloween, and traditions such as dressing up, trick-or-treating, and carving jack-o-lanterns were gradually added over time.

The air quality in Delhi is expected to fluctuate between the "poor" and "very poor" categories for the next four to five days. This is due to crop residue burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana. Stubble burning in Punjab has been listed as one of the biggest contributors to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, there has been a decrease in stubble burning incidents in Haryana this year. Data from NASA shows that farm fires have been at a low level this year, possibly due to a delayed burning season and excess rainfall. The air quality situation in Delhi is monitored by NASA, and it deteriorates every year during late October and November.

This comes as several other TMC leaders have been arrested or investigated for corruption.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari, the owner of 'Baap of Chart', from the securities market. SEBI claims that Ansari misled investors and influenced them to deal in securities, making Rs 17.2 crore in the process. Ansari, who presents himself as a stock market expert on social media, offered educational courses and conducted workshops to train investors. SEBI alleges that he made buying/selling recommendations under the guise of educational courses and promised guaranteed returns. The regulator also accused Ansari of using theatrics and showmanship to induce investors to trade in securities. Additionally, SEBI found that Ansari incurred losses in stock trading despite claiming to provide strategies for high profits. Along with Ansari, four other directors of Golden Syndicate Ventures were also involved in non-registered investment advisory services, according to SEBI. The regulator has ordered Ansari and others to cease acting as investment advisors and deposit the Rs 17.2 crore within 15 days.

### [Why are ‘free’ seats on flights in India so hard to find?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/centre-airlines-free-paid-seats-flights-india-dgca-rules-13299942.html)

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs in India has warned domestic airlines and online travel aggregators for engaging in "unfair" trade practices. The ministry highlighted issues such as misleading claims of "free mandatory web check-in" and not allowing customers to board with confirmed tickets. A survey found that 47% of respondents had to pay for a seat of their choice in the last year, and 51% did not get any free seat and were charged an additional fee for seat allocation. The ministry has called for a meeting with CEOs of airlines and travel portals to address these concerns. Airlines in India charge passengers for seat selection, with fees ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 1,000 depending on the location of the seat. In 2013, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation allowed airlines to charge consumers for extra services, including preferential seats, but this norm was struck down in 2015. Last March, a Parliamentary panel criticized airlines for charging different fares for seat allocation and asked the government to monitor fare pricing. Despite an increase in consumer complaints, the Indian government does not intend to intervene in the pricing mechanism of airlines.

Israel has reportedly agreed to delay its planned invasion of Gaza in order to allow the United States to deploy missile defenses to protect US troops in the region. Both Israel and the Biden administration are focused on trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The US is rushing nearly a dozen air-defense systems to the area, and has also advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault as it works to free more hostages and prepare for a potential wider conflict. Israel is taking into account the need for humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages. The threat to US troops is a top concern, as they are expected to be targeted by militant groups once an invasion begins. Israeli officials acknowledge that some hostages may have already been killed in retaliatory air raids, and they believe a solution for the hostages will become practically impossible once a ground invasion takes place. Egypt has been urged to pressure Hamas to release all detained women and children if they want to reach a solution. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas in response to the recent attack on civilians by militants. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has warned Hamas, stating that modern Jews have different capabilities than in the past.

Russia has passed legislation to withdraw from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a landmark accord that prohibits nuclear weapons tests. The CTBT, agreed upon in 1996, aims to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons by banning any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion worldwide. Currently, 187 states have signed the treaty, with 178 ratifying it in their parliaments. Of the nine countries with nuclear weapons, Britain and France have both signed and ratified the treaty, while the United States, Israel, and China have signed but not ratified it. Russia had previously signed and ratified the treaty but is now withdrawing its ratification. The treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests, with no country conducting such a test since the 1990s except for North Korea. The treaty also established a global network of observation posts to detect signs of nuclear explosions. While Russia claims it does not plan to conduct a test unless the US does so first, some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now. A resumption of nuclear testing could prompt other countries to follow suit and potentially lead to a new arms race.

A recent article discusses the impact of social media, particularly Instagram, on teenagers. The article highlights a lawsuit filed against Meta (formerly Facebook) by 41 states and the District of Columbia, alleging that the company intentionally designed Facebook and Instagram with features that harm teens and young users. Internal research from Meta in March 2020 showed that Instagram is harmful to teen girls' body image and well-being, but the company ignored these findings. Numerous studies have shown that the more often teens use Instagram, the worse their overall well-being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, mood, and body image. Two key features of Instagram make it particularly risky for teens: the ability to follow celebrities and peers who present unrealistic body images and curated impressions of a perfect life, and the emphasis on pictures of the body, leading users to focus on how they look to others. These factors contribute to negative social comparisons, envy, lowered self-esteem, and increased body dissatisfaction among teens. Body dissatisfaction during the teen years is a predictor of later eating disorder symptoms. The article suggests that parents can help by talking to their teens about appearance versus reality, encouraging face-to-face interactions with peers, and promoting active engagement with their bodies instead of focusing on selfies. The article raises concerns about how Meta will handle these damaging results and compares their approach to Big Tobacco's denial of the harmful effects of its products.

Experts are concerned that thousands of penguins and seals in Antarctica could be wiped out by a deadly variant of bird flu known as avian flu. British scientists discovered the virus in brown skuas, a scavenger bird, on Bird Island, part of the British overseas possession of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The virus is believed to have been brought to Antarctica by birds migrating from South America, where it has already caused significant deaths among seabirds and sea lions. The H5N1 strain of avian flu is highly pathogenic and causes significant mortality in poultry. While the virus is difficult to spread from animals to humans, there are concerns that if a person with the flu contracts this bird flu, it could lead to serious consequences. Researchers fear that the disease could result in catastrophic breeding failure and have a devastating impact on many wildlife species in Antarctica.

Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly in Miami, Florida while Israel is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza. Yair's absence has caused anger among reservists who are serving on the front lines. Yair, who is currently eligible for reserve duty in Israel, has been photographed enjoying the beaches and sunshine in Miami. He hosts a right-wing podcast in Florida and has a history of posting incendiary messages on social media. In August, he was ordered to pay compensation to a woman he defamed on social media. Yair has also been involved in several defamation cases and has been temporarily banned from Facebook for hate speech.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening as Israel continues its attacks on the region, and a United Nations agency may be forced to stop aid operations due to a shortage of fuel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) currently provides aid to 600,000 displaced Gazans and has called for a humanitarian "pause" in fighting. Hospitals are on the verge of shutting down due to the lack of fuel supplies, and the healthcare system is at its worst stage in history. The World Health Organization warns that patients dependent on dialysis and premature babies are at risk of dying without a stable supply of electricity. Israel has ruled out allowing fuel into Gaza, claiming that Hamas would use it for its operational infrastructure and rocket attacks. Israel suggests that the UN ask Hamas for fuel supplies, as they claim Hamas has stored fuel in advance. Israel is also in a diplomatic row with the UN after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments about the attack by Hamas on Israel not happening in a vacuum. Israel has asked Guterres to resign and plans to deny visas to UN officials.

Hezbollah, a significant force in Lebanon with political and military power, has been trading fire with Israel along the Israel-Lebanon border since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began its attacks on the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah has been supporting Hamas in the conflict and has expressed its readiness to take action. The group has a history of tense relations with Israel and is committed to its destruction. Experts fear that Hezbollah's involvement in the Israel-Hamas war could escalate the conflict and destabilize the region.

Scammers are taking advantage of the Israel-Hamas war by sending deceptive emails and creating fraudulent websites to solicit donations. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has identified over 500 scam emails and fake websites that exploit people's willingness to help those affected by the conflict. The scammers pose as charitable organizations and use emotive language to entice people to click on a fake website link and make donations. They even offer options like using cryptocurrencies for transactions. Additionally, there are suspicious accounts on social media platforms asking for donations, but these are likely scams as well. To avoid getting scammed, it is important to thoroughly scrutinize donation pages, check the legitimacy of charitable organizations, and cross-check names to avoid mistaken identity.

India is reportedly considering moving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) against Canada for its soft stance towards Khalistani terrorists. The FATF is a global watchdog that combats money laundering and terror financing. India has accused Canada of providing safe space to terrorists despite sharing evidence. The FATF conducts regular evaluations of countries' performance on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, and countries that do not meet the standards can be placed on the grey or black lists. India may present evidence of terror funding and financing emanating from Canada to the FATF. The India-Canada diplomatic row has escalated, with Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats from India and India suspending visa services to Canadians.

### [Why melting of West Antarctic ice shelves cannot be avoided despite carbon emissions cuts](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-melting-of-west-antarctic-ice-shelves-cannot-be-avoided-despite-carbon-emissions-cuts-13291192.html)

A new study suggests that regardless of efforts to reduce emissions, a significant portion of Antarctica will be lost in the future. The research indicates that the rate at which the warming Southern Ocean melts the West Antarctic ice sheet will accelerate over the course of this century, leading to increased sea-level rise and potential consequences for coastal communities worldwide. The study used a regional ocean model to predict ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea, the most vulnerable sector of the ice sheet. The results show a rapid increase in ocean warming and ice-shelf melting, even under the best-case scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5°C. The findings suggest that rapid ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea is now inevitable until at least 2100, regardless of international policies on fossil fuels. Melting ice shelves contribute significantly to sea-level rise, and while it is difficult to determine exact figures without considering other factors such as glacier flow and snow accumulation, increased ice-shelf melting is expected to accelerate sea-level rise. The West Antarctic ice sheet is already losing about 80 billion tonnes of ice per year and has enough ice to cause up to 5 meters of sea-level rise. However, there is still hope for the longer term, as simulations show that under the 1.5°C scenario, ice-shelf melting may start to plateau by the end of the century, suggesting that further changes in the 22nd century could still be preventable. The article emphasizes the need for courage and adaptation in facing climate change and protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels.

### [Are tensions between Netanyahu and military delaying Israel's invasion?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-tensions-between-netanyahu-and-military-delaying-israels-ground-invasion-13292532.html)

Israel has not yet launched a ground invasion on Gaza, despite announcing its urgency. The reasons for the delay include talks on the release of hostages held by Hamas, international pressure, and political-military differences. The Biden administration is urging Israel to postpone a ground conflict in Gaza and is sending military assets to express support for Israel and prevent others from joining the conflict. Hamas has held over 200 captives since attacking Israel on October 7th. Israeli authorities believe that a deal for hostages will be impossible once a ground invasion occurs. There are tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF (army), with disagreements and accusations of failing to prevent the attack by Hamas militants. The presence of US military personnel in Israel aims to prevent any move that could endanger the hostages, including Americans. International leaders are urging caution and fear that a ground operation could escalate the conflict and involve other countries like Iran-backed Hezbollah.

Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old Israeli grandmother, was held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza. After being released, she shared her abduction ordeal and shed light on the treatment of captives by Hamas. Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released after being held captive for 16 days. Lifshitz described being beaten during the journey into Gaza and being tied to a motorcycle. Once in captivity, she and the other hostages were provided with mattresses, food, access to medical care, and were treated well overall. Lifshitz praised the militants for their treatment, stating that they took care of their needs and were concerned about hygiene. She also criticized the Israeli government for security lapses. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are gathering intelligence from Lifshitz's account as they prepare to respond to the Hamas attack. The decision to put Lifshitz in front of the cameras has received criticism, with some viewing it as a propaganda win for Hamas. Hamas claims to have over 200 hostages, and the release of Lifshitz and Cooper follows the release of two Israeli-American women. The US has reportedly asked Israel to delay its ground invasion to facilitate the release of more hostages.

The Israeli army is urging residents of the Gaza Strip to provide information about hostages held by Hamas in exchange for financial rewards. The army dropped leaflets containing the message from aircraft during airstrikes. The leaflets also provided contact information for sending information about the hostages. So far, four female hostages have been released through negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Israeli military is using various methods, including surveillance and interrogating captured Hamas militants, to determine the whereabouts of the captives. Israel is preparing for a potential ground invasion to free the hostages and eliminate Hamas. The exact location of the hostages is unknown, and it's unclear whether they are all held by Hamas or other extremist groups. The presence of dual nationals among the hostages further complicates the situation. Over 220 people were kidnapped by Hamas militants during an attack on southern Israel in early October.

China and Bhutan have pledged to resolve their boundary dispute, which could have implications for India. The dispute between China and Bhutan dates back to 1950 when China occupied Tibet and refused to recognize the dividing line between Tibet and Bhutan. The two countries have been engaged in boundary talks since 1984, focusing on three disputed areas. In 2017, India and China had a standoff over the Doklam plateau, which is considered an undisputed territory of Bhutan by India. The region holds great security importance for India as it threatens the Siliguri Corridor, a vital stretch connecting the Indian mainland to the Northeast. There are concerns in New Delhi that a deal between Bhutan and China could involve swapping Doklam for disputed territories in the north. India believes that China's claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is a way to pressure Bhutan into handing over Doklam. Tensions remain high between India and China over the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with no agreement reached on troop disengagement at key friction points. Resolving the dispute over Doklam is linked to the conflict on China and India's shared border, particularly regarding Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as an extension of South Tibet.

A bot network linked to China has been accused of launching a "spamouflage" misinformation campaign targeting Canadian lawmakers. The network used thousands of messages on social media accounts to accuse members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of criminal and ethical infractions. The campaign involved the dissemination of propaganda across various platforms, combining spam-like content with more ordinary, human-interest style posts. The bot network also circulated misinformation about other events, such as the Hawaiian wildfires and Japan's Fukushima water release. The goal of the campaign was to discredit and denigrate targeted MPs and silence criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. China has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and called the accusations a "blatant smear campaign." Canada has expressed concern that the campaign could discourage MPs from carrying out their duties and speaking out on important issues.

### [How Hezbollah will decide whether Lebanon enters the war](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-hezbollah-will-decide-whether-lebanon-enters-the-israel-hamas-war-13287972.html)

The Israeli military conducted airstrikes on two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were preparing to launch rockets and anti-tank missiles against Israel. As tensions between Israel and Hamas continue to escalate, there is a risk that Lebanon, already on the brink of economic and political collapse, could be drawn into the conflict. Hezbollah has been preparing to join the fight since Hamas launched a surprise assault, resulting in increased attacks by the Shiite militant group. Israel is evacuating residents along the border with Lebanon in anticipation of a ground invasion of Gaza, and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate if Israeli forces enter Gaza. The decision of whether Hezbollah fully joins the war will shed light on its priorities: the well-being of Lebanon or acting as a proxy for Iran. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has spilled into Lebanon since 1948, with the displacement of Palestinians leading to tensions and conflict. The rise of Hezbollah, which formed in 1982 with Iranian and Syrian support, has significantly impacted Lebanon's political landscape. Despite the fractured political system and weak state, Lebanon managed to retain some stability until it experienced a severe economic crisis in 2019, followed by the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The political system remains in gridlock, and Hezbollah has emerged as a defender of the current political system. The decision of whether Lebanon enters the war rests with Hezbollah and, by extension, Iran. If Hezbollah joins the war, it could lead to further regional conflict and push Lebanon closer to collapse.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In Gujarat, at least 10 people have died while participating in Garba, a traditional dance performed during the Navratri celebrations. The victims ranged from teenagers to middle-aged individuals, with the youngest being a 13-year-old boy. The cause of these deaths is believed to be heart attacks, possibly due to pre-existing medical conditions, prolonged fasting, poor eating habits, and a lack of awareness about heart health issues in India. Some experts also speculate that COVID-19 may be a contributing factor, although this has been refuted by former chief minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel. Similar incidents have been reported in the past, highlighting the need for individuals to be aware of their health and not push their physical limits during such celebrations. It is important to stay hydrated and take breaks to prevent cardiac strain. COVID-19 has been linked to increased risks of blood clotting, heart failure, and other heart-related issues. An analysis of these deaths is necessary to determine the exact causes and prevent future incidents.

### [Hold. Delay. Go: How ISRO launched Gaganyaan's first test flight after 'anomaly'](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/isro-gaganyaan-mission-first-test-flight-launch-delay-anomaly-13279482.html)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the first test flight for India's Gaganyaan mission on 21 October. The Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission was initially delayed due to weather conditions and was later halted just seconds before lift-off due to an anomaly detected by the ground support computer. The issue was quickly resolved, and the launch took place at 10 am. The objective of the test flight was to showcase the performance of the crew escape system, and it lasted a total of 532 seconds. The crew module successfully separated from the rocket and descended through parachutes, landing in the Bay of Bengal. This test flight is significant for India's first human spaceflight project as it tests the safety mechanisms for the Gaganyaan crew in case of an emergency. The successful separation of the crew module ensures that astronauts can escape during a mid-flight emergency. The ISRO is prioritizing astronaut safety and is building environmental control and life support systems for the crew module. India aims to send a manned Gaganyaan mission to space by 2025.

In addition to space achievements, India also inaugurated a rapid rail transport system, with the aim of faster travel between Sahibabad and Duhai depot. However, there was disappointment as the Supreme Court refused to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriages, stating that it should be decided by parliament. There was some political drama involving TMC MP Mahua Moitra, who was accused of granting parliamentary access in exchange for cash and gifts, allegations she denied.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Captagon pills, a counterfeit version of a medicine first produced in Germany in the 1960s, are widely smuggled across West Asia and have been found on the bodies of Hamas militants killed on Israeli soil. The drug is an amphetamine-type stimulant that provides a boost of energy, enhances focus, and produces a feeling of euphoria. It is dubbed "the poor man's cocaine" and has been linked to militants in Iraq and Syria. Captagon has serious side effects, including psychosis and brain damage, and can lead to addiction. Syria has become a major producer and consumer of amphetamines, with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad and his associates profit from the sale of these drugs. Efforts have been made by several West Asian countries to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, but experts warn that smugglers may find new routes and markets, posing a threat to Europe and the rest of the world.
