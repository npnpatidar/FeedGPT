Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of rules that govern marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and other personal issues applicable to all Indian residents regardless of religious beliefs. A committee led by retired Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai is expected to submit a comprehensive report on the UCC to Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. The state government is considering calling a special session of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly to enact the UCC bill. The committee's report emphasizes equal rights for daughters living on ancestral properties and gender equality but does not advocate for raising the age at which women can get married. The proposed laws focus on consistency in personal laws, including child custody, maintenance, divorce, property rights, and inter-state property rights. The draft bill also seeks to ban polygamy and allows live-in couples to register their relationship. The Union government may use the report as a model when developing the UCC Bill for nationwide implementation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made the UCC a prime focus for upcoming elections and aims to promote uniformity and law reform. Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, two other BJP-ruled states, have also initiated the process of implementing the UCC.

The article also mentions historical boycotts related to the Middle East and highlights instances of successful and unsuccessful boycotts. It concludes that while the boycotts against American companies have raised awareness about Israel's treatment of Palestinians, they may not have a significant economic impact without coordinated international sanctions.

### [Is flexible work hours good for your heart health?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/is-flexible-work-hours-good-for-your-heart-health-13375612.html)

A new study conducted by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Penn State University has found that flexible working can have positive effects on heart health and reduce the risk of cardiac events. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at the impact of work environment on heart health and surveyed employees from an IT company and a long-term care company. The researchers assigned each employee a cardiometabolic risk score (CRS) and found that while flexible work did not improve the employees' CRS overall, it did show reductions in those who started with a higher baseline CRS. Older employees, especially those over 45, were more likely to see a reduction in their heart risk profiles. The study highlights the importance of working conditions and their impact on health, particularly for low- and middle-wage workers who have less control over their schedules and job demands. Overall, the study suggests that implementing flexible work policies could be beneficial for employees' heart health.

"Fried rice syndrome," a type of food poisoning caused by the bacteria Bacillus cereus, has returned to public attention after an incident involving the death of a student who consumed noodles left unattended for five days. The bacteria can multiply when food is left unrefrigerated for long periods of time. The term "fried rice syndrome" originated from the first documented cases connected to cooked white rice that wasn't refrigerated and was subsequently used to make fried rice dishes at restaurants. The bacteria thrives in pre-cooked starchy foods like rice and pasta, and its ideal growth temperature range is between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The symptoms of the syndrome resemble other gastrointestinal disorders, and treatment usually involves hydration and rest. To prevent food poisoning, it is advised to avoid eating leftovers and to ensure proper storage and cooling of cooked food.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has allowed the use of "green crackers" during the Diwali festival to address concerns about air pollution. Green crackers are considered eco-friendly and cause less air and noise pollution compared to traditional fireworks. They were developed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and have smaller shells, no ash, and reduced usage of raw materials. These crackers also release water vapor, which acts as a dust suppressant. There are three types of green crackers: SWAS, SAFAL, and STAR. Experts, however, are skeptical about their environmental friendliness, as even with a 30% reduction in particulate matter levels, the pollution caused by these crackers would still be high. Some manufacturers claim that green crackers cannot function without barium, which contradicts the requirements set by NEERI. The effectiveness of the restrictions on firecrackers and the clarity on the production of green crackers remain questionable. It is advisable to celebrate Diwali with candles and diyas instead of fireworks if unsure about the green credentials of the crackers.

Qatar has also provided financial support to Palestinians in Gaza and has been involved in previous negotiations, such as the release of prisoners and hosting peace talks. Despite the challenges, Qatar aims to establish itself as a diplomatic player and promote peace in the region.

Light to moderate rain showers were observed in Delhi and surrounding regions, providing some relief from the severe air pollution. The timing of the rainfall is significant as the city government plans to use cloud seeding for artificial rain. The air quality index (AQI) improved in various areas after the rain, with some locations moving from the severe category to the moderate or satisfactory categories. Rain is known to help cleanse the air by capturing and removing pollutants like particulate matter. However, its impact on pollution is more significant for larger particles. The Delhi government aims to implement artificial rain through cloud seeding technology to address air pollution. Factors such as wind speed and temperature also play a role in improving AQI. Wind can aid in dispersing particulate matter, while temperature inversion can trap pollutants near the ground. Efforts are being made to tackle air pollution in different regions of India, including addressing stubble burning and implementing measures to curb pollution in Mumbai.

An environmentalist in Israel is using birds of prey, such as eagles and vultures, to assist the army in locating dead bodies. Ohad Hatzofe of Israel’s Nature and Parks Authority tracks the migration patterns of these birds using GPS devices. The data collected by Hatzofe has helped locate four corpses so far. Birds of prey have a strong sense of smell and can detect dead bodies from a distance. The idea to involve these birds in the search for human remains came from a unit within the Israeli army responsible for locating missing soldiers. The program led by Hatzofe tracks endangered griffon vultures, eagles, and other birds of prey to study their migratory patterns, feeding habits, and environmental challenges. One of the tracked birds, a sea eagle, was found near Beeri, just outside the Gaza Strip, and its data led to the recovery of four bodies. Dozens of people are still missing after a Hamas attack on Beeri, which resulted in numerous casualties. The use of birds of prey has aided in locating bodies and providing closure for families affected by the conflict.

Despite being warned about the shortage, passport offices continue to receive applications, causing a backlog of unprinted passports. The shortage is affecting thousands of Pakistanis who are unable to obtain new passports, jeopardizing their plans to travel abroad for study, work, or vacation. The Directorate General of Immigration and Passports has extended the delivery period for passports due to the increase in applications. The backlog of unprinted passports is estimated to be around seven lakh. The shortage is primarily attributed to economic woes faced by citizens, leading them to seek job opportunities abroad. Additionally, the relaxation of travel restrictions has encouraged more people to travel for religious or tourism purposes. The inefficiency of the Directorate General of Immigration and Passports has frustrated applicants, with some having to cancel their plans due to the unavailability of passports.

A 42-year-old man in the UK, Paul Wapham, used his smartwatch to call his wife when he experienced chest pain during a run. His wife rushed him to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a heart attack caused by a blocked artery. This incident highlights how smartphones and smartwatches can play a role in saving lives and improving users' health by monitoring heart rate and detecting irregularities. Other incidents include a woman in the US whose Apple Watch warned her about an increased heart rate, leading to the diagnosis of a severe condition, and a Reddit user whose mother's Apple Watch automatically called emergency services after she collapsed from a ruptured aorta. Smartwatches from companies like Apple, Samsung, Withings, Fitbit, and AliveCor are equipped with features to record heart rate, physical activity, and even perform electrocardiograms (ECG). While they are not as accurate as hospital ECG machines, they can detect fluctuations in heartbeat and prompt users to seek medical care. Studies have shown that ECG monitors on smartwatches are 93% - 95% accurate at identifying different types of heart attacks. However, experts caution that more research is needed before fully relying on smartwatches for early detection of heart attacks. There are concerns that people may be unnecessarily worried about minor heart arrhythmias and seek unnecessary testing and treatment. Smartwatches should be seen as supplementary devices and not replacements for medical tests conducted in healthcare settings.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Bihar Assembly recently passed a bill increasing reservation for deprived castes from 50 to 60 percent in government jobs and educational institutions, bringing the total reservation in Bihar to 75 percent. This decision by the Bihar government goes beyond the 50 percent cap on reservation set by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1992 judgment in the Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case, also known as the Mandal Commission verdict. The Supreme Court ruled that reservation for the backward class should be capped at 50 percent and that economic backwardness alone cannot be a criteria for reservation. Since the 1992 verdict, several states, including Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and now Bihar, have passed laws to exceed the 50 percent cap. In 2019, the Centre also introduced a 10 percent reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) over and above the existing 50 percent reservation for SCs, STs, and OBCs. The Supreme Court upheld the 103rd Constitution Amendment of 2019, which introduced the EWS reservation, in a ruling in November 2022. The Bihar government's decision to increase reservation to 75 percent is based on a comprehensive caste survey conducted by the Nitish Kumar government. The survey provided data that will be used to introduce more measures for the upliftment of socially, educationally, and economically backward sections of society in Bihar.

The article discusses the approval of a new weight-loss drug called Zepbound by the FDA. The drug is developed by Eli Lilly and contains the same active ingredient as their diabetes treatment, Mounjaro. Zepbound works by activating hormones in the body that slow down stomach emptying, making people feel full for longer and suppressing appetite. However, it carries risks such as gastrointestinal issues. Zepbound will join other weight-loss drugs in the market, including Ozempic and Wegovy, which have seen high demand and sales. The obesity drug market is expected to grow significantly, with predictions of it becoming a $100 billion industry by 2030. The rise of these drugs may also impact the food and pharmaceutical industries, as consumers make more nutritious choices and opt for weight-loss drugs instead of certain medications.

The article discusses the findings of the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2023 Global Tuberculosis (TB) report, with a focus on the situation in India. The report reveals that around 7.5 million people were diagnosed with TB worldwide in 2022, and the number of people falling sick with TB increased to 10.6 million. However, there has been a "significant worldwide recovery" in the scale-up of TB diagnosis and treatment services in 2022. India, along with Indonesia and the Philippines, accounted for over 60% of the global reductions in newly diagnosed TB cases in 2020 and 2021. The report also highlights that multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis. In India, MDR-TB accounts for 2.5% of new cases and 13% of previously treated cases. The article mentions that India has made progress in improving case detection and reducing TB mortality, but it still has a long way to go in achieving the goals set by the WHO. The cost of treatment and the detection of MDR-TB are identified as challenges in India's fight against TB.

### [What happens once Israel dismantles Hamas in Gaza? The possibilities explained](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-happens-once-israel-dismantles-hamas-in-gaza-the-possibilities-explained-13369762.html)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the evolving plans for Israel's security role in the Gaza Strip following its intensified campaign against Hamas militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed the intention to maintain overall security responsibility in Gaza once Hamas is removed from power. However, the article highlights that this could be seen as a form of military occupation by the Palestinians and the international community, potentially complicating efforts to hand governing responsibility to the Palestinian Authority or friendly Arab states.

The presence of Israeli forces in Gaza is likely to fuel an insurgency, similar to the period from 1967 to 2005 when two Palestinian uprisings occurred, leading to the rise of Hamas. The United States, Israel's biggest ally, acknowledges these consequences but suggests that Israel might control the territory for a transition period.

There is currently no long-term plan for Gaza, according to Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's War Cabinet. Any plan would have to address Israel's security needs and aim to replace the Hamas regime while ensuring security superiority for Israel.

The article also provides historical context, mentioning that Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War. After decades of military rule, the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority as an autonomous government in the West Bank and Gaza. However, the Palestinian Authority lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, leaving it with administrative powers and Israel with overall security control.

Various suggestions are discussed, including maintaining an over-the-horizon presence with moderate Palestinians handling security inside Gaza and Israeli intervention only when necessary. Another option is creating a buffer zone along the border or considering the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. The article references the lessons learned from Israel's experiences in Lebanon and the challenges it faced after withdrawing its forces.

Ultimately, the future of Gaza and its residents remains uncertain, with mixed messages from Israel about its plans for the region.

### [How Japanese gangs are using social media for recruitment](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-japanese-gangs-are-using-social-media-for-recruitment-13368332.html)

Japan's criminal underworld is utilizing social media platforms to recruit individuals, including teenagers and retirees, for illegal activities. These recruits, often low-income citizens, are enticed by the promise of financial gain. One such individual, Risa Yamada, stumbled upon a job listing on social media and was hired to impersonate a police officer. She successfully obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars from Japan's elderly population through phone scams. The proliferation of online platforms, including encrypted messaging apps like Telegram and Signal, allows criminal gangs to connect with potential recruits anonymously. Damage caused by these illegal operations has increased by 30% in 2022, amounting to over 37 billion yen. The anonymity offered by social media platforms enables criminals to assemble groups for robberies and fraud schemes effortlessly. Recruits receive instructions via messaging apps and are rewarded for their work without feeling guilty because they don't physically interact with anyone. The consequences of these crimes became evident when a 90-year-old woman was assaulted and killed by individuals hired through online advertisements. These criminal organizations exploit and dispose of their recruits, using them as pawns. Police have been working to remove criminal ads from social media platforms and have offered rewards for information on these gangs. Only a small percentage of those arrested for organized fraud held high-ranking gang positions. The article highlights personal accounts of individuals who engaged in criminal activities for financial gain and the subsequent consequences they faced.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israel has intensified its ground campaign and airstrikes on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, forcing thousands of Palestinians to flee. Videos show civilians carrying luggage and waving white flags as they walk to the south of Gaza for safety. The white flag has historically been associated with surrender in times of conflict. In recent times, it has been used by Iraqi soldiers in the 2003 Iraq war when surrendering to US troops. However, waving white flags has not always guaranteed safety, as Israeli soldiers reportedly killed Palestinian civilians waving white flags during Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009. The IDF has urged Gazans to move south for weeks, but Hamas claims that Israeli airstrikes have hit both the north and south of Gaza. The UNRWA has warned that relief operations may cease due to a lack of fuel supplies, putting thousands at risk.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Ohio residents have voted in favor of enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution, with 56.1% voting in favor and 43.9% against. This comes after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v Wade last year. The inclusion of abortion rights in the constitution means that the state's proposed restriction on abortions after six weeks cannot be implemented. Advocates for abortion access are now focusing on the 2024 election and whether the issue can help President Joe Biden overcome likely opponent Donald Trump. The wins for Democrats and abortion-rights campaigners in Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia were seen as a boost for Biden's re-election campaign. However, recent polls have shown Biden trailing Trump, and concerns about his age and inflation persist among voters. Democrats hope to use the highly emotional issue of abortion as a central weapon in their strategy for the 2024 election.

The latest work trend called "coffee badging" is gaining attention, but not for positive reasons. Coffee badging involves employees showing up at the office, grabbing a coffee, socializing briefly with colleagues, and then leaving. It is a form of presenteeism where employees make a brief appearance at the office to earn recognition without actually being productive. A recent report found that 58% of hybrid workers in the US have engaged in coffee badging. The practice is seen as a subtle form of protest against returning to the office and can create a toxic work culture. Employees may feel pressured to be physically present in order to be noticed and rewarded. Coffee badging can also lead to reduced collaboration and undermine work culture. Managers are concerned about the impact of this trend on productivity and employee engagement. To address coffee badging, companies should offer more flexible work models and encourage open communication between employees and employers.

The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has led to companies facing backlash and being caught in the politics of the war. Luxury fashion brand Dior received criticism on social media after reports emerged that it replaced Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid with Israeli model May Tager in its latest ad campaign. Turkey's Parliament reportedly removed Coca-Cola and Nestle products from menus due to their alleged support for Israel, marking the first time a government or major organization has targeted global brands over the conflict. UK-based retail brand Marks and Spencer faced outrage for posting a photo on Instagram of Christmas party hats in the colors of the Palestinian flag burning in a fireplace, leading to an apology and removal of the post. Starbucks faced calls for boycotts after its union expressed solidarity with Palestinians, leading to a lawsuit between the company and the union. McDonald's also faced criticism after one of its Israel-based franchises offered free food to personnel of the Israeli military, while McDonald's Malaysia donated funds for humanitarian aid in Gaza. Companies in the United States have been pressured to respond to the conflict, with employees at Google and Amazon calling on their bosses to take a public stand. The conflict has evoked divisions among employees, with Arab and Muslim workers feeling dismissed while Jewish employees worry about rising antisemitism.

### [Trump leading Biden in polls: Could the Republican return to the White House?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/trump-leading-biden-in-polls-could-the-republican-return-to-the-white-house-13365172.html)

According to a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll, President Joe Biden is trailing former President Donald Trump in nearly every swing state, raising concerns among Democrats about the possibility of Trump being re-elected in 2024. The swing states in question include Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan, which account for a significant number of electoral votes. The poll shows that Biden is leading only in Wisconsin, while Trump has an average lead of 48% to 44% in the other states [[SOURCE 1]].

The polls also indicate that registered voters have concerns about Biden's age and his handling of the economy. A majority of those polled, including 71% of registered voters and 54% of Biden's own supporters, believe that Biden is "too old." Additionally, swing state voters favor Trump over Biden when it comes to handling the economy, with a 59% to 37% margin [[SOURCE 1]].

Furthermore, the polls suggest that Biden's multiracial and multigenerational coalition may be weakening. Young voters, who heavily supported Biden in the 2020 election, now only favor him by a slim margin of one percent. Biden's advantage with Hispanic voters has also decreased to single digits. In addition, black voters, a core demographic for Biden, are registering 22% support for Trump in these swing states, which is unprecedented for a Republican candidate [[SOURCE 1]].

Despite these poll results, it is important to note that the 2024 election is still a year away, and predictions made at this stage may not accurately reflect the final outcome. Experts caution against panicking based on early polls and emphasize that the economy and other factors can significantly influence voter perceptions over time. The Biden camp remains confident and points to past examples where polls underestimated the eventual outcome, such as Barack Obama's victory in 2012 [[SOURCE 1]].

In conclusion, while recent polls show Biden trailing Trump in swing states and raise concerns about his age and handling of the economy, it is too early to make definitive predictions about the 2024 election. The polls serve as a warning to Democrats about the work they need to do to maintain support and address concerns among key voter groups. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the state of the economy and how voters perceive the candidates in the coming months [[SOURCE 1]].

This level of pollution poses significant health risks to residents, with even healthy individuals vulnerable to respiratory issues. Experts compare the current air quality to smoking 25-30 cigarettes a day. An AQI of 500 indicates the worst air quality and has severe health impacts. However, some stations in Delhi cannot report beyond 999 on the pollution measurement metric. Anand Vihar's high pollution levels can be attributed to factors such as vehicular pollution, dust, emissions from nearby industries, and the Ghazipur landfill. The primary pollutant in the area is PM10. The hazardous particulate matter PM2.5 and other pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone further increase the risk of respiratory problems and other health issues. The situation calls for immediate action to address this ongoing environmental crisis.

### [There’s a new COVID-19 variant. What's JN.1, will vaccines work against it?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/jn1-new-covid-19-variant-vaccines-danger-symptoms-13363242.html)

Scientists have expressed concern about a new variant of the COVID-19 virus known as JN.1. This variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant, also called 'Pirola,' which originated from Omicron. JN.1 has undergone a mutation that allows it to bind more strongly to human cells and increase transmissibility. It was first detected in Luxembourg and has since been found in several other countries. While JN.1 currently accounts for less than 0.1% of COVID-19 cases, experts believe it could become more prevalent, especially during the upcoming winter season. However, current vaccines are expected to be effective against this variant, as they target the spike protein that JN.1 possesses. Scientists emphasize the importance of a layered approach, including vaccination and mitigation strategies, to combat evolving variants. The emergence of JN.1 before winter has raised concerns due to historical surges in COVID-19 cases during colder months. The World Health Organization has warned of concerning trends and urged increased vaccinations and surveillance. Overall, while JN.1 presents some risks, experts believe that existing measures can help protect against severe disease.

### [What is ptosis, the eye condition that Zeenat Aman has been battling for decades?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-ptosis-the-eye-condition-that-zeenat-aman-has-been-battling-for-decades-13362952.html)

Veteran actor Zeenat Aman recently shared her struggle with a health condition called ptosis. She explained that the condition is a result of an injury she sustained many decades ago, which damaged the muscles around her right eye. Ptosis, also known as "droopy eyelid" or "blepharoptosis," is characterized by the sagging or drooping of the upper eyelid, potentially obstructing vision. It can affect one or both eyelids and vary in severity. The causes of ptosis can include age-related changes, muscle weakness, nerve damage, or congenital factors. Treatment options depend on the cause and severity and may include medication, plastic surgery, or the use of glasses or eyedrops. While there is no way to prevent ptosis, regular eye exams are recommended.

### [Can deepfakes be regulated? Which countries have laws to curb such content?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/rashmika-mandanna-katrina-kaif-deepfakes-laws-india-us-china-europe-13363342.html)

The Indian government has issued an advisory to social media platforms regarding deepfake content after a video featuring actress Rashmika Mandanna went viral. The government has highlighted the legal provisions that cover such content, including Section 66D of the Information Technology Act, which covers punishment for cheating by personation using computer resources. India's laws for copyright protection can also be used against individuals creating deepfakes using copyrighted works. However, there is a growing need for specific legislation to tackle the challenges posed by deepfakes, especially in cases related to pornography.

China has introduced regulations around deepfakes, requiring users' consent for the use of their images and prohibiting the dissemination of fake news. South Korea has made it illegal to distribute deepfakes that could cause harm to public interest, with offenders facing imprisonment or fines. In the United States, there is no national legislation specifically addressing deepfakes, but a bill called the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act has been introduced to protect individuals from deceptive political messages and deepfake pornography. The UK, Australia, France, and the European Union are also considering or implementing laws to combat deepfake content.

The recent incidents of deepfake videos have highlighted the dangers of synthetic media, particularly in the context of adult content featuring Indian actresses. India is ranked as the sixth most vulnerable country to deepfake pornography according to a State of Deepfakes report.

The air quality in Mumbai has been deteriorating and is now ranked among the world's most polluted cities. The city's air quality index (AQI) was in the "moderate" category with a reading of 149, according to SAFAR. The pollution is causing respiratory problems such as COPD, asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia across all age groups. A hospital in Mumbai has set up a special Intensive Respiratory Care Unit (IRCU) to treat patients with respiratory illnesses. Nearly 50% of patients visiting the hospital with respiratory symptoms need to be admitted, and 30% require ICU admission. The IRCU facility is equipped with advanced technology to manage complex respiratory conditions. The Maharashtra health department has initiated a "health action plan" to monitor air pollution-related conditions and ensure prompt treatment. In Delhi, RML Hospital has established a weekly "pollution" OPD to address illnesses caused by pollution.

The Supreme Court has extended the ban on polluting firecrackers to all states in India, not just the Delhi-NCR region. However, the court clarified that green crackers are allowed. These green crackers were developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in 2018 to reduce pollution levels. Green crackers have a smaller carbon footprint and contain fewer harmful chemicals compared to traditional crackers. They cause 30% less air pollution and emit less noise. The court's decision means that all states, including Rajasthan, must take steps to minimize air and noise pollution during the festival season and beyond. Some states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, and West Bengal have already imposed restrictions on the sale and use of firecrackers, with some allowing only green crackers.

Air India passengers at Delhi and Punjab airports will undergo additional security checks following a threat issued by the separatist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ). Designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun warned Sikhs not to fly Air India after November 19. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has ordered a "secondary ladder point check," where airline staff will frisk passengers and inspect their hand luggage just before boarding. Entry of visitors to the airports has also been banned. Pannun's threat, although lacking the means to carry it out, has been taken seriously, and heightened security measures have been implemented. Pannun, who has dual citizenship in Canada and the United States, is known for using social media to make threats against India. He has been designated a "proclaimed offender" by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and his assets have been seized. The Indian High Commission in Ottawa is seeking increased security for Air India flights originating and terminating in Canada.

Sweden is on track to become Europe's first smoke-free nation, with less than 5% of its population smoking every day. This achievement is attributed to a combination of factors, including strict anti-smoking laws, public health campaigns, and the use of a product called snus. The smoking rate in Sweden has steadily declined over the years, thanks to measures such as smoking bans in restaurants and public places. The Swedish government has also implemented high taxes on cigarettes while reducing taxes on snus, which is a smokeless tobacco product. Snus is a highly addictive nicotine product that is placed under the upper lip. It has been popular in Sweden for over 200 years and is considered a part of Swedish culture. While snus is seen as a less harmful alternative to smoking, health authorities remain cautious about its potential risks, including cardiovascular issues and harm to pregnant women. Overall, Sweden's success in reducing smoking rates can be attributed to a combination of tobacco control measures and public awareness campaigns [[2]](https://www.scholarcy.com/)

### [Small joys: Why you need you find your glimmer](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/glimmers-calm-joy-triggers-mental-health-trauma-13361402.html)

The concept of "glimmers" is gaining popularity on social media, particularly TikTok. Coined by Deb Dana in her book "The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy," glimmers refer to small moments that bring feelings of connection, calmness, and joy. They serve as the opposite of triggers, which can send our bodies into fight, flight, or freeze mode. Glimmers have a soothing effect on our nervous system, promoting a sense of safety and relaxation. Recognizing and seeking out glimmers regularly can be beneficial, especially for those who have experienced trauma, as it helps in managing triggers. There are two types of glimmers: self-regulating (activities like reading or walking in nature) and co-regulating (interactions with others like laughing with friends or talking to a therapist). Glimmers offer a sense of safety and connectedness, allowing us to cope during challenging times. Sharing glimmers with someone else can deepen acceptance and connection. It is important not to shy away from acknowledging and embracing feel-good emotions, as they contribute to overall well-being. Exploring and cultivating glimmers is worth a try for everyone.

Two recent studies have found a link between regular marijuana use and an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. The first study presented by the American Heart Association (AHA) found that regular marijuana users had a 34% higher risk of developing heart failure compared to non-users. The study also found that the risk decreased when participants had coronary artery disease. The second study assessed marijuana users with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes and found that 20% experienced a serious cardiac or neurological event while receiving medical attention. Additionally, marijuana users with cardiovascular risk factors had a higher rate of heart attacks compared to non-users. The use of marijuana among senior citizens is on the rise, with a 2020 study showing an increase in usage between 2015 and 2018. The American Heart Association advises against smoking or vaping any chemical, including cannabis products, due to potential risks to the heart, lungs, and blood vessels.

A deepfake video of Indian actor Rashmika Mandanna wearing a low-cut top in a lift has caused concern in India. The manipulated video, created using Artificial Intelligence (AI), has led to calls for legal action against those responsible. This incident highlights the growing problem of deepfakes, particularly their use to harm women. Deepfakes use AI to create or alter media in a way that makes it difficult to determine authenticity. While deepfakes can have positive applications, such as realistic visual effects in movies, they are predominantly used for non-consensual pornographic content. Reports indicate that 98% of all online deepfake videos target women, and there has been a significant increase in their numbers. Deepfake technology poses risks beyond pornography, including crimes, scams, and influencing key events like elections. A company called DeepMedia predicts that 500,000 video and audio deepfakes will be shared on social media this year. India is ranked as the sixth most vulnerable country to deepfake pornography. Although India currently lacks specific laws addressing deepfakes, there are legal provisions that can address the issue. The government has issued an advisory to social media platforms, citing the Information Technology Act, 2000. The United States is ranked as the second most susceptible nation to deepfake adult content, with concerns rising ahead of the presidential elections. Other countries, such as China, Japan, the UK, and South Korea, have taken steps to regulate or criminalize deepfakes. Tech companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft are also developing tools to detect AI-generated content.

Scientists at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) have developed "green crackers" as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional firecrackers. These green crackers emit about 30% less pollution and do not contain barium compounds, which are known to pollute the air and cause noise. There are three types of green firecrackers: safe water releaser, safe thermite cracker, and safe minimal aluminium cracker. Green crackers are also cheaper and make less noise than conventional firecrackers. They can be recognized by a QR code and green logo indicating certification from NEERI.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly hinted at the possibility of Israel occupying Gaza in an interview with ABC News. He stated that Israel would have an indefinite security responsibility for Gaza, as they have witnessed the eruption of Hamas terror when they haven't had that responsibility. Netanyahu also rejected calls for a ceasefire without the release of over 200 hostages taken by Hamas.

In terms of the West Bank, it is a parcel of land east of Israel that borders Jerusalem. Israel captured the West Bank during the 1967 war and has since built settlements there, which are considered illegal by the United Nations and much of the international community. The West Bank is home to millions of Palestinians who view it as their spiritual home and the capital of a Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank, while Israeli settlers argue that the settlements enhance Israel's national security.

The article raises questions about what will happen in Gaza once Israel gains complete control. Experts suggest that this remains uncertain, and replacing Hamas with another governing body poses challenges. The leaked plan from the Israeli government mentioned options such as handing over control to the Palestinian Authority or establishing a local regime. However, these options were discarded due to their inability to deter further attacks. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has indicated that assuming power in Gaza would require a comprehensive political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

It is yet to be seen if Netanyahu will pursue a similar settlement policy in Gaza as he has in the West Bank. The article concludes by mentioning the potential cessation of relief operations in the Gaza Strip by the UNRWA due to the lack of fuel supplies, putting thousands at risk. Additionally, there is scrutiny on Netanyahu's role in the intelligence failure preceding the Hamas attack, which resulted in significant casualties in Israel.

The air quality in Delhi, India continues to be poor, causing respiratory problems among the residents. To address this issue, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has been working on a technique to induce artificial rains and reduce pollutants and dust in the city. The institute successfully carried out a test for producing artificial rain through cloud seeding and has obtained the necessary permissions from government authorities. Artificial rain can provide relief from air pollution for up to a week, but specific meteorological conditions are required for the process to work. IIT Kanpur needs permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and Special Protection Group (SPG) to fly an aircraft over the National Capital. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique that involves adding chemicals to clouds to increase precipitation, either by causing ice crystals to grow or by making particles larger to fall faster. It has been used for various purposes, such as mitigating droughts, hail damage, forest fires, and improving air quality. However, the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still debated among scientists. In addition to these efforts, the Delhi government plans to implement an odd-even scheme for private vehicles between November 13 and 20, where vehicles with odd registration numbers will be allowed on odd dates and vice versa. The Supreme Court has also directed states neighboring Delhi to take immediate measures to halt stubble burning by farmers, which contributes to the worsening air quality.

China has been cracking down on a cyber scam known as "pig butchering," which involves con artists luring victims into fake romantic relationships and then convincing them to invest in fraudulent bitcoin schemes. These scams are operated by strong Chinese syndicates based in Southeast Asia, particularly Myanmar. The scams can be lengthy, with the con artists courting their victims for months before convincing them to make large investments. Many of these con artists are also victims of human trafficking, having been tricked into false job ads and imprisoned in prison-like complexes. Investment fraud is the fastest-growing scam globally, with Chinese citizens losing billions of dollars each year. In response, Chinese authorities have conducted mass arrests and launched joint operations with neighboring countries to catch suspects. Despite these efforts, experts warn that these criminal groups will continue to exploit vulnerable areas around the world.

The Indian government has launched a new wheat flour scheme called "Bharat Atta" ahead of the Diwali festival. The scheme aims to reduce food inflation and provide reasonably priced wheat flour to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. Bharat Atta is a fortified wheat flour made with a blend of rice, wheat, and pulses. It will be sold through various retail outlets, including Mother Dairy, NAFED, and NCCF, as well as 800 mobile vans and 2,000 outlets run by these agencies. The initiative follows a pilot sale of 18,000 tonnes of wheat flour at Rs 29.50 per kilo, which has now been reduced to combat inflation. India continues to face high cereal inflation, with the rate of cereal inflation still in double digits. The government plans to limit exports of wheat and rice to ensure adequate supply and reasonably priced access for its population of 1.4 billion people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also announced plans to introduce a free food grains program to protect consumers from rising food inflation.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Israel-Hamas war has been ongoing for over a month, with Israel intensifying its airstrikes in Gaza and making advances with tanks and soldiers. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, over 10,000 people have died, including 4,104 children. There are growing calls for Israel to stop, with the Arab world and the United States pressing for a ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has mentioned considering "tactical little pauses" for aid entry or hostage release but rejected a general ceasefire during an interview with ABC News.

A humanitarian pause is a temporary halt in fighting for humanitarian reasons, allowing for the passage of aid or displaced people. It can promote obligations under international humanitarian law, such as evacuating the wounded or facilitating the passage of relief. On the other hand, a ceasefire is a general suspension of hostilities agreed upon by both sides involved in the conflict, often leading to a permanent settlement. In the case of the Israel-Hamas war, a ceasefire would involve the withdrawal of tanks and troops from Gaza and the release of hostages by Hamas.

Several countries, including Russia and major United Nations bodies, have called for a ceasefire in Gaza due to the dire situation. However, the US has rejected these calls, stating that a ceasefire would leave Hamas in place to regroup and repeat attacks. Instead, the US supports humanitarian pauses to protect civilians, deliver aid, and enable the defeat of Hamas. The UK and the European Union have also not backed a ceasefire, focusing on advocating for humanitarian pauses.

Netanyahu has consistently refused a ceasefire until Hamas releases its captives in Gaza. He expressed willingness to consider humanitarian pauses for aid and hostage movements but ruled out a general ceasefire.

Overall, the article discusses the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the difference between humanitarian pauses and ceasefires, and the positions of various countries regarding a cessation of hostilities.

The recent Israeli-Hamas conflict has had a devastating impact on the employment situation in Gaza, with over 60% of jobs lost since the conflict began. This amounts to a total of 182,000 jobs lost in the small Palestinian territory. The occupied West Bank has also lost an estimated 24% of its employment, or 208,000 jobs, as a result of the war's spillover effects. The International Labour Organisation warns that if the conflict continues, the repercussions on the Palestinian labour market will worsen and reverberate for many years to come. In addition to job losses, rising poverty is a major concern in Gaza, where more than 80% of the population already lives below the poverty level. The UN agency estimates that job losses in Gaza and the West Bank result in a daily income loss of $16 million. The economic future for Gaza was already bleak before the war, and the recent fighting has only worsened the situation. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts a short but steep recession followed by a hesitant rebound and a return to normal economic performance by 2025.

### [Is Delhi’s odd-even scheme to battle air pollution even effective?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/delhi-odd-even-car-scheme-air-pollution-effective-13357202.html)

The article discusses the implementation of the odd-even rule in Delhi as a measure to combat air pollution. The rule allows cars with either odd or even number plates to ply on alternate days. The scheme was first introduced in Delhi in 2016 and is applied only to private vehicles, with some exemptions for certain categories. While reducing the number of vehicles can help reduce pollution levels, experts have differing opinions on the effectiveness of the scheme. Some studies have shown a reduction in particulate matter levels, while others argue that the scheme has been ineffective due to people changing their travel schedules and increased exempted vehicle activity. The severity of air pollution in Delhi has led to the implementation of various measures, including the odd-even scheme, but a long-term holistic approach is needed. Doctors have reported an increase in respiratory problems among residents, highlighting the need for immediate action.

### [Want to boost productivity? Try getting angry at work](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/anger-boost-productivity-study-workplace-motivator-goals-13355892.html)

A new study has found that anger can actually be a powerful motivator for productivity and meeting goals. The American Psychological Association conducted a survey of over 1,000 people and found that anger usually evoked the best performance compared to other emotions. The study also examined surveys from the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections and found that people who said they would be angry if their preferred candidate lost were more likely to vote. Experts say that the findings are important, especially for women in the workplace who are often conditioned to believe they cannot be "emotional." The study suggests that anger and frustration with the status quo can be tools for innovation and creativity. However, it is important to note that excess anger can be detrimental to cognitive functioning. Overall, the study adds to the growing evidence that a mix of positive and negative emotions promotes well-being, and using negative emotions as tools can be effective in certain situations.

A deepfake video featuring actor Rashmika Mandanna has gone viral on social media, prompting concerns about the spread of misinformation and the role of AI. The video, which was doctored to replace the face of another individual with Mandanna's, has garnered strong reactions from Mandanna herself, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, and superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Chandrasekhar reminded social media platforms of their legal obligations to combat misinformation, while Bachchan called for strong legal action against deepfakes. Deepfakes are realistic but fake images, voices, or videos created using AI and deep learning algorithms. They have been a growing concern, with numerous instances involving celebrities going viral in the past. Deepfake fraud is when scamsters use AI to duplicate the sound or faces of an intended victim's friends or family to manipulate them into transferring money. Indians, in particular, are falling victim to deepfake scams, with many unable to distinguish between real and AI voices. To protect oneself from such scams, establishing a codeword with close friends and family, being cautious of unknown calls, and verifying information through alternative means are recommended.

India is in the process of formulating its National Security Strategy (NSS) after years of discussion and no progress. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) has started collecting inputs from various ministries and departments to draft the strategy, which will then be presented to the Cabinet for approval. The NSS will outline India's security objectives, identify internal and external challenges, and provide guidance on how to achieve national goals. It will address traditional and non-traditional challenges such as economic security, information warfare, and environmental concerns. The need for an NSS has been emphasized by military and strategic circles, who believe it will provide a comprehensive framework for addressing security-related matters and guide defense reforms. However, there have been hesitations in releasing an NSS document due to concerns about revealing India's stance to potential adversaries. Countries like the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, and Pakistan have already formulated their own national security strategies.

### [Discrimination is Bad for Business: How it destroys motivation at work](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/discrimination-is-bad-for-business-how-it-destroys-motivation-at-work-13331092.html)

A new study published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour suggests that workplace discrimination can lead to reduced effort and productivity among employees. The study involved nearly 1,200 participants who were placed in experiments designed to mimic work settings. Participants were told that their manager would award a bonus based on their performance, and some were informed that there were two types of employees: blue and red. One-third of the participants were told that the manager had a bias against blue employees, another third were told the manager was biased in their favor, and the rest received no information about bias. The study found that participants who knew their managers discriminated against them or favored them completed fewer tasks than those in the control group. The researchers also found that discrimination can worsen over time, with disadvantaged workers showing the largest decline in effort. Additionally, the study showed that discrimination can lead to behavior by employees that strengthens negative stereotypes or spreads discriminatory stereotypes to new managers. The findings suggest that workplace discrimination can have negative effects on productivity and may hurt firms' bottom lines more than previously assumed. Future research is needed to understand how bias operates in different contexts, such as race, gender, sexuality, or parental status.

A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck a remote region in northwestern Nepal, resulting in at least 128 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The death toll is expected to rise as communication has been cut off in many areas. Nepal is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the boundary of two tectonic plates, the Asian and Indo-Australian plates. The collision of these plates created the Himalayan Mountains and causes frequent earthquakes. Nepal's flimsy buildings and growing population contribute to the vulnerability of the country. Some of the deadliest earthquakes in Nepal's history include a 8.2 magnitude earthquake in 1934 that killed over 10,000 people and a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 that killed around 9,000 people.

### [What are the huge mysterious blobs near Earth’s core?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-are-the-huge-mysterious-blobs-near-earths-core-13342672.html)

A new study suggests that the two continent-sized blobs of strange material discovered deep near the Earth's center in the 1980s may be the remains of a prototype planet that had a massive influence on Earth billions of years ago. These blobs, known as Large Velocity Provinces (LLVPs), have a higher density than the surrounding areas and are estimated to be slightly denser than the surrounding mantle rock. The theory proposes that the blobs were formed by a severe collision between the early Earth and a smaller planet called Theia, which also resulted in the formation of the moon. However, scientists are still looking for evidence to support this theory and suggest that studying moon rocks could provide further insights.

The price of olive oil has seen a significant increase, with prices rising by about 75% since January 2021. This rise in price is due to factors such as drought and harsh weather damaging olive crops in major producing countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal. As a result, the cost of olive oil has reached record levels, making it more expensive for consumers. In addition to olive oil, potato prices have also seen a staggering rise. These increases in food prices have put a burden on poorer families who are struggling to keep up with inflation. The European Trade Union Confederation has noted that wages are failing to keep up with the rising costs of basic food items, forcing more people to rely on food banks. Despite falling annual inflation rates, food inflation remains high at 7.5%. The olive oil sector is facing its own challenges, including drought, higher temperatures affecting flowering, and inflation affecting fertilizer prices. The shortage of supply is impacting markets and households globally, including India where the cost of imported olive oil has increased by 22%. Consumers in India are reconsidering their choices and opting for alternative cooking oils due to the surging costs of olive oil. The high prices are expected to continue until at least June 2024.

Japan ranked lowest for employees' well-being in a recent global survey, while Turkey topped the list. The survey, conducted by the McKinsey Health Institute, evaluated workers' physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being. Japanese respondents reported low scores in all categories, with 30% reporting social health, 74% reporting physical health, 24% reporting spiritual health, and 42% reporting mental health. The report suggests that Japan's high levels of stress and lack of workplace satisfaction contribute to its low ranking. India ranked second in the survey but reported high rates of burnout symptoms. Over 50% of workers worldwide exhibit signs of burnout, which increases their likelihood of quitting their jobs. The survey also found that demands at work, such as dealing with toxic behaviors or role ambiguity, are more predictive of burnout symptoms than enablers. Employers are encouraged to prioritize their employees' overall health to improve workforce performance and work-life balance.

The air quality in Delhi and its surrounding areas has reached the "severe plus" category, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency. The current PM2.5 concentration in New Delhi is 23.3 times above the recommended limit by the WHO. The air quality is expected to worsen in the next two weeks due to an increase in stubble burning and unfavorable weather patterns. Emergency measures have been announced, including a ban on construction and polluting vehicles. The air quality index (AQI) in various areas of Delhi and NCR has reached alarming levels, with some areas recording over 500 AQI. The spike in farm fires and poor weather conditions have contributed to the smoky haze enveloping the region.

A powerful jet stream over the Atlantic is causing planes to travel faster from the United States to Europe. Jet streams are bands of strong wind that influence weather, air travel, and the atmosphere. They are created when warm and cold air masses collide, creating an air current. Jet streams can reach speeds of up to 442 kilometers per hour. When an airplane flies in the same direction as a jet stream, it gets an extra push and travels faster. Airlines have been using jet streams to reduce flight times, with some flights arriving at their destinations earlier than expected. However, jet streams can also cause turbulence and require extensive planning for arrival times. The current jet stream over the Atlantic is expected to strengthen a potential storm called Storm Ciaran.

### [How ‘white hydrogen’ deposits found in France could save Earth](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-white-hydrogen-deposits-found-in-france-could-save-earth-13327552.html)

Scientists have discovered a large supply of hydrogen, known as "white hydrogen," in northeastern France. White hydrogen is a greener energy source than solar or wind power, as it only produces water when burned. It can be used as a substitute for steel, shipping, and aviation. The discovery was made when methane concentrations in the earth's crust were being evaluated, and hydrogen concentrations increased as scientists dug deeper. This discovery is significant because it shows that large amounts of hydrogen can naturally occur without requiring energy-consuming procedures. White hydrogen is predicted to be more affordable than green hydrogen, costing around one US dollar per kilogramme. It has the potential to help combat the climate crisis and transform the clean energy market. Organizations are currently drilling to find hydrogen resources, and startups are exploring the possibility of selling white hydrogen.

### [How a simple blood test could help diagnose bipolar disorder](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-a-simple-blood-test-could-help-diagnose-bipolar-disorder-13323932.html)

Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK have developed a blood test that, when combined with a digital mental health assessment, can provide an improved diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The blood test alone can diagnose up to 30% of patients with bipolar disorder, but it is even more effective when used in conjunction with the online assessment. This combination can help differentiate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, which have similar symptoms but require different treatments. The blood test is still in the proof of concept stage, but it has the potential to be a valuable complement to existing psychiatric diagnosis methods. Up to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder, and the blood test could help ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment. The research team used samples and data from the delta study, conducted in the UK between 2018 and 2020, to identify bipolar disorder in patients previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The blood test and online assessment combination significantly improved diagnostic outcomes for people with bipolar disorder, especially in cases where the diagnosis was not obvious.

Stubble burning in Punjab has been listed as one of the biggest contributors to pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, there has been a decrease in stubble burning incidents in Haryana this year. Data from NASA shows that farm fires have been at a low level this year, possibly due to a delayed burning season and excess rainfall. The air quality situation in Delhi is monitored by NASA, and it deteriorates every year during late October and November.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs in India has warned domestic airlines and online travel aggregators for engaging in "unfair" trade practices. The ministry highlighted issues such as misleading claims of "free mandatory web check-in" and not allowing customers to board with confirmed tickets. A survey found that 47% of respondents had to pay for a seat of their choice in the last year, and 51% did not get any free seat and were charged an additional fee for seat allocation. The ministry has called for a meeting with CEOs of airlines and travel portals to address these concerns. Airlines in India charge passengers for seat selection, with fees ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 1,000 depending on the location of the seat. In 2013, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation allowed airlines to charge consumers for extra services, including preferential seats, but this norm was struck down in 2015. Last March, a Parliamentary panel criticized airlines for charging different fares for seat allocation and asked the government to monitor fare pricing. Despite an increase in consumer complaints, the Indian government does not intend to intervene in the pricing mechanism of airlines.

Israel has reportedly agreed to delay its planned invasion of Gaza in order to allow the United States to deploy missile defenses to protect US troops in the region. Both Israel and the Biden administration are focused on trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The US is rushing nearly a dozen air-defense systems to the area, and has also advised Israel to hold off on a ground assault as it works to free more hostages and prepare for a potential wider conflict. Israel is taking into account the need for humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages. The threat to US troops is a top concern, as they are expected to be targeted by militant groups once an invasion begins. Israeli officials acknowledge that some hostages may have already been killed in retaliatory air raids, and they believe a solution for the hostages will become practically impossible once a ground invasion takes place. Egypt has been urged to pressure Hamas to release all detained women and children if they want to reach a solution. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas in response to the recent attack on civilians by militants. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has warned Hamas, stating that modern Jews have different capabilities than in the past.

Russia has passed legislation to withdraw from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a landmark accord that prohibits nuclear weapons tests. The CTBT, agreed upon in 1996, aims to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons by banning any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion worldwide. Currently, 187 states have signed the treaty, with 178 ratifying it in their parliaments. Of the nine countries with nuclear weapons, Britain and France have both signed and ratified the treaty, while the United States, Israel, and China have signed but not ratified it. Russia had previously signed and ratified the treaty but is now withdrawing its ratification. The treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests, with no country conducting such a test since the 1990s except for North Korea. The treaty also established a global network of observation posts to detect signs of nuclear explosions. While Russia claims it does not plan to conduct a test unless the US does so first, some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now. A resumption of nuclear testing could prompt other countries to follow suit and potentially lead to a new arms race.

### [Why is Israel attacking south Gaza after ordering civilians to go there?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-is-israel-attacking-south-gaza-after-ordering-civilians-to-go-there-13297702.html)

Israel has intensified its bombing campaign in southern Gaza, causing fear among the Palestinians who had evacuated there. The Israeli military claims that Hamas has entrenched itself among the civilian population, making it difficult to avoid civilian casualties. Since October 7th, over 6,500 Palestinians have died as a result of Israeli strikes. Israel ordered the evacuation of Gazans to the south in order to move civilians away from Hamas targets concentrated in the north. However, many Palestinians feel betrayed and angry as they are still being targeted in the south. The international community has called for a pause in the fighting to allow for humanitarian aid and the opening of humanitarian corridors.

### [Meta sued in the US: How Instagram is particularly harmful to adolescents](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/meta-sued-in-the-us-how-instagram-is-particularly-harmful-to-adolescents-13296072.html)

A recent article discusses the impact of social media, particularly Instagram, on teenagers. The article highlights a lawsuit filed against Meta (formerly Facebook) by 41 states and the District of Columbia, alleging that the company intentionally designed Facebook and Instagram with features that harm teens and young users. Internal research from Meta in March 2020 showed that Instagram is harmful to teen girls' body image and well-being, but the company ignored these findings. Numerous studies have shown that the more often teens use Instagram, the worse their overall well-being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, mood, and body image. Two key features of Instagram make it particularly risky for teens: the ability to follow celebrities and peers who present unrealistic body images and curated impressions of a perfect life, and the emphasis on pictures of the body, leading users to focus on how they look to others. These factors contribute to negative social comparisons, envy, lowered self-esteem, and increased body dissatisfaction among teens. Body dissatisfaction during the teen years is a predictor of later eating disorder symptoms. The article suggests that parents can help by talking to their teens about appearance versus reality, encouraging face-to-face interactions with peers, and promoting active engagement with their bodies instead of focusing on selfies. The article raises concerns about how Meta will handle these damaging results and compares their approach to Big Tobacco's denial of the harmful effects of its products.

Experts are concerned that thousands of penguins and seals in Antarctica could be wiped out by a deadly variant of bird flu known as avian flu. British scientists discovered the virus in brown skuas, a scavenger bird, on Bird Island, part of the British overseas possession of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The virus is believed to have been brought to Antarctica by birds migrating from South America, where it has already caused significant deaths among seabirds and sea lions. The H5N1 strain of avian flu is highly pathogenic and causes significant mortality in poultry. While the virus is difficult to spread from animals to humans, there are concerns that if a person with the flu contracts this bird flu, it could lead to serious consequences. Researchers fear that the disease could result in catastrophic breeding failure and have a devastating impact on many wildlife species in Antarctica. Ongoing disease surveillance programs are recommended to identify new and emerging pathogens.

Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly in Miami, Florida while Israel is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza. Yair's absence has caused anger among reservists who are serving on the front lines. Yair, who is currently eligible for reserve duty in Israel, has been photographed enjoying the beaches and sunshine in Miami. He hosts a right-wing podcast in Florida and has a history of posting incendiary messages on social media. In August, he was ordered to pay compensation to a woman he defamed on social media. Yair has also been involved in several defamation cases and has been temporarily banned from Facebook for hate speech.

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening as Israel continues its attacks on the region, and a United Nations agency may be forced to stop aid operations due to a shortage of fuel. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) currently provides aid to 600,000 displaced Gazans and has called for a humanitarian "pause" in fighting. Hospitals are on the verge of shutting down due to the lack of fuel supplies, and the healthcare system is at its worst stage in history. The World Health Organization warns that patients dependent on dialysis and premature babies are at risk of dying without a stable supply of electricity. Israel has ruled out allowing fuel into Gaza, claiming that Hamas would use it for its operational infrastructure and rocket attacks. Israel suggests that the UN ask Hamas for fuel supplies, as they claim Hamas has stored fuel in advance. Israel is also in a diplomatic row with the UN after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made comments about the attack by Hamas on Israel not happening in a vacuum. Israel has asked Guterres to resign and plans to deny visas to UN officials.

Hezbollah, a significant force in Lebanon with political and military power, has been trading fire with Israel along the Israel-Lebanon border since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began its attacks on the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah has been supporting Hamas in the conflict and has expressed its readiness to take action. The group has a history of tense relations with Israel and is committed to its destruction. Experts fear that Hezbollah's involvement in the Israel-Hamas war could escalate the conflict and destabilize the region.

Scammers are taking advantage of the Israel-Hamas war by sending deceptive emails and creating fraudulent websites to solicit donations. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has identified over 500 scam emails and fake websites that exploit people's willingness to help those affected by the conflict. The scammers pose as charitable organizations and use emotive language to entice people to click on a fake website link and make donations. They even offer options like using cryptocurrencies for transactions. Additionally, there are suspicious accounts on social media platforms asking for donations, but these are likely scams as well. To avoid getting scammed, it is important to thoroughly scrutinize donation pages, check the legitimacy of charitable organizations, and cross-check names to avoid mistaken identity.

The FATF is a global watchdog that combats money laundering and terror financing. India has accused Canada of providing safe space to terrorists despite sharing evidence. The FATF conducts regular evaluations of countries' performance on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, and countries that do not meet the standards can be placed on the grey or black lists. India may present evidence of terror funding and financing emanating from Canada to the FATF. The India-Canada diplomatic row has escalated, with Canada withdrawing 41 diplomats from India and India suspending visa services to Canadians.

However, police investigation revealed the truth, and they discovered evidence on Mohite's phone and in his car that pointed to his guilt. The motive behind the murders was Mohite's resentment towards his sisters and his desire to take control of his father's property. He has been taken into custody.

### [Why melting of West Antarctic ice shelves cannot be avoided despite carbon emissions cuts](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-melting-of-west-antarctic-ice-shelves-cannot-be-avoided-despite-carbon-emissions-cuts-13291192.html)

A new study suggests that regardless of efforts to reduce emissions, a significant portion of Antarctica will be lost in the future. The research indicates that the rate at which the warming Southern Ocean melts the West Antarctic ice sheet will accelerate over the course of this century, leading to increased sea-level rise and potential consequences for coastal communities worldwide. The study used a regional ocean model to predict ice-shelf melting in the Amundsen Sea, the most vulnerable sector of the ice sheet. The results show a rapid increase in ocean warming and ice-shelf melting, even under the best-case scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5°C. The findings suggest that rapid ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea is now inevitable until at least 2100, regardless of international policies on fossil fuels. Melting ice shelves contribute significantly to sea-level rise, and while it is difficult to determine exact figures without considering other factors such as glacier flow and snow accumulation, increased ice-shelf melting is expected to accelerate sea-level rise. The West Antarctic ice sheet is already losing about 80 billion tonnes of ice per year and has enough ice to cause up to 5 meters of sea-level rise. However, there is still hope for the longer term, as simulations show that under the 1.5°C scenario, ice-shelf melting may start to plateau by the end of the century, suggesting that further changes in the 22nd century could still be preventable. The article emphasizes the need for courage and adaptation in facing climate change and protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels.

### [Are tensions between Netanyahu and military delaying Israel's invasion?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/are-tensions-between-netanyahu-and-military-delaying-israels-ground-invasion-13292532.html)

Israel has not yet launched a ground invasion on Gaza, despite announcing its urgency. The reasons for the delay include talks on the release of hostages held by Hamas, international pressure, and political-military differences. The Biden administration is urging Israel to postpone a ground conflict in Gaza and is sending military assets to express support for Israel and prevent others from joining the conflict. Hamas has held over 200 captives since attacking Israel on October 7th. Israeli authorities believe that a deal for hostages will be impossible once a ground invasion occurs. There are tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF (army), with disagreements and accusations of failing to prevent the attack by Hamas militants. The presence of US military personnel in Israel aims to prevent any move that could endanger the hostages, including Americans. International leaders are urging caution and fear that a ground operation could escalate the conflict and involve other countries like Iran-backed Hezbollah.

Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85-year-old Israeli grandmother, was held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza. After being released, she shared her abduction ordeal and shed light on the treatment of captives by Hamas. Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released after being held captive for 16 days. Lifshitz described being beaten during the journey into Gaza and being tied to a motorcycle. Once in captivity, she and the other hostages were provided with mattresses, food, access to medical care, and were treated well overall. Lifshitz praised the militants for their treatment, stating that they took care of their needs and were concerned about hygiene. She also criticized the Israeli government for security lapses. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are gathering intelligence from Lifshitz's account as they prepare to respond to the Hamas attack. The decision to put Lifshitz in front of the cameras has received criticism, with some viewing it as a propaganda win for Hamas. Hamas claims to have over 200 hostages, and the release of Lifshitz and Cooper follows the release of two Israeli-American women. The US has reportedly asked Israel to delay its ground invasion to facilitate the release of more hostages.

The Israeli army is urging residents of the Gaza Strip to provide information about hostages held by Hamas in exchange for financial rewards. The army dropped leaflets containing the message from aircraft during airstrikes. The leaflets also provided contact information for sending information about the hostages. So far, four female hostages have been released through negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Israeli military is using various methods, including surveillance and interrogating captured Hamas militants, to determine the whereabouts of the captives. Israel is preparing for a potential ground invasion to free the hostages and eliminate Hamas. The exact location of the hostages is unknown, and it's unclear whether they are all held by Hamas or other extremist groups. The presence of dual nationals among the hostages further complicates the situation. Over 220 people were kidnapped by Hamas militants during an attack on southern Israel in early October.

China and Bhutan have pledged to resolve their boundary dispute, which could have implications for India. The dispute between China and Bhutan dates back to 1950 when China occupied Tibet and refused to recognize the dividing line between Tibet and Bhutan. The two countries have been engaged in boundary talks since 1984, focusing on three disputed areas. In 2017, India and China had a standoff over the Doklam plateau, which is considered an undisputed territory of Bhutan by India. The region holds great security importance for India as it threatens the Siliguri Corridor, a vital stretch connecting the Indian mainland to the Northeast. There are concerns in New Delhi that a deal between Bhutan and China could involve swapping Doklam for disputed territories in the north. India believes that China's claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is a way to pressure Bhutan into handing over Doklam. Tensions remain high between India and China over the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with no agreement reached on troop disengagement at key friction points. Resolving the dispute over Doklam is linked to the conflict on China and India's shared border, particularly regarding Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as an extension of South Tibet.

A bot network linked to China has been accused of launching a "spamouflage" misinformation campaign targeting Canadian lawmakers. The network used thousands of messages on social media accounts to accuse members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, of criminal and ethical infractions. The campaign involved the dissemination of propaganda across various platforms, combining spam-like content with more ordinary, human-interest style posts. The bot network also circulated misinformation about other events, such as the Hawaiian wildfires and Japan's Fukushima water release. The goal of the campaign was to discredit and denigrate targeted MPs and silence criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. China has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and called the accusations a "blatant smear campaign." Canada has expressed concern that the campaign could discourage MPs from carrying out their duties and speaking out on important issues.

The Israeli military conducted airstrikes on two Hezbollah cells in Lebanon that were preparing to launch rockets and anti-tank missiles against Israel. As tensions between Israel and Hamas continue to escalate, there is a risk that Lebanon, already on the brink of economic and political collapse, could be drawn into the conflict. Hezbollah has been preparing to join the fight since Hamas launched a surprise assault, resulting in increased attacks by the Shiite militant group. Israel is evacuating residents along the border with Lebanon in anticipation of a ground invasion of Gaza, and Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate if Israeli forces enter Gaza. The decision of whether Hezbollah fully joins the war will shed light on its priorities: the well-being of Lebanon or acting as a proxy for Iran. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has spilled into Lebanon since 1948, with the displacement of Palestinians leading to tensions and conflict. The rise of Hezbollah, which formed in 1982 with Iranian and Syrian support, has significantly impacted Lebanon's political landscape. Despite the fractured political system and weak state, Lebanon managed to retain some stability until it experienced a severe economic crisis in 2019, followed by the Beirut port explosion in 2020. The political system remains in gridlock, and Hezbollah has emerged as a defender of the current political system. The decision of whether Lebanon enters the war rests with Hezbollah and, by extension, Iran. If Hezbollah joins the war, it could lead to further regional conflict and push Lebanon closer to collapse.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.In Gujarat, at least 10 people have died while participating in Garba, a traditional dance performed during the Navratri celebrations. The victims ranged from teenagers to middle-aged individuals, with the youngest being a 13-year-old boy. The cause of these deaths is believed to be heart attacks, possibly due to pre-existing medical conditions, prolonged fasting, poor eating habits, and a lack of awareness about heart health issues in India. Some experts also speculate that COVID-19 may be a contributing factor, although this has been refuted by former chief minister of Gujarat, Anandiben Patel. Similar incidents have been reported in the past, highlighting the need for individuals to be aware of their health and not push their physical limits during such celebrations. It is important to stay hydrated and take breaks to prevent cardiac strain. COVID-19 has been linked to increased risks of blood clotting, heart failure, and other heart-related issues. An analysis of these deaths is necessary to determine the exact causes and prevent future incidents.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the first test flight for India's Gaganyaan mission on 21 October. The Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) took off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission was initially delayed due to weather conditions and was later halted just seconds before lift-off due to an anomaly detected by the ground support computer. The issue was quickly resolved, and the launch took place at 10 am. The objective of the test flight was to showcase the performance of the crew escape system, and it lasted a total of 532 seconds. The crew module successfully separated from the rocket and descended through parachutes, landing in the Bay of Bengal. This test flight is significant for India's first human spaceflight project as it tests the safety mechanisms for the Gaganyaan crew in case of an emergency. The successful separation of the crew module ensures that astronauts can escape during a mid-flight emergency. The ISRO is prioritizing astronaut safety and is building environmental control and life support systems for the crew module. India aims to send a manned Gaganyaan mission to space by 2025.

The drug is an amphetamine-type stimulant that provides a boost of energy, enhances focus, and produces a feeling of euphoria. It is dubbed "the poor man's cocaine" and has been linked to militants in Iraq and Syria. Captagon has serious side effects, including psychosis and brain damage, and can lead to addiction. Syria has become a major producer and consumer of amphetamines, with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad and his associates profit from the sale of these drugs. Efforts have been made by several West Asian countries to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, but experts warn that smugglers may find new routes and markets, posing a threat to Europe and the rest of the world.
