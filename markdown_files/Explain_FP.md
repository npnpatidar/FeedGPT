### [Who was Aruna Shanbaug mentioned by the Supreme Court during Kolkata rape-murder case hearing?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/supreme-court-kolkata-rape-murder-case-hearing-aruna-shanbaug-euthanasia-13806612.html)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Supreme Court referred to the case of Aruna Shanbaug, a Mumbai nurse who was brutally sexually assaulted and left in a persistent vegetative state for 42 years. 

The attack occurred in 1973 when Shanbaug was  working at KEM Hospital.  The perpetrator, a ward boy, sodomized and strangled her. While convicted, he received a lenient sentence as "sodomy" was not considered rape under Indian law at the time. 

Shanbaug's case sparked a national discussion on euthanasia and violence against women in healthcare settings. A petition seeking legal euthanasia was filed on her behalf, ultimately leading the Supreme Court to legalize passive euthanasia in specific circumstances. Shanbaug sadly passed away in 2015.

In 1973,  Aruna Shanbaug, a 25-year-old nurse, was brutally sexually assaulted by a ward boy at Mumbai's KEM Hospital.  The attack left her in a persistent vegetative state for 42 years until her death in 2015.  Her case sparked a national debate on euthanasia in India.  A petition seeking her legal right to die was filed in the Supreme Court, which ultimately rejected it but paved the way for passive euthanasia in certain cases. Aruna Shanbaug's story highlighted the vulnerability of healthcare workers, particularly women, to violence in the workplace.

### [Why is Switzerland offering Rs 49 lakh to pull ammunition from its lakes?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/switzerland-rs-49-lakh-ammunition-lakes-13806561.html)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Switzerland is tackling the problem of thousands of tonnes of military munitions dumped in its lakes between 1918 and 1964. The Swiss federal office for defence procurement, Armasuisse, has launched a competition offering 50,000 Swiss francs to find safe and environmentally friendly methods to remove the explosives.  The munitions pose risks of explosions and environmental contamination, with some estimations suggesting over 3,300 tonnes in Lake Lucerne alone.  The competition invites ideas from various sectors, with the winning proposals potentially serving as a basis for future research and removal projects.
=======
Switzerland is confronting a significant environmental hazard: thousands of tonnes of old military munitions dumped in its picturesque lakes between 1918 and 1964.  These explosives pose risks of both explosions and environmental contamination from toxic TNT. 

To address this issue, the Swiss government has launched a competition seeking innovative and safe methods for removing the munitions.  The competition, with a prize pool of 50,000 Swiss francs, aims to engage academia and industry in finding solutions for this complex challenge.

Estimates suggest that Lake Lucerne alone holds 3,300 tonnes of munitions, while Lake Neuchatel contains approximately 4,500 tonnes. The depth and weight of the munitions, coupled with visibility issues, add significant complexity to the recovery effort.  Experts believe that international experience from countries like the UK, Norway, and Denmark could be beneficial in tackling this issue.

Donald Trump posted AI-generated images of Taylor Swift endorsing him for the 2024 election. Swift, who previously criticized Trump, has not endorsed any candidate this year.  Legal experts believe Swift could sue Trump for using her likeness without permission, potentially violating her right of publicity.  

The NO FAKES Act and Tennessee's ELVIS Act are two potential legal avenues Swift could explore. While experts agree she likely has a strong case, they question whether the cost and effort of a lawsuit outweigh the potential benefits.

### [Excessive screen time can cause ‘digital dementia’. What is this condition?](https://www.firstpost.com/health/excessive-screen-time-can-cause-digital-dementia-what-is-this-condition-13806465.html)

The term "digital dementia" describes potential cognitive decline linked to excessive technology use. While not an official diagnosis, research suggests a correlation between increased screen time and negative impacts on cognitive function, including memory loss, attention difficulties, and reduced learning capacity. 

Studies highlight the link between excessive screen time and heightened risks of dementia,  especially vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This is potentially due to the constant multitasking and rapid information processing that digital devices demand, overwhelming the brain and disrupting sleep patterns.  
  
Efforts to manage screen time, engage in cognitively stimulating activities, and prioritize real-world interactions can help mitigate these risks and protect cognitive health in the digital age.

Zara has faced backlash for a T-shirt marketed towards young girls that read "the perfect snack" and featured a strawberry with the words "take a bite" and "a burst of sweet delight."  

Critics, including mothers on TikTok, called the design sexually suggestive, particularly due to the slang use of "snack" to describe someone attractive. Zara apologized for the "misunderstanding," removed the shirt from its stores and website, stating there was no intention to imply anything other than the traditional meaning of "snack." This incident is not the first controversy Zara has faced, with past issues including an ad campaign criticized for its resemblance to imagery from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a  "White is the New Black" t-shirt deemed as racially insensitive.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged the move was an attack on social justice and constitutionally disadvantaged groups.  
BJP Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal defended the lateral entry scheme, pointing out that Manmohan Singh was also appointed through a similar process and questioning the opposition's hypocrisy.

Ethiopia is leading Africa's transition to electric vehicles. The country banned gas-powered car imports in 2023 and aims to have 500,000 EVs on the road by 2030.  This initiative is driven by Ethiopia's abundant hydropower and a desire to reduce fuel costs. The government has implemented policies to make EVs more accessible, including reducing import tariffs and supporting local manufacturing. Despite progress, economic challenges and the high cost of EVs pose hurdles to widespread adoption. Expanding charging infrastructure and making EVs more affordable for all income levels are crucial for sustaining this green revolution.

The recent rape and murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata has renewed calls for a central law to protect healthcare professionals in India.  While several states have their own legislation, the absence of a nationwide law has led to a patchwork of inconsistent protections.  

A study by the Indian Medical Association revealed that over 75% of doctors have experienced violence in their workplaces, often perpetrated by patients' relatives. Factors contributing to this violence include underfunding of the public healthcare system, expensive treatment costs, and a lack of trust in the healthcare delivery system. 

Various initiatives, including a proposed central bill and recent directives from the Union health ministry, are aimed at addressing this pressing issue and ensuring safer working conditions for healthcare workers.

Malaysia and India share a significant trade relationship, particularly in palm oil. India is the world's largest importer of palm oil, with Malaysia being the second-largest producer. Palm oil imports from Malaysia constitute a major portion of India's vegetable oil imports. 

Historically, the relationship faced a setback in 2019 due to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's critical remarks on India's policies in Kashmir. This led to India implementing measures to curb Malaysian palm oil imports. 

However, the situation normalized after Mahathir's departure and India resumed purchases.  Both countries are now working together to counter anti-palm oil campaigns and increase cooperation in the palm oil sector.

Mpox, a viral infection formerly known as monkeypox,  has been declared a global health emergency by the WHO due to a surge in cases, especially those caused by a new and potentially more transmissible strain. While there is no vaccine specifically for mpox, existing vaccines against smallpox, such as Jynneos and ACAM2000, offer cross-protection because the viruses share genetic similarities.  

These vaccines have shown about 85% efficacy against mpox, potentially preventing infection or reducing its severity. The WHO and CDC recommend two doses of these vaccines for maximum protection.  While the antiviral drug tecovirimat (TPOXX) is commonly used to treat mpox, recent clinical trials have shown it doesn't accelerate healing for infections with the new strain.

A potential strike looms on Canada's railways as contract negotiations between Teamsters Canada Rail Conference and the major railway companies CN and CPKC have reached an impasse. The union, representing 9,300 workers, accuses the companies of seeking concessions that could compromise worker safety and scheduling.  

CN and CPKC deny these accusations, stating their proposals align with government regulations and maintain the current safety standards. The companies and the union have traded accusations of bad faith bargaining. 

A strike could cripple Canada's freight rail system, impacting supply chains and causing billions of dollars in economic damage, particularly for farmers in the Prairies heading into harvest season.  While the federal government has the power to impose binding arbitration, it has not shown interest in doing so, leaving negotiations as the primary avenue to avert a potential strike.

The alleged rape and murder of a postgraduate doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College has triggered nationwide protests and questions about women's safety under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The victim's parents have accused Banerjee of stifling protests and attempting to "hush up" the case, alleging that their daughter's body was cremated hurriedly.

There are many misconceptions surrounding weight training for children. Research shows that supervised resistance training is safe and does not stunt growth. Concerns about growth plate injuries, often stemming from  impact activities, are unfounded. 

Weight training benefits children's physical fitness, including strength, power, speed, agility and endurance.  It can also positively impact their mental health and academic performance.

Children as young as those ready for sports can benefit from resistance training. Starting light, focusing on proper technique, and gradually increasing weight and intensity is key.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency due to a rapidly spreading virulent strain. 

The virus, typically found in central and west Africa, has now reached 16 countries, with over 15,000 confirmed cases.  

While mpox has existed for a long time, recent genetic changes have increased its severity and transmissibility. The clade I strain, which is more dangerous, is spreading quickly, posing a high threat to vulnerable populations like children and women. 

Unlike previous strains, clade I has no previous exposure to human hosts, making it harder to predict its behavior. There is a shortage of vaccines, highlighting the need for increased testing, public awareness campaigns, and expedited vaccine development to prevent a global pandemic.

### [Why extreme weather in Pakistan has given rise to 'monsoon brides'](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/why-extreme-weather-in-pakistan-has-given-rise-to-monsoon-brides-13805367.html)

Since the 2022 devastating floods in Pakistan, a worrying trend of "monsoon brides" has emerged. Faced with economic hardship and displacement, parents in rural Sindh are marrying off their teenage daughters to older men in exchange for money. This desperate practice has surged in areas severely impacted by the floods, where livelihoods were destroyed and families struggle to survive.

Young girls like Shamila and Najma, married at 14 and 16 respectively, find themselves trapped in arranged marriages, often to men twice their age. While their parents see it as a means to alleviate poverty, the girls are left with little hope for education or a better future. Concern grows that "monsoon brides" will set back years of progress made in combating child marriage in Pakistan.

Tahawwur Rana, a former Pakistani army doctor and key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is eligible for extradition to India. A US appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Rana's habeas corpus petition.  The court found India had provided sufficient evidence to support the probability of Rana's involvement in the attacks which resulted in 166 deaths and over 300 injuries.

Rana helped David Headley, a US citizen and LeT operative, in setting up a fake immigration office in Mumbai to facilitate the attacks. He also allegedly provided financial aid and logistical support to Headley.  


Although Rana has been convicted in the US for a separate conspiracy to attack a Danish newspaper, the recent ruling paves the way for his extradition to India to face charges related to the Mumbai attacks. 

Rana retains the option to appeal the decision though.

Child marriage remains a prevalent issue in the United States, with over 300,000 cases recorded since 2000. Despite global efforts to eradicate this harmful practice, 37 states still allow it under certain conditions, such as parental consent or judicial approval.  

This legal inconsistency allows child marriage to persist, particularly impacting young girls who marry adult men, leaving them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.  The lack of comprehensive federal legislation sets a minimum age for marriage, allowing loopholes that endanger minors. 

While thirteen states have banned child marriage outright, advocates argue for a nationwide ban without exceptions to ensure the safety and well-being of all minors. Child marriage has detrimental consequences, including increased risk of poverty, school dropout, and limited opportunities. Ending this practice is crucial for protecting the rights and future of children in the US.

### [Where did the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs come from? We have the answer](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/asteroid-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs-66-years-ago-13805321.html)

A new study published in the journal 'Science' sheds light on the origin of the asteroid that caused the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Researchers analyzed sediment samples and found high levels of ruthenium isotopes, a rare element on Earth but common on asteroids.  

The isotope analysis revealed that the asteroid was a C-type, originating from beyond Jupiter's orbit, confirming earlier hypotheses with greater certainty. This finding is significant because most meteorites recovered on Earth are S-types,  originating closer to the sun.  The study also refutes the theory that the impactor was a comet. 


The research highlights the importance of understanding asteroid origins for assessing future threats and for learning about the history of water on Earth.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global health emergency due to a concerning surge in cases, primarily in Africa.  

Mpox, a viral disease related to smallpox, causes symptoms like fever, headache, and a characteristic rash. It spreads through close contact with infected animals or individuals and can be fatal in rare cases. 

A new and more transmissible variant, clade Ib, is driving the current outbreak, particularly affecting children in displacement camps. While cases outside Africa have been rare, a recent case in Sweden and others in Pakistan signal potential for wider spread. 

The WHO is urging international cooperation and funding to contain the outbreak and prevent further global transmission. Two years ago, the WHO declared mpox a global emergency during a similar outbreak. That outbreak was controlled through vaccination and behavioral changes, but the new variant poses a different challenge.

He aimed to create a more direct connection with the people, despite concerns raised by security officials and intelligence agencies. Additional security measures were implemented to mitigate the risks, including heightened surveillance and the deployment of snipers.

Karunanidhi wrote to then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,  leading to a change in practice where Governors unfurl the flag on Republic Day, and Chief Ministers on Independence Day.  This move marked a significant step in recognizing the authority and role of democratically elected state leaders.

The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr has heightened tensions between Iran and Israel. Although Iran has vowed revenge, a delayed response suggests a calculated strategy.  Internal deliberation within Iran's new government, balancing strength with diplomacy and economic interests, likely contributes to the restraint. 

Additionally, Iranian officials are mindful of the risks associated with a hasty military action, potentially escalating the conflict into a broader war. 

Iran's response could involve its network of proxy forces, potentially mirroring the missile and drone strikes launched in April in response to an Israeli embassy attack.  

The international community, particularly the US, monitors the situation closely, urging de-escalation while bolstering its military presence in the region.  Ceasefire efforts and diplomatic avenues remain, but the threat of a swift escalation persists.

Renewed ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to begin, aiming to end the 10-month conflict and secure the release of 110 hostages.  Despite an initial proposal by the US, key issues remain unresolved.

Israel is concerned about Hamas' potential to prolong negotiations indefinitely, while Hamas fears a renewed Israeli offensive after the release of vulnerable hostages.

The killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, blamed on Israel, and a subsequent strike on Hezbollah have heightened regional tensions, diverting attention from the ceasefire efforts.  Both Netanyahu and Hamas' new leader, Yahya Sinwar, face political pressures that may incentivize them to prolong the war.

Following her resignation and fleeing to India, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued a statement urging the nation to observe August 15 as 'National Mourning Day' to commemorate the assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  This call comes shortly after the interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, decided to cancel the national holiday.

The move is also seen as an attempt to appease various political parties, with some supporting the cancellation and others advocating for the holiday to be retained.

### [Explained: Why are multinational corporations fleeing Pakistan?](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/explained-why-are-multinational-corporations-fleeing-pakistan-13804087.html)

Pakistan is experiencing a decline in multinational corporations (MNCs) due to several factors.

Companies like TotalEnergies, Telenor, and Shell Oil have exited the market, citing regulatory instability, economic challenges, and political turmoil. 

High taxation, complex regulations, and limited profit repatriation have deterred investment. Political instability and ineffective governance have further worsened the situation, leading to a loss of confidence in Pakistan's business environment.

Experts urge Pakistan to implement reforms to create a stable and transparent business climate to attract new investment and reverse the trend of MNC departures.

With heightened tensions in the Middle East, Iran is preparing a response to the recent assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh. While the exact timing and scale of the attack remain unclear, experts believe Iran will likely launch a missile and drone assault, similar to the one in April that was largely neutralized by Israel's defense systems. 

Experts suggest Iran's response will be calculated to avoid escalating into a full-scale war, potentially coordinating with Hezbollah. Despite reassurances from Iran that its actions won't jeopardize the Gaza ceasefire, Israel remains on high alert, vowing to inflict a heavy price on any aggressor. International efforts are underway to de-escalate the situation and prevent a wider regional conflict.

The success of the Paris 2024 Olympics provided French President Emmanuel Macron with a brief political reprieve.  However, the aftermath of the Games presents significant challenges.   

Macron faces the task of appointing a prime minister who can navigate a fractured parliament resulting from the recent legislative elections. This appointment is crucial as France must present a budget plan to meet the European Commission's deficit reduction demands by September 20.  The need for consensus-building in a divided parliament complicates this task.  


Despite the Olympic triumph, deep-seated political issues and Macron's low approval ratings persist. 
The coming months will be crucial for Macron as he attempts to address these challenges and secure his political future.

Lt General Faiz Hameed, former chief of Pakistan's ISI, has been arrested and faces court martial proceedings. This unprecedented move stems from allegations of misconduct related to a housing scheme scandal known as the Top City case. Hameed is accused of extorting money from a housing development company owner and violating army regulations after his retirement. 

The army's action is seen as a crackdown on allies of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, with whom Hameed had close ties. The arrest is viewed as a warning to both serving and retired military personnel against challenging army authority. It also sends a message to the public, amidst growing anti-army sentiment, that the military will hold its members accountable.

Elon Musk announced that a major DDoS attack targeted X, preventing his scheduled interview with former US President Donald Trump from airing on time. While Musk mentioned the possibility of a limited live audience and a later online posting, the attack significantly disrupted the event. DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a target's systems with traffic, rendering them inaccessible to legitimate users.

During a highly publicized interview on X, former President Donald Trump made numerous claims about various topics that, upon closer inspection, proved to be inaccurate or misleading. He exaggerated border crossing numbers, misrepresented VP Kamala Harris's role regarding immigration, and provided false figures about inflation and  impending sea-level rise. 

Trump also presented a skewed view of his economic record, unsupported claims about China's role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and made incorrect statements about the number of countries possessing nuclear weapons. He persisted in his false assertion that the 2020 election was rigged and inaccurately claimed that European nations were not contributing their fair share to Ukraine's aid.  The interview highlighted a pattern of unsubstantiated assertions and mischaracterizations of facts.

During his two-hour interview with Elon Musk on X, Donald Trump's voice drew significant attention. Many viewers commented on a noticeable lisp, leading to speculation about the former president's health. The incident reignited concerns about Trump's fitness for office at age 78, coinciding with polls that suggest a growing number of Americans believe he's too old to serve. While Trump's campaign dismissed the concerns, questions remain about his health status given a lack of transparency regarding his medical records and condition updates.

The much-anticipated conversation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk,  intended for independent voters,  was delayed due to technical issues attributed to a cyber attack.  

The dialogue, while friendly,  provided little insight into Trump's plans for a potential second term. Notable points include Trump's  suggestion that Musk could join his administration, his proposal to disband the Department of Education,  and his praise for leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un.

Trump's speech drew attention for its occasional lisp, sparking comparisons to President Biden's stutter.  The former president also expressed interest in establishing an Iron Dome missile defense system in the US,  modeled after Israel's system.  
 
Trump made a return to X (formerly Twitter) prior to the interview, marking his first posts on the platform in a year.

A massive 30-kilometre wildfire is raging near Athens, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate.  The fire, fueled by Greece's hottest June and July on record, has burned homes and caused power outages in the capital.  Scorching winds hampered firefighting efforts, prompting Greece to seek assistance from other European countries. Although wildfires are common in Greece due to its climate, experts say climate change is exacerbating the situation, making the Mediterranean a hot spot for such disasters. 

Temperatures are expected to remain high, raising concerns about further fires. Greece's vulnerability to climate change, coupled with its geography, makes the country particularly susceptible to the devastating effects of wildfires.

Experts propose adding a fourth colour, white, to traffic lights to accommodate driverless cars. This system would improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency.  While human drivers rely on red, yellow, and green lights, autonomous vehicles would respond to a single white light, acting as an instruction to  continue unless directed otherwise.  Dr. Ali Hajbabaie, an engineering professor at North Carolina State University, conducted simulations suggesting a decrease of over 25% in intersection delays with widespread adoption of driverless cars.  

Though years away from implementation, the idea is gaining traction as artificial intelligence and self-driving technology advance.

The end of the Olympic Games can trigger a sense of emptiness and disorientation in athletes, known as "Olympic comedown." This feeling stems from the abrupt shift from a high-pressure, highly-structured environment back to ordinary life. 

The "high" experienced during the Games, linked to adrenaline release, can lead to a similar feeling of withdrawal as drug use. The intense media attention and public adulation also contribute to the emotional shift.  

Many athletes struggle with finding their identity and purpose after the Games end.  Strategies for coping include accepting the completion of the goal, celebrating achievements, reflecting on the experience, and engaging in pleasurable activities missed during training.

Kamala Harris's distinctive laughter has become a target for Republican attacks, with Donald Trump and his allies attempting to portray it as evidence of her being "crazy" or "inappropriate." This strategy echoes past attempts to undermine female politicians by criticizing their expressions of emotion, such as Hillary Clinton's "cackle." 

Experts suggest that voters are more aware of such misogynistic and racist tactics and are unlikely to be swayed by them.  They argue that Harris's laughter, often described as genuine and uninhibited, reflects her strength and refusal to conform to traditional expectations of female leaders.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor claimed that statues at the 1971 Shaheed Memorial Complex in Bangladesh depicting the surrender of Pakistani soldiers to Indian forces had been destroyed by "anti-India vandals." Tharoor’s claim was based on images showing figures on the ground, which he interpreted as broken statues.  

However, this claim has been challenged by others who point out that the statues are intentionally designed in a state of prostration, meant to depict the surrender and atrocities committed during the Liberation War.  Pictures from 2018 show similar depictions at the memorial, and the Bangladesh Army maintains custody of the site.

### [Independence Day 2024: How India and Pakistan divided money, military and an elephant amid partition](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/independence-day-india-pakistan-assets-partition-13803755.html)

Following India's independence in 1947, the monumental task of dividing assets between India and Pakistan commenced. A committee, the Partition Council, was formed, comprised of representatives from both the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League. 

The division of the military proved particularly complex, with approximately two-thirds staying with India and one-third allocated to Pakistan.  The financial division saw Pakistan receiving 17.5% of British India's assets and liabilities.  

Besides military and financial assets, movable assets were divided in an 80-20 ratio, encompassing everything from furniture to stationery. Even antiquities and animals, such as the elephant Joymoni, were subject to this division process.  Despite the immense challenges, India and Pakistan successfully completed this intricate task of asset division, albeit amidst diplomatic disputes and lingering financial claims between the two nations.

Olympic medals, despite their prestige, hold relatively low intrinsic value due to their composition. The Paris 2024 gold medal, for example, contains only 6 grams of gold and is worth approximately $1,027.  The value increases due to the history and achievements associated with them.

India has a significant population of Asiatic elephants, which are unfortunately threatened by collisions with trains. Over 200 elephants have lost their lives in these accidents in the past decade.  

To address this issue, authorities are implementing various measures. These include deploying AI-based surveillance systems, like "Gajraj," to detect elephant movement near tracks and alert drivers. Additionally, states are constructing "animal flyovers" and utilizing drones for monitoring elephant movement.

While these efforts are crucial, challenges remain.  Vast railway networks, elephant corridors intersecting tracks, and prioritizing development over conservation pose ongoing issues. Suggestions include restricting train operations at night, regulating train speeds in forested areas, and providing adequate food and water within forests to reduce elephant movement near tracks.

Ukraine launched a large-scale incursion into Russia's Kursk region, marking a major escalation in the ongoing war. Ukrainian forces, supported by tanks and artillery, advanced deep into Russian territory, capturing strategic points and forcing mass evacuations. This audacious operation has significantly embarrassed the Kremlin and exposed vulnerabilities in Russia's defenses. Despite claiming victories against Ukrainian columns, the Kremlin faces growing pressure as Ukrainian troops remain entrenched in Russian territory.  The incursion has boosted Ukrainian morale, challenged Russia's narrative of invincibility, and forced Russia to divert resources from other fronts.

Hindenburg Research, a US-based investor-activist firm, has made fresh allegations against Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch, claiming they held stakes in offshore entities linked to Adani Group. These accusations stem from Hindenburg's revisiting of its earlier report on the Adani Group, which alleged wrongdoing and stock manipulation. 

The Buchs deny the allegations, stating their finances are transparent and the investment in the offshore fund was made in 2015,  before Madhabi Buch's appointment to Sebi. They claim it was based on trust in the fund manager, Anil Ahuja, a childhood friend of Dhaval Buch.

Hindenburg, however, questions the Sebi chief's handling of Adani-related investigations given her previous investments.  The company also highlights inconsistencies in the Buchs' statement regarding the status of one of their consulting companies.

Despite denials from both the Buchs and Adani Group, the allegations have shaken investor confidence, leading to a significant drop in Adani group stocks. This has resulted in considerable market capitalisation losses for the conglomerate.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will visit Russia from August 12 to 14, marking his first trip to the country since 2021.  The relationship between Palestine and Russia dates back to 1974, with Russia consistently supporting the "two-state solution" and Palestinian statehood.

While Russia positions itself as a neutral mediator, its ties with Hamas and its recent actions in the UN Security Council have complicated its role. Abbas aims to discuss international developments, coordinate positions, and strengthen bilateral relations during his visit.   Experts, however, remain skeptical about Russia's ability to deliver a breakthrough on the Palestinian issue, given its limited influence and the ongoing complexities in the region.

St. Martin's Island, a small Bangladeshi coral island, has become a geopolitical focal point due to its strategic location near vital maritime trade routes. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina claimed that the US sought to acquire the island in exchange for political support, an allegation denied by her son and the US State Department. 

The island's strategic importance stems from its potential to provide oversight of the Bay of Bengal, offering valuable surveillance capabilities for global powers like the US and China.  While Bangladesh asserts its sovereignty over the island, its proximity to Myanmar and the Rohingya crisis have added to regional tensions and maritime boundary disputes.  The potential for a US military presence on the island raises concerns for neighboring countries like India and China, adding another layer to the complex geopolitical dynamics in the region.

Mercury retrograde, an astrological phenomenon observed when the planet Mercury appears to move backward in its orbit, is believed by some to cause disruptions in communication, technology, and travel.  This illusion occurs due to Mercury's faster orbit around the sun.

During retrograde periods, astrologers advise caution in decision-making, as miscommunications and technical difficulties are more prevalent. Travel plans may face delays or complications, and relationships can experience strain. 

Although scientifically unsupported, many believe Mercury retrograde coincides with increased chaos and challenges, prompting strategies like double-checking communications, avoiding major decisions, and remaining flexible.

A Goldman Sachs report predicts that China's urban pet population will surpass its young child population by 2030.  The report attributes this trend to declining birth rates and increased pet ownership among younger generations. 

By 2030, the urban pet population is projected to reach 70 million, nearly double the number of children under four years old. This surge in pet ownership is expected to fuel the pet food market, with Goldman Sachs estimating it to reach $12 billion by 2030. Cat ownership is predicted to outpace dog ownership due to space constraints.  


China's demographic crisis, marked by a shrinking population and low birth rates, is a key factor driving this shift.  Experts cite economic concerns, high living costs, and changing societal norms as contributing factors to the decline in childbearing.

The Netherlands faces an unexpected challenge: overcrowded prisons are a thing of the past, replaced by a declining prison population. This trend is attributed to shorter sentences, particularly for non-violent crimes, and a strong emphasis on rehabilitation over punishment.  

The Dutch justice system prioritizes alternatives to incarceration, such as electronic tagging and specialized treatment programs for individuals with mental health issues. This innovative approach has led to a significant reduction in prison sentences and the repurposing of former correctional facilities for other social needs.

The New York Times faced criticism for its headline on violence against Hindus in Bangladesh, which initially labeled the attacks as "revenge attacks" following the exit of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 

The headline was widely condemned on social media, with many accusing the NYT of implying that the Hindu community provoked the violence. The newspaper later revised the headline, removing the word "revenge." 

This is not the first time the NYT has sparked controversy with its coverage of India. Past incidents include publishing a cartoon deemed racist in 2014 and facing accusations of bias in articles about press freedom in Kashmir and the 2016 JNU protests.

The attack has drawn condemnation from Russia, which has responded with airstrikes, missile, and artillery fire.   The situation is volatile, with concerns about potential disruptions to European energy security due to the fighting's proximity to critical infrastructure. Some analysts believe the move could be a strategy by Ukraine to destabilize Russia's economy and gain leverage in negotiations, especially given the upcoming US elections.

Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize laureate known as the "banker of the poor," has been appointed head of Bangladesh's interim government following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Yunus, 84, gained prominence for founding the Grameen Bank, a micro-finance institution that provides small loans to impoverished individuals, particularly women. The bank's innovative approach, which focuses on trust and solidarity lending rather than collateral, has empowered millions in Bangladesh and inspired similar institutions worldwide. 

Yunus' previous experience tackling poverty and his commitment to social upliftment fuel hope for stability in Bangladesh, which has been grappling with student-led unrest. However, questions remain about his ability to effectively navigate the complex political landscape.

Carles Puigdemont, the exiled former leader of Catalonia, returned to Barcelona after seven years.  He fled Spain in 2017 after leading a failed secessionist bid and faces charges of embezzlement. 

His return is controversial as it coincides with the formation of a new Catalan government dependent on support from Puigdemont's Junts party. A potential amnesty bill could clear Puigdemont of charges, but faces legal challenges.  

Puigdemont's return aims to solidify his position as the head of the Catalan independence movement and pressure authorities on the amnesty bill.    Some experts believe it may be his final attempt to influence the movement, while others see it as a catalyst for further political instability. His parliamentary immunity could complicate any potential arrest.

The Waqf (Amendment) Bill seeks to make 44 changes to the Waqf Act of 1995. Some key proposed changes include establishing a separate board for Boharas and Aghakhanis, allowing representation of various Muslim groups in Waqf bodies, and mandating  the use of specific wording for Waqf property designation. 

The Bill removes the power of Waqf boards to designate properties as Waqf and instead grants this authority to district collectors. This change has sparked controversy, with some Waqf officials and Muslim leaders arguing that it weakens the autonomy of Waqf boards and increases government control over religious endowments. 

The Bill also proposes including women on Waqf boards and stipulating that a portion of Waqf funds be used for the welfare of widows, divorcees, and orphans.  

While the government defends the changes as necessary for efficiency and transparency, opposition parties have criticized the Bill as an "attack" on the constitution and federalism, alleging that it discriminates against Muslims and undermines religious freedom.

Shia Islamist parties in Iraq are proposing amendments to the country's 1959 Personal Status Law which would allow girls as young as nine to be married. This has sparked outrage from women's rights groups who highlight that the existing law is considered one of the most progressive in the region, setting 18 as the legal age for marriage for both men and women. 

The proposed changes are being pushed by the Coordination Framework, a bloc of conservative Shia Islamist parties, and would see Shia and Sunni endowments taking over the sanctioning of marriages, instead of courts. They argue that the changes are in line with the constitution and Sharia law. However, critics contend that the amendments are a step backward for women's rights and will have a detrimental impact on the lives of children. 
 
Globally, child marriage remains a serious issue, with over one in five girls married before the age of 18.  Nigeria has the highest rate, followed by the Central African Republic, Chad, and Mali.

Republican critics have dubbed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, chosen by Kamala Harris as her running mate, “Tampon Tim” due to a law he signed requiring free menstrual products in public schools. The nickname stems from the law’s inclusive language, which provides products to all menstruating students, not just females.  

This has sparked controversy, with conservative commentators attacking Walz and equating the policy to radical liberal agendas. However, many Democrats and progressives have embraced the “Tampon Tim” moniker, viewing it as a positive and highlighting Walz's commitment to menstrual equity and progressive values.  The debate underscores the ongoing conversation about menstrual equity in the US,  with 30 states having already eliminated sales tax on menstrual products.

In response, thousands of counter-protesters took to the streets, voicing messages of unity and opposing racism. They gathered outside targeted institutions, forming human shields and carrying banners against hate speech.

Protests in Bangladesh led to the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years in power. The initial trigger was a quota system reserving government jobs for war veterans' relatives, but the demonstrations evolved into a wider movement against political repression, economic inequality, and lack of opportunities for youth.  The protests were primarily youth-led, utilizing social media despite government attempts to restrict access. 

The violent government response further fueled public anger, ultimately forcing Hasina's departure. Now, with a fragile power vacuum, the opportunity exists for a bottom-up democratic transition where youth voices can be heard and policies address their concerns. However, the participation of young people in the new interim government and the inclusivity of the upcoming elections remain crucial to ensure  lasting change.

### [How Thailand found, and then banned, its most popular politician](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/how-thailand-found-and-then-banned-its-most-popular-politician-13802143.html)

The Constitutional Court in Thailand has dissolved the Move Forward Party (MFP) and banned its leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, from politics for 10 years. This decision stems from the party's pledge to reform the country's strict lese-majeste law, which criminalizes defamation of the monarchy. 

The MFP, led by Pita, had won the most votes in last year's general election, but his bid to become prime minister was thwarted by conservative senators.  The court's ruling is seen by many as a blow to pro-democracy forces in Thailand, which has a history of military intervention and suppression of dissent.  Supporters of Pita and the MFP express concern that the judiciary is being used to stifle political opposition and criticize the monarchy.

Following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and flight to India, Bangladesh is experiencing widespread violence. Protesters have targeted Awami League properties, resulting in the deaths of 29 party members and their families. 

The Awami League faces a significant challenge as its institutions are being ransacked and key leaders either detained, fled, or remain missing.

Experts believe it will be difficult for the Awami League, once the country's most dominant force, to recover in the near future.

A recent viral video showing Gen Z  women sporting jeans, tops, and sneakers at a bar has sparked debate about evolving fashion norms. While some lament the perceived demise of traditional going-out attire, others applaud the comfort and practicality of the trend.

However, some style experts predict that high heels will eventually make a comeback, citing their enduring power to boost confidence and elongate the silhouette.  
This shift towards comfortable clothing, like pajamas worn to work in China, signifies a broader societal trend where functionality and personal expression are prioritized over rigid fashion rules.

The Indian government has amended its Budget 2024 proposal regarding long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on property sales.  Originally, the proposal aimed to reduce the LTCG tax rate to 12.5% but remove indexation benefits, a move that faced criticism. 

The amended proposal allows taxpayers to choose between the old system (20% tax with indexation benefits) or the new system (12.5% tax without indexation benefits) for properties acquired before July 23, 2024. This provides flexibility and addresses concerns that the removal of indexation would disproportionately affect middle-class homeowners. The government's decision to offer this choice is seen as a way to balance the desire for tax simplification with the need to protect the interests of property owners.

The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at a rate of 3.82 centimeters per year.  This is primarily due to tidal forces caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. As the Moon recedes, it causes Earth's rotation to slow down, resulting in the gradual lengthening of a day. Over the next 200 million years, Earth's days are predicted to extend to 25 hours.  This constant gravitational tug-of-war shapes Earth's geological features and has significant implications for the planet's rotation and relationship with its moon.

The US has reportedly revoked Hasina's visa, citing strained relations stemming from concerns over the January elections and allegations of a military base plot.

Recent political turmoil in Bangladesh has led to a surge in violence against Hindus, resulting in deaths, destruction of homes and places of worship.  

This escalation of violence, following student protests against a job quota scheme, has fueled concerns of a refugee crisis in India, given the close proximity of the two countries and shared border. 

The possibility of a BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government further exacerbates these worries, as their past stance is seen as potentially less favourable to the Hindu population.  The Indian government has advised its citizens in Bangladesh to exercise extreme caution and restrict their movements.

A23a, which detached from Antarctica in 1986, has been rotating counterclockwise by 15 degrees daily since coming free from the seabed in 2020.

This strange stillness has delayed the iceberg's expected melting and disintegration as it remains above warmer waters. It was predicted that A23a would be carried north by the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current, but the Taylor Column has kept it in place.  Its unpredictable movements highlight the significant influence of underwater topography on ocean currents and iceberg behaviour.

Dolce and Gabbana have launched a dog perfume called 'Fefé', priced at €99. Inspired by co-founder Domenico Dolce's love for his dog, the fragrance features notes of Ylang, Musk, and Sandalwood.  

While marketed as a luxurious product, the perfume has faced criticism from animal welfare organizations like the RSPCA. They argue that it interferes with a dog's sensitive sense of smell, which is crucial for their perception and well-being. Experts warn that the strong scents can cause confusion, anxiety, and even hinder a dog's ability to function effectively.  Additionally, there are concerns that owners may use the perfume to mask underlying health issues instead of seeking veterinary care.

Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old sociology student and key figure in the anti-quota and anti-government demonstrations, is now part of the 16-member council advising the interim government. 

Islam, known for his human rights activism, drew national attention during the protests that turned violent, leading to his arrest and allegations of torture. His movement demanded an end to a job quota system perceived as discriminatory and benefited the Awami League party. 
The protests, which began in July, were widely supported and highlighted economic distress and a lack of job opportunities for young graduates.

Sheikh Hasina, the recently ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, fled her country and arrived in India seeking temporary refuge. She plans to apply for asylum in the UK, but her request has been met with obstacles as UK immigration rules require asylum seekers to remain in the first safe country they reach.  Hasina's stay in India is uncertain, with the Indian government offering her time to decide her future plans.  

Granting Hasina asylum could strain India's relationship with the new Bangladeshi government, while denying it could portray India as abandoning an ally. This creates a diplomatic dilemma for New Delhi. 


Hasina is also reportedly exploring options in Scandinavian countries.

Begum Khaleda Zia, former prime minister of Bangladesh, has been released from house arrest after over three years. Zia, a prominent opposition figure, had been jailed on corruption charges in 2018, which her supporters claim were politically motivated.

The US economy is facing heightened recession fears due to a weak July jobs report and global market volatility.

While some economists warn of a potential recession, others point to positive indicators like continued private-sector demand and cooling inflation. The mixed signals have led to divided opinions within the expert community. 


The political landscape has also been impacted, with the opposition seizing on the economic data to criticize the incumbent administration. Ultimately, the trajectory of the US economy remains uncertain.

Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Bangladesh's prime minister presents a significant challenge for India.  Hasina was a strong ally, fostering closer ties in trade, defence, and security. 

With her departure, India faces uncertainties regarding these collaborations. The new interim government, potentially influenced by the army, may adopt a less pro-India stance, impacting defence ties and security cooperation.

The future of the proposed India-Bangladesh Free Trade Agreement and ongoing infrastructure projects are also in question.

The Sahm Rule, a strong recession indicator based on US unemployment data, was triggered by a recent jobs report showing a higher-than-expected unemployment rate. 

Despite this, some economists argue the rule is purely empirical and not necessarily indicative of a recession.  They point to other positive economic indicators such as strong consumer spending and business investment.  However, the rule's activation has heightened investor concerns and increased pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than anticipated to mitigate potential market decline.

Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has been a dominant figure in Bangladeshi politics for decades. 

She rose to power after her father's assassination in 1975, leading the Awami League party against military dictatorships. Her premiership, beginning in 2009, saw significant economic growth, driven by the garment industry, and Bangladesh's impressive poverty reduction.

However, her tenure has been marked by accusations of authoritarianism, cracking down on dissent, and manipulating the judicial system.  Controversial war crimes tribunals and bans on opposition parties sparked protests and international condemnation. 

Recently, widespread protests against a controversial quota system led to her resignation after serving four consecutive terms as prime minister.
