### [What is magnetic resonance imaging? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-magnetic-resonance-imaging-explained/article68145357.ece)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that has been indispensable since its development in the 1970s. It uses strong magnetic fields to produce images of soft tissues within the body, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, including cancer and neurological diseases. The MRI machine consists of a superconducting magnet, a radiofrequency pulse emitter, and a detector that works together to align hydrogen atoms in the body and capture their emitted signals to create detailed images.

The technique is safe, with no long-term effects on the body, but it cannot be used on individuals with metallic implants or objects. MRI scans are costly due to the high price of the machines and the energy-intensive process of maintaining them. Patients often bear these costs, which can be significant, especially for those without insurance. The procedure requires patients to remain still for an extended period, which can be uncomfortable, particularly for claustrophobic individuals. Despite these challenges, MRI remains a critical component of modern medical diagnostics.

Here's a summary of the article:

The Supreme Court of India has placed a stay on the Allahabad High Court's ruling that declared the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 unconstitutional. The Act was established to regulate madarsas and provide education from primary to research levels. The High Court had questioned the Act's validity, suggesting it violated the principle of secularism and constitutional articles related to equality, discrimination, and education.

The High Court had directed the Uttar Pradesh government to integrate madarsa students into regular schools, citing the lack of quality and universal education in madarsas, which focused primarily on Islamic studies. The Supreme Court's stay order came after senior advocates argued that the High Court's decision would disrupt the education of nearly 17 lakh students and that the Act's purpose was regulatory, not religious.

The Supreme Court will re-examine the case, considering whether the Act's regulatory nature conflicts with the secular principles of the Constitution and if the State has the authority to legislate on education matters reserved for the Union. The final arguments are scheduled for the second week of July.

### [How do mosquito bats work? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-do-mosquito-bats-work-explained/article68042488.ece)

Certainly! Here's a summary of the article:

As summer approaches, mosquitos become a common nuisance. At IIT Kanpur, these insects are often found bloated from feasting on blood. Despite their fascinating biology and physics, their biting makes them unwelcome. To combat them, the 'electric tennis bat' has become a popular tool. It works by having a positively charged central mesh and two negatively charged outer meshes. When a mosquito bridges these meshes, it completes the circuit, allowing current to flow and killing the mosquito.

The article explains that electric current is carried by electrons, which are shared among atoms in conductive materials like copper. In contrast, insulators like air hold onto their electrons until a high voltage forces them out, creating a mix of charged particles. This is similar to how a mosquito bat works, generating about 1,400 V to kill mosquitos and create sparks. These sparks' color depends on the atom types involved, with oxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere causing white or near-white sparks.

The author, Adhip Agarwala, an assistant professor of physics at IIT Kanpur, ties this to quantum mechanics, suggesting that understanding the emission of light at certain wavelengths requires knowledge of this field. He concludes by reminding us that when we use a mosquito bat, it's not just us, but also quantum physics, electrons, and atoms that are part of the victory over mosquitos. The article is from The Hindu and delves into physics and electrical engineering concepts. 

If you're interested in the detailed physics behind these phenomena or considering a course in physics, the article suggests that quantum mechanics is the key to understanding these processes.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture has identified issues with the current state of protected monuments, noting that many may not have significant national value. A past report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India also highlighted that some monuments were untraceable.

The 18 monuments in question are spread across several Indian states and mostly date back to the pre-Independence era. Notably, the Kos Minars, mile markers from the time of Sher Shah Suri, are included in the list. The government is also considering an amendment to the AMASR Act that would allow for construction projects near these monuments, which is currently restricted to preserve their integrity. This amendment aims to facilitate public works and development projects that are currently hindered by the existing regulations.

### [What purposes do university rankings serve? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/education/what-purposes-do-university-rankings-serve-explained/article67910252.ece)

Global university rankings have gained significant influence in higher education, leading some institutions to allocate resources to improve their rankings. However, concerns have been raised about the systems' incentives and the companies behind them. Issues include conflicts of interest, as companies that create rankings sometimes consult with universities to help them improve their positions. Additionally, universities provide these companies with access to their data without permission. Critics argue that rankings oversimplify complex university roles and prioritize research excellence based on factors like citations, which can be manipulated. In response, several prominent universities have withdrawn from traditional rankings, recognizing their potential to promote harmful behaviors and negative long-term effects.

### [Supreme Court’s ban on Patanjali ads | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-courts-ban-on-patanjali-ads-explained/article67899090.ece)

The Supreme Court has prohibited Patanjali Ayurved from discrediting allopathy and advertising products that claim to cure chronic conditions. This is because Patanjali's ads present their products as a 'permanent relief,' which is "misleading" and violates the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. The court also issued a contempt notice against Patanjali and its Managing Director Acharya Balkrishna for failing to adhere to directions passed in November last year. The case was filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in response to Patanjali ads that allegedly denigrated allopathy and made exaggerated claims about its drugs. Patanjali has been previously found to have sold substandard products and failed to comply with drug manufacturing standards. Despite being warned by the court in November 2023, Patanjali continued to make misleading claims in its advertisements. The court has now temporarily banned all forms of advertisements for Patanjali's medicinal products. The case will be heard next on March 19.

Mizoram and Nagaland have opposed the Centre's decision to fence the India-Myanmar border and scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) agreement. The FMR allows cross-border movement up to 16 km without travel documents. The Centre claims the decision is to prevent illegal migration, drug smuggling, and extremist activity. However, Mizoram and Nagaland argue that it will divide communities and disrupt age-old ties. The Supreme Court has ruled that State Assembly resolutions against central laws are merely opinions with no legal force.

**India's Gaganyaan Mission**

India's Gaganyaan Mission aims to send astronauts to low-earth orbit with a launch scheduled for 2025. The mission includes:

* **Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3):** Three-stage rocket to launch the orbital module.
* **Orbital Module:** Crew module (for three astronauts) with parachutes and life support systems, and service module for propulsion.
* **Crew:** Four shortlisted astronaut candidates from the Indian Air Force.

The mission has been approved and several technologies have been tested, including:

* Space Capsule Recovery Experiment (SRE, 2007)
* Crew-Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE, 2014)
* Testing of CE-20 engines and other components

The crew module and life support systems will be procured externally due to a lack of domestic manufacturing capability.

The mission is part of India's space reforms, including the establishment of NSIL and IN-SPACe, and aims to establish India's self-sufficiency in sending humans to space.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, was emotional at the company's listing in 2021, seeing it as a realization of the company's goal of empowering India through digital payments. Despite its initial success, Paytm has faced regulatory hurdles and shaken investor confidence. Sharma's journey as an entrepreneur began in college, where he faced challenges with the English medium of instruction. He started XS, a content management system, and later founded One97 Communications in 2000. Paytm was launched in 2010, focusing on removing cash and promoting financial inclusion. The company's entry into lending and its ambition for a small finance bank license have been hindered by regulatory issues. Sharma's intuitive and opinionated approach to decision-making has also impacted the company's performance. As Paytm struggles with its stock price below its debut price, Sharma remains determined to preserve its profitability and fight regulatory challenges.

These highly trained Air Force test pilots will undergo rigorous training at various facilities in India and Russia. Gaganyaan aims to demonstrate human spaceflight in low-earth orbit using an Indian launch vehicle. The mission has two uncrewed test flights planned before the first crewed flight, tentatively scheduled for 2025. The crew module can accommodate up to three astronauts, but ISRO may only send one on the maiden mission, highlighting the importance of both physical and mental fitness.

### [Maharashtra’s latest Maratha quota law and its challenges | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra-latest-maratha-quota-law-and-its-challenges-explained/article67891042.ece)

The Maharashtra Assembly has passed a Bill granting 10% reservation in education and government jobs to the Maratha community. The new law is based on a survey that claims 84% of Marathas qualify as backward. However, activists are demanding a quota carved out from the existing OBC category, while OBC leaders are concerned about their share being reduced. The Bill does not affect the existing OBC quota or the issuance of Kunbi caste certificates to Marathas. Those within the "creamy layer" bracket are not eligible for the benefits. The law has been formulated based on the report of the Justice Sunil B Shukre-led Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission. It argues that exceptional circumstances justify granting reservation to the community beyond the Supreme Court-approved 50% limit. The law is unlikely to pass judicial scrutiny as the Supreme Court has previously struck down a similar law in Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, holding that the Marathas are a "dominant forward class."

### [The Italian court ruling against returning sea migrants to Libya | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-italian-court-ruling-against-returning-sea-migrants-to-libya/article67894696.ece)

In a landmark ruling, Italy's highest court declared Libya an unsafe harbor for migrants. The verdict prohibits the return of migrants rescued at sea to Libya, where they face human rights abuses in detention centers controlled by coastguards and militias. The ruling upholds the conviction of a ship captain for returning migrants to Libya in 2018, considering it a violation of international maritime and humanitarian laws. Despite the ruling, Italy and the EU continue to support Libyan authorities in intercepting migrants, allowing for the "push-back" of people to Libya's unsafe conditions. This practice is supported by right-wing parties capitalizing on anti-immigration policies, but has been met with criticism from human rights organizations.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg believes Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO is inevitable, despite concerns among member states. Russia opposes NATO expansion, viewing it as a provocation. Ukraine faces a shortage of artillery ammunition, leading to heavy casualties. Russia has suffered significant losses, but has made recent gains. The US faces Congressional resistance to aid for Ukraine from Republicans. The EU is struggling to finance its support for Ukraine's war effort. NATO is seeking to address Ukraine's concerns through increased cooperation, but full membership is not yet on the table. Ukraine's future is uncertain with potential Russian victories and the possibility of Trump's return to power.

### [On cross-voting in Rajya Sabha elections | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-cross-voting-in-rajya-sabha-elections-explained/article67901293.ece)

The Rajya Sabha elections have been marred by cross-voting from MLAs in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka. To curb this practice, the Representation of the People Act was amended in 2003 to mandate open ballot voting and the 'anti-defection' law was introduced in 1985. Despite these measures, cross-voting continues, undermining the sanctity of the election process. The Supreme Court has upheld open ballot voting for Rajya Sabha elections, but ruled that cross-voting does not warrant disqualification under the 'anti-defection' law. However, it has also held that a member's conduct within and outside the House can be considered when determining voluntary abandonment of party membership. To combat cross-voting effectively, the Supreme Court may consider reviewing its ruling in light of its judgment in the Ravi Naik case, potentially leading to disqualification for MLAs who defy party whips in Rajya Sabha elections.

### [Why sustainable funding matters for India’s ‘science power’ ambition | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/sustainable-funding-science-power-ambition-india/article67884760.ece)

- India's R&D spending has declined from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 0.64% currently, despite calls to double this spending.


- India needs to spend at least 3% of GDP on R&D annually until 2047 to achieve developed nation status.


- While the private sector contributes significantly to R&D in developed countries, in India, it accounts for only 36.4% of GERD.


- The Anusandhan National Research Foundation was meant to address funding issues, but its implementation has been delayed and funding remains unclear.


- Under-utilization of allocated funds is a recurring problem, with ministries like DBT, DST, and DSIR consistently falling short of budget execution.


- To effectively utilize R&D funds, the government needs to prioritize R&D spending, streamline bureaucratic processes, and build capacity within agencies.


- Encouraging private investment through incentives and clear regulatory roadmaps is crucial to boost R&D funding.


- India needs to develop the bureaucratic capacity to evaluate science projects and monitor fund utilization to become a science power by 2047.

NATO started its largest military exercise, Steadfast Defender 2024, in response to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The exercise aims to demonstrate NATO's collective military strength and commitment to its members' security. It includes land, air, sea, cyber, and space operations, involving over 90,000 troops from 31 allies and Sweden. The first phase focuses on maritime reinforcement, while the second phase involves multi-domain exercises across Europe. Experts believe the exercise serves as a deterrent to Russia and a warning to the Kremlin. NATO allies, including the US, France, and Germany, have pledged significant financial and military support to Ukraine. The exercise is strategically located in European countries, particularly those near the Baltic Sea, due to Russia's presence in Kaliningrad. The inclusion of cyber and space operations makes the exercise relevant to modern warfare. NATO member states aim to strengthen their collaboration in real-world operations through this exercise.

China plans to loan a pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo as part of its panda diplomacy efforts. Panda diplomacy, which dates back to the Tang Dynasty, involves gifting or loaning pandas as a symbol of friendship. China stopped gifting pandas in the 1980s but now loans them for a fee, with conditions typically including proper facilities and an agreement to return offspring. While experts believe panda diplomacy has environmental implications, China has hinted at resuming panda loans to the U.S. following a meeting between President Xi and President Biden.

### [Is Russia testing a new anti-satellite weapon? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/is-russia-testing-a-new-anti-satellite-weapon-explained/article67858315.ece)

The article discusses Chairman Mike Turner's remarks regarding a potential national security threat posed by a new Russian space-based anti-satellite weapon. The weapon could violate the Outer Space Treaty, which bans placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth's orbit. The historical context of ASAT weapons, including nuclear tests conducted in space, is highlighted. The article also delves into the potential impacts of a space-based nuclear weapon, such as EMP and debris generation, on satellites and space operations. The debate surrounding the nature and implications of the Russian capability is explored, with some experts suggesting it may be a weapon of last resort or primarily powered by nuclear energy for electronic warfare purposes. Sharp reactions and accusations from U.S. political circles and the Kremlin's dismissal of the claims are also mentioned.

This article discusses the challenges faced in matching influenza and COVID-19 vaccines to the circulating strains of the viruses. Due to the long gestation period of vaccine development, strains may have drifted by the time vaccines reach the market. The effectiveness of the vaccines is influenced by the match between the strains included in the vaccine and those in circulation. The article highlights the decline in protection over time and the emergence of highly mutated variants, such as Omicron. Researchers emphasize the importance of updating vaccines to match new variants. A study suggests that updating vaccines can significantly improve neutralizing antibody titres and increase efficacy against future variants. However, there are factors to consider, including the distance between antigens in the updated vaccine and future variants. The study primarily focuses on humoral immunity conferred by antibodies and doesn't consider cellular immunity conferred by T-cells. The article also discusses the need for updated vaccines in India, taking into account the objective of preventing severe disease and the challenges of updating traditional influenza vaccines versus mRNA-based vaccines.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) between South Africa and Israel. South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide during its military campaign in Gaza and has invoked the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. South Africa has requested provisional measures to stop the alleged genocide. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, and only states can be parties in cases before the Court. The Genocide Convention of 1948, which both South Africa and Israel are signatories to, defines genocide as acts such as killing members of a national, racial, ethnic, or religious group. South Africa has accused Israel of causing harm to the Palestinian people in Gaza and has cited statements from Israeli officials and international organizations to support its claims. Israel, on the other hand, denies any genocidal intent and argues that its operations in Gaza are aimed at protecting its people and removing the threat posed by Hamas. The ICJ is expected to issue a ruling on provisional measures in the coming weeks, but it does not have the means to enforce its own orders. The article also mentions the possibility of the UN Security Council taking measures, but any enforcement would be subject to the veto power of permanent members, such as the United States.

The article discusses the concerns raised by passengers regarding the enrollment process for the Digi Yatra app at airports in India. Passengers reported that their facial biometrics were being collected without their consent or knowledge by security personnel and private staff. The CEO of Digi Yatra Foundation stated that the enrollment drive was intensified in December to allow passengers to experience the benefits of the app. Digi Yatra aims to streamline passenger movement at airports through digital processing. The app is owned by the Digi Yatra Foundation, which includes the Airports Authority of India and five private airports. Passengers need to download the app, register with their personal information and Aadhaar document, and upload a selfie. The app allows for facial recognition at e-gates, eliminating the need for physical boarding passes. The government claims that passenger data is not centrally stored and is purged within 24 hours. However, concerns have been raised about data protection and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is yet to be fully implemented.

### [International Court of Justice | Justice without power](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/international-court-of-justice-justice-without-power/article67738733.ece)

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest judicial body of the United Nations, recently held hearings regarding South Africa's accusation of Israel committing genocide in Gaza. The ICJ has dual jurisdictional powers, advisory and contentious, and was established in 1945 after the Permanent Court of International Justice became ineffective. The court's decisions are legally binding but often lack an enforcement mechanism. The participation of powerful member states and the court's slow procedures have also been criticized. However, the ICJ has played a role in expanding international law and has had major rulings adhered to by concerned parties. Its advisory role has also contributed to peaceful solutions and diplomatic efforts. The ongoing proceedings by South Africa will provide evidence for an advisory opinion on Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Despite its impact, the ICJ's effectiveness is hindered by political biases and the potential fragmentation of international law.
