### [Three new fish species spotted using tools in the Laccadive Sea](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/three-new-wrasse-species-spotted-using-tools-laccadive-sea/article68071175.ece)

A recent study published in the journal Coral Reefs has documented three fish species in the Laccadive Sea using coral structures as tools to break open sea urchins, a behavior not previously reported for two of these species. This discovery contributes to the evidence of tool use among animals, challenging the notion that fish lack the intelligence for complex tasks. The accidental observation was made while researching sea urchin burrowing, which affects reef stability. The wrasses demonstrated skill in handling their prey, using the reef as an anvil to remove spines and crack open the urchin's hard shell. This behavior, mostly observed in the Labridae family, prompts questions about the development of animal intelligence and the necessity for more extensive natural observations.

### [Reforms needed in the voting process | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/reforms-needed-in-the-voting-process-explained/article68073269.ece)

The Supreme Court of India is set to hear petitions for complete verification of VVPAT slips with EVM counts. The evolution of voting in India from separate boxes for each candidate to the introduction of EVMs in 1982 is highlighted. EVMs have been validated by the Supreme Court and were used across all constituencies in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Despite their benefits, such as preventing booth capturing and eliminating invalid votes, EVMs face skepticism over their susceptibility to hacking. The current practice of matching EVM counts with VVPAT slips in five random booths per constituency lacks a scientific basis and could miss errors. The article suggests a more robust verification process, including scientific sampling and the use of 'totaliser' machines to maintain voter anonymity at the booth level. The author, Rangarajan. R, emphasizes the need for transparency and verifiability in the electoral process without requiring special technical knowledge from citizens.

Here's a summary of the article:

The Supreme Court of India has placed a stay on the Allahabad High Court's ruling that declared the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 unconstitutional. The Act was established to regulate madarsas and provide education from primary to research levels. The High Court had questioned the Act's validity, suggesting it violated the principle of secularism and constitutional articles related to equality, discrimination, and education.

The High Court had directed the Uttar Pradesh government to integrate madarsa students into regular schools, citing the lack of quality and universal education in madarsas, which focused primarily on Islamic studies. The Supreme Court's stay order came after senior advocates argued that the High Court's decision would disrupt the education of nearly 17 lakh students and that the Act's purpose was regulatory, not religious.

The Supreme Court will re-examine the case, considering whether the Act's regulatory nature conflicts with the secular principles of the Constitution and if the State has the authority to legislate on education matters reserved for the Union. The final arguments are scheduled for the second week of July.

### [How do mosquito bats work? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-do-mosquito-bats-work-explained/article68042488.ece)

Certainly! Here's a summary of the article:

As summer approaches, mosquitos become a common nuisance. At IIT Kanpur, these insects are often found bloated from feasting on blood. Despite their fascinating biology and physics, their biting makes them unwelcome. To combat them, the 'electric tennis bat' has become a popular tool. It works by having a positively charged central mesh and two negatively charged outer meshes. When a mosquito bridges these meshes, it completes the circuit, allowing current to flow and killing the mosquito.

The article explains that electric current is carried by electrons, which are shared among atoms in conductive materials like copper. In contrast, insulators like air hold onto their electrons until a high voltage forces them out, creating a mix of charged particles. This is similar to how a mosquito bat works, generating about 1,400 V to kill mosquitos and create sparks. These sparks' color depends on the atom types involved, with oxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere causing white or near-white sparks.

The author, Adhip Agarwala, an assistant professor of physics at IIT Kanpur, ties this to quantum mechanics, suggesting that understanding the emission of light at certain wavelengths requires knowledge of this field. He concludes by reminding us that when we use a mosquito bat, it's not just us, but also quantum physics, electrons, and atoms that are part of the victory over mosquitos. The article is from The Hindu and delves into physics and electrical engineering concepts. 

If you're interested in the detailed physics behind these phenomena or considering a course in physics, the article suggests that quantum mechanics is the key to understanding these processes.

### [Government notifies plan to delist 18 centrally protected monuments | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/18-protected-asi-monuments-to-be-delisted-central-government/article68027944.ece)

The article from The Hindu discusses the Indian Ministry of Culture's decision to potentially delist 18 monuments previously deemed of national importance. This action is based on Section 35 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 (AMASR Act), which allows for such a change if the monuments are no longer considered important. The public has been given two months to raise objections or suggestions.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Ministry of Culture, is responsible for the upkeep of these monuments. If delisted, the ASI would no longer maintain them. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture has identified issues with the current state of protected monuments, noting that many may not have significant national value. A past report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India also highlighted that some monuments were untraceable.

The 18 monuments in question are spread across several Indian states and mostly date back to the pre-Independence era. Notably, the Kos Minars, mile markers from the time of Sher Shah Suri, are included in the list. The government is also considering an amendment to the AMASR Act that would allow for construction projects near these monuments, which is currently restricted to preserve their integrity. This amendment aims to facilitate public works and development projects that are currently hindered by the existing regulations.

### [A brief history of EVMs in India | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/history-of-electronic-voting-machine-evms-in-india/article68015562.ece)

The article from The Hindu provides a comprehensive history and analysis of the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in India. It traces the journey from the first trial of EVMs in the 1982 Paravur Assembly elections to their widespread use in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The EVM was introduced as a solution to the logistical challenges and fraud associated with paper ballots. Despite initial controversies and legal challenges, EVMs were constitutionally validated and fully replaced ballot papers in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

Over the years, the technology has faced skepticism regarding its transparency and reliability, with concerns about potential tampering and the lack of a verifiable paper trail. This led to the introduction of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in 2013, which produces a paper slip for voter verification. The 2019 elections were the first to use EVMs backed 100% by VVPAT machines. However, issues persist, including mismatches in vote counts and questions about the software integrity within EVMs.

The Supreme Court's recent order for a detailed counting of VVPAT slips aims to enhance the electoral process's integrity. Despite technological advancements and legal endorsements, there is ongoing debate among politicians and activists about the possibility of returning to paper ballots for elections. The article highlights the evolving nature of voting technology and the continuous efforts to balance efficiency, transparency, and security in India's electoral system.

Global university rankings have gained significant influence in higher education, leading some institutions to allocate resources to improve their rankings. However, concerns have been raised about the systems' incentives and the companies behind them. Issues include conflicts of interest, as companies that create rankings sometimes consult with universities to help them improve their positions. Additionally, universities provide these companies with access to their data without permission. Critics argue that rankings oversimplify complex university roles and prioritize research excellence based on factors like citations, which can be manipulated. In response, several prominent universities have withdrawn from traditional rankings, recognizing their potential to promote harmful behaviors and negative long-term effects.

The Supreme Court has prohibited Patanjali Ayurved from discrediting allopathy and advertising products that claim to cure chronic conditions. This is because Patanjali's ads present their products as a 'permanent relief,' which is "misleading" and violates the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. The court also issued a contempt notice against Patanjali and its Managing Director Acharya Balkrishna for failing to adhere to directions passed in November last year. The case was filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in response to Patanjali ads that allegedly denigrated allopathy and made exaggerated claims about its drugs. Patanjali has been previously found to have sold substandard products and failed to comply with drug manufacturing standards. Despite being warned by the court in November 2023, Patanjali continued to make misleading claims in its advertisements. The court has now temporarily banned all forms of advertisements for Patanjali's medicinal products. The case will be heard next on March 19.

**India's Gaganyaan Mission**

India's Gaganyaan Mission aims to send astronauts to low-earth orbit with a launch scheduled for 2025. The mission includes:

* **Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3):** Three-stage rocket to launch the orbital module.
* **Orbital Module:** Crew module (for three astronauts) with parachutes and life support systems, and service module for propulsion.
* **Crew:** Four shortlisted astronaut candidates from the Indian Air Force.

The mission has been approved and several technologies have been tested, including:

* Space Capsule Recovery Experiment (SRE, 2007)
* Crew-Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE, 2014)
* Testing of CE-20 engines and other components

The crew module and life support systems will be procured externally due to a lack of domestic manufacturing capability.

The mission is part of India's space reforms, including the establishment of NSIL and IN-SPACe, and aims to establish India's self-sufficiency in sending humans to space.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, was emotional at the company's listing in 2021, seeing it as a realization of the company's goal of empowering India through digital payments. Despite its initial success, Paytm has faced regulatory hurdles and shaken investor confidence. Sharma's journey as an entrepreneur began in college, where he faced challenges with the English medium of instruction. He started XS, a content management system, and later founded One97 Communications in 2000. Paytm was launched in 2010, focusing on removing cash and promoting financial inclusion. The company's entry into lending and its ambition for a small finance bank license have been hindered by regulatory issues. Sharma's intuitive and opinionated approach to decision-making has also impacted the company's performance. As Paytm struggles with its stock price below its debut price, Sharma remains determined to preserve its profitability and fight regulatory challenges.

These highly trained Air Force test pilots will undergo rigorous training at various facilities in India and Russia. Gaganyaan aims to demonstrate human spaceflight in low-earth orbit using an Indian launch vehicle. The mission has two uncrewed test flights planned before the first crewed flight, tentatively scheduled for 2025. The crew module can accommodate up to three astronauts, but ISRO may only send one on the maiden mission, highlighting the importance of both physical and mental fitness.

### [Maharashtra’s latest Maratha quota law and its challenges | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra-latest-maratha-quota-law-and-its-challenges-explained/article67891042.ece)

The Maharashtra Assembly has passed a Bill granting 10% reservation in education and government jobs to the Maratha community. The new law is based on a survey that claims 84% of Marathas qualify as backward. However, activists are demanding a quota carved out from the existing OBC category, while OBC leaders are concerned about their share being reduced. The Bill does not affect the existing OBC quota or the issuance of Kunbi caste certificates to Marathas. Those within the "creamy layer" bracket are not eligible for the benefits. The law has been formulated based on the report of the Justice Sunil B Shukre-led Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission. It argues that exceptional circumstances justify granting reservation to the community beyond the Supreme Court-approved 50% limit. The law is unlikely to pass judicial scrutiny as the Supreme Court has previously struck down a similar law in Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, holding that the Marathas are a "dominant forward class."

### [The Italian court ruling against returning sea migrants to Libya | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-italian-court-ruling-against-returning-sea-migrants-to-libya/article67894696.ece)

In a landmark ruling, Italy's highest court declared Libya an unsafe harbor for migrants. The verdict prohibits the return of migrants rescued at sea to Libya, where they face human rights abuses in detention centers controlled by coastguards and militias. The ruling upholds the conviction of a ship captain for returning migrants to Libya in 2018, considering it a violation of international maritime and humanitarian laws. Despite the ruling, Italy and the EU continue to support Libyan authorities in intercepting migrants, allowing for the "push-back" of people to Libya's unsafe conditions. This practice is supported by right-wing parties capitalizing on anti-immigration policies, but has been met with criticism from human rights organizations.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg believes Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO is inevitable, despite concerns among member states. Russia opposes NATO expansion, viewing it as a provocation. Ukraine faces a shortage of artillery ammunition, leading to heavy casualties. Russia has suffered significant losses, but has made recent gains. The US faces Congressional resistance to aid for Ukraine from Republicans. The EU is struggling to finance its support for Ukraine's war effort. NATO is seeking to address Ukraine's concerns through increased cooperation, but full membership is not yet on the table. Ukraine's future is uncertain with potential Russian victories and the possibility of Trump's return to power.

### [On cross-voting in Rajya Sabha elections | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-cross-voting-in-rajya-sabha-elections-explained/article67901293.ece)

The Rajya Sabha elections have been marred by cross-voting from MLAs in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka. To curb this practice, the Representation of the People Act was amended in 2003 to mandate open ballot voting and the 'anti-defection' law was introduced in 1985. Despite these measures, cross-voting continues, undermining the sanctity of the election process. The Supreme Court has upheld open ballot voting for Rajya Sabha elections, but ruled that cross-voting does not warrant disqualification under the 'anti-defection' law. However, it has also held that a member's conduct within and outside the House can be considered when determining voluntary abandonment of party membership.

### [Why sustainable funding matters for India’s ‘science power’ ambition | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/sustainable-funding-science-power-ambition-india/article67884760.ece)

- India's R&D spending has declined from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 0.64% currently, despite calls to double this spending.


- India needs to spend at least 3% of GDP on R&D annually until 2047 to achieve developed nation status.


- While the private sector contributes significantly to R&D in developed countries, in India, it accounts for only 36.4% of GERD.


- The Anusandhan National Research Foundation was meant to address funding issues, but its implementation has been delayed and funding remains unclear.


- Under-utilization of allocated funds is a recurring problem, with ministries like DBT, DST, and DSIR consistently falling short of budget execution.


- To effectively utilize R&D funds, the government needs to prioritize R&D spending, streamline bureaucratic processes, and build capacity within agencies.


- Encouraging private investment through incentives and clear regulatory roadmaps is crucial to boost R&D funding.


- India needs to develop the bureaucratic capacity to evaluate science projects and monitor fund utilization to become a science power by 2047.

### [Why is NATO’s Steadfast Defender 2024 military exercise significant? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-is-natos-steadfast-defender-2024-military-exercise-significant-explained/article67873511.ece)

NATO started its largest military exercise, Steadfast Defender 2024, in response to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The exercise aims to demonstrate NATO's collective military strength and commitment to its members' security. It includes land, air, sea, cyber, and space operations, involving over 90,000 troops from 31 allies and Sweden. The first phase focuses on maritime reinforcement, while the second phase involves multi-domain exercises across Europe. Experts believe the exercise serves as a deterrent to Russia and a warning to the Kremlin. NATO allies, including the US, France, and Germany, have pledged significant financial and military support to Ukraine. The exercise is strategically located in European countries, particularly those near the Baltic Sea, due to Russia's presence in Kaliningrad. The inclusion of cyber and space operations makes the exercise relevant to modern warfare. NATO member states aim to strengthen their collaboration in real-world operations through this exercise.

China plans to loan a pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo as part of its panda diplomacy efforts. Panda diplomacy, which dates back to the Tang Dynasty, involves gifting or loaning pandas as a symbol of friendship. China stopped gifting pandas in the 1980s but now loans them for a fee, with conditions typically including proper facilities and an agreement to return offspring. While experts believe panda diplomacy has environmental implications, China has hinted at resuming panda loans to the U.S. following a meeting between President Xi and President Biden.

This article discusses the challenges faced in matching influenza and COVID-19 vaccines to the circulating strains of the viruses. Due to the long gestation period of vaccine development, strains may have drifted by the time vaccines reach the market. The effectiveness of the vaccines is influenced by the match between the strains included in the vaccine and those in circulation. The article highlights the decline in protection over time and the emergence of highly mutated variants, such as Omicron. Researchers emphasize the importance of updating vaccines to match new variants. A study suggests that updating vaccines can significantly improve neutralizing antibody titres and increase efficacy against future variants. However, there are factors to consider, including the distance between antigens in the updated vaccine and future variants. The study primarily focuses on humoral immunity conferred by antibodies and doesn't consider cellular immunity conferred by T-cells. The article also discusses the need for updated vaccines in India, taking into account the objective of preventing severe disease and the challenges of updating traditional influenza vaccines versus mRNA-based vaccines.

### [Why has South Africa dragged Israel to the ICJ? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-has-south-africa-dragged-israel-to-the-icj-explained/article67738570.ece)

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) between South Africa and Israel. South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide during its military campaign in Gaza and has invoked the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. South Africa has requested provisional measures to stop the alleged genocide. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, and only states can be parties in cases before the Court. The Genocide Convention of 1948, which both South Africa and Israel are signatories to, defines genocide as acts such as killing members of a national, racial, ethnic, or religious group. South Africa has accused Israel of causing harm to the Palestinian people in Gaza and has cited statements from Israeli officials and international organizations to support its claims. Israel, on the other hand, denies any genocidal intent and argues that its operations in Gaza are aimed at protecting its people and removing the threat posed by Hamas. The ICJ is expected to issue a ruling on provisional measures in the coming weeks, but it does not have the means to enforce its own orders. The article also mentions the possibility of the UN Security Council taking measures, but any enforcement would be subject to the veto power of permanent members, such as the United States.

The article discusses the concerns raised by passengers regarding the enrollment process for the Digi Yatra app at airports in India. Passengers reported that their facial biometrics were being collected without their consent or knowledge by security personnel and private staff. The CEO of Digi Yatra Foundation stated that the enrollment drive was intensified in December to allow passengers to experience the benefits of the app. Digi Yatra aims to streamline passenger movement at airports through digital processing. The app is owned by the Digi Yatra Foundation, which includes the Airports Authority of India and five private airports. Passengers need to download the app, register with their personal information and Aadhaar document, and upload a selfie. The app allows for facial recognition at e-gates, eliminating the need for physical boarding passes. The government claims that passenger data is not centrally stored and is purged within 24 hours. However, concerns have been raised about data protection and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is yet to be fully implemented.

### [International Court of Justice | Justice without power](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/international-court-of-justice-justice-without-power/article67738733.ece)

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest judicial body of the United Nations, recently held hearings regarding South Africa's accusation of Israel committing genocide in Gaza. The ICJ has dual jurisdictional powers, advisory and contentious, and was established in 1945 after the Permanent Court of International Justice became ineffective. The court's decisions are legally binding but often lack an enforcement mechanism. The participation of powerful member states and the court's slow procedures have also been criticized. However, the ICJ has played a role in expanding international law and has had major rulings adhered to by concerned parties. Its advisory role has also contributed to peaceful solutions and diplomatic efforts. The ongoing proceedings by South Africa will provide evidence for an advisory opinion on Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Despite its impact, the ICJ's effectiveness is hindered by political biases and the potential fragmentation of international law.

### [How a super-energetic particle from outer space could help physics | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/amaterasu-cosmic-ray-physics-explained/article67690711.ece)

According to an article titled "Japanese scientist discovers second-highest-energy cosmic ray, names it 'Amaterasu'" published on January 2, 2024, in The Hindu, Japanese scientist Toshihiro Fujii discovered a very high energy cosmic-ray event in May 2021 and named it 'Amaterasu' after the sun goddess in Japanese mythology. The discovery was made while analyzing data collected between May 2008 and November 2021 by the Telescope Array Project in the U.S. Cosmic rays are streams of energetic particles and clusters of particles from outer space and the sun. The Amaterasu cosmic ray had an energy of 240 exa-electron-volt (EeV), which is about 40 million times higher than the energy imbued in protons by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The discovery of the Amaterasu cosmic ray could potentially help in spotting more such events and understanding their properties. The article also mentions that the Amaterasu particle appears to have come from an empty part of the universe, suggesting the possibility of unknown astronomical phenomena and new physical origins beyond the Standard Model. The article proposes three possible explanations for the particle's origin: it could be from an unidentified source, it may have interacted with a stronger magnetic field than currently accounted for, or scientists may need to rethink their understanding of high-energy particle physics.

### [What is radiocarbon dating? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/radiocarbon-dating-history-science-revolution-politics-explained/article67692713.ece)

Radiocarbon dating is a method that uses the isotope carbon-14 to determine the age of an object. Carbon-14 is created in the Earth's atmosphere when cosmic rays collide with gas atoms and release neutrons. These neutrons can then interact with nitrogen-14 to produce carbon-14. This carbon-14 is constantly being created in the atmosphere and enters the bodies of plants, animals, and other biomass through the carbon cycle. When an organism is alive, it constantly exchanges carbon with its surroundings, maintaining a nearly constant concentration of carbon-14. However, when the organism dies, the concentration of carbon-14 begins to decrease through radioactive decay. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 remaining in an object, scientists can estimate how long ago the organism died [[1]].

Radiocarbon dating was first proposed by the American physical chemist Willard Libby in 1946. Libby's idea was based on the assumption that the concentration of carbon-14 in the Earth's atmosphere remains constant over thousands of years and that carbon-14 can diffuse into the Earth's ecosystems. These assumptions were later proven to be valid. Libby and his colleagues tested the technique by dating objects whose ages were already known and found that it could accurately estimate their ages [[1]].

The technique of radiocarbon dating has since been refined and improved. In the past, the Geiger counter was used to study radioactive decay and measure the amount of carbon-14 in a sample. Today, more sophisticated methods like accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) are used. AMS can work with very small organic samples and can isolate and examine all the carbon-14 in a sample to estimate its age [[1]].

Radiocarbon dating has had a significant impact on fields such as archaeology and geology. It has allowed researchers to date archaeological sites, compare the ages of objects found at different sites, and gain a clearer understanding of the past. It has provided insights into human migration, the rise and fall of civilizations, the evolution of languages and religions, and the Earth's climate changes [[1]].

In India, radiocarbon dating has also been of political significance, as it has been used to date objects retrieved from temples and mosques. Researchers continue to refine the technique and address any remaining flaws. For example, in 2018, archaeologists reported evidence of the radiocarbon cycle deviating from the expected version between 1610 and 1940, which could affect radiocarbon dating during those periods. In 2020, researchers developed a way to improve the time resolution of radiocarbon dating, allowing for more precise dating within a year [[1]].

Overall, radiocarbon dating has revolutionized our ability to date organic remains and has provided valuable insights into the history of humanity and the Earth [[1]].

The article discusses the recent summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, held in San Francisco on November 15. The main focus of the summit was to revive the bilateral relationship between the two countries, which has reached its lowest point since diplomatic ties were established in 1979. One significant outcome was the decision to restore military-to-military communications between the two nuclear weapons states, aimed at preventing potential miscalculations. These channels had been closed since Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022, which China considered a violation of the status quo. The article also highlights the economic and trade tensions between the two countries, including export bans and blacklisting of companies. Despite these conflicts, there appears to be a subtle shift towards exploring pragmatic avenues of coexistence rather than disengagement or 'decoupling'.

Javier Milei, the newly elected president of Argentina, has gained attention for his controversial views and economic proposals. He is known for opposing abortion and having a mixed stance on Argentina's military government's actions. In terms of economics, Milei campaigned to replace the Argentine peso with the US dollar, eliminate the Central Bank, and reduce government spending. With Argentina suffering from high inflation and poverty rates, many voters supported Milei's unconventional policies. However, he has already begun to backtrack on some of his promises, stating that dollarization will be a "medium-term" goal and ruling out an immediate removal of currency controls. The article explores the potential benefits and challenges of dollarization, citing examples of Ecuador, Panama, and El Salvador as successful cases. Dollarization can help curb hyperinflation by breaking the link between rising prices and increasing money supply. It can also incentivize export-focused growth and long-term planning due to the stability of the dollar. However, critics argue that adopting a foreign currency limits policy leverage and poses risks, as seen in Greece during the Eurozone crisis. While dollarization alone may not be a cure-all solution, when combined with effective domestic policies, it can contribute to economic success. The author raises concerns about Milei's plans to slash government spending and abolish the Central Bank, suggesting that Argentina's policy space might shrink under his administration. The outcome of this economic gamble awaits the judgment of the suffering populace.

### [What are fibre optic cables and how do they work? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fibre-optic-cables-explained/article67579264.ece)

The article discusses the importance of optical fibers in communication and how they work. Optical fibers are thin strands of glass that can transmit information across long distances at the speed of light. They are strong, flexible, and durable, making them ideal for underground or underwater installations.

The concept of using glass fibers for communication was initially proposed by physicist Charles Kao, who received a Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking achievements in fiber optic communication. Light signals can be guided through optical fibers using the principle of total internal reflection, which allows the signals to bounce between the walls of the glass with minimal loss of power.

A fiber optic communication system consists of a transmitter that encodes information into optical signals, an optical fiber that carries the signals, and a receiver that reproduces the information. Unlike other communication mediums, fiber optic cables are not affected by external disturbances such as bad weather or lightning.

The development of fiber optics can be traced back to the early 19th century when scientists demonstrated the guiding of light through water jets and bent glass rods. Early optical fibers were prone to damage and leaks, but advancements in the 1950s and 1960s improved their performance.

Today, optical fibers are manufactured using the fiber-drawing technique, where a high-purity glass rod is melted and drawn into a thin fiber. These fibers have a typical loss of less than 0.2 dB per kilometer. Fiber optics technology is widely used in various fields, including telecommunication, medical science, laser technology, and sensing.

The article also mentions India's national mission on quantum technologies and applications, which aims to promote secure communication and quantum science. The possibilities of fiber optic networks and their integration with quantum optics suggest a new era in communication infrastructure.

### [Why is Bihar demanding the Special Category Status? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-is-bihar-demanding-the-special-category-status-explained/article67577691.ece)

The Bihar Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, has passed a resolution seeking special category status (SCS) for the state. The demand is based on the findings of the "Bihar Caste-based Survey, 2022," which revealed that nearly one-third of the population in Bihar lives in poverty. The SCS classification is granted by the Centre to support the development of states facing geographical or socio-economic disadvantages. It was introduced in 1969 and takes into account factors such as hilly terrain, low population density, strategic location along international borders, economic and infrastructural backwardness, and non-viable state finances. Initially, three states were granted SCS, and since then, eight more states have received it. Previously, SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, but after the abolition of the Planning Commission, this assistance has been incorporated into increased devolution of funds for all states. SCS states also benefit from favorable funding ratios for centrally sponsored schemes and other incentives like tax concessions to attract investments. Bihar has consistently been one of the poorest states, with a per-capita GDP of around ₹54,000. CM Nitish Kumar believes that granting SCS to Bihar will provide around ₹2.5 lakh crore required for various welfare measures over the next five years. Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have also requested SCS, but their demands have been denied by the Central government. Although Bihar meets most of the criteria for SCS, it doesn't fulfill the requirement of hilly terrain and geographically difficult areas. In 2013, the Raghuram Rajan Committee suggested an alternative methodology based on a 'multi-dimensional index' to address Bihar's socio-economic backwardness.

The article discusses India's position and actions regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. India has condemned terrorism and shown support for Israel while also advocating for restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy. The country supports a two-state solution and has provided humanitarian assistance to Palestine. However, there have been some shifts in India's stance, including abstaining from a UNGA vote calling for a ceasefire and voting in favor of resolutions critical of Israeli practices. This departure from its traditional alignment with the Global South and closer ties with Israel could impact India's relationships with other countries, such as those in the Gulf and Arab world. The article highlights the potential implications for trade initiatives and relations with Iran. The Modi government is also cautious about being overly critical of Qatar due to ongoing negotiations and the country's support for Hamas.

### [Geert Wilders | Out of the wilderness](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/geert-wilders-out-of-the-wilderness/article67574362.ece)

In the recent general elections in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders and his far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) emerged victorious, winning 37 out of 150 seats. This exceeded all expectations and marked a significant increase from their previous tally. The centre-left Labour/Green coalition came in second with 25 seats, and the outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) secured only 24 seats. Another major winner was the conservative National Social Contract (NSC), a new party led by Peter Omtzigt, which gained 20 seats.

The Dutch political landscape is highly fragmented, with no single party winning a clear majority. Typically, the party with the most seats attempts to form a coalition government. Rutte had been the Prime Minister since 2010, but his coalition collapsed in July 2023 due to various challenges. His government faced criticism from farmers opposing its nitrogen bill and disagreement among coalition partners regarding restrictions on family reunifications of asylum-seekers. These issues led to the government's resignation and the subsequent elections. Rutte also announced that he would not contest again.

Notably, Wilders is a former VVD leader and one-time mentor of Rutte. He left the party due to its perceived leniency on migration. Wilders is known for his extreme anti-Islam and anti-immigrant rhetoric, advocating for banning the Quran, shutting down mosques, and prohibiting headscarves in government buildings. His stance against Islam intensified after the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh in 2004, coinciding with the launch of his PVV party.

Apart from his anti-Islam views, Wilders is pro-Israel and supports shifting the Dutch Embassy to Jerusalem while closing its diplomatic post in Ramallah. He is also strongly Eurosceptic, desiring the Netherlands' exit from the European Union (EU) through a 'Nexit' referendum. His policy proposals include restoring Dutch border control, deporting undocumented migrants, implementing work permits for intra-EU workers, and adopting a 'Netherlands First' foreign policy. These positions raise concerns for the EU.

Wilders aims to become the Prime Minister rather than being part of a ruling coalition. However, this may be challenging given his political beliefs. The VVD's new leader, Dilan Yesilgoz-Zegerius, has already ruled out supporting a Wilders government, as have the Labour-Green coalition. On the other hand, Omtzigt from NSC has expressed interest in working with Wilders, and their combined seats could attract smaller parties to cross the halfway mark of 75 seats. Nonetheless, negotiations would be difficult and time-consuming, possibly taking several months.

In pursuit of power, Wilders has shown some willingness to compromise on his radical agenda. He slightly softened his anti-Islam stance during the elections, stating that he would respect the Dutch Constitution. Critics accused him of opportunism, but he may believe that compromising on Islam won't cost him politically as long as he can build consensus around his core anti-immigrant agenda, which seems to have more common ground across the political spectrum.

Regardless of whether Wilders becomes the Prime Minister, he will remain an influential figure in the next government. This aligns with the broader trend of far-right politicians and parties gaining influence across Europe. Leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orban, Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Sweden's Sweden Democrats, and others in power were among the first to congratulate Wilders on his victory.

### [What factors led to the turmoil at OpenAI? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-factors-led-to-the-turmoil-at-openai-explained/article67574326.ece)

The article discusses the recent turmoil at OpenAI, a leading AI company. The founder and CEO, Sam Altman, was initially ousted by the board of directors but was reinstated a few days later. The conflict arose from a contradiction within OpenAI's mission: to advance AI research for the benefit of humanity while also needing financial returns to support costly AI projects. OpenAI started a for-profit wing, which led to tensions between the non-profit organization and the commercial exploitation of AI. The release of ChatGPT, a popular AI tool, attracted investors and increased OpenAI's valuation. Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. The board's coup attempt blindsided Microsoft, which expressed support for Altman's return. Eventually, Altman was reinstated as CEO, and most coup instigators resigned. The article highlights the clash between those focused on effective altruism and reducing AI risks and those advocating for technological acceleration.

The estimated number of measles cases globally reached nine million, with 136,000 deaths, mostly among children. The Union Health Ministry in India disputed a part of the report which stated that globally, 22 million children did not receive their first measles shot in 2022, with half of them residing in 10 countries, including India. The ministry claimed that only about 21,000 Indian children missed their measles vaccine dose. They emphasized that efforts have been made to ensure all children receive their missed or due doses of the measles vaccine. Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. The WHO highlighted that routine immunization efforts have been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving millions of children at risk. Vaccination campaigns and catch-up vaccinations are being conducted to address this issue.

### [COP28: What is Carbon Dioxide Removal? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/what-is-carbon-dioxide-removal-explained/article67569642.ece)

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has emphasized the need for countries to surpass their current pledges under the Paris Agreement in order to limit global warming. The UNEP's Emissions Gap report states that delaying greenhouse gas emissions reduction will increase reliance on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. However, there are uncertainties and risks associated with scaling up CDR methods, including land competition and political and economic challenges.

Various CDR methods exist, such as afforestation, biochar, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced rock weathering, and ocean alkalinity enhancement. Afforestation involves converting agricultural lands into forests to sequester carbon, but improper location choices can lead to competition for land needed for food production. Biochar is produced through the controlled burning of organic waste and is a stable form of carbon that can be safely stored. BECCS combines biomass energy production with carbon capture and storage. DACCS extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere and stores it underground or uses it for other applications. Enhanced rock weathering pulverizes silicate rocks, which are spread on agricultural lands to absorb CO2. Ocean alkalinity enhancement involves adding alkaline substances to seawater to convert dissolved CO2 into stable forms of carbon.

Each method has its own costs and drawbacks. Afforestation is relatively cheaper, costing under $240 per tonne of CO2, while biochar can cost between $10 and $345 per tonne of CO2. BECCS costs between $50 and $200 per tonne of CO2. DACCS is the most expensive method, typically ranging from $100 to $300 per tonne of CO2. Enhanced rock weathering costs $50 to $200 per tonne of CO2, and ocean alkalinity enhancement costs approximately $40 to $260 per tonne of CO2.

It is important to consider governance and policies for CDR methods to minimize adverse side effects. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends integrating CDR into existing climate policy frameworks and establishing reliable measurement, reporting, and verification of carbon flows.

### [What is RBI’s latest move to increase risk weight for lending about? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/what-is-rbis-latest-move-to-increase-risk-weight-for-lending-about-explained/article67553551.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has instructed banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to reserve more capital for risk weights in order to control the rise in unsecured personal loans and credit cards. The mandatory risk weight requirement has been increased by 25 percentage points, leading to higher capital requirements for lenders and potentially higher lending rates for consumers. The RBI aims to address credit risk, which refers to the risk associated with borrowers being unable to meet their obligations. The increased risk weight applies to unsecured personal loans, credit cards, and lending to NBFCs. Additionally, the RBI has raised concerns about the growth in consumer credit and the dependency of NBFCs on bank borrowings. The new directions come into effect immediately and must be adhered to by February-end of the following year. Moody's ratings agency states that the higher risk weights are intended to curb lenders' appetite for consumer loan growth. Unsecured personal loans have increased by approximately 23% year-over-year, while delinquencies for all personal loans stood at 0.84% for loans overdue by more than 90 days. Concerns arise for loans below Rs 50,000, where delinquencies stood at 5.4% as of June this year. S&P ratings agency suggests that slower loan growth and increased risk management will likely improve asset quality in the Indian banking system but may result in higher interest rates, reduced capital adequacy, and impact profitability.

### [What the OECD report says of climate finance ahead of COP 28 | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/oecd-report-climate-finance-cop-28-explained/article67555060.ece)

A report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revealed that economically developed countries failed to meet their promise of jointly mobilizing $100 billion per year for climate mitigation and adaptation in developing nations. In 2021, developed countries only mobilized $89.6 billion, with a 14% decrease in finance for adaptation compared to the previous year. The report sheds light on the financing strategies of rich countries ahead of the COP 28 climate talks in the United Arab Emirates. It also highlights the failure of developed nations to double adaptation finance as pledged during the COP 26 talks in 2020. The lack of adequate climate finance reduces the ability of developing countries to address climate change and undermines trust between poorer and wealthier nations. The report exposes that a significant portion of public climate financing is provided as loans, potentially exacerbating debt stress in poorer countries. Additionally, the report raises concerns about additionality, as developed countries often classify existing aid as climate finance, violating the principle of providing new and additional resources. The absence of a clear definition of climate finance allows richer countries to arbitrarily categorize funding, including high-cost loans and development aid, as climate finance, evading scrutiny. The report also questions the role of the private sector in climate action, showing stagnation in private financing for climate initiatives over the past decade. Ultimately, fulfilling the climate finance challenge rests with public funding from governments in developed countries and multilateral development banks.

Government and non-governmental organizations in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Punjab have released mosquitofish into local water bodies to address mosquito problems. However, these fish have become invasive and are causing ecological and environmental issues. Mosquitofish were introduced in India in the 1920s as a biological control method for mosquitoes, but they have since spread and displaced native species. The World Health Organization stopped recommendingThe article discusses the widespread introduction of mosquitofish, specifically Gambusia affinis and Gambusia holbrooki, in various water bodies in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Punjab to control mosquito populations. These fish were initially introduced as a biological control method to feed on mosquito larvae and reduce mosquito-borne diseases. However, the unintended consequences of their introduction have led to severe ecological problems. The mosquitofish, originally from the U.S., have become invasive species, displacing native fauna and threatening freshwater ecosystems. Studies from other countries have shown similar negative effects. Despite recommendations against their use by organizations like the World Health Organisation, government and non-governmental organizations in India continue to introduce these fish for mosquito control. The article suggests that more stringent measures are needed to prevent further introductions and protect indigenous aquatic biodiversity. It also proposes exploring local alternative solutions involving collaboration between experts in different fields to identify native fish species capable of controlling mosquito larvae without causing ecological harm.

Workers in Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector are demanding a trebling of their minimum wages, sparking protests and strikes. Bangladesh is the world's second-largest exporter of fast fashion, and the RMG sector plays a significant role in the country's economy. The sector's main markets are the US, UK, Europe, and Canada. The RMG sector has been credited with reducing poverty in the country, but rising inflation and a decline in foreign exchange reserves have put pressure on workers' wages. Garment worker unions are demanding a minimum wage of BDT 23,000 ($208), while economists suggest a minimum living wage of BDT 33,368 ($302). The global fashion industry is also under scrutiny for its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.

### [The controversy over land acquisition by the SIPCOT near Cheyyar in Tamil Nadu | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-controversy-over-land-acquisition-by-the-sipcot-near-cheyyar-town-in-tiruvannamalai-tamil-nadu-explained/article67546954.ece)

This article discusses the ongoing protests in Tiruvannamalai district, Tamil Nadu, over the proposed land acquisition by the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) for its Phase-III project near Cheyyar town. The article explains that SIPCOT had previously acquired land in the area for its Phase-I and Phase-II projects, which now house several companies and provide employment to thousands of people. However, the plans for Phase-III have sparked mass protests by farmers and local residents who are concerned about the loss of their cultivable lands and livelihoods. The situation escalated when 20 individuals were arrested, leading to criticism from civil society members and activists. The Chief Minister later ordered the release of six of the seven individuals detained under the Goondas Act. The government argues that the land identified for Phase-III mostly consists of wastelands, but those affected claim that their farming lands are under cultivation and fear inadequate compensation. Local activists and elected representatives are calling for the administration to address the concerns of affected farmers and offer alternative employment opportunities. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of gaining the trust of the local community, particularly by addressing the issue of permanent jobs for affected families in the Phase-III complex.

### [What community forest resources say about India’s forest plans | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/community-forest-resources-conservation-moefcc-explained/article67551233.ece)

The article discusses the Forest Rights Act (FRA) enacted by the Indian Parliament in 2006. The FRA was designed to address the insecure rights of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers who were historically marginalized. It recognizes the need to protect forest rights on ancestral lands and habitat and aims to usher in democratic forest governance. The FRA grants various rights, such as individual rights for homestead and cultivation, community rights for common purposes, development rights for public utilities, and governance rights over community forest resources.

The article highlights that despite the enactment of the FRA, there have been ongoing challenges with its implementation. Many forest areas that should have come under the habitation-level Gram Sabhas, the primary authority to determine and approve these rights, have not been recognized. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has issued titles for forest rights in 18% of forest land, but it is unclear how much of this land is titled to the Gram Sabha as Community Forest Resource (CFR). The bureaucracy has been reluctant to generate CFR claims and recognize them.

The article also mentions that several other laws related to forests, wildlife, and biodiversity have not been aligned with the FRA. Amendments have been made to include violation of forest rights under the Atrocities Act and the Right to Fair Compensation Act, but these provisions are often not honored.

In conclusion, the author emphasizes the importance of defending the Forest Rights Act and empowering forest dwellers to protect their rights, especially in the face of climate change and ongoing dispossession.

### [‘Strong evidence’ unusual nitrogen-9 nucleus exists, scientists say](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nitrogen-9-nucleus-stability-challenge-nuclear-structure/article67550743.ece)

A recent study published in Physical Review Letters focused on investigating the existence of an unusual isotope called nitrogen-9. This isotope has a high proton-to-neutron ratio, making it unstable and challenging to classify. The study used experimental techniques to examine the characteristics of nitrogen-9 atoms produced from the collision of oxygen-13 with beryllium-9. The researchers observed distinct energy peaks in the nitrogen-9 resonant states, indicating stability and specific nuclear reactions. The findings provide strong evidence for the existence of nitrogen-9 and offer new insights into subatomic structures. This discovery expands the nuclide chart, which represents isotopes' relationships based on their number of protons and neutrons. Understanding such exotic isotopes is crucial for nuclear physics and astrophysical processes, aiding in the modeling of element synthesis in stars.

The Georgia state election fraud case involving former President Donald Trump and his allies has gained attention once again following the guilty pleas of several defendants. Among them is attorney Sidney Powell, a close ally of Trump, who pleaded guilty to six misdemeanors related to conspiracy to interfere with election conduct. Powell had advanced the theory that Dominion Voting Machines conspired with Venezuelan intelligence to manipulate the election results. Another potential witness against Trump is lawyer Jenna Ellis, who pleaded guilty to amplifying false claims about the election. Kenneth Chesebro, another pro-Trump lawyer, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to filing false documents. These guilty pleas could encourage others to cooperate with prosecutors. The Georgia indictment is separate from a federal indictment filed against Trump for conspiracy to defraud the US and disenfranchise voters.

The Tamil Nadu Governor, R. N. Ravi, has withheld assent for certain Bills passed by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, following the Supreme Court expressing concern over delays by Governors in giving assent to Bills. According to Article 200 of the Constitution, the Governor has four alternatives when presented with a Bill for assent: give assent, withhold assent, return the Bill for reconsideration, or reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President. The Governor is required to act as per the advice of the Council of Ministers and does not exercise discretionary powers. The return of a Bill for reconsideration is also based on ministerial advice. The Governor must reserve certain Bills for the consideration of the President, but this is only done in rare cases. The politicization of the gubernatorial post has been a problem in the federal set up, and there have been calls for the abolition of the Governor's post in the past. The Supreme Court has urged Governors and Chief Ministers to do some soul-searching, and it has been suggested that Chief Ministers should be consulted before the appointment of Governors and that Governors should be removable through impeachment by the State Legislature. These amendments would result in responsible cooperation between the Central and State Governments in the appointment and functioning of Governors.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. In a recent study published in the journal Cell, scientists have successfully generated a live chimeric monkey, which is a monkey composed of cells from more than one distinct genotype. The researchers extracted embryonic stem cells from one-week-old embryos of Cynomolgus monkeys and modified their DNA to include a green fluorescent protein (GFP). These modified cells were then injected into recipient embryos and implanted into surrogate female monkeys, resulting in the birth of six full-term offspring. The chimeric monkey exhibited a high degree of chimerism in various tissues, including the eyes, brain, heart, kidney, and more. This study opens up new possibilities for using non-human primates as models for biomedical applications. However, ethical considerations and limitations need to be addressed before considering human biomedical applications.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) due to government interference. The ICC stated that SLC breached its obligations as a member by allowing government involvement in the governance of cricket in Sri Lanka. This suspension came after Sri Lanka's Sports Minister sacked the SLC board and appointed former captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead an interim committee. However, the Court of Appeal issued a stay order and reinstated the SLC regime, leading to further conflict between the government and SLC. The ICC requires its members to manage their affairs autonomously, free from government interference. Sri Lanka is the second full ICC member to be suspended for such reasons, following Zimbabwe in 2019. The consequences of this suspension will be determined after the ICC board meeting. Sri Lanka's government plans to approach the ICC's dispute resolution committee and, if necessary, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.

Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has reemerged in the political arena as the country's new Foreign Secretary. This comes seven years after his resignation following the Brexit referendum, which he campaigned against. Cameron's political career began in the Conservative Party, where he held various positions before becoming party leader in 2005. He led the party for 11 years, implementing austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit. However, his tenure was marred by international events such as the Arab Spring and the intervention in Libya, for which he faced criticism for a lack of coherent strategy. Historians have summarized his legacy as being defined by Europe, similar to Tony Blair's association with Iraq. Cameron's recent appointment is overshadowed by concerns over the Greensill Capital scandal, where he was accused of showing poor judgement while lobbying government officials.

### [Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement | Limited peace, unlimited tensions](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/border-peace-and-tranquility-agreement-limited-peace-unlimited-tensions/article67548733.ece)

The article discusses the Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement (BPTA) signed between India and China in 1993, which aimed to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in their border areas. The agreement was significant as it marked the first time both countries legally committed to respecting the status quo and reducing the risk of unplanned confrontations. However, the limited nature of the agreement led to an infrastructure race and increasing incidents between the two countries since 2013.

The article highlights that the ongoing border crisis, with over 100,000 troops deployed from both sides near the LAC, has rendered the commitments of the BPTA invalid. One of the main reasons for the breakdown is the ambiguity surrounding the LAC, as India and China have differing perceptions of its location. The BPTA attempted to address this by stating that both sides would clarify the LAC where necessary, but it did not conclusively reject China's version of the LAC from November 7, 1959.

Despite the shortcomings of the BPTA, it paved the way for subsequent agreements, such as Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field along the LAC in 1996, and the appointment of Special Representatives in 2003. However, negotiations for a final settlement of the boundary have stalled, and mechanisms designed to maintain peace have come under increasing stress.

The current border crisis, which began in April 2020, has further strained relations between India and China. While military commanders continue to meet to work out new Confidence Building Measures in this context, the process of settling the boundary dispute has almost completely halted. The article concludes that the India-China border remains unsettled, and it remains to be seen if the current crisis will lead to a transformative moment in their relationship.

### [The unusual ‘mutations’ that protect humans from viruses | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/paramutations-viruses-pirna-cluster-study-explained/article67538884.ece)

The article discusses the concept of paramutations in genetics and their potential role in protecting humans against viruses. Paramutations are small chemical modifications of chromosomal proteins that can silence genes and make them resistant to viral infections. The piRNA cluster, a type of gene, plays a crucial role in this process by producing short pieces of RNA called piRNA, which guide the destruction of targeted RNA or turn off targeted genes. The article explains how paramutation amplifies the antiviral action of piRNA clusters and helps fly populations become virus resistant faster. The study also uncovers the mechanism by which piRNA from one cluster can paramutate viral DNA copies inserted elsewhere in the genome. However, not all viral insertions are amenable to paramutation, and the reasons behind this are still unknown. The article highlights that paramutation is still a relatively undiscovered phenomenon, and further research is needed to understand its intricacies.

The world's first vaccine for chikungunya has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. The vaccine, called Ixchiq, has been developed by Valneva, a European vaccine manufacturer. It is approved for administration in individuals who are 18 years or older and at increased risk of exposure to the virus. The vaccine was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, which allows the FDA to clear products for serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of effectiveness. Chikungunya is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and is characterized by severe joint pain, impaired mobility, and fever. The vaccine contains a live, weakened version of the chikungunya virus and is administered as a single dose by injection into the muscle. Common side effects reported by vaccine recipients include headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, nausea, and tenderness at the injection site. The effectiveness of the vaccine was evaluated based on immune response data from clinical studies conducted in the U.S. This approval is seen as an important advancement in the prevention of chikungunya, which currently has limited treatment options.

### [On the sub-categorisation within castes | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-the-sub-categorisation-within-castes-explained/article67541707.ece)

The article discusses the issue of sub-categorization of Scheduled Castes (SCs) in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to address the concerns of the Madiga community, who feel that their representation is being overshadowed by another SC community, the Malas. Several states have attempted to implement reservation laws to sub-categorize SCs and allocate separate quotas for different subcategories. However, these plans are currently held up in court as the Supreme Court forms a larger Constitution Bench to decide on the matter.

The Andhra Pradesh government had previously formed a commission to recommend sub-categorization based on evidence of communities being more backward and having less representation. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that states do not have the power to unilaterally sub-categorize communities in the list of SCs and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as this can only be done by Parliament and notified by the President.

In a contradiction to the 2004 judgment, a five-judge bench in 2020 stated that deciding on the quantum of benefits within the lists of SCs/STs would not amount to "tinkering" with it and that states could do so. This contradiction has also been referred to the larger bench.

While the question of sub-categorization remains pending with the Supreme Court, the Union government explored legal options in 2005 and the Attorney-General of India opined that it was possible to sub-categorize SCs if there was sufficient evidence and a constitutional amendment was made. However, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) expressed that a constitutional amendment was unnecessary, as Article 16(4) already allowed states to create special laws for underrepresented backward classes.

The arguments for sub-categorization revolve around addressing graded inequalities among SC communities, where some communities have better access to basic facilities, leaving the more backward communities at a disadvantage. However, both the SC and ST Commissions argue that separate reservations within categories would not solve the root problem, as the most backward SCs lag so far behind that they would not have enough candidates to benefit from higher-level reserved posts. They recommend focusing on ensuring existing schemes and government benefits reach these sections first.

Legal experts highlight the need for concrete population numbers and socio-economic data of each community to support sub-categorization. This information is crucial in determining how castes can be categorized and what percentage of benefits should be allocated to each group.

### [How many forces are there in nature, really? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nature-fundamental-forces-counting-problem-explained/article67531853.ece)

This article discusses the concept of fundamental forces in physics. It starts by comparing the idea of "The Force" from Star Wars to the scientific understanding of force. There are four fundamental types of interactions between elementary particles that give rise to all the forces we encounter: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak force, and strong force. 

Gravity is the most well-known force but is still not fully understood in modern physics. It is the weakest of the fundamental forces and keeps objects from floating away. The electromagnetic force is stronger and plays a role in various everyday phenomena like television and magnets. The weak force only acts on specific particles and is responsible for radiation used in nuclear medicine. The strong force binds atomic nuclei together and powers the sun through nuclear fusion.

Each force is mediated by a force-carrier particle: graviton for gravity, photon for electromagnetism, W bosons and Z boson for weak force, and gluons for strong force. However, the classification of fundamental forces based on force-carriers is not always straightforward, as there can be additional force-carriers beyond the four known ones.

Furthermore, the distinction between fundamental forces becomes more complex when considering the symmetries in the equations that describe these interactions. For example, the electroweak force, which combines electromagnetism and the weak force, was once a single force after the Big Bang before breaking into two forces.

Gravity stands apart from the other forces because it is associated with the curvature of spacetime according to Einstein's theory of general relativity. While the other forces are described within energy fields, gravity is described by the geometry of spacetime.

In conclusion, while it is commonly stated that there are four fundamental forces, the true understanding of these forces is more nuanced and evolving as scientists delve deeper into the mathematical regularities and symmetries underlying them.

### [Why is the amnesty deal by Spain’s government contentious? |  Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-is-the-amnesty-deal-by-spains-government-contentious-explained/article67533445.ece)

Spain's socialist government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, has struck a controversial amnesty deal with the Catalan separatist party, Together for Catalonia, in order to secure another term for Sanchez. Carles Puigdemont, former regional president of Catalonia and a member of the European Parliament, has offered his party's support in exchange for amnesty for himself and others involved in the failed Catalan independence bid in 2017. However, the approval of the amnesty legislation is not guaranteed, and critics argue that it undermines the principle of equality before the law. Spain has seen widespread protests in response to the deal, and there are concerns about the potential for violence. This move by Sanchez contradicts his previous stance against granting amnesty to separatists. The opposition People's Party and far-right Vox party view it as a ploy by Sanchez to hold onto power. Spain's political landscape has been marked by post-electoral stalemate and the rise of smaller parties on the extreme ends of the spectrum. There is uncertainty about the outcome of another general election, and no clear vision of Spain's next government has emerged since the elections in July. Currently, Sanchez's government is allied with extreme left parties, including separatist parties from Basque and Catalonia, but concerns over the cost of collaboration with these parties may be exaggerated.

### [Community rights and forest conservation | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/community-rights-and-forest-conservation-explained/article67529937.ece)

The Forest Conservation Amendment Act of 2023 aims to address climate change and deforestation, but it neglects the rights of indigenous communities. The amendment removes forests from the law's jurisdiction, allowing for economic exploitation. It only applies to specific areas and excludes forests converted for non-forest use after 1996. The government can construct security measures and implement initiatives like ecotourism in these areas, which has drawn criticism from tribal communities and human rights activists. The Forest Conservation Act faced opposition from private landowners and organizations involved in conservation who believe it hinders industrial progress. The Bill passed without substantial debates or discussions, excluding collaborative discussions with southern States. Concerns have been raised about obstructing indigenous rights if forests are removed from the Act's purview. The recent amendments remove the necessity for tribal consent for alterations to forests, but State governments hesitate to involve Adivasi grama sabhas due to perceived anti-development sentiments. Compensatory afforestation projects face challenges, and the new amendment does not specify the types of trees to be planted. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) is seen as an impediment to converting forest land, leading to a reduction or dilution of forest areas instead of amending the FRA. The amendment also fails to address human-animal conflicts in forest areas. The implementation of the law presents challenges to forest-dwelling communities and government agencies. The concept of afforestation clashes with forest governance and decentralization, and defining strategic linear projects becomes complex. Internal environmental security is not guaranteed, despite being a significant concern in disaster-prone states.

### [Explained | The Agartala-Akhaura rail link](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-the-agartala-akhaura-rail-link/article67516621.ece)

On November 1, 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina virtually inaugurated the rail link between Agartala and Akhaura, which connects India's northeast with Bangladesh. The rail link is expected to re-establish connectivity and boost commerce between the two regions. The rail line is 12.24 km long, with 6.78 km in Bangladesh and 5.46 km in Tripura. It will reduce the travel time between Agartala and Kolkata from 31 hours to 10 hours and the distance from 1,581 km to 460 km. The project is in line with India's 'Act East Policy' and 'Neighbourhood First Policy' and aims to promote small-scale industries, tourism, and facilitate import and export activities. The total cost of the project on the Indian side is ₹862.58 crore, with additional assistance provided by the Ministry of External Affairs. Currently, there are five operational broad gauge connectivity routes between India and Bangladesh, and work is underway to connect Mahihasan railway station in Assam to Shahbazpur in Bangladesh. The rail link between Agartala and Akhaura was first suggested in 1974 and the memorandum of understanding was signed in 2010. Trade between the two countries has been growing steadily, with close to 100 cargo trains per month and approximately 2.66 metric tonnes of goods sent to Bangladesh in the previous financial year. Passenger trains also facilitate people-to-people ties between the two countries. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of rail cooperation for cross-border transportation of essential commodities, and efforts are being made to improve port and road connectivity between India and Bangladesh alongside railway initiatives [[2]](https://www.academia.edu/10431782/Government_of_the_Peoples_Republic_of_Bangladesh_Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare_HEALTH_BULLETIN).

### [‘Loss and damage’ fund talks leave developing nations at new disadvantage | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/loss-and-damage-fund-cop-28-transitional-committee-failure/article67514293.ece)

The article discusses the concept of 'loss and damage' (L&D) in relation to climate change. It explains that adaptation is the proactive response to climate change, whereas L&D represents the irreversible consequences that cannot be avoided or mitigated through adaptation. These consequences include economic losses, human casualties, and the degradation of ecosystems and cultural heritage.

The article highlights the need for affluent nations to acknowledge their historic pollution and its contribution to climate change. It mentions the establishment of the L&D fund at the 19th Conference of the Parties (COP 19) in 2013, which aimed to provide financial and technical assistance to economically developing nations experiencing L&D due to climate change. However, subsequent meetings of the Transitional Committee (TC) responsible for operationalizing the fund have failed to produce clear recommendations.

The fifth meeting of the TC (TC5) recently took place, resulting in a set of recommendations. Developing nations agreed to host the fund at the World Bank Financial Intermediary Fund for an interim period, while developed nations remained non-committal about being primary donors. There is no indication of the fund's size, and developed nations' support is voluntary, diluting the spirit and intent of the L&D fund.

The article emphasizes the lack of trust between wealthy and impoverished nations regarding historical responsibilities and climate reparations. It warns that the watering down of the L&D fund has wide-reaching implications, including threats to climate justice, increased humanitarian crises, economic consequences, environmental degradation, and security implications.

The author argues that both adaptation and L&D are essential in addressing climate change. They stress the need for rich countries to meet their obligations to reduce emissions and provide fair finance to achieve climate justice. Failure to do so may derail global climate action and strain future COP talks.

The article discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine and the potential war crimes committed by both sides. The United Nations has stated that there is evidence of war crimes being committed by Hamas and the Israeli military since October 7. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over the current conflict and has visited Gaza to gather evidence. The ICC will investigate the events in the West Bank and the families of Israeli victims have lodged a complaint alleging genocide by Hamas. The article also explains the international laws that apply to the war, such as international humanitarian law (IHL) and the Geneva Conventions. These laws require parties to distinguish between combatants and civilians, take precautionary measures to minimize harm to civilians, and give advance warning of attacks. The article highlights the applicability of these laws to the conflict and the obligations of both parties. The ICC can prosecute war crimes and genocide, and its jurisdiction extends to the Palestinian territories. However, Israel and the United States have rejected the ICC's jurisdiction. The article also mentions the support and lack of support from different nations for the ICC's intervention.

GPT-3.5: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) is currently investigating 20 IAS coaching institutes for misleading claims and unfair trade practices in their advertisements. Four of these institutes have already been fined Rs 1 lakh each. The investigation focuses on the institutes' use of testimonials without disclosing the nature of the enrolments and the course pursued by the top rank holders featured in their ads. The CCPA has found that many rank holders only took mock interviews from these institutes, which were provided free of cost. This lack of disclosure qualifies as deliberate concealment of important information and is categorized as a 'misleading advertisement' under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The penalties for first-time violations can go up to Rs 10 lakh, and subsequent violations may attract penalties up to Rs 50 lakh. The CCPA observed that the total selections claimed by the institutes being probed exceeded the recommendations by UPSC, possibly due to multiple enrolments among students. Currently, four institutes have been fined, while others are still under investigation.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article provides a simplified introduction to electric power transmission. It explains that power transmission is a crucial component of the electricity supply system, which includes generation, transmission, and distribution. Electricity is generated at power plants and transmitted through a network of stations, substations, cables, and transformers. The article highlights several key factors in power transmission:

1. **Transmission Efficiency**: The efficiency of transmission is higher at lower current and higher voltage. Transformers are used to increase voltage and reduce current before feeding into transmission lines.

2. **Cable Resistance**: The cables used for transmission have some resistance, resulting in energy loss. The thickness of the cables can be adjusted to control the amount of energy loss.

3. **Distance of Transmission**: The longer the distance of transmission, the lower the transmission cost.

4. **Alternating Current (AC)**: AC is commonly used for power transmission due to its higher transmission efficiency and ease of modification in transformers. AC voltage flips polarity, and in a three-phase AC circuit, there are three wires that transmit AC power.

The article also mentions the various components and setups involved in power transmission, such as transmission towers, insulators, circuit-breakers, transformers, and substations. It explains the role of grids in power transmission, including the storage of electrical energy, connection to different sources, and management of demand and supply.

Overall, the article provides a basic understanding of electric power transmission and its importance in the modern nation's economic development.

#### Summary:

A large number of Afghan refugees have entered the Torkham border to return home before the Pakistani government's deadline for illegal immigrants to leave or face deportation. The mass exodus was triggered by an order from Pakistan's interim government, which aims to address hyperinflation, political instability, and rising crime rates ahead of the general elections next year. The United Nations has called the decision a 'human rights catastrophe' that puts hundreds of thousands of refugees at grave risk. Human rights agencies estimate that about 60% of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are undocumented, and the new policy will worsen their situation. The Pakistani government has demolished the houses of Afghan nationals living in illegal settlements, leaving many stranded and fearing arrest. Pakistan is home to about 4 million refugees and migrants, with Afghan refugees forming a large portion of the immigrant population. The Taliban has criticized the decision and prepared temporary refugee camps to assist the returning refugees. The deportation has faced legal challenges, with human rights activists and politicians arguing that it violates people's fundamental rights. Pakistan justifies its actions by linking the migrant population to crimes and drug trafficking. However, analysts attribute the violence in the region to Pakistan's 'dual policy' of supporting certain terror groups for geopolitical goals. The international community has been urged to fulfill its responsibility to protect refugees caught in Pakistan's economic, security, and political challenges.

The collision between two passenger trains in Vizianagaram district in Andhra Pradesh, India, could have been avoided if Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) were in place. The indigenously developed TCAS called "Kavach," which is a cab signaling train control system with anti-collision features, was not installed on the route where the accident occurred. Kavach was developed over 10 years by the Indian Railways Research Designs and Standards Organization and is designed to warn train drivers of overshooting red signals and automatically apply the emergency brakes. The system utilizes radio frequency identification technology, RFID readers and equipment, and radio infrastructure to monitor train movements and transmit signals ahead. Experts believe that if Kavach was deployed more widely, it could help prevent accidents. However, the coverage for Kavach is currently limited, and it may take many years to ensure its installation on high-density routes due to the length of Indian Railways' total route. The Indian Railways has allocated funds for Kavach implementation, but it may only cover a limited distance this year.

### [The stance of the Maldives President-elect on India | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-stance-of-the-maldives-president-elect-on-india-explained/article67482140.ece)

President-elect Mohamed Muizzu of the Maldives has expressed his desire to remove Indian troops from the country upon assuming office. This stance aligns with the opposition bloc's 'India Out' campaign, which criticized outgoing President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's 'India first' foreign policy. Currently, 75 Indian military personnel are stationed in the Maldives to operate and maintain aircraft gifted by India. Muizzu's pro-China stance and emphasis on removing Indian military presence may be driven by international media framing the Maldives elections as a referendum on India and China. However, Muizzu will face challenges in handling the Indian military question while also addressing the country's economic crisis and debt obligations.

### [What has caused the recent thaw in U.S.-Venezuela ties? |  Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/what-has-caused-the-recent-thaw-in-us-venezuela-ties-explained/article67474221.ece)

Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader in Venezuela, has won a significant victory in the country's primary elections. This comes after the Biden administration agreed to ease sanctions against Venezuela's oil, gas, and mining industries in exchange for free and fair elections in 2024. The re-engagement between Washington and Caracas is partly due to the shifting geopolitical realities resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Venezuela, with its large oil reserves, has been able to withstand the effects of U.S. and EU sanctions with support from Cuba, China, Russia, and Iran. For President Maduro, the revival of ties with the U.S. could mean an end to his government's international isolation. However, it is uncertain if Machado will be allowed to challenge Maduro in the upcoming elections, as she has been disqualified from holding public office for 15 years. The Biden administration has indicated that the extent of sanctions relief will depend on Venezuela's progress towards democracy.

### [Will QR codes improve access to food labels? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/will-qr-codes-improve-access-to-food-labels-explained/article67470951.ece)

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has recommended the use of QR codes on food products to improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals. This move is important as India has a large market for packaged foods and is seeing an increase in non-communicable diseases, which can be linked to the consumption of pre-packaged foods. The CEO of Consumer Voice, Ashim Sanyal, states that this initiative will offer informed choices to consumers, but also emphasizes the need to identify unhealthy foods. The QR codes recommended by the FSSAI should provide comprehensive information about the product, including ingredients, nutritional information, allergens, manufacturing date, and contact information for customer inquiries. The inclusion of QR codes does not replace mandatory information on product labels required by regulations. The use of QR codes can improve brand image, customer loyalty, and operational efficiency for food manufacturers. The paper "Food Literacy & Food Labelling Laws - A Legal Analysis of India's Food Policy" highlights the importance of accurate and accessible food labels to prevent the further spread of non-communicable diseases. Food industry experts also note that consumers consider food packaging as important as the product itself, and the use of QR codes can enhance consumer information and influence their buying behavior. The US, India, France, and the UK are among the top users of QR codes globally. A survey revealed that a majority of respondents scanned QR codes on food products for specific information and found them helpful in making life easier.

### [Why are the China-Bhutan boundary talks significant?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-are-the-china-bhutan-boundary-talks-significant/article67462151.ece)

China and Bhutan have held their 25th round of boundary talks and signed a Cooperation Agreement on the "Responsibilities and Functions of the Joint Technical Team (JTT) on the Delimitation and Demarcation of the Bhutan-China Boundary." This marks significant progress in their efforts to resolve border disputes. The talks were held after a seven-year gap and were delayed due to the Doklam Standoff and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the two sides used the pause to hold talks at other levels, leading to the establishment of a 3-step roadmap for border resolution. Bhutan's Prime Minister stated that they are "inching towards" completing the roadmap. The roadmap involves agreeing on the border, visiting the sites on the ground, and formally demarcating the boundary. India is concerned about the discussions over Doklam, as China has proposed swapping areas under Bhutanese control with areas it claims. India is also worried about China's demand for full diplomatic relations with Bhutan and the potential for a Chinese presence in the region. Bhutan has assured that it will consider India's interests in its decisions.

### [Does India need to relook the Dam Safety Act? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/does-india-need-to-relook-the-dam-safety-act-explained/article67447034.ece)

The article discusses the recent glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in North Sikkim, India, which resulted in the destruction of the Teesta III dam. The incident highlighted the lack of early warning systems and preventive measures, as required under the Dam Safety Act (DSA) passed in late 2021. The DSA aimed to address deficient surveillance and maintenance that have led to dam failure-related disasters. It outlined key responsibilities, including the establishment of national and state-level bodies for dam safety implementation. The Act also emphasized the need for hazard classification, regular inspections, emergency action plans, flood warning systems, and safety reviews. States were required to report dam failures, and non-compliance with the Act could result in imprisonment and fines. However, experts point out the shortcomings in legislation and implementation, emphasizing the need for risk-based decision-making and transparency. They argue that dam safety information should be easily accessible to the public. Compliance with safety standards, periodic reviews, and standardized failure analysis and reporting were also highlighted as important aspects. The article concludes by mentioning how the Himachal Pradesh government recently found several hydroelectric projects guilty of non-compliance with the DSA during floods in July-August.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent study published in the Nature journal and led by the World Bank has highlighted the increased risk of flooding in urban areas in India. The study found that the expansion of cities into flood-prone areas has more than doubled since 1985. This poses significant threats to life, livelihoods, and the economy. While India is not among the most exposed countries to flood hazards, it is the third highest contributor to global settlements and has new settlements expanding into flood-prone areas. Experts emphasize the need for sustainable urban planning that accounts for flood-related risks and suggests measures such as scientific mapping of flood-prone areas, improved storm-water management plans, and resilient housing solutions.
