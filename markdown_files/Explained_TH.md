### [What led ICC to suspend Sri Lanka Cricket? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/what-led-icc-to-suspend-sri-lanka-cricket-explained/article67548636.ece)

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) due to government interference. The ICC stated that SLC breached its obligations as a member by allowing government involvement in the governance of cricket in Sri Lanka. This suspension came after Sri Lanka's Sports Minister sacked the SLC board and appointed former captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead an interim committee. However, the Court of Appeal issued a stay order and reinstated the SLC regime, leading to further conflict between the government and SLC. The ICC requires its members to manage their affairs autonomously, free from government interference. Sri Lanka is the second full ICC member to be suspended for such reasons, following Zimbabwe in 2019. The consequences of this suspension will be determined after the ICC board meeting. Sri Lanka's government plans to approach the ICC's dispute resolution committee and, if necessary, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.

The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) in Manipur, India, has been in the news after clashes between the Kuki and Meitei people. The ITLF's general secretary, Muan Tombing, was recently accused of "attempting to wage war" against the Indian government. The ITLF, formed in 2022, comprises various tribal councils and aims to address issues faced by the Kuki-Zomi community. The forum seeks self-governance within the framework of the Indian Constitution, citing concerns over violence and discrimination. Some Kuki-Zomi organizations, including MLAs from Mizoram, support the demand for a separate administration for the community.

### [David Cameron | Comeback conservative](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/david-cameron-comeback-conservative/article67548748.ece)

Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has reemerged in the political arena as the country's new Foreign Secretary. This comes seven years after his resignation following the Brexit referendum, which he campaigned against. Cameron's political career began in the Conservative Party, where he held various positions before becoming party leader in 2005. He led the party for 11 years, implementing austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit. However, his tenure was marred by international events such as the Arab Spring and the intervention in Libya, for which he faced criticism for a lack of coherent strategy. Historians have summarized his legacy as being defined by Europe, similar to Tony Blair's association with Iraq. Cameron's recent appointment is overshadowed by concerns over the Greensill Capital scandal, where he was accused of showing poor judgement while lobbying government officials.

### [Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement | Limited peace, unlimited tensions](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/border-peace-and-tranquility-agreement-limited-peace-unlimited-tensions/article67548733.ece)

The article discusses the Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement (BPTA) signed between India and China in 1993, which aimed to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in their border areas. The agreement was significant as it marked the first time both countries legally committed to respecting the status quo and reducing the risk of unplanned confrontations. However, the limited nature of the agreement led to an infrastructure race and increasing incidents between the two countries since 2013.

The article highlights that the ongoing border crisis, with over 100,000 troops deployed from both sides near the LAC, has rendered the commitments of the BPTA invalid. One of the main reasons for the breakdown is the ambiguity surrounding the LAC, as India and China have differing perceptions of its location. The BPTA attempted to address this by stating that both sides would clarify the LAC where necessary, but it did not conclusively reject China's version of the LAC from November 7, 1959.

Despite the shortcomings of the BPTA, it paved the way for subsequent agreements, such as Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field along the LAC in 1996, and the appointment of Special Representatives in 2003. However, negotiations for a final settlement of the boundary have stalled, and mechanisms designed to maintain peace have come under increasing stress.

The current border crisis, which began in April 2020, has further strained relations between India and China. While military commanders continue to meet to work out new Confidence Building Measures in this context, the process of settling the boundary dispute has almost completely halted. The article concludes that the India-China border remains unsettled, and it remains to be seen if the current crisis will lead to a transformative moment in their relationship.

### [The unusual ‘mutations’ that protect humans from viruses | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/paramutations-viruses-pirna-cluster-study-explained/article67538884.ece)

The article discusses the concept of paramutations in genetics and their potential role in protecting humans against viruses. Paramutations are small chemical modifications of chromosomal proteins that can silence genes and make them resistant to viral infections. The piRNA cluster, a type of gene, plays a crucial role in this process by producing short pieces of RNA called piRNA, which guide the destruction of targeted RNA or turn off targeted genes. The article explains how paramutation amplifies the antiviral action of piRNA clusters and helps fly populations become virus resistant faster. The study also uncovers the mechanism by which piRNA from one cluster can paramutate viral DNA copies inserted elsewhere in the genome. However, not all viral insertions are amenable to paramutation, and the reasons behind this are still unknown. The article highlights that paramutation is still a relatively undiscovered phenomenon, and further research is needed to understand its intricacies.

The world's first vaccine for chikungunya has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. The vaccine, called Ixchiq, has been developed by Valneva, a European vaccine manufacturer. It is approved for administration in individuals who are 18 years or older and at increased risk of exposure to the virus. The vaccine was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, which allows the FDA to clear products for serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of effectiveness. Chikungunya is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and is characterized by severe joint pain, impaired mobility, and fever. The vaccine contains a live, weakened version of the chikungunya virus and is administered as a single dose by injection into the muscle. Common side effects reported by vaccine recipients include headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, nausea, and tenderness at the injection site. The effectiveness of the vaccine was evaluated based on immune response data from clinical studies conducted in the U.S. This approval is seen as an important advancement in the prevention of chikungunya, which currently has limited treatment options.

### [On the sub-categorisation within castes | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-the-sub-categorisation-within-castes-explained/article67541707.ece)

The article discusses the issue of sub-categorization of Scheduled Castes (SCs) in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to address the concerns of the Madiga community, who feel that their representation is being overshadowed by another SC community, the Malas. Several states have attempted to implement reservation laws to sub-categorize SCs and allocate separate quotas for different subcategories. However, these plans are currently held up in court as the Supreme Court forms a larger Constitution Bench to decide on the matter.

The Andhra Pradesh government had previously formed a commission to recommend sub-categorization based on evidence of communities being more backward and having less representation. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that states do not have the power to unilaterally sub-categorize communities in the list of SCs and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as this can only be done by Parliament and notified by the President.

In a contradiction to the 2004 judgment, a five-judge bench in 2020 stated that deciding on the quantum of benefits within the lists of SCs/STs would not amount to "tinkering" with it and that states could do so. This contradiction has also been referred to the larger bench.

While the question of sub-categorization remains pending with the Supreme Court, the Union government explored legal options in 2005 and the Attorney-General of India opined that it was possible to sub-categorize SCs if there was sufficient evidence and a constitutional amendment was made. However, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) expressed that a constitutional amendment was unnecessary, as Article 16(4) already allowed states to create special laws for underrepresented backward classes.

The arguments for sub-categorization revolve around addressing graded inequalities among SC communities, where some communities have better access to basic facilities, leaving the more backward communities at a disadvantage. However, both the SC and ST Commissions argue that separate reservations within categories would not solve the root problem, as the most backward SCs lag so far behind that they would not have enough candidates to benefit from higher-level reserved posts. They recommend focusing on ensuring existing schemes and government benefits reach these sections first.

Legal experts highlight the need for concrete population numbers and socio-economic data of each community to support sub-categorization. This information is crucial in determining how castes can be categorized and what percentage of benefits should be allocated to each group.

### [How many forces are there in nature, really? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nature-fundamental-forces-counting-problem-explained/article67531853.ece)

This article discusses the concept of fundamental forces in physics. It starts by comparing the idea of "The Force" from Star Wars to the scientific understanding of force. There are four fundamental types of interactions between elementary particles that give rise to all the forces we encounter: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak force, and strong force. 

Gravity is the most well-known force but is still not fully understood in modern physics. It is the weakest of the fundamental forces and keeps objects from floating away. The electromagnetic force is stronger and plays a role in various everyday phenomena like television and magnets. The weak force only acts on specific particles and is responsible for radiation used in nuclear medicine. The strong force binds atomic nuclei together and powers the sun through nuclear fusion.

Each force is mediated by a force-carrier particle: graviton for gravity, photon for electromagnetism, W bosons and Z boson for weak force, and gluons for strong force. However, the classification of fundamental forces based on force-carriers is not always straightforward, as there can be additional force-carriers beyond the four known ones.

Furthermore, the distinction between fundamental forces becomes more complex when considering the symmetries in the equations that describe these interactions. For example, the electroweak force, which combines electromagnetism and the weak force, was once a single force after the Big Bang before breaking into two forces.

Gravity stands apart from the other forces because it is associated with the curvature of spacetime according to Einstein's theory of general relativity. While the other forces are described within energy fields, gravity is described by the geometry of spacetime.

In conclusion, while it is commonly stated that there are four fundamental forces, the true understanding of these forces is more nuanced and evolving as scientists delve deeper into the mathematical regularities and symmetries underlying them.

### [Why is the amnesty deal by Spain’s government contentious? |  Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-is-the-amnesty-deal-by-spains-government-contentious-explained/article67533445.ece)

Spain's socialist government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, has struck a controversial amnesty deal with the Catalan separatist party, Together for Catalonia, in order to secure another term for Sanchez. Carles Puigdemont, former regional president of Catalonia and a member of the European Parliament, has offered his party's support in exchange for amnesty for himself and others involved in the failed Catalan independence bid in 2017. However, the approval of the amnesty legislation is not guaranteed, and critics argue that it undermines the principle of equality before the law. Spain has seen widespread protests in response to the deal, and there are concerns about the potential for violence. This move by Sanchez contradicts his previous stance against granting amnesty to separatists. The opposition People's Party and far-right Vox party view it as a ploy by Sanchez to hold onto power. Spain's political landscape has been marked by post-electoral stalemate and the rise of smaller parties on the extreme ends of the spectrum. There is uncertainty about the outcome of another general election, and no clear vision of Spain's next government has emerged since the elections in July. Currently, Sanchez's government is allied with extreme left parties, including separatist parties from Basque and Catalonia, but concerns over the cost of collaboration with these parties may be exaggerated.

### [Community rights and forest conservation | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/community-rights-and-forest-conservation-explained/article67529937.ece)

The Forest Conservation Amendment Act of 2023 aims to address climate change and deforestation, but it neglects the rights of indigenous communities. The amendment removes forests from the law's jurisdiction, allowing for economic exploitation. It only applies to specific areas and excludes forests converted for non-forest use after 1996. The government can construct security measures and implement initiatives like ecotourism in these areas, which has drawn criticism from tribal communities and human rights activists. The Forest Conservation Act faced opposition from private landowners and organizations involved in conservation who believe it hinders industrial progress. The Bill passed without substantial debates or discussions, excluding collaborative discussions with southern States. Concerns have been raised about obstructing indigenous rights if forests are removed from the Act's purview. The recent amendments remove the necessity for tribal consent for alterations to forests, but State governments hesitate to involve Adivasi grama sabhas due to perceived anti-development sentiments. Compensatory afforestation projects face challenges, and the new amendment does not specify the types of trees to be planted. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) is seen as an impediment to converting forest land, leading to a reduction or dilution of forest areas instead of amending the FRA. The amendment also fails to address human-animal conflicts in forest areas. The implementation of the law presents challenges to forest-dwelling communities and government agencies. The concept of afforestation clashes with forest governance and decentralization, and defining strategic linear projects becomes complex. Internal environmental security is not guaranteed, despite being a significant concern in disaster-prone states.

### [Explained | The Agartala-Akhaura rail link](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-the-agartala-akhaura-rail-link/article67516621.ece)

On November 1, 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina virtually inaugurated the rail link between Agartala and Akhaura, which connects India's northeast with Bangladesh. The rail link is expected to re-establish connectivity and boost commerce between the two regions. The rail line is 12.24 km long, with 6.78 km in Bangladesh and 5.46 km in Tripura. It will reduce the travel time between Agartala and Kolkata from 31 hours to 10 hours and the distance from 1,581 km to 460 km. The project is in line with India's 'Act East Policy' and 'Neighbourhood First Policy' and aims to promote small-scale industries, tourism, and facilitate import and export activities. The total cost of the project on the Indian side is ₹862.58 crore, with additional assistance provided by the Ministry of External Affairs. Currently, there are five operational broad gauge connectivity routes between India and Bangladesh, and work is underway to connect Mahihasan railway station in Assam to Shahbazpur in Bangladesh. The rail link between Agartala and Akhaura was first suggested in 1974 and the memorandum of understanding was signed in 2010. Trade between the two countries has been growing steadily, with close to 100 cargo trains per month and approximately 2.66 metric tonnes of goods sent to Bangladesh in the previous financial year. Passenger trains also facilitate people-to-people ties between the two countries. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of rail cooperation for cross-border transportation of essential commodities, and efforts are being made to improve port and road connectivity between India and Bangladesh alongside railway initiatives [[2]](https://www.academia.edu/10431782/Government_of_the_Peoples_Republic_of_Bangladesh_Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare_HEALTH_BULLETIN).

### [‘Loss and damage’ fund talks leave developing nations at new disadvantage | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/loss-and-damage-fund-cop-28-transitional-committee-failure/article67514293.ece)

The article discusses the concept of 'loss and damage' (L&D) in relation to climate change. It explains that adaptation is the proactive response to climate change, whereas L&D represents the irreversible consequences that cannot be avoided or mitigated through adaptation. These consequences include economic losses, human casualties, and the degradation of ecosystems and cultural heritage.

The article highlights the need for affluent nations to acknowledge their historic pollution and its contribution to climate change. It mentions the establishment of the L&D fund at the 19th Conference of the Parties (COP 19) in 2013, which aimed to provide financial and technical assistance to economically developing nations experiencing L&D due to climate change. However, subsequent meetings of the Transitional Committee (TC) responsible for operationalizing the fund have failed to produce clear recommendations.

The fifth meeting of the TC (TC5) recently took place, resulting in a set of recommendations. Developing nations agreed to host the fund at the World Bank Financial Intermediary Fund for an interim period, while developed nations remained non-committal about being primary donors. There is no indication of the fund's size, and developed nations' support is voluntary, diluting the spirit and intent of the L&D fund.

The article emphasizes the lack of trust between wealthy and impoverished nations regarding historical responsibilities and climate reparations. It warns that the watering down of the L&D fund has wide-reaching implications, including threats to climate justice, increased humanitarian crises, economic consequences, environmental degradation, and security implications.

The author argues that both adaptation and L&D are essential in addressing climate change. They stress the need for rich countries to meet their obligations to reduce emissions and provide fair finance to achieve climate justice. Failure to do so may derail global climate action and strain future COP talks.

The article discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine and the potential war crimes committed by both sides. The United Nations has stated that there is evidence of war crimes being committed by Hamas and the Israeli military since October 7. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over the current conflict and has visited Gaza to gather evidence. The ICC will investigate the events in the West Bank and the families of Israeli victims have lodged a complaint alleging genocide by Hamas. The article also explains the international laws that apply to the war, such as international humanitarian law (IHL) and the Geneva Conventions. These laws require parties to distinguish between combatants and civilians, take precautionary measures to minimize harm to civilians, and give advance warning of attacks. The article highlights the applicability of these laws to the conflict and the obligations of both parties. The ICC can prosecute war crimes and genocide, and its jurisdiction extends to the Palestinian territories. However, Israel and the United States have rejected the ICC's jurisdiction. The article also mentions the support and lack of support from different nations for the ICC's intervention.

### [‘Misleading’ ads for IAS coaching institutes being probed by consumer protection body | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/education/misleading-ads-for-ias-coaching-institutes-being-probed-by-consumer-protection-body-explained/article67485182.ece)

GPT-3.5: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) is currently investigating 20 IAS coaching institutes for misleading claims and unfair trade practices in their advertisements. Four of these institutes have already been fined Rs 1 lakh each. The investigation focuses on the institutes' use of testimonials without disclosing the nature of the enrolments and the course pursued by the top rank holders featured in their ads. The CCPA has found that many rank holders only took mock interviews from these institutes, which were provided free of cost. This lack of disclosure qualifies as deliberate concealment of important information and is categorized as a 'misleading advertisement' under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The penalties for first-time violations can go up to Rs 10 lakh, and subsequent violations may attract penalties up to Rs 50 lakh. The CCPA observed that the total selections claimed by the institutes being probed exceeded the recommendations by UPSC, possibly due to multiple enrolments among students. Currently, four institutes have been fined, while others are still under investigation.

### [How is electricity transmitted? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/electric-power-transmission-explained/article67507272.ece)

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.This article provides a simplified introduction to electric power transmission. It explains that power transmission is a crucial component of the electricity supply system, which includes generation, transmission, and distribution. Electricity is generated at power plants and transmitted through a network of stations, substations, cables, and transformers. The article highlights several key factors in power transmission:

1. **Transmission Efficiency**: The efficiency of transmission is higher at lower current and higher voltage. Transformers are used to increase voltage and reduce current before feeding into transmission lines.

2. **Cable Resistance**: The cables used for transmission have some resistance, resulting in energy loss. The thickness of the cables can be adjusted to control the amount of energy loss.

3. **Distance of Transmission**: The longer the distance of transmission, the lower the transmission cost.

4. **Alternating Current (AC)**: AC is commonly used for power transmission due to its higher transmission efficiency and ease of modification in transformers. AC voltage flips polarity, and in a three-phase AC circuit, there are three wires that transmit AC power.

The article also mentions the various components and setups involved in power transmission, such as transmission towers, insulators, circuit-breakers, transformers, and substations. It explains the role of grids in power transmission, including the storage of electrical energy, connection to different sources, and management of demand and supply.

Overall, the article provides a basic understanding of electric power transmission and its importance in the modern nation's economic development.

The people of Poland recently voted in a multi-party opposition coalition, giving them a majority in the parliament's lower house. This marked a defeat for the ruling ultra-conservative Law and Justice party, which has been known for its right-wing and populist policies. The coalition plans to reverse many of the current government's controversial actions, such as imposing a total ban on abortions and attacking the LGBT community. The new government, led by former Prime Minister Donald Tusk, is expected to take a pro-EU stance and work to improve Poland's relationship with Brussels.

### [Why is Pakistan deporting Afghan migrants and refugees? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-is-pakistan-deporting-afghan-migrants-and-refugees-explained/article67493610.ece)

#### Summary:

A large number of Afghan refugees have entered the Torkham border to return home before the Pakistani government's deadline for illegal immigrants to leave or face deportation. The mass exodus was triggered by an order from Pakistan's interim government, which aims to address hyperinflation, political instability, and rising crime rates ahead of the general elections next year. The United Nations has called the decision a 'human rights catastrophe' that puts hundreds of thousands of refugees at grave risk. Human rights agencies estimate that about 60% of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are undocumented, and the new policy will worsen their situation. The Pakistani government has demolished the houses of Afghan nationals living in illegal settlements, leaving many stranded and fearing arrest. Pakistan is home to about 4 million refugees and migrants, with Afghan refugees forming a large portion of the immigrant population. The Taliban has criticized the decision and prepared temporary refugee camps to assist the returning refugees. The deportation has faced legal challenges, with human rights activists and politicians arguing that it violates people's fundamental rights. Pakistan justifies its actions by linking the migrant population to crimes and drug trafficking. However, analysts attribute the violence in the region to Pakistan's 'dual policy' of supporting certain terror groups for geopolitical goals. The international community has been urged to fulfill its responsibility to protect refugees caught in Pakistan's economic, security, and political challenges.

### [What is the status of Kavach installations? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/what-is-the-status-of-kavach-installations-explained/article67498761.ece)

The collision between two passenger trains in Vizianagaram district in Andhra Pradesh, India, could have been avoided if Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) were in place. The indigenously developed TCAS called "Kavach," which is a cab signaling train control system with anti-collision features, was not installed on the route where the accident occurred. Kavach was developed over 10 years by the Indian Railways Research Designs and Standards Organization and is designed to warn train drivers of overshooting red signals and automatically apply the emergency brakes. The system utilizes radio frequency identification technology, RFID readers and equipment, and radio infrastructure to monitor train movements and transmit signals ahead. Experts believe that if Kavach was deployed more widely, it could help prevent accidents. However, the coverage for Kavach is currently limited, and it may take many years to ensure its installation on high-density routes due to the length of Indian Railways' total route. The Indian Railways has allocated funds for Kavach implementation, but it may only cover a limited distance this year.

### [The stance of the Maldives President-elect on India | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-stance-of-the-maldives-president-elect-on-india-explained/article67482140.ece)

President-elect Mohamed Muizzu of the Maldives has expressed his desire to remove Indian troops from the country upon assuming office. This stance aligns with the opposition bloc's 'India Out' campaign, which criticized outgoing President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's 'India first' foreign policy. Currently, 75 Indian military personnel are stationed in the Maldives to operate and maintain aircraft gifted by India. Muizzu's pro-China stance and emphasis on removing Indian military presence may be driven by international media framing the Maldives elections as a referendum on India and China. However, Muizzu will face challenges in handling the Indian military question while also addressing the country's economic crisis and debt obligations. India has become the Maldives' main security and economic partner, committing $1.4 billion towards development needs. The Maldives' national security is closely tied to its collective security aspirations in the region, as highlighted by its participation in the 'Colombo Security Conclave' with India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius.

Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader in Venezuela, has won a significant victory in the country's primary elections. This comes after the Biden administration agreed to ease sanctions against Venezuela's oil, gas, and mining industries in exchange for free and fair elections in 2024. The re-engagement between Washington and Caracas is partly due to the shifting geopolitical realities resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Venezuela, with its large oil reserves, has been able to withstand the effects of U.S. and EU sanctions with support from Cuba, China, Russia, and Iran. For President Maduro, the revival of ties with the U.S. could mean an end to his government's international isolation. However, it is uncertain if Machado will be allowed to challenge Maduro in the upcoming elections, as she has been disqualified from holding public office for 15 years. The Biden administration has indicated that the extent of sanctions relief will depend on Venezuela's progress towards democracy.

### [Will QR codes improve access to food labels? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/will-qr-codes-improve-access-to-food-labels-explained/article67470951.ece)

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has recommended the use of QR codes on food products to improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals. This move is important as India has a large market for packaged foods and is seeing an increase in non-communicable diseases, which can be linked to the consumption of pre-packaged foods. The CEO of Consumer Voice, Ashim Sanyal, states that this initiative will offer informed choices to consumers, but also emphasizes the need to identify unhealthy foods. The QR codes recommended by the FSSAI should provide comprehensive information about the product, including ingredients, nutritional information, allergens, manufacturing date, and contact information for customer inquiries. The inclusion of QR codes does not replace mandatory information on product labels required by regulations. The use of QR codes can improve brand image, customer loyalty, and operational efficiency for food manufacturers. The paper "Food Literacy & Food Labelling Laws - A Legal Analysis of India's Food Policy" highlights the importance of accurate and accessible food labels to prevent the further spread of non-communicable diseases. Food industry experts also note that consumers consider food packaging as important as the product itself, and the use of QR codes can enhance consumer information and influence their buying behavior. The US, India, France, and the UK are among the top users of QR codes globally. A survey revealed that a majority of respondents scanned QR codes on food products for specific information and found them helpful in making life easier.

### [Why are the China-Bhutan boundary talks significant?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-are-the-china-bhutan-boundary-talks-significant/article67462151.ece)

China and Bhutan have held their 25th round of boundary talks and signed a Cooperation Agreement on the "Responsibilities and Functions of the Joint Technical Team (JTT) on the Delimitation and Demarcation of the Bhutan-China Boundary." This marks significant progress in their efforts to resolve border disputes. The talks were held after a seven-year gap and were delayed due to the Doklam Standoff and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the two sides used the pause to hold talks at other levels, leading to the establishment of a 3-step roadmap for border resolution. Bhutan's Prime Minister stated that they are "inching towards" completing the roadmap. The roadmap involves agreeing on the border, visiting the sites on the ground, and formally demarcating the boundary. India is concerned about the discussions over Doklam, as China has proposed swapping areas under Bhutanese control with areas it claims. India is also worried about China's demand for full diplomatic relations with Bhutan and the potential for a Chinese presence in the region. Bhutan has assured that it will consider India's interests in its decisions.

The article discusses the recent glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in North Sikkim, India, which resulted in the destruction of the Teesta III dam. The incident highlighted the lack of early warning systems and preventive measures, as required under the Dam Safety Act (DSA) passed in late 2021. The DSA aimed to address deficient surveillance and maintenance that have led to dam failure-related disasters. It outlined key responsibilities, including the establishment of national and state-level bodies for dam safety implementation. The Act also emphasized the need for hazard classification, regular inspections, emergency action plans, flood warning systems, and safety reviews. States were required to report dam failures, and non-compliance with the Act could result in imprisonment and fines. However, experts point out the shortcomings in legislation and implementation, emphasizing the need for risk-based decision-making and transparency. They argue that dam safety information should be easily accessible to the public. Compliance with safety standards, periodic reviews, and standardized failure analysis and reporting were also highlighted as important aspects. The article concludes by mentioning how the Himachal Pradesh government recently found several hydroelectric projects guilty of non-compliance with the DSA during floods in July-August.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent study published in the Nature journal and led by the World Bank has highlighted the increased risk of flooding in urban areas in India. The study found that the expansion of cities into flood-prone areas has more than doubled since 1985. This poses significant threats to life, livelihoods, and the economy. While India is not among the most exposed countries to flood hazards, it is the third highest contributor to global settlements and has new settlements expanding into flood-prone areas. Experts emphasize the need for sustainable urban planning that accounts for flood-related risks and suggests measures such as scientific mapping of flood-prone areas, improved storm-water management plans, and resilient housing solutions.
