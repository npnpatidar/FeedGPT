### [Russia-Ukraine Crisis: Why is Kharkiv important? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-ukraine-crisis-kharkiv-importance-explained/article68193558.ece)

Here's a summary of the article:

**Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy** has stated that the situation in **Kharkiv** has stabilized following intense fighting since Russia's invasion in February 2022. Despite ongoing Russian shelling, Ukrainian forces have managed to instill confidence in the region's defense, particularly in the Vochansk direction. However, threats persist, and the head of the Vovchansk local administration was recently wounded.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has been a significant target for Russian forces due to its economic and educational importance. Although Ukrainian forces regained control over most of the Kharkiv oblast by October 2022, Russia has continued its offensive throughout 2023 and renewed it in May 2024, worsening the situation according to Ukraine's commander-in-chief.

**Russian President Vladimir Putin** claims that Russian advances in the Kharkiv region aim to create a buffer zone to protect Russia's borders, but insists that capturing the city of Kharkiv is not part of the plan. He also accuses Ukraine of shelling Russian border regions, which he cites as the reason for the renewed offensive.

Security analysts speculate that Russia's actions in Kharkiv may be a distraction from the main theatre of operations in the Donbas region. Despite frequent attacks, Kharkiv remains a major urban center, and Russia lacks the troop strength required for its encirclement and capture.

The article also mentions U.S. Secretary of State **Antony Blinken's** recent visit to Ukraine, where he stated that Ukraine has the right to chart its own course in the war and that the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine with necessary equipment.

### [Festival de Cannes | Universal cinema](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/festival-de-cannes-universal-cinema/article68191282.ece)

The article discusses the historical and contemporary significance of the Cannes Film Festival. It begins by highlighting the festival's aim to foster collaboration in the cinematic arts and its origins as a response to Fascist influence on film awards in the late 1930s. The festival's dramatic inception, postponed due to the outbreak of World War II, is recounted, along with its post-war revival symbolizing resistance to Fascism.

The piece also touches on the festival's role in arthouse cinema and its reputation, which was solidified by an incomplete edition in 1968 that was shut down in solidarity with student protests. The current edition is noted for its contributions to the festival's history of resistance, with Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof fleeing Iran to avoid imprisonment and the #metoo movement's presence through Judith Godrèche's film.

Significantly, the article mentions India's return to competition for the Palme d’Or after 30 years, with Payal Kapadia's Malayalam film "All We Imagine As Light" competing against international films for the top honor. The last Indian film to compete was in 1994, marking a momentous occasion for Indian cinema at the festival.

### [Why is RBI keeping an eye on gold loans? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/why-is-rbi-keeping-an-eye-on-gold-loans-explained/article68191243.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently taken steps to enforce regulatory norms among Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), particularly concerning gold loans. The RBI's actions include a ban on IIFL Finance from issuing new gold loans due to norm violations and increased scrutiny over NBFCs. Key regulations stipulate that lenders cannot loan more than 75% of the gold's value used as collateral and must disburse loans above ₹20,000 through bank accounts, not cash. The RBI is also emphasizing fair and transparent auction processes for defaulted gold loans.

Concerns have been raised about NBFCs potentially overvaluing gold to extend larger loans, which could lead to systemic risks as the gold loan industry expands. The RBI's strict enforcement of loan-to-value ratios and disbursement rules aims to curb aggressive lending practices and ensure the sustainability of the gold loan sector. During the pandemic, the RBI had temporarily relaxed these norms to aid borrowers, but it is now focused on maintaining strict compliance to prevent future financial instability. NBFCs worry that these measures may impact their growth and profitability, as they pride themselves on providing quick cash loans, especially to those outside the banking system. The RBI believes that its regulations will ultimately lead to a more stable gold loan market.

### [Andrei Belousov | Putin’s war manager](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/andrei-belousov-putins-war-manager/article68191299.ece)

Vladimir Putin has been inaugurated as Russian President for a fifth term, leading to significant political changes. Andrei Belousov replaces Sergei Shoigu as Defence Minister, with Shoigu moving to head the National Security Council. The reshuffle reflects a need for better economic integration of military spending, which has escalated to levels seen in the mid-1980s due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Despite initial successes in the war, Shoigu's transfer raises questions. His background as a civil engineer and his rise to prominence through key military operations had made him a potential successor to Putin. However, the prolonged conflict in Ukraine, internal opposition, and corruption charges against his deputy have tarnished his reputation.

The shake-up suggests that Shoigu's growing influence may have played a role in his reassignment. Other strategic appointments, including promotions within Putin's inner circle, aim to consolidate power and neutralize potential threats.

Belousov, an economist with a technocratic approach and aligned with Putin's economic policies, is seen as an ideal choice for Defence Minister. His task will be to balance the demands of the war with economic efficiency, leveraging his expertise to innovate and combat corruption. This appointment underscores the importance of economic management in wartime strategy.

### [The takeaway from Mumbai hoarding tragedy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/the-takeaway-from-mumbai-hoarding-tragedy/article68191310.ece)

On May 13, 2024, a catastrophic event occurred in Mumbai's Ghatkopar area when a massive illegal hoarding collapsed during a dust storm, resulting in the tragic loss of at least 16 lives. The hoarding, weighing 250 tonnes, fell onto a petrol pump, impacting those refueling or working there. The hoarding's owner, Bhavesh Bhinde, initially fled but was later apprehended in Rajasthan.

The incident has prompted urgent calls for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (BMC) to inspect and address illegal or unstable hoardings across the city. This has led to a broader response, with Chennai officials removing over 460 structures and Pune experiencing a similar, though non-fatal, incident.

The Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act requires written permission from the Municipal Commissioner for such structures, a rule apparently flouted in this case. The hoarding in question did not comply with size regulations and was not removed despite its visible risk. The collapse has highlighted the need for strict enforcement of structural stability standards, as outlined in the Policy Guidelines for Display of Advertisements 2018 and the Bureau of Indian Standards.

The article also discusses the broader implications of outdoor advertising, the advent of digital displays, and the challenges posed by extreme weather conditions exacerbated by climate change. It underscores the importance of due diligence by governments to prevent harm to citizens and the legal liabilities that arise from negligence, as demonstrated by recent court rulings.

In essence, the Ghatkopar disaster serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of non-compliance with safety regulations and the need for proactive governance to safeguard public safety in the face of increasing urbanization and climate change challenges.

### [What are the NIA’s allegations against NSCN? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/what-are-the-nias-allegations-against-nscn-explained/article68191274.ece)

The article from The Hindu details the charge sheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against the "China-Myanmar module" of the NSCN-IM, accusing them of aiding Meitei insurgent groups in India. The NIA alleges that this support is part of a larger scheme to destabilize Manipur amidst ethnic unrest. The charge sheet names five individuals arrested with weapons and ammunition, suggesting a conspiracy to attack the Kuki-Zo community. It also touches on the ethnic composition of Manipur, the strategic India-Myanmar border, and the history of peace agreements and conflicts in the region. The NSCN-IM, engaged in peace talks with the Indian government, seeks a 'Greater Nagaland' but distances itself from the current violence. The peace talks are currently stalled, with the NSCN-IM accusing the Indian government of propaganda and failing to honor previously agreed points. The article provides a comprehensive view of the ongoing ethnic and political tensions in Manipur and the complex history of insurgent groups in the region.

### [Chabahar | India’s gateway to Central Asia](https://www.thehindu.com/profile/chabahar-indias-gateway-to-central-asia/article68191185.ece)

The article discusses the strategic importance and development of the Chabahar port in Iran, which has been a significant project for India. **Before Partition**, Chabahar was geographically close to India and shared cultural ties. Despite the Shah of Iran's leanings towards the U.S., India sought to build a new relationship with Iran post-1979 revolution. The port's development was first envisioned by the Shah in 1970, but it wasn't until the 1990s and early 2000s that India began serious discussions and agreements to develop the port and its connections.

**Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to Tehran in 1993** and subsequent visits by Indian leaders solidified the partnership, leading to the Delhi Declaration in 2003, which planned a sea link from India to Chabahar and further to Europe and Central Asia. The port was also seen as a strategic trade route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan, and has been part of India-Iran cooperation on Afghan reconstruction efforts.

Despite challenges, including U.S. sanctions and geopolitical shifts, India has continued to invest in the port. The latest agreement involves a **$120 million outlay and a $250 million credit line** from India to develop the port further, with plans to build 32 jetties and increase cargo processing. The article concludes by reflecting on the enduring geopolitical significance of Chabahar and its potential, despite the slow pace of development.

### [Chabahar | India’s gateway to Central Asia](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chabahar-indias-gateway-to-central-asia/article68191185.ece)

The article discusses the strategic importance and development of the Chabahar port in Iran, which has been a key project for India to enhance its trade routes and geopolitical influence. Historically, Chabahar offered India a strategic edge, particularly in relation to Pakistan, by providing an alternative route to Afghanistan. The port's development has seen various phases, influenced by international relations, particularly with the U.S. and its sanctions on Iran. Despite challenges, India has continued to invest in the port, with the latest agreement involving a $120 million outlay and a $250 million credit line to further develop the port. This development aims to build 32 jetties and handle about 82 million tonnes of cargo annually by the end of the fourth phase. The article reflects on the enduring significance of Chabahar for India, despite the slow progress and geopolitical complexities.

### [Watch | Israel’s Rafah invasion | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/watch-israels-rafah-invasion-explained/article68190272.ece)

The article discusses the severe humanitarian crisis in Rafah, Gaza, following Israel's military offensive. The city's population has swelled to 1.5 million, with many living in dire conditions. Rafah's history as a conflict flashpoint is highlighted, including its rule by Egypt after the 1948 Arab-Israel war and the 1956 Rafah massacre. Post-1967, Israel maintained direct control over Gaza until 2005.

The recent conflict began on October 7, 2023, leading to a massive displacement of Palestinians to Rafah. The U.S. warned Israel against a full-scale invasion, but Prime Minister Netanyahu insisted on proceeding, despite international pressure and the need to address the hostage situation with Hamas. Ceasefire talks, mediated by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, proposed a three-phase deal for the release of hostages and prisoners, but details remain undisclosed.

Israel's refusal to meet Hamas's demands for a comprehensive ceasefire and withdrawal has led to a stalemate. Netanyahu faces a dilemma: agreeing to a ceasefire could ensure Hamas's survival, but continuing the offensive risks further civilian casualties and international isolation. The U.S. has expressed concerns over a full-scale attack on Rafah, and Netanyahu's stance has strained Israel-U.S. relations. Despite the challenges, Netanyahu remains resolute, even if it means Israel standing alone. The article concludes with a reference to a recent defensive success against Iranian missile attacks. The situation remains tense, with no clear resolution in sight.

### [Under what rules did the ECI reject comedian Shyam Rangeela’s poll nomination from Varanasi? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/comedian-shyam-rangeela-poll-nomination-from-varanasi-under-what-rules-did-eci-reject/article68184098.ece)

The article discusses the rejection of comedian Shyam Rangeela's nomination for the Varanasi parliamentary constituency by the Election Commission of India (ECI) due to incompleteness. Rangeela, known for impersonating the Prime Minister, intended to run as an independent candidate. He faced difficulties in submitting his nomination and claimed that the returning officer (RO) accepted his papers just before the deadline but later rejected them for not taking the required oath. The ECI's handbook states that candidates must take an oath before scrutiny, and the RO is to ensure all documents are complete. Out of 41 nominations in Varanasi, 33 were rejected, leaving only seven candidates, including PM Modi. The article outlines the nomination process, eligibility criteria, and the importance of the oath as per the Constitution and the Representation of People Act, 1951. It also mentions the Supreme Court's stance on the RO's quasi-judicial role in scrutinizing nominations. Dissatisfied candidates can challenge the RO's decision in the High Court.

### [The cases and charges against the Bhima Koregaon 16 | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/elgar-parishad-bhima-koregaon-16-human-rights-defenders-cases-and-charges/article68177476.ece)

The article from The Hindu, dated May 17, 2024, details the legal journey of 16 human rights defenders arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, for their alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence. **Gautam Navlakha**, one of the accused, was released on bail by the Supreme Court after four years of incarceration, with the court noting the delay in framing charges and the anticipated lengthy trial. The article highlights the release of other co-accused on bail over the years, including **Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Varavara Rao, and Shoma Sen**, while others like **Mahesh Raut, Rona Wilson, Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Hany Babu, Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor, and Jyoti Jagtap** remain in jail. The article also mentions the death of Father **Stan Swamy** in custody in July 2021.

The narrative recounts the arrests, house arrests, bail pleas, and health concerns of the accused, along with the judicial observations questioning the evidence and conduct of the investigating agencies. It also covers the use of malware to plant evidence on electronic devices of the accused, as revealed by forensic reports, and the subsequent legal challenges. The article concludes with a reference to Alpha Shah's book "The Incarcerations," which criticizes the handling of the case as indicative of a broader abuse of democratic rights in India.

### [Why NHRC’s international accreditation is under review | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-nhrc-international-accreditation-is-under-review-explainer/article68141899.ece)

The article discusses the status of India's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in the context of its international accreditation. The NHRC, which has held an 'A rating' since 1999, is under review by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI). Concerns about the NHRC include its lack of diversity, opaque appointment processes, conflicts of interest involving police personnel, and failure to address human rights violations effectively.

The NHRC's re-accreditation has been deferred for the second consecutive year due to these issues. The Sub-Committee for Accreditation (SCA) of GANHRI, which conducts reviews every five years based on the Paris Principles, has repeatedly highlighted the need for the NHRC to be more inclusive and transparent. The SCA has recommended changes to improve the NHRC's functioning, such as amending the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA) to remove the capacity for government to appoint police officers as investigative staff and to ensure at least one woman member in the NHRC.

The article also notes that the NHRC has been criticized for not fostering a constructive relationship with NGOs and human rights defenders, and for being reduced to a "silent spectator" in recent years. The NHRC's failure to review contentious laws and its inability to enforce its recommendations have also been pointed out. The SCA has urged for amendments to the PHRA to empower the NHRC to independently recruit candidates and to ensure a more diverse and pluralistic composition.

Overall, the NHRC's current challenges threaten its international standing and the protection of human rights in India. If the NHRC loses its 'A rating', it will lose its voting position with GANHRI and its representation at the United Nations Human Rights Council, which could have significant implications for human rights governance in India. The article underscores the urgency for the NHRC to address these concerns and comply with the Paris Principles to maintain its accreditation and credibility.

### [Lok Sabha elections: Who are BJP’s allies and how many seats has it ceded to them?](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/lok-sabha-elections-who-has-bjp-allied-with-how-many-seats-has-it-ceded/article68164185.ece)

The article discusses the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) strategy and alliances for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections in India, aiming to secure over 400 seats for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The BJP is contesting in alliance with regional parties in 12 states and one union territory, while facing the Indian National Congress and other regional parties in various states. Notably, the BJP is not contesting any seats in Kashmir for the first time. Internal party conflicts have led to splits and new alliances in states like Maharashtra and Bihar. The BJP has set ambitious targets in states like Uttar Pradesh, leveraging recent political developments and awarding the Bharat Ratna to a prominent local figure. The elections are being held in multiple phases across the country, with results to be announced on June 4. The article also highlights key battleground states and the BJP's efforts to expand its presence in regions where it has historically had minimal influence.

### [Lok Sabha elections 2024: Examining Modi, Kejriwal and Congress’ guarantees](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha/modi-kejriwal-and-congress-guarantees-for-lok-sabha-polls-do-they-address-voter-issues/article68178960.ece)

The article discusses the electoral guarantees offered by India's three major political parties—BJP, Congress, and AAP—in the midst of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has continued its focus on existing schemes under the banner of 'Modi ki guarantee,' aiming for a developed India by 2047. Their guarantees include welfare saturation, empowering farmers, women's empowerment, cultural heritage development, youth and middle-class benefits, economic growth, digital infrastructure, J&K integration, and foreign policy enhancements.

Congress, building on its Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, has presented 'Nyay Patra' and 'Paanch Nyay,' promising new policy changes and addressing demands like legal MSP, reservation cap removal, farm loan waivers, and a caste census. Their guarantees target youth, women, farmers, laborers, and marginalized communities.

AAP, following its Delhi governance model, promises free power, education, healthcare, and jobs, along with full statehood for Delhi, MSP as per the Swaminathan Commission, anti-corruption measures, and scrapping the Agniveer scheme. They have not released a detailed manifesto and are contesting only 22 seats.

A pre-poll survey indicates unemployment and price rise as primary voter concerns, with a perceived increase in corruption and class divide. The survey suggests a higher trust in BJP's guarantees, especially among middle-aged, older, and rural voters, compared to Congress's guarantees.

The article concludes with an analysis of how each party's guarantees address unemployment, inflation, corruption, class divide, and farmer distress, reflecting the electorate's priorities and the parties' strategies to win votes. The BJP is slightly favored according to the survey, with a trust advantage in their guarantees.

### [Can parties be de-recognised or de-registered? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/can-parties-be-de-recognised-or-de-registered-explained/article68183892.ece)

The article discusses the Election Commission of India's (ECI) enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and the debate over its powers to address violations. It outlines the requirements for political party registration under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, including allegiance to the Constitution and principles of socialism, secularism, and democracy. Registered parties enjoy benefits like tax exemptions, a common symbol for elections, and a set number of 'star campaigners'. Currently, there are 2,790 active registered parties, with only a third contesting elections. The ECI lacks explicit power to de-register parties for not contesting elections or other failures, as established by a Supreme Court ruling.

The MCC prohibits exploiting caste and communal sentiments for votes, and recognized parties have violated it on several occasions. The ECI's response has typically been to bar leaders from campaigning temporarily. The ECI and the Law Commission have suggested legal amendments to empower the ECI to de-register parties that fail to contest elections for an extended period. The ECI also has the power to suspend or withdraw recognition of a party for MCC violations, a measure used sparingly.

The author, Rangarajan R, a former IAS officer, emphasizes the need for strict action to ensure adherence to the MCC and suggests implementing the recommended legal reforms. The views expressed are his personal opinions.

### [The use of AI in drug development | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-use-of-ai-in-drug-development-explained/article68183913.ece)

The article discusses the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on drug development, highlighting its potential to expedite the process. It begins by explaining that drug development traditionally starts with identifying a 'druggable' protein target, a process that can be lengthy and costly due to laboratory experiments. AI, particularly through tools like AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold, has revolutionized this phase by predicting protein structures and drug-target interactions, thereby saving time and resources.

The upgraded versions of these tools, AlphaFold 3 and RoseTTAFold All-Atom, have further advanced the field by predicting interactions between proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules with higher accuracy. However, the article notes that these AI tools have limitations, such as a maximum of 80% accuracy in predictions and the inability to guarantee success in subsequent drug development phases. Additionally, challenges like model hallucinations and the unavailability of AlphaFold 3's code for independent verification are mentioned.

The article also touches on the need for large-scale computing infrastructure and skilled AI scientists for developing new AI tools, pointing out India's potential to lead in this area despite current limitations. The author, Professor Binay Panda, emphasizes India's rich history in structural biology and the growing number of pharmaceutical organizations as advantages for the country in applying AI to drug development.

### [Watch | Can you take your lawyer to consumer court for poor services? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/watch-can-you-take-your-lawyer-to-consumer-court-for-poor-services-explained/article68182730.ece)

The Supreme Court of India has ruled that lawyers cannot be taken to consumer courts for poor services. The verdict states that a lawyer's service is a "contract of personal service" and thus not included under the "Service" definition in the Consumer Protection Act. The Act aims to protect consumers from unfair trade practices of businessmen and traders, not professionals like lawyers. The Court noted that professional work involves a high level of education and training, and success depends on factors beyond one's control. While lawyers are exempt from consumer court proceedings for service deficiencies, they can still be sued in ordinary courts for negligence and other malpractices.

The case arose from a 2007 National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) verdict, which was challenged by bar bodies and stayed by the Supreme Court in 2009. The recent ruling also suggests that doctors might receive similar relief, as the Court indicated a need to reconsider a 1995 judgment that brought medical professionals under the Consumer Protection Act. This decision significantly affects the liability of legal professionals in cases of professional misconduct. The article was written by Aaratrika Bhaumik and produced by Shikha Kumari.

The article discusses a series of protests and violent clashes in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) due to rising prices of essential goods and perceived discrimination by Islamabad. The unrest began with the arrest of leaders from the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), who planned a march to Muzaffarabad. This led to widespread protests, resulting in casualties and injuries. In response, Pakistan's Prime Minister approved a subsidy program to lower prices, but violence escalated when a convoy of paramilitary Rangers was attacked. Activists and politicians in PoK have long accused the government of discrimination, citing unfair taxes, inflation, and lack of local employment. Last year's protests over high wheat prices and electricity tariffs set the stage for the current unrest. Despite agreements and government concessions, tensions remain high, with continued protests and a call for a judicial inquiry into the recent violence. The situation reflects deep-seated issues of governance and resource distribution in PoK.

India has provided aid to Kenya in the form of relief materials, including medicines and essential supplies, due to severe flooding caused by incessant rainfall. Despite efforts to reopen schools, 2,000 remained closed due to the floods. The United Nations reports that heavy rains and flash floods have affected nearly 849,000 people across East Africa, displacing over 350,000. The El Niño weather pattern is largely responsible for the unusually heavy rainfall, which has been one of the strongest on record. The flooding has resulted in approximately 267 deaths, 188 injuries, and 75 missing persons in Kenya, with significant damage to infrastructure and agriculture. The Indian Ocean Dipole and predictions of continued El Niño conditions have contributed to the crisis. Human Rights Watch criticized the Kenyan government for inadequate flood mitigation measures. The floods have destroyed roads, schools, businesses, and health facilities, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases and threatening food security. President Ruto has announced plans for resettlement, aid, and rebuilding efforts in response to the disaster.

The article discusses the challenges of solid waste management (SWM) in New Delhi, where over **3,800 tonnes** of waste remain untreated daily, contributing to public health and environmental issues. The city generates around **13,000 tonnes** of waste per day, expected to increase with the growing population. Despite having waste-processing facilities with a collective capacity of **9,200 tonnes per day**, a significant portion of waste is not processed due to various challenges.

The main issues include:
- **Lack of waste segregation** at the source by households and commercial establishments.
- **Insufficient land** for waste processing plants.
- **Public unawareness** and improper disposal habits.
- **Irregular waste collection services** and illegal dumping.
- **Lack of coordination** among municipal bodies.

To address these, the article suggests scaling up processing capacity, promoting waste segregation, and learning from best practices. It emphasizes the need for **decentralized composting** and **dry waste collection centers**, as well as **partnerships** for setting up facilities and managing non-recyclable waste through **waste-to-energy projects**. The goal is to ensure all waste is scientifically processed and to mitigate environmental impacts. The authors, Pradeep Dadlani and Pushkara S.V., are experienced professionals in SWM.

### [Why was NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha’s arrest invalidated by the top Court? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-was-newsclick-founder-prabir-purkayasthas-arrest-invalidated-by-the-top-court-explained/article68177999.ece)

The Supreme Court of India has ordered the release of NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha, ruling that his arrest under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) by the Delhi Police was invalid. The Court highlighted that Purkayastha was not provided the grounds for his arrest in writing, which is a fundamental requirement. The case emphasizes the importance of following due process, especially under stringent laws like the UAPA, which places a reverse burden of proof on the accused, making bail challenging to obtain.

Purkayastha was arrested on allegations of receiving funds from Chinese firms for pro-China propaganda. His counsel argued that the FIR was not publicized nor provided to him, and he was not informed of the remand proceedings in time, violating his constitutional rights. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the necessity of written communication of arrest grounds, aligning with constitutional safeguards and ensuring the accused can consult their lawyer and seek bail effectively. The ruling may not prevent future arrests but mandates adherence to due process.

### [The verdict in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-verdict-in-the-narendra-dabholkar-murder-case/article68170148.ece)

A special CBI Court in Pune sentenced Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar to life imprisonment for the murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, imposing a ₹5 lakh fine. However, three others, including the alleged mastermind Virendrasinh Tawade, were acquitted due to insufficient evidence. Dabholkar, a physician and prominent anti-superstition activist, was shot dead in 2013. His murder sparked national outrage and demands for a probe into a possible common conspiracy with other similar cases. The court criticized the investigation's failure to identify the mastermind behind the crime and noted procedural lapses by state authorities. Despite the convictions, Dabholkar's family intends to appeal the acquittals, citing a broader conspiracy threat to rationalists' safety. The State government is considering an appeal against the acquittals following the court's observations.

### [An overview of the Smart Cities Mission | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/smart-cities-mission-status-an-overview/article68172436.ece)

The article discusses the progress and challenges of the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) in India. Initiated by the NDA-1 government in 2015, the SCM aimed to develop 100 cities with advanced infrastructure and ICT solutions. Despite an ambitious start, the mission faced several hurdles:

- **Lack of a clear definition**: The SCM did not have a universally accepted definition of a smart city, leading to varied interpretations across different regions.
- **Funding and execution issues**: The original budget of ₹2 lakh crore was reduced by 16%, and many projects are unlikely to meet the extended deadline of June 2024. Moreover, less than 5% of the funding came from public-private partnerships (PPP).
- **Governance model**: The SCM adopted a business model of governance, creating Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) that marginalized the role of elected councils.
- **Exclusionary development**: The mission was criticized for focusing on less than 1% of a city's geographical area, ignoring the diverse urban realities of India.
- **Misalignment with constitutional amendments**: The SPV model was not in line with the 74th Constitutional Amendment, leading to objections from many cities.
- **Social and environmental impact**: The SCM led to the displacement of people from poorer localities and increased urban flooding due to infrastructure projects disrupting natural water channels.

The article suggests that the SCM's limited budget and top-down approach have made it less effective in addressing the broader needs of urban India. It concludes by highlighting the need for a more inclusive and substantial investment to make Indian cities livable.

### [Sikkim flood was one of Asia’s worst climate disasters in 2023](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/sikkim-2023-glacial-lake-outburst-flood-climate-change-analysis/article68152208.ece)

The article discusses a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Sikkim, India, in October 2023, which led to the collapse of the Teesta III hydroelectric dam and resulted in over 100 fatalities and widespread damage. The event was highlighted in the World Meteorological Organisation's report as one of the worst climate-related disasters in Asia for the year.

Glacial lakes form from the erosion caused by moving glaciers, which create natural dams of debris. These lakes can lead to GLOFs when the dam structures weaken and release water rapidly, causing flooding. The High-Mountain Asia region, which includes the Tibetan plateau, is particularly vulnerable due to its large volume of ice.

The specific GLOF event in Sikkim was triggered by a breach in the South Lhonak glacier, leading to significant destruction 60 km downstream at Chungthang. Satellite imagery showed a considerable reduction in the lake's volume, and monitoring stations recorded surges in water levels. A subsequent landslide created a new lake, which still exists and requires monitoring.

Experts cited in the article link the shrinking of glaciers and the formation of glacial lakes to climate change, emphasizing the need for early warning systems and infrastructure designed to withstand GLOFs. The article also mentions the role of anthropogenic activities in exacerbating the consequences of such disasters.

Overall, the article calls for better risk management and adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of glacial lake expansions and GLOFs, which are expected to become more frequent and severe due to climate change.

### [How is India streamlining the pharma sector? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/how-is-india-streamlining-the-pharma-sector-explained/article68165988.ece)

India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has centralized the issuance of manufacturing licenses for drugs intended for export, revoking the authority previously delegated to State licensing bodies. This move aims to address concerns over the quality of drugs supplied internationally. India, being the third-largest producer of pharmaceuticals globally and a major vaccine supplier, is preparing for significant growth in its generic drug market with $251 billion worth of drug sales expected to go off-patent between 2022 and 2030. The industry is advised to adapt to external factors and align strategies to capitalize on these opportunities. The centralization is also part of a crackdown on poor manufacturing practices, following the cancellation of licenses of over 10 companies and notices to 26 others for non-compliance. The new order requires pharmaceutical companies to obtain No Objection Certificates (NOCs) online from CDSCO's zonal offices before applying for manufacturing licenses from State/UT drug regulators. The change is expected to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and support the goal of reaching $450 billion in pharma exports by 2047. Industry experts believe this centralization will not significantly impact costs or cause delays, as the central government has always been the ultimate licensing authority.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi filed his nomination for the Rae Bareli constituency in Uttar Pradesh, accompanied by senior party members. The article discusses the legalities of a candidate contesting from two constituencies, as per the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951. It highlights that while a candidate can contest from two seats, they can only hold one if elected from both. The Election Commission of India and the Law Commission have proposed amending the RPA to restrict candidates to one seat to avoid unnecessary byelections. The article also outlines the eligibility criteria for contesting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in India, including age, citizenship, and absence of certain disqualifications. Additionally, it mentions recent amendments to political party funding rules by the Election Commission of India, including a reduction in the cash donation limit and the scrapping of the Electoral Bond Scheme by the Supreme Court. The article concludes with comments on the use of muscle power in elections and the role of central paramilitary forces in preventing malpractices like booth-capturing.

### [John Swinney | The gradualist](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/john-swinney-the-gradualist/article68165827.ece)

John Ramsay Swinney, a seasoned member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has been sworn in as Scotland's First Minister. He succeeds Humza Yousaf, who resigned after a no-confidence threat related to a coalition breakdown with the Scottish Greens. Swinney secured his position by gaining the support of 64 parliament members and the abstention of the Scottish Greens.

Swinney, who has served in various political roles including head of the SNP, Deputy First Minister, and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, faced criticism and a no-confidence vote in his career. Despite stepping down from his Cabinet roles in 2023, he accepted the role of First Minister out of a sense of duty.

As Scotland marks 25 years of parliamentary devolution, Swinney, a proponent of gradual independence, focuses on winning the next elections to gain public support for an independent Scotland. He prioritizes immediate issues like the cost of living crisis over the independence agenda, despite internal party divisions and a lack of majority in the Holyrood. Swinney aims to unite perspectives and address challenges such as a weakened party, a divided parliament, and economic inflation.

### [Rafah | Opening the gates of hell](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rafah-opening-the-gates-of-hell/article68165802.ece)

The article discusses the severe humanitarian crisis in Rafah, Gaza, following an Israeli offensive. The city's population has swelled to 1.5 million, with many living in dire conditions. Rafah's history as a conflict flashpoint is highlighted, including its rule by Egypt after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and subsequent Israeli occupation post-1967. The current situation involves Israel's refusal to meet Hamas's demands for a ceasefire and full withdrawal, despite international pressure and a proposed three-phase ceasefire deal. Israel's objectives to dismantle Hamas and secure hostage release remain unmet, leading to a stalemate. U.S.-Israel tensions have risen, with the U.S. threatening to withhold offensive weapons if Israel attacks Rafah. The Israeli Prime Minister faces a dilemma: proceeding with the attack could lead to further civilian casualties and international isolation, while a ceasefire could destabilize his government due to internal political pressures. The United Nations warns that an attack on Rafah could result in a humanitarian catastrophe. The article concludes with the Israeli Prime Minister's firm stance on standing alone if necessary.

### [Dushyant Chautala | Rebel prince](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dushyant-chautala-rebel-prince/article68165823.ece)

Haryana is experiencing political upheaval as three independent MLAs have withdrawn support from the BJP-led government. The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), formerly allied with the BJP, is now offering support to the Congress to form a new government. Dushyant Chautala, the JJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister since 2019, is working to maintain unity among his 10 legislators amidst significant political shifts and upcoming elections.

Chautala has proposed external support to the Congress and requested a 'floor test' to assess the majority in the government. The BJP, led by Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini, holds 43 seats in the 88-member assembly, just shy of a majority. Despite this, BJP leaders claim their government is stable, hinting at potential backing from dissatisfied JJP MLAs.

Internal discord within the JJP and challenges from farmer groups are putting Chautala's leadership to the test. The JJP, which primarily represents the agrarian Jat community, is facing backlash from farmers dissatisfied with the BJP's policies at the Centre. Chautala's current focus is on quelling internal rebellion and addressing farmers' grievances to prevent the JJP from becoming marginalized in Haryana's political landscape. The party, which was instrumental in forming the government in 2019, is now at a crossroads just before the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.

John Swinney has been sworn in as the First Minister of Scotland following the resignation of Humza Yousaf. Yousaf's departure came after the Scottish National Party (SNP), which advocates for Scottish independence, ended its power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens due to a decision to scrap climate targets. The SNP has faced financial scrutiny since 2021, leading to multiple resignations and arrests, including former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her husband, Peter Murell. The SNP's recent actions led to a no-confidence motion, which they survived, allowing Swinney to take leadership. The Scottish Greens have expressed their conditional support for the SNP, emphasizing their commitment to climate crisis policies. The SNP remains a minority government and maintains its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2045, despite scrapping the 2030 target and facing criticism for failing to meet previous climate goals.

The Karnataka High Court has struck down a 2008 amendment to the Employees’ Provident Funds Scheme that included foreign workers in the provident fund (PF), declaring it unconstitutional. The court ruled that the lack of a salary cap for international workers, unlike the ₹15,000 limit for domestic workers, violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The decision is expected to be contested, and its impact is being assessed by employers, especially since similar cases are pending in other states. The 1952 Act, which the amendment altered, is a key social security legislation in India, and the ruling may affect India's social security agreements with other countries. The court's decision emphasizes the need for equitable treatment of domestic and international workers under the PF schemes. The Ministry of Labour and Employment is considering an appeal, highlighting the importance of these provisions for Indian workers abroad. The ruling has significant implications for the future of provident fund benefits for international workers in India.

### [Reservation within Constitutional bounds](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/reservation-within-constitutional-bounds/article68157106.ece)

The article discusses the contentious issue of reservation in India and compares it with affirmative action policies in other countries. It highlights the political debate around caste census and reservation policies, with the BJP contesting the Congress' demands. The Indian Constitution's provisions for equality and social justice are explained, including Articles 15 and 16, which allow for special provisions for the advancement of OBC, SC, and ST communities. The historical **Indra Sawhney** and **Janhit Abhiyan** court cases are mentioned, which upheld the reservation for OBCs and the constitutional validity of the EWS reservation, respectively.

The article also touches upon the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling against race-based affirmative action in college admissions and the practices of positive action in the U.K. and educational measures in France. It details the history of reservation for Muslim communities within the OBC quota in Karnataka and the sub-categorisation for Muslims in other states. The Congress party's manifesto promise to remove the 50% cap on reservations is noted.

Furthermore, the article discusses the **Rohini Commission's** work on sub-categorisation among OBC castes and the lack of representation among many OBC communities in jobs and educational institutions. It also addresses the issues faced by Dalit Christians and Muslims, and the government's commission to study extending SC reservation to these groups.

The author, Rangarajan R, a former IAS officer, argues for the need to deliberate on increasing the reservation limit, introducing creamy layers for SC and ST, and extending reservations to marginalized communities, with the goal of achieving social justice while maintaining constitutional equality. The views expressed are personal.

### [Israel’s ‘limited’ military operation in Rafah | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rafah-israel-military-operation-invasion-explainer-gaza-palestine-netanyahu/article68150206.ece)

The article reports on the escalating conflict in Gaza, particularly focusing on the Israeli ground invasion of Rafah and the seizure of the Gaza side of the border crossing with Egypt. This move came shortly after Hamas accepted a ceasefire proposal, raising concerns about the prospects of ending the war that has already claimed over 34,700 lives.

Israeli tanks entered Rafah, and airstrikes targeted the area near the Rafah border crossing, resulting in at least 23 Palestinian casualties. The U.S. described the invasion as a "limited operation," which followed an Israeli military order for over a million people in Rafah to evacuate to a safer zone near Khan Younis.

The U.S. President and human rights groups have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of the invasion, urging a ceasefire to protect lives and prevent further devastation. Despite international pressure and the ceasefire proposal by Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu rejected the truce, stating it did not meet Israel's demands and vowing to continue military operations to pressure Hamas and secure the release of hostages.

The article also highlights the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Rafah serving as a shelter for 1.4 million displaced Palestinians. The Rafah crossing is a critical point for aid delivery and the main exit from Gaza not under direct Israeli control. The Israeli military's control over the crossing has raised global concerns for the 2.3 million people in Gaza facing hunger and homelessness due to the war. The situation remains tense, with the future of the ceasefire and the welfare of Gaza's residents hanging in the balance.

### [How the Widal test is clouding India’s sense of its typhoid problem | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/widal-test-overuse-typhoid-antimicrobial-resistance-health-expenses/article68152863.ece)

The article discusses the challenges of diagnosing and treating typhoid fever in India. It highlights the limitations of the Widal test, which is widely used in India due to its simplicity and low cost. The test detects antibodies against the bacteria causing typhoid, but it can produce false results due to cross-reactivity with other infections, prior vaccination, or antibiotic therapy. Misdiagnosis can lead to serious complications or contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) when antibiotics are used unnecessarily.

The gold standard for diagnosis is culturing the bacteria from blood or bone marrow, but this is resource-intensive and not always feasible. The article calls for better point-of-care tests, improved surveillance of AMR, and regional data on effective antibiotics. It also emphasizes the need for better sanitation and access to safe food and water to prevent the disease. The authors, Dr. Vasundhara Rangaswamy and Dr. Parth Sharma, advocate for a 'hub and spoke' model for sample collection and processing to improve diagnostic capabilities. They stress the importance of constant environmental vigilance and data-sharing to manage typhoid, which affects millions globally and can be life-threatening if untreated.

### [The delay in Nagaland civic body polls | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nagaland/the-delay-in-nagaland-civic-body-polls-explained/article68154739.ece)

The article discusses the upcoming Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) elections in Nagaland, scheduled for June 26, 2024. The elections are significant as they mark the end of a 20-year impasse over the reservation of 33% of the wards for women, a mandate from the 74th Amendment to the Constitution of India. Previously, the Naga hohos opposed this quota, arguing it violated Nagaland's special provisions under Article 371A. The first civic elections in 2004 had no reservations for women, and subsequent attempts to hold elections with the reservation led to widespread protests and violence, resulting in the cancellation of the election process in 2017.

In November 2023, the Nagaland Assembly passed an amended Municipal Bill that retained the 33% women's reservation but removed the reservation for the chairperson's post and taxation on immovable property. This amendment was broadly accepted after consultations with stakeholders. The new Nagaland Municipal Act of 2023 will govern the upcoming elections, with nominations from June 7-11, scrutiny on June 13, and the last date for withdrawal on June 20. Results will be announced on June 29. The reservation for women will be rotated among the wards.

Despite the acceptance of the amended act by most tribal bodies, the Eastern Nagaland People’s Organisation (ENPO) has decided not to participate in the ULB polls or any Central or State election, continuing their protest against the failure to create the autonomous Frontier Nagaland Territory. Consequently, the Lok Sabha polls on April 19 saw no participation from voters in the six eastern districts represented by ENPO, and the same is expected for the ULB polls.

### [Israel bans Al Jazeera: A look at the history of its feud, the network’s coverage of Gaza & accusations](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-bans-al-jazeera-a-look-at-the-history-of-its-feud-the-networks-coverage-of-gaza-accusations/article68150990.ece)

The article reports on the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, focusing on the Israeli government's decision to shut down Al Jazeera's operations in Israel. The closure, which occurred on World Press Freedom Day, was justified by Prime Minister Netanyahu as a response to Al Jazeera's alleged incitement and harm to Israel's security. Al Jazeera has been reporting live from Gaza since the conflict began with a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023.

Al Jazeera has criticized the closure as a violation of human rights and a suppression of the free press, vowing to pursue legal channels to protect its journalists and the public's right to information. The Israeli law, passed on April 1, 2024, allows for the temporary ban of foreign news outlets considered a security threat, enabling the confiscation of their equipment.

The article details Al Jazeera's coverage of the conflict, including the initial Hamas-led attack, continuous air attacks by Israel, and counter-claims by Al Jazeera challenging IDF's accusations of sexual violence by Hamas. It also highlights the network's reporting on civilian casualties, the siege of Gaza, and protests in Israel demanding Prime Minister Netanyahu's resignation and a ceasefire.

Furthermore, the article touches on Al Jazeera's history of tension with the Israeli government, including past incidents leading to sanctions and threats of closure. The current ban comes amidst Qatar's mediation efforts for a ceasefire, with Hamas accepting a proposal while Israel continues its military operations. The ceasefire deal under discussion includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the return of displaced Palestinians, and an exchange of captives and prisoners. Negotiations are ongoing, despite continued Israeli attacks on Rafah.

The article discusses the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, KP.2 and KP1.1, known as 'FLiRT' variants, which are causing concern due to their ability to evade immunity from vaccines and previous infections. These variants are descendants of the Omicron JN.1 variant and have led to a rise in cases and hospitalizations in the U.S., U.K., South Korea, New Zealand, and India. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) has reported cases of these variants in India.

The FLiRT variants, particularly KP.2, are more dominant and prevalent, with the U.S. CDC reporting it accounts for about 25% of new cases in the U.S. as of late April. Symptoms of the new variants are similar to other Omicron subvariants. Research indicates that KP.2 can escape immune protection from the latest vaccines and previous infections, posing challenges to current COVID-19 management strategies.

In India, there has been a surge in cases since early April, and while vaccinations remain effective in preventing severe illness, health bodies are calling for updates to vaccines to target these new variants. AstraZeneca has also begun withdrawing its COVID-19 vaccine due to a surplus of updated vaccines available.

The article emphasizes that COVID-19 is becoming a cyclical disease, with waves of infection expected to continue. It suggests that management strategies need to adapt to this reality, focusing on sustained surveillance and protection for the vulnerable. The virus, while not causing profound illness on its own, can still pose risks to those with pre-existing health conditions and contribute to the burden of respiratory infections. The long-term health impacts of Long COVID are also highlighted as a concern. The overall message is that COVID-19 will persist, and efforts should focus on learning to live with the virus rather than attempting to eliminate it.

### [The Kotak Mahindra Bank controversy | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/the-kotak-mahindra-bank-controversy-explained/article68150904.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed restrictions on Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) due to deficiencies in its IT systems. The bank is barred from adding new customers to its online and mobile banking services and from issuing new credit cards, although it can continue to serve existing customers. The RBI's action follows a two-year examination of KMB's IT systems, revealing serious deficiencies in IT inventory, user access management, data leak prevention, and business continuity planning. The bank's non-compliance with RBI's Corrective Action Plans and frequent digital banking outages have led to this decision.

The regulatory action is expected to impact KMB's credit growth and profitability, particularly in the credit card segment, which is a high-yield growth area for the bank. Despite this, S&P Global Ratings believes the RBI's measures will not materially affect the bank's ratings. KMB's net profit increased by 18% in the last quarter, and the bank plans to continue investing in its card franchise. However, the ban may force KMB to rely more on its physical branch network, increasing operating costs. The bank's CEO expressed concerns about the reputational impact of the RBI's actions. It is anticipated that it may take a year for KMB to fully address the RBI's concerns and complete the necessary technological enhancements and external audit.

### [Why is NASA creating a standard time for the moon? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/why-is-nasa-allotting-a-standard-time-for-the-moon/article68131522.ece)

The article discusses the establishment of a **Coordinated Lunar Time (LTC)** by NASA, directed by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), to standardize timekeeping for cislunar operations. This initiative is part of the National Cislunar Science and Technology Strategy and aims to align with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on Earth. The LTC is expected to be considered by December 31, 2024, as part of NASA's Moon-to-Mars Architecture Concept Review cycle.

The European Space Agency (ESA) has launched a project called 'Moonlight' to support NASA's Artemis mission, which raised the question of setting a single time zone for the moon. The slow rotation of the moon suggests the practicality of having a single time zone, similar to UTC. The article explains that atomic clocks are used for their accuracy in measuring time, while solar time is variable. Currently, moon missions follow the time of the operating country, and the International Space Station (ISS) runs on UTC.

The White House's policy aims to standardize time for celestial bodies, starting with the moon. The LTC will simplify operations for future missions and commercial activities on the lunar surface. The article also touches on the challenges of defining lunar time due to the moon's weaker gravitational pull and rotation, which affects the speed of clocks. A global satellite navigation system for the moon is planned by 2030, requiring a unified lunar time for communication and coordination.

Several countries have lunar ambitions, with China planning to send astronauts by 2030 and India by 2040. Japan has recently become the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon. The OSTP emphasizes that U.S. leadership in defining a standard will benefit all spacefaring nations, although consensus on LTC may be challenging due to non-participation by China and Russia in the Artemis Accords. The article concludes with the global discussion on the need for a unified lunar time at an ESA meeting.

### [Explained | Why has densely populated Rwanda agreed to the U.K.’s plan to deport migrants?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-rwanda-asylum-deport-migrants-explainer-policy-volunteer-scheme/article68141949.ece)

The article discusses the U.K.'s controversial immigration policy involving the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda. The U.K. government has been deporting asylum seekers under a voluntary returns scheme and is preparing for more deportations as part of a new law. Despite legal challenges and the Supreme Court declaring the policy unlawful, the government has finalized a new agreement with Rwanda, introducing a bill to declare it a "safe third country" for processing asylum claims.

The policy has been criticized for the risks it poses to asylum seekers due to Rwanda's dense population, poor human rights record, and inadequate asylum system. Critics argue that the policy may not effectively address human trafficking and dangerous crossings. However, Rwanda asserts its capability to accommodate migrants sent by Britain.

The article also details the history of the Voluntary Returns Scheme, financial assistance offered to migrants, and the eligibility criteria for the service. It highlights Rwanda's development after the 1994 genocide but also points out ongoing human rights concerns, including the treatment of refugees and dissenters.

Rwanda has agreed to accept more refugees, and the U.K. has promised development funding and to cover processing and integration costs. Rwandan President Paul Kagame emphasizes that the partnership with the U.K. is not economically motivated but aims to offer refugees a better life. The article concludes with perspectives on Rwanda's role as an ally to the West in addressing migration issues.

### [What is magnetic resonance imaging? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-magnetic-resonance-imaging-explained/article68145357.ece)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that has been indispensable since its development in the 1970s. It uses strong magnetic fields to produce images of soft tissues within the body, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, including cancer and neurological diseases. The MRI machine consists of a superconducting magnet, a radiofrequency pulse emitter, and a detector that works together to align hydrogen atoms in the body and capture their emitted signals to create detailed images.

The technique is safe, with no long-term effects on the body, but it cannot be used on individuals with metallic implants or objects. MRI scans are costly due to the high price of the machines and the energy-intensive process of maintaining them. Patients often bear these costs, which can be significant, especially for those without insurance. The procedure requires patients to remain still for an extended period, which can be uncomfortable, particularly for claustrophobic individuals. Despite these challenges, MRI remains a critical component of modern medical diagnostics.

Here's a summary of the article:

The Supreme Court of India has placed a stay on the Allahabad High Court's ruling that declared the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 unconstitutional. The Act was established to regulate madarsas and provide education from primary to research levels. The High Court had questioned the Act's validity, suggesting it violated the principle of secularism and constitutional articles related to equality, discrimination, and education.

The High Court had directed the Uttar Pradesh government to integrate madarsa students into regular schools, citing the lack of quality and universal education in madarsas, which focused primarily on Islamic studies. The Supreme Court's stay order came after senior advocates argued that the High Court's decision would disrupt the education of nearly 17 lakh students and that the Act's purpose was regulatory, not religious.

The Supreme Court will re-examine the case, considering whether the Act's regulatory nature conflicts with the secular principles of the Constitution and if the State has the authority to legislate on education matters reserved for the Union. The final arguments are scheduled for the second week of July.

### [How do mosquito bats work? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-do-mosquito-bats-work-explained/article68042488.ece)

Certainly! Here's a summary of the article:

As summer approaches, mosquitos become a common nuisance. At IIT Kanpur, these insects are often found bloated from feasting on blood. Despite their fascinating biology and physics, their biting makes them unwelcome. To combat them, the 'electric tennis bat' has become a popular tool. It works by having a positively charged central mesh and two negatively charged outer meshes. When a mosquito bridges these meshes, it completes the circuit, allowing current to flow and killing the mosquito.

The article explains that electric current is carried by electrons, which are shared among atoms in conductive materials like copper. In contrast, insulators like air hold onto their electrons until a high voltage forces them out, creating a mix of charged particles. This is similar to how a mosquito bat works, generating about 1,400 V to kill mosquitos and create sparks. These sparks' color depends on the atom types involved, with oxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere causing white or near-white sparks.

The author, Adhip Agarwala, an assistant professor of physics at IIT Kanpur, ties this to quantum mechanics, suggesting that understanding the emission of light at certain wavelengths requires knowledge of this field. He concludes by reminding us that when we use a mosquito bat, it's not just us, but also quantum physics, electrons, and atoms that are part of the victory over mosquitos. The article is from The Hindu and delves into physics and electrical engineering concepts. 

If you're interested in the detailed physics behind these phenomena or considering a course in physics, the article suggests that quantum mechanics is the key to understanding these processes.

The article from The Hindu discusses the Indian Ministry of Culture's decision to potentially delist 18 monuments previously deemed of national importance. This action is based on Section 35 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 (AMASR Act), which allows for such a change if the monuments are no longer considered important. The public has been given two months to raise objections or suggestions.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Ministry of Culture, is responsible for the upkeep of these monuments. If delisted, the ASI would no longer maintain them. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture has identified issues with the current state of protected monuments, noting that many may not have significant national value. A past report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India also highlighted that some monuments were untraceable.

The 18 monuments in question are spread across several Indian states and mostly date back to the pre-Independence era. Notably, the Kos Minars, mile markers from the time of Sher Shah Suri, are included in the list. The government is also considering an amendment to the AMASR Act that would allow for construction projects near these monuments, which is currently restricted to preserve their integrity. This amendment aims to facilitate public works and development projects that are currently hindered by the existing regulations.

The article from The Hindu provides a comprehensive history and analysis of the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in India. It traces the journey from the first trial of EVMs in the 1982 Paravur Assembly elections to their widespread use in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The EVM was introduced as a solution to the logistical challenges and fraud associated with paper ballots. Despite initial controversies and legal challenges, EVMs were constitutionally validated and fully replaced ballot papers in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

Over the years, the technology has faced skepticism regarding its transparency and reliability, with concerns about potential tampering and the lack of a verifiable paper trail. This led to the introduction of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in 2013, which produces a paper slip for voter verification. The 2019 elections were the first to use EVMs backed 100% by VVPAT machines. However, issues persist, including mismatches in vote counts and questions about the software integrity within EVMs.

The Supreme Court's recent order for a detailed counting of VVPAT slips aims to enhance the electoral process's integrity. Despite technological advancements and legal endorsements, there is ongoing debate among politicians and activists about the possibility of returning to paper ballots for elections. The article highlights the evolving nature of voting technology and the continuous efforts to balance efficiency, transparency, and security in India's electoral system.

Issues include conflicts of interest, as companies that create rankings sometimes consult with universities to help them improve their positions. Additionally, universities provide these companies with access to their data without permission. Critics argue that rankings oversimplify complex university roles and prioritize research excellence based on factors like citations, which can be manipulated. In response, several prominent universities have withdrawn from traditional rankings, recognizing their potential to promote harmful behaviors and negative long-term effects.

### [Supreme Court’s ban on Patanjali ads | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-courts-ban-on-patanjali-ads-explained/article67899090.ece)

The Supreme Court has prohibited Patanjali Ayurved from discrediting allopathy and advertising products that claim to cure chronic conditions. This is because Patanjali's ads present their products as a 'permanent relief,' which is "misleading" and violates the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. The court also issued a contempt notice against Patanjali and its Managing Director Acharya Balkrishna for failing to adhere to directions passed in November last year. The case was filed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in response to Patanjali ads that allegedly denigrated allopathy and made exaggerated claims about its drugs. Patanjali has been previously found to have sold substandard products and failed to comply with drug manufacturing standards. Despite being warned by the court in November 2023, Patanjali continued to make misleading claims in its advertisements. The court has now temporarily banned all forms of advertisements for Patanjali's medicinal products. The case will be heard next on March 19.

### [The resolutions against Centre’s border plan](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-resolutions-against-centres-border-plan/article67908288.ece)

Mizoram and Nagaland have opposed the Centre's decision to fence the India-Myanmar border and scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) agreement. The FMR allows cross-border movement up to 16 km without travel documents. The Centre claims the decision is to prevent illegal migration, drug smuggling, and extremist activity. However, Mizoram and Nagaland argue that it will divide communities and disrupt age-old ties. The Supreme Court has ruled that State Assembly resolutions against central laws are merely opinions with no legal force.

**India's Gaganyaan Mission**

India's Gaganyaan Mission aims to send astronauts to low-earth orbit with a launch scheduled for 2025. The mission includes:

* **Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3):** Three-stage rocket to launch the orbital module.
* **Orbital Module:** Crew module (for three astronauts) with parachutes and life support systems, and service module for propulsion.
* **Crew:** Four shortlisted astronaut candidates from the Indian Air Force.

The mission has been approved and several technologies have been tested, including:

* Space Capsule Recovery Experiment (SRE, 2007)
* Crew-Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE, 2014)
* Testing of CE-20 engines and other components

The crew module and life support systems will be procured externally due to a lack of domestic manufacturing capability.

The mission is part of India's space reforms, including the establishment of NSIL and IN-SPACe, and aims to establish India's self-sufficiency in sending humans to space.

### [Vijay Shekhar Sharma | Embattled entrepreneur](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/vijay-shekhar-sharma-embattled-entrepreneur/article67908316.ece)

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, was emotional at the company's listing in 2021, seeing it as a realization of the company's goal of empowering India through digital payments. Despite its initial success, Paytm has faced regulatory hurdles and shaken investor confidence. Sharma's journey as an entrepreneur began in college, where he faced challenges with the English medium of instruction. He started XS, a content management system, and later founded One97 Communications in 2000. Paytm was launched in 2010, focusing on removing cash and promoting financial inclusion. The company's entry into lending and its ambition for a small finance bank license have been hindered by regulatory issues. Sharma's intuitive and opinionated approach to decision-making has also impacted the company's performance. As Paytm struggles with its stock price below its debut price, Sharma remains determined to preserve its profitability and fight regulatory challenges.

### [Gaganyaan astronauts | The chosen four](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gaganyaan-astronauts-the-chosen-four/article67908298.ece)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has revealed the four astronaut candidates for the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Gaganyaan mission: Group Captains Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander Shubanshu Shukla. These highly trained Air Force test pilots will undergo rigorous training at various facilities in India and Russia. Gaganyaan aims to demonstrate human spaceflight in low-earth orbit using an Indian launch vehicle. The mission has two uncrewed test flights planned before the first crewed flight, tentatively scheduled for 2025. The crew module can accommodate up to three astronauts, but ISRO may only send one on the maiden mission, highlighting the importance of both physical and mental fitness.

### [Maharashtra’s latest Maratha quota law and its challenges | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra-latest-maratha-quota-law-and-its-challenges-explained/article67891042.ece)

The Maharashtra Assembly has passed a Bill granting 10% reservation in education and government jobs to the Maratha community. The new law is based on a survey that claims 84% of Marathas qualify as backward. However, activists are demanding a quota carved out from the existing OBC category, while OBC leaders are concerned about their share being reduced. The Bill does not affect the existing OBC quota or the issuance of Kunbi caste certificates to Marathas. Those within the "creamy layer" bracket are not eligible for the benefits. The law has been formulated based on the report of the Justice Sunil B Shukre-led Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission. It argues that exceptional circumstances justify granting reservation to the community beyond the Supreme Court-approved 50% limit. The law is unlikely to pass judicial scrutiny as the Supreme Court has previously struck down a similar law in Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, holding that the Marathas are a "dominant forward class."

### [The Italian court ruling against returning sea migrants to Libya | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-italian-court-ruling-against-returning-sea-migrants-to-libya/article67894696.ece)

In a landmark ruling, Italy's highest court declared Libya an unsafe harbor for migrants. The verdict prohibits the return of migrants rescued at sea to Libya, where they face human rights abuses in detention centers controlled by coastguards and militias. The ruling upholds the conviction of a ship captain for returning migrants to Libya in 2018, considering it a violation of international maritime and humanitarian laws. Despite the ruling, Italy and the EU continue to support Libyan authorities in intercepting migrants, allowing for the "push-back" of people to Libya's unsafe conditions. This practice is supported by right-wing parties capitalizing on anti-immigration policies, but has been met with criticism from human rights organizations.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg believes Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO is inevitable, despite concerns among member states. Russia opposes NATO expansion, viewing it as a provocation. Ukraine faces a shortage of artillery ammunition, leading to heavy casualties. Russia has suffered significant losses, but has made recent gains. The US faces Congressional resistance to aid for Ukraine from Republicans. The EU is struggling to finance its support for Ukraine's war effort. NATO is seeking to address Ukraine's concerns through increased cooperation, but full membership is not yet on the table. Ukraine's future is uncertain with potential Russian victories and the possibility of Trump's return to power.

### [On cross-voting in Rajya Sabha elections | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-cross-voting-in-rajya-sabha-elections-explained/article67901293.ece)

The Rajya Sabha elections have been marred by cross-voting from MLAs in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka. To curb this practice, the Representation of the People Act was amended in 2003 to mandate open ballot voting and the 'anti-defection' law was introduced in 1985. Despite these measures, cross-voting continues, undermining the sanctity of the election process. The Supreme Court has upheld open ballot voting for Rajya Sabha elections, but ruled that cross-voting does not warrant disqualification under the 'anti-defection' law. However, it has also held that a member's conduct within and outside the House can be considered when determining voluntary abandonment of party membership. To combat cross-voting effectively, the Supreme Court may consider reviewing its ruling in light of its judgment in the Ravi Naik case, potentially leading to disqualification for MLAs who defy party whips in Rajya Sabha elections.

### [Why sustainable funding matters for India’s ‘science power’ ambition | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/sustainable-funding-science-power-ambition-india/article67884760.ece)

- India's R&D spending has declined from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 0.64% currently, despite calls to double this spending.


- India needs to spend at least 3% of GDP on R&D annually until 2047 to achieve developed nation status.


- While the private sector contributes significantly to R&D in developed countries, in India, it accounts for only 36.4% of GERD.


- The Anusandhan National Research Foundation was meant to address funding issues, but its implementation has been delayed and funding remains unclear.


- Under-utilization of allocated funds is a recurring problem, with ministries like DBT, DST, and DSIR consistently falling short of budget execution.


- To effectively utilize R&D funds, the government needs to prioritize R&D spending, streamline bureaucratic processes, and build capacity within agencies.


- Encouraging private investment through incentives and clear regulatory roadmaps is crucial to boost R&D funding.


- India needs to develop the bureaucratic capacity to evaluate science projects and monitor fund utilization to become a science power by 2047.

NATO started its largest military exercise, Steadfast Defender 2024, in response to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The exercise aims to demonstrate NATO's collective military strength and commitment to its members' security. It includes land, air, sea, cyber, and space operations, involving over 90,000 troops from 31 allies and Sweden. The first phase focuses on maritime reinforcement, while the second phase involves multi-domain exercises across Europe. Experts believe the exercise serves as a deterrent to Russia and a warning to the Kremlin. NATO allies, including the US, France, and Germany, have pledged significant financial and military support to Ukraine. The exercise is strategically located in European countries, particularly those near the Baltic Sea, due to Russia's presence in Kaliningrad. The inclusion of cyber and space operations makes the exercise relevant to modern warfare. NATO member states aim to strengthen their collaboration in real-world operations through this exercise.

China plans to loan a pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo as part of its panda diplomacy efforts. Panda diplomacy, which dates back to the Tang Dynasty, involves gifting or loaning pandas as a symbol of friendship. China stopped gifting pandas in the 1980s but now loans them for a fee, with conditions typically including proper facilities and an agreement to return offspring. While experts believe panda diplomacy has environmental implications, China has hinted at resuming panda loans to the U.S. following a meeting between President Xi and President Biden.

This article discusses the challenges faced in matching influenza and COVID-19 vaccines to the circulating strains of the viruses. Due to the long gestation period of vaccine development, strains may have drifted by the time vaccines reach the market. The effectiveness of the vaccines is influenced by the match between the strains included in the vaccine and those in circulation. The article highlights the decline in protection over time and the emergence of highly mutated variants, such as Omicron. Researchers emphasize the importance of updating vaccines to match new variants. A study suggests that updating vaccines can significantly improve neutralizing antibody titres and increase efficacy against future variants. However, there are factors to consider, including the distance between antigens in the updated vaccine and future variants. The study primarily focuses on humoral immunity conferred by antibodies and doesn't consider cellular immunity conferred by T-cells. The article also discusses the need for updated vaccines in India, taking into account the objective of preventing severe disease and the challenges of updating traditional influenza vaccines versus mRNA-based vaccines.

As GPT-3.5, I can provide a summary of the article you shared. The article discusses the proceedings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) between South Africa and Israel. South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide during its military campaign in Gaza and has invoked the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. South Africa has requested provisional measures to stop the alleged genocide. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, and only states can be parties in cases before the Court. The Genocide Convention of 1948, which both South Africa and Israel are signatories to, defines genocide as acts such as killing members of a national, racial, ethnic, or religious group. South Africa has accused Israel of causing harm to the Palestinian people in Gaza and has cited statements from Israeli officials and international organizations to support its claims. Israel, on the other hand, denies any genocidal intent and argues that its operations in Gaza are aimed at protecting its people and removing the threat posed by Hamas. The ICJ is expected to issue a ruling on provisional measures in the coming weeks, but it does not have the means to enforce its own orders. The article also mentions the possibility of the UN Security Council taking measures, but any enforcement would be subject to the veto power of permanent members, such as the United States.

The article discusses the concerns raised by passengers regarding the enrollment process for the Digi Yatra app at airports in India. Passengers reported that their facial biometrics were being collected without their consent or knowledge by security personnel and private staff. The CEO of Digi Yatra Foundation stated that the enrollment drive was intensified in December to allow passengers to experience the benefits of the app. Digi Yatra aims to streamline passenger movement at airports through digital processing. The app is owned by the Digi Yatra Foundation, which includes the Airports Authority of India and five private airports. Passengers need to download the app, register with their personal information and Aadhaar document, and upload a selfie. The app allows for facial recognition at e-gates, eliminating the need for physical boarding passes. The government claims that passenger data is not centrally stored and is purged within 24 hours. However, concerns have been raised about data protection and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is yet to be fully implemented.

### [International Court of Justice | Justice without power](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/international-court-of-justice-justice-without-power/article67738733.ece)

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest judicial body of the United Nations, recently held hearings regarding South Africa's accusation of Israel committing genocide in Gaza. The ICJ has dual jurisdictional powers, advisory and contentious, and was established in 1945 after the Permanent Court of International Justice became ineffective. The court's decisions are legally binding but often lack an enforcement mechanism. The participation of powerful member states and the court's slow procedures have also been criticized. However, the ICJ has played a role in expanding international law and has had major rulings adhered to by concerned parties. Its advisory role has also contributed to peaceful solutions and diplomatic efforts. The ongoing proceedings by South Africa will provide evidence for an advisory opinion on Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian territories. Despite its impact, the ICJ's effectiveness is hindered by political biases and the potential fragmentation of international law.
