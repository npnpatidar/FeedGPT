### [The stance of the Maldives President-elect on India | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-stance-of-the-maldives-president-elect-on-india-explained/article67482140.ece)

President-elect Mohamed Muizzu of the Maldives has expressed his desire to remove Indian troops from the country upon assuming office. This stance aligns with the opposition bloc's 'India Out' campaign, which criticized outgoing President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's 'India first' foreign policy. Currently, 75 Indian military personnel are stationed in the Maldives to operate and maintain aircraft gifted by India. Muizzu's pro-China stance and emphasis on removing Indian military presence may be driven by international media framing the Maldives elections as a referendum on India and China. However, Muizzu will face challenges in handling the Indian military question while also addressing the country's economic crisis and debt obligations. India has become the Maldives' main security and economic partner, committing $1.4 billion towards development needs. The Maldives' national security is closely tied to its collective security aspirations in the region, as highlighted by its participation in the 'Colombo Security Conclave' with India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius.

### [What has caused the recent thaw in U.S.-Venezuela ties? |  Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/what-has-caused-the-recent-thaw-in-us-venezuela-ties-explained/article67474221.ece)

Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader in Venezuela, has won a significant victory in the country's primary elections. This comes after the Biden administration agreed to ease sanctions against Venezuela's oil, gas, and mining industries in exchange for free and fair elections in 2024. The re-engagement between Washington and Caracas is partly due to the shifting geopolitical realities resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Venezuela, with its large oil reserves, has been able to withstand the effects of U.S. and EU sanctions with support from Cuba, China, Russia, and Iran. For President Maduro, the revival of ties with the U.S. could mean an end to his government's international isolation. However, it is uncertain if Machado will be allowed to challenge Maduro in the upcoming elections, as she has been disqualified from holding public office for 15 years. The Biden administration has indicated that the extent of sanctions relief will depend on Venezuela's progress towards democracy.

### [Will QR codes improve access to food labels? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/will-qr-codes-improve-access-to-food-labels-explained/article67470951.ece)

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has recommended the use of QR codes on food products to improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals. This move is important as India has a large market for packaged foods and is seeing an increase in non-communicable diseases, which can be linked to the consumption of pre-packaged foods. The CEO of Consumer Voice, Ashim Sanyal, states that this initiative will offer informed choices to consumers, but also emphasizes the need to identify unhealthy foods. The QR codes recommended by the FSSAI should provide comprehensive information about the product, including ingredients, nutritional information, allergens, manufacturing date, and contact information for customer inquiries. The inclusion of QR codes does not replace mandatory information on product labels required by regulations. The use of QR codes can improve brand image, customer loyalty, and operational efficiency for food manufacturers. The paper "Food Literacy & Food Labelling Laws - A Legal Analysis of India's Food Policy" highlights the importance of accurate and accessible food labels to prevent the further spread of non-communicable diseases. Food industry experts also note that consumers consider food packaging as important as the product itself, and the use of QR codes can enhance consumer information and influence their buying behavior. The US, India, France, and the UK are among the top users of QR codes globally. A survey revealed that a majority of respondents scanned QR codes on food products for specific information and found them helpful in making life easier.

### [Why are the China-Bhutan boundary talks significant?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-are-the-china-bhutan-boundary-talks-significant/article67462151.ece)

China and Bhutan have held their 25th round of boundary talks and signed a Cooperation Agreement on the "Responsibilities and Functions of the Joint Technical Team (JTT) on the Delimitation and Demarcation of the Bhutan-China Boundary." This marks significant progress in their efforts to resolve border disputes. The talks were held after a seven-year gap and were delayed due to the Doklam Standoff and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the two sides used the pause to hold talks at other levels, leading to the establishment of a 3-step roadmap for border resolution. Bhutan's Prime Minister stated that they are "inching towards" completing the roadmap. The roadmap involves agreeing on the border, visiting the sites on the ground, and formally demarcating the boundary. India is concerned about the discussions over Doklam, as China has proposed swapping areas under Bhutanese control with areas it claims. India is also worried about China's demand for full diplomatic relations with Bhutan and the potential for a Chinese presence in the region. Bhutan has assured that it will consider India's interests in its decisions.

### [Does India need to relook the Dam Safety Act? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/does-india-need-to-relook-the-dam-safety-act-explained/article67447034.ece)

The article discusses the recent glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in North Sikkim, India, which resulted in the destruction of the Teesta III dam. The incident highlighted the lack of early warning systems and preventive measures, as required under the Dam Safety Act (DSA) passed in late 2021. The DSA aimed to address deficient surveillance and maintenance that have led to dam failure-related disasters. It outlined key responsibilities, including the establishment of national and state-level bodies for dam safety implementation. The Act also emphasized the need for hazard classification, regular inspections, emergency action plans, flood warning systems, and safety reviews. States were required to report dam failures, and non-compliance with the Act could result in imprisonment and fines. However, experts point out the shortcomings in legislation and implementation, emphasizing the need for risk-based decision-making and transparency. They argue that dam safety information should be easily accessible to the public. Compliance with safety standards, periodic reviews, and standardized failure analysis and reporting were also highlighted as important aspects. The article concludes by mentioning how the Himachal Pradesh government recently found several hydroelectric projects guilty of non-compliance with the DSA during floods in July-August.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A recent study published in the Nature journal and led by the World Bank has highlighted the increased risk of flooding in urban areas in India. The study found that the expansion of cities into flood-prone areas has more than doubled since 1985. This poses significant threats to life, livelihoods, and the economy. While India is not among the most exposed countries to flood hazards, it is the third highest contributor to global settlements and has new settlements expanding into flood-prone areas. Experts emphasize the need for sustainable urban planning that accounts for flood-related risks and suggests measures such as scientific mapping of flood-prone areas, improved storm-water management plans, and resilient housing solutions.
