### [Ladki Bahin : A look at cash transfer schemes for women in seven states](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ladki-bahin-a-look-at-womens-cash-transfer-scheme-in-seven-states/article68557741.ece)

Various Indian states have launched direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes providing monthly financial aid to women. Maharashtra's Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, offering ₹1,500 per month to women with annual family income below ₹2.5 lakh, is one such example.  This initiative comes amid anticipation of state elections.  Other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Delhi, and West Bengal, have implemented similar schemes with varying amounts, eligibility criteria, and focus areas. These programs aim to empower women economically, improve their decision-making power, and enhance their overall well-being. 


Despite the positive impact of these schemes, challenges remain, including low digital and financial literacy among women, limited access to banking services, and restrictive social norms. 


India continues to strive to bridge the gender gap in financial inclusion through such DBT initiatives.

### [Since Chandrayaan-3, what has India’s space programme been up to? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/since-chandrayaan-3-what-has-the-indian-space-programme-been-up-to-explained/article68554417.ece)

Since its successful Chandrayaan-3 mission, ISRO has been busy with several projects.  The Aditya-L1 solar mission reached its destination at the Lagrangian point L1, where it observed a solar storm.  

ISRO conducted abort tests for its Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission, with plans to launch an uncrewed Gaganyaan mission later this year. Four astronaut candidates are currently training for spaceflight, with Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla and Group Captain Prashanth Nair chosen as the prime and backup crews for the first Gaganyaan mission to the International Space Station in 2025.

ISRO plans to create a new Indian space station, Bharatiya Antariksh Station, by 2035, and is developing a new launch vehicle, the NGLV, for heavier payloads.  In the meantime, the PSLV and GSLV rockets continue to launch satellites. Prime Minister Modi declared August 23rd as National Space Day to commemorate  ISRO's success with Chandrayaan-3. ISRO is also prioritizing research and development, focusing on new technologies and collaborating with private companies to advance India's space program.  India has also made strides in its space policies and regulations, with new licenses and relaxed FDI rules encouraging greater private sector participation.

### [Ten ex-CMs who rebelled against their ouster](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ten-ex-cms-who-were-hurt-by-their-ouster-and-rebelled/article68549345.ece)

This article discusses former Chief Ministers in India who have been ousted from their positions and their subsequent actions. It provides specific examples of how each CM was removed from office (e.g.,  due to disagreements with party leadership, health issues, or loss of public support), and highlights their subsequent political moves, which often include joining rival parties or forming their own. Some examples include N.T. Rama Rao, who was removed from his party due to alleged interference by his wife, and  Jitan Ram Manjhi, who resigned from his party and formed his own after being pressured to step down. The article explores the reasons behind these political maneuvers and the subsequent impact on the political landscape.

### [What is vaccine-derived polio, and what are the available vaccines against poliovirus? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/what-is-vaccine-derived-polio-and-what-are-the-available-vaccines-against-poliovirus-explained/article68550340.ece)

A two-year-old child in Meghalaya has been diagnosed with vaccine-derived polio (VDPV). This is a rare condition that occurs when the weakened poliovirus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and causes paralysis. 

The child was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis and officials are on high alert. OPV, though effective, carries a risk of VDPV, particularly with the type 2 strain. The World Health Organization has declared wild poliovirus type 2 eradicated, but cases of  VDPV remain a concern. India had shifted to a bivalent OPV in 2016 to  prevent type 2 VDPV, but outbreaks have continued to increase. A newer, genetically modified type 2 oral polio vaccine with a lower risk of reversion is now being used.

### [What are some new research projects in the field of ‘smart’ insulin? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/diabetes-insulin-research-new-research-projects-in-the-field-of-smart-insulin/article68528434.ece)

The Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge awarded over £2.7 million in grants to six international research projects focused on developing next-generation insulins.  These projects aim to address limitations of current insulin therapy, such as frequent injections and the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  

Four projects focus on glucose-responsive insulins (GRIs) that release insulin only when blood glucose levels are high, preventing both high and low blood sugar. Other projects involve developing a short-acting insulin with immediate effect and a combination of insulin and glucagon to stabilize blood sugar.  


The research, conducted at universities in the United States, Australia, and China, utilizes various innovative approaches including nanotechnology and studies on cone snail venom to improve insulin delivery and effectiveness.

### [Can blood tests for cancer save more lives? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/blood-tests-for-cancer-could-save-more-lives/article68547977.ece)

Cancer is a major public health concern in India, with a high incidence and mortality rate. Early detection is crucial for improving survival outcomes. While organised screening programs exist in many developed countries, India lags behind in this area. 

However, advancements in liquid biopsy technology offer hope. Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can detect signals from early-stage cancers, including those currently lacking recommended screening methods.  These tests have shown promise in detecting additional cancer cases that traditional methods might miss.  

While MCED tests are not yet FDA approved, some are available in India as laboratory-developed tests.  They offer a potentially transformative approach to cancer screening, but it is important to be aware of potential challenges like false positives and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Comprehensive patient support and clear communication with healthcare providers are essential to navigate the complexities of MCED testing.

### [Lateral entry for government posts | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lateral-entry-for-ias-posts-what-is-the-proposal-and-why-it-has-sparked-controversy-explained/article68542248.ece)

The UPSC advertisement, withdrawn shortly after issuing, sought to fill 45 posts across 24 ministries through lateral entry - recruiting experts from outside the usual bureaucratic setup.  The posts included joint secretary and director/deputy secretary roles in areas like emerging technologies, cybersecurity, climate change, and education.  The application was open to both private and public sector employees, with appointments made on a contract or deputation basis. The move sparked controversy as the opposition alleged it circumvented reservation policies, raising concerns about equity and social justice. They pointed to the lack of reservation for SC, ST, OBC, and EWS candidates in these lateral entry roles. This  follows criticism faced by the government earlier regarding the alleged reduction of reservation-based posts in other government sectors.

### [A change in India’s power export rules | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-change-in-indias-power-export-rules-explained/article68544254.ece)

India recently amended its power export rules, allowing exporters to reroute power to the domestic grid if payments are delayed from partner countries. This change comes after reports that Bangladesh, a significant buyer of Indian power, may be facing financial difficulties and delays in payments. Adani Power's Godda plant in India, which supplies all its power to Bangladesh, has stated its commitment to the existing contract despite the amendment. 

Bangladesh relies on imported power, with India’s Godda plant contributing a substantial portion. However, the country faces internal issues like overcapacity and fuel scarcity, leading to underutilization of power plants.  Analysts believe the amendment provides flexibility to Indian exporters and mitigates risks associated with payment delays. Despite concerns, experts suggest the immediate impact of a potential supply stoppage from India would be limited, as Bangladesh has alternative power sources.
