### [Haryana Assembly elections | What have parties promised in their manifestos?](https://www.thehindu.com/elections/haryana-assembly/haryana-assembly-elections-what-have-parties-promised-in-their-manifestos/article68666776.ece)

The upcoming Haryana Assembly elections are witnessing a fierce contest between the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress party, and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).  The BJP is campaigning on a platform of freebies, job creation, and continuing its governance initiatives. The Congress, seeking to regain power, is heavily focused on 'freebies' and promises like a monthly allowance for women and the implementation of the Old Pension Scheme. AAP, despite its leader's recent incarceration, is aiming to make inroads with promises of free services and substantial economic benefits.  

Other significant players in the fray include an alliance between the JJP and the ASP, and a coalition between the INLD and the BSP. These alliances are crucial as they aim to capitalize on the strong Dalit and Jat votes. With key issues like unemployment, farmers' welfare, and caste dynamics at the forefront, the elections are expected to be closely contested.

### [Is the spike in India’s trade deficit a worry?](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/is-the-spike-in-indias-trade-deficit-a-worry/article68668475.ece)

India's merchandise trade deficit widened to $29.7 billion in August, the second highest on record. While exports contracted in July and August, imports surged, driven by a significant increase in gold imports.  This surge was attributed to reduced import duties, rising gold prices, and festive season stocking.  Despite the widening deficit, economists don't see it as a major concern due to India's strong economic growth and healthy foreign exchange reserves. 

Global trade challenges, including a slowdown in developed markets and geopolitical uncertainties, are expected to make the path for India's export growth difficult.

### [Jill Stein: Three’s not a crowd](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jill-stein-threes-not-a-crowd/article68668580.ece)

Jill Stein, the Green Party's presidential candidate, is challenging the two-party system in the 2024 US election.  While her party is unlikely to win, Stein's stance against US arms support for Israel during the war on Gaza has resonated with some voters.  Stein, a physician and environmental activist, advocates for a Green New Deal and policies such as abolishing student debt and providing universal healthcare.  She has faced criticism from Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, for her strong anti-war views and her labeling of US leaders as "war criminals." Despite her limited chances of victory, Stein's campaign is impacting the election, particularly among Muslim voters in key swing states.

### [Pokrovsk: The Russians are coming](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pokrovsk-the-russians-are-coming/article68668563.ece)

Pokrovsk, a strategically important Ukrainian city in the Donetsk region, faces increasing pressure from advancing Russian troops.  The city, with its vital railway station and road intersections, has become a key target for Russia after capturing Avdiivka earlier this year.  

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy describes the situation in Pokrovsk as "difficult" as Russian forces seek to encircle the city from both north and south. A Ukrainian cross-border attack on Russia's Kursk region aimed to divert troops from Pokrovsk, but Russia reinforced its Kursk defense and intensified its offensive towards the Ukrainian city.

The capture of Pokrovsk would be a significant strategic victory for Russia, disrupting Ukrainian supply lines and putting other key towns at risk. It would also bring Russia closer to Ukraine's deep rear, advancing Putin's goal of full control over the Donbas region. 
Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Ukraine remains determined to defend Pokrovsk and is seeking long-range strike capabilities from NATO allies to counter Russian aggression.

### [Atishi Marlena: From the backroom to the top](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/atishi-marlena-from-the-backroom-to-the-top/article68668548.ece)

Atishi Marlena's journey from a backroom policy expert to Delhi's chief minister is marked by a combination of hard work, loyalty, and strategic maneuvering within the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).  Her rise began after she joined the party in 2013, playing a key role in shaping its education policies. While initially a behind-the-scenes figure, she later faced a political test, aligning herself with the party leadership during a split with founding members. Her appointment as Education Minister witnessed her championing the AAP's ambitious education initiatives, earning her recognition and eventually the top job. Atishi's ascent coincides with  the party's increasing focus on Hindu nationalism and welfare measures, reflecting a calculated approach that aims to solidify their electoral base. In stepping down as chief minister after facing corruption allegations, Kejriwal entrusted the reins to Atishi, entrusting her with navigating the turbulent political landscape and heading into the upcoming elections. Atishi's future success hinges on her ability to maintain this balance between loyalty and her own political aspirations.

Responding to the circulation of a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed three bills aimed at combating the spread of misleading AI-generated content in elections. The bills require online platforms to remove or label election-related deepfakes during specific periods, expand the timeframe during which it's prohibited to distribute deceptive AI-generated content, and mandate disclosures for electoral ads containing AI or altered content. 

While the bills' efficacy and enforcement remain to be seen, they represent an effort to safeguard election integrity and combat the potential for AI-driven disinformation.  

Musk, who initially shared the deepfake video, defended it as parody and claimed the governor's actions violated the Constitution.

### [Sri Lankan polls: economy takes centre stage | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lankan-polls-economy-takes-centre-stage-explained/article68661351.ece)

Sri Lanka holds its presidential election amidst an ongoing economic recovery following the country's 2022 financial meltdown.  

While the government headed by outgoing President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlights progress like stabilized inflation and increased foreign investment, the majority of Sri Lankans continue to grapple with the impact of the crisis. Austerity measures introduced as part of an IMF program have led to higher living costs and job losses, disproportionately affecting the poor. 

Despite efforts to restructure debt and boost the struggling economy, unemployment remains high, food insecurity is widespread, and many households are burdened by debt and diminished earnings. The election presents a choice between "stability" and the lingering hardship faced by a nation still striving to recover.

Haryana is gearing up for its Assembly elections on October 5th.  The BJP, seeking a third consecutive term, faces challenges from the Congress, AAP, JJP, and INLD, with a multi-cornered contest anticipated.  The BJP has focused on fielding candidates from OBC, Brahmin, and Punjabi communities. The Congress has relied on sitting MLAs and its traditional Jat support base while AAP attempts to make inroads.

Key issues impacting the elections include farm laws, the Agniveer scheme, and resentment within certain communities. The BJP has won over some voters by addressing concerns over farmer livelihoods and projecting its commitment to providing jobs for Agniveers coming back from service. However, the Congress is trying to capitalize on these concerns and build a coalition with various communities. The election outcome will significantly influence the political landscape of Haryana for years to come.

Tupperware, a food storage and homeware maker, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing a challenging macroeconomic environment.  The company stated its financial position had been severely impacted by the pandemic and the subsequent war in Ukraine.  Tupperware's reliance on a direct-selling model through freelance agents has been a drawback as consumer behavior shifted towards online shopping. The company aims to emerge as a digital-first entity through a restructuring process. Tupperware plans to continue operating during these proceedings and explore a sale to secure its future and transition to a more modern business model.

Kenyans are protesting a proposed 30-year lease of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to India's Adani Group. The deal, revealed by a whistleblower, sparked outrage as it involves handing over control of a "strategic national asset".  Adani Airport Holdings Ltd. proposed a $1.85 billion investment for refurbishment, expansion, and operational control. Concerns have been raised over potential job losses,  a 10-year tax break for Adani, and a clause prohibiting airport development within a 100km radius of JKIA.  While the Adanis claim a Private Initiated Proposal (PIP) is beneficial, experts recommended an open tender process as per Kenya's PPP Act.  Legal challenges have been filed, and a court order has suspended further action on the deal pending a judicial review.

### [Pager attack on Hezbollah: A low-tech gadget blitz redraws the contours of the Israel-Iran conflict](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/pager-attack-on-hezbollah-a-low-tech-gadget-blitz-redraws-the-contours-of-the-israel-iran-conflict/article68655123.ece)

Over 1,000 people were injured and at least nine killed in Lebanon after explosions targeting Hezbollah fighters. The blasts, captured on CCTV, occurred across the southern part of the country, a Hezbollah stronghold.  

The shock came from the weapon used: pagers. These outdated devices, surpassed by smartphones, were repurposed to trigger the explosions. Their simplicity and lack of sophisticated technology like GPS made them ideal. 

Pagers are known for their reliability in areas with weak cell service, being less susceptible to high-tech surveillance due to their lack of internet connectivity.  Their ability to be modified for covert operations, such as activating explosives with specific messages, was likely key to this attack.  

While Israel remains silent, the pagers used bore branding from Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company which denies responsibility. The incident heightens already strained tensions between Israel and Hezbollah.

The upcoming Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections have witnessed political parties releasing manifestos outlining contrasting visions for the state. The BJP, contesting alone, focuses on development and integration with the Union of India, promising economic benefits, security against terrorism, and infrastructure projects. 

In contrast, the NC and PDP, while aligning with Congress, prioritize restoring J&K's special status and statehood, seeking to repeal stringent laws and initiate dialogue with Pakistan. The Congress manifesto offers a mix of Central schemes and local initiatives, focusing on statehood restoration, increased unemployment allowances, and improved connectivity. Other parties, like the J&K People's Conference and the Apni Party, have also released manifestos, outlining promises ranging from local reservation to amending state land laws.

### [What is a telescope? How good are modern telescopes? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-a-telescope-how-good-are-modern-telescopes-explained/article68654399.ece)

This article explains how telescopes work and the factors that determine their power. 

Telescopes, primarily reflectors, utilize mirrors to focus light and magnify distant celestial objects.  The larger the telescope's aperture, the more light it gathers, making faint objects visible.  This is analogous to a larger container collecting more rainwater.

The article further discusses the concept of limiting magnitude, which indicates the faintest object a telescope can detect.  Resolution, another crucial factor, refers to the ability to distinguish details between closely spaced objects.  Atmospheric turbulence hinders ground-based telescopes, while space telescopes, like Hubble, offer superior resolution by escaping atmospheric interference.

The article concludes by highlighting advancements like adaptive optics, which correct for atmospheric distortions, and the construction of increasingly larger telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), pushing the boundaries of astronomical observation.

### [How do emergency provisions impact Centre-State relations?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/how-do-emergency-provisions-impact-centre-state-relations/article68648093.ece)

The recent violence in Manipur has reignited discussions on Centre-State relations and the use of emergency provisions. India's Constitution gives states primary responsibility for maintaining law and order, while Article 355 mandates the Centre  to protect states from internal disturbances and ensure they function constitutionally.

Article 356 allows the Centre to impose President's rule if a state government fails to do so. While intended as a last resort, Article 356 has been misused in the past.  The Supreme Court has since restricted its application, requiring a breakdown of constitutional machinery, not just law and order.

Articles 355 and 356 are subject to judicial review, and commissions have emphasized using Article 356 sparingly.  The Manipur situation requires immediate action,  and while President's rule might not be appropriate, the Centre should utilize Article 355's provisions to restore normalcy.

India’s Cheetah Action Plan aims to introduce African cheetahs into its ecosystems.  Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh was selected for its suitable habitat and prey base. The plan emphasizes the importance of long-term commitment for the project's success, including financial, technical, and administrative support from various government bodies and institutions.

Despite the plan's guidelines, several challenges have arisen.  Concerns have been raised about the prolonged captivity of the cheetahs, exceeding the recommended three-month period, potentially compromising their chances of successfully reintegrating into the wild.  Multiple cheetah deaths have occurred, both in captivity and in the wild, attributed to various causes including heat stroke, suspected hypokalaemia, septicemia, and drowning.

The project has also faced criticism regarding its selection criteria for individual animals, with at least one cheetah imported with a pre-existing health condition. 
Short-term goals like a 50% survival rate and successful reproduction in the wild have not been achieved due to the prolonged captivity. The long-term success of the project hinges on the establishment of a stable cheetah population, natural survival rates, improved habitat, and beneficial impacts on local economies.  There remain doubts about India’s ability to provide sufficient suitable habitat for a viable cheetah population.

### [Why is Tamil Nadu’s education funding on hold? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/education/why-is-tamil-nadus-education-funding-on-hold-explained/article68648084.ece)

Tamil Nadu is in a standoff with the Centre over funding for the Samagra Shiksha education scheme. The Centre has withheld funds, linking their release to Tamil Nadu's full implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which includes a three-language formula. Tamil Nadu opposes this, preferring its existing two-language policy of Tamil and English. 

The State has signed a modified Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the PM Schools for Rising India scheme, which is linked to Samagra Shiksha funding, but dropped the clause on full NEP implementation. This has led to an impasse, with Tamil Nadu accusing the Centre of withholding funds while the Centre maintains there is no quid pro quo.  The main point of contention is the NEP's three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu has historically resisted, citing its cultural and linguistic identity.

### [A crucial election in Sri Lanka | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-crucial-election-in-sri-lanka-explained/article68645207.ece)

Sri Lanka is going to the polls on September 21st to elect its next president.  This is the first election since the nation's devastating economic crisis in 2022 that led to widespread protests and the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  The election is considered a three-cornered race between incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Kumara Dissanayake.  

While Wickremesinghe campaigns on a platform of stability and economic recovery, Premadasa promises a more inclusive and resilient economy. Dissanayake, representing the National People's Power Alliance, advocates for systemic change and an end to corruption. 

The Tamil and Muslim communities, crucial demographics in Sri Lankan politics, are also expected to play a significant role in determining the outcome.  



The election takes place amidst economic hardship and a fragmented political landscape, making it difficult for any candidate to secure a clear majority.

In 1952, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin proposed unifying East and West Germany through a note, known as the Stalin Note. This proposal, which aimed to reshape the geopolitical landscape of Europe, was rejected by the Western allies. They suspected Stalin might have been buying time, as the Soviet Union was still recovering from World War II and not ready for another conflict. The rejection solidified the division between East and West Germany, which lasted for nearly four decades. It wasn't until 1989, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Germany finally achieved unification. The Stalin Note remains a historical turning point, symbolizing the enduring East-West divide during the Cold War and the missed opportunity for early reunification.

The Boeing Starliner mission, initially planned as a week-long test flight to the International Space Station (ISS), encountered numerous technical issues shortly after launch. These problems, including thruster malfunctions and helium leaks, prevented the Starliner from completing its objectives and forced astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams into an extended stay aboard the ISS.  Due to the technical setbacks, NASA decided it was too risky to use the Starliner for the return trip, and the astronauts will now remain on the ISS until early 2025 when a SpaceX capsule will be available.  While the mission faced significant challenges, the astronauts adapted and continued their work on the ISS, demonstrating their resilience and professionalism. Although a setback for Boeing, NASA remains committed to the Starliner program and hopes for another crewed flight in the near future.

A recent Indian Finance Ministry advisory has clarified that LGBTQIA+ individuals and queer couples can open joint bank accounts and nominate each other as beneficiaries, addressing some legal hurdles they face. While the advisory provides some relief, it highlights the broader need for legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Queer couples currently lack rights in areas like inheritance, adoption, medical decision-making, and access to benefits like ration cards and insurance.  

Although the Supreme Court refused to recognise same-sex marriage in October 2023, it acknowledged the need for  entitlements for queer couples and directed the government to set up a committee to define these rights. This committee is examining various aspects, including spouse recognition for ration cards, medical decision-making, and funeral rights. While government advisories can provide some immediate relief,  amendments to existing laws may be necessary for complete equality.

Nearly 78 lakh EPFO pensioners will be able to receive their pensions through any bank branch from January 1, 2025. This change, facilitated by the Centralised Pension Payment System (CPPS), will eliminate the need to transfer Pension Payment Orders (PPOs) across offices and provide a more seamless experience. While welcomed, some pensioners hope for a more substantial announcement, such as a unified pension scheme combining aspects of the Old Pension Scheme and the New Pension Scheme. 

There are ongoing concerns regarding the minimum pension amount of ₹1,000 and the processing of applications for pensions based on higher wages.  The EPFO is facing criticism for its slow response to these demands, especially given the Supreme Court's ruling in 2022 that allows for pensions on wages exceeding the PF ceiling.

Hefazat-e-Islam, a Bangladeshi Islamist group, has been making political inroads. Formed in 2010 to oppose policies promoting women's rights, the group gained prominence for its protests. 

Despite its extremist views and violent clashes with police,  both the Sheikh Hasina government and the current caretaker government led by Muhammad Yunus have engaged with Hefazat. This engagement has included appointing a Hefazat leader to a government advisory position, recognizing madrassa degrees, and releasing jailed Hefazat members.  This appeasement of Hefazat, along with moves such as lifting the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami, has raised concerns about a resurgence of hardline Islamic influence in Bangladesh.

Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the official presidential candidate for the Democratic Unitary Platform in Venezuela's July 28 elections,  sought asylum in Spain on September 8. Despite opposition claims citing exit polls and their own vote tallies that pointed to Gonzalez's victory, Venezuela's National Electoral Council declared Nicolas Maduro the winner for a third term. 

Gonzalez, a retired diplomat, emerged as the Opposition candidate after two other leading figures were barred from running. He campaigned on a platform of reducing inflation and restoring faith in government institutions, attracting public support with his calm demeanor and grandfatherly image.

Following the election, with Gonzalez claiming pressure and threats, he fled Venezuela. Spain is debating a motion to recognize Gonzalez as the election winner as protesters gathered in Madrid, expressing their support and demanding transparency from the Venezuelan authorities.

Madhabi Puri Buch, SEBI's first woman chairperson, faced early challenges, most significantly the Adani Group controversy in early 2023. Hindenburg Research accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation, triggering investor losses and legal inquiries. The Supreme Court appointed a committee to investigate SEBI's handling of the allegations, but it found no regulatory failure.  

More recently, Hindenburg made new accusations, alleging conflicts of interest against Buch and her husband. Buch vehemently denied these claims, stating her finances were transparent and she had recused herself from relevant matters. SEBI also addressed the allegations, emphasizing Buch's disclosures and adherence to conflict-of-interest guidelines.   

Despite these denials, Buch faces internal criticism within SEBI and opposition scrutiny, particularly concerning new regulations for foreign portfolio investors and derivatives trading. Some call for an independent review to clear Buch's name and restore trust in SEBI.

### [What are AM, FM, and signal modulation? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-are-am-fm-and-signal-modulation-explained/article68641239.ece)

Signal modulation is a key technology in long-distance communication, allowing for the efficient transmission of information like sound and images. 

Two common forms of modulation are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). In AM, the amplitude of the signal wave is varied to represent the information, while in FM, the frequency of the wave is varied. 

Analog signals, like those used in AM and FM radio broadcasts, are continuous, while digital signals are discrete. Modulation allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over the same channel without interference.

Operators prefer analog television and radio broadcasting because analog receivers are cheaper. However, the world is gradually transitioning to digital broadcasting due to the advantages of digital technology, such as improved sound and picture quality and resistance to noise.

The Supreme Court granted regular bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the CBI case related to the now-scrapped liquor excise policy.  Justice Kant ruled that the arrest was valid as the special court had already sanctioned it, while Justice Bhuyan questioned the timing and necessity of the arrest, calling it potentially an "insurance arrest" to thwart Mr. Kejriwal's release in another case. Both judges agreed that continued incarceration violated his right to personal liberty and noted the likelihood of a lengthy trial.  

Mr. Kejriwal was released on a ₹10 lakh bond with two sureties and barred from making public comments on the case. He must also adhere to certain bail conditions from a previous ED case involving restrictions on visiting his office and signing official files. Justice Bhuyan expressed reservations about these conditions.

Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal chief prosecutor has announced plans to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India to face charges of murder, torture, abduction, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Hasina fled to India in August after mass protests forced her resignation.   

While Bangladeshi courts can proceed with trials in absentia, extradition is considered crucial to ensure fairness and due process. India and Bangladesh have an extradition treaty that covers these offenses, and Hasina's alleged crimes qualify for extradition under its provisions. 

However, India could potentially refuse extradition on grounds of political motivation or fear of unfair trial. Experts note that the final decision will likely be influenced by diplomatic negotiations and political considerations.

The Brazilian Supreme Court ordered the suspension of X, formerly Twitter, citing the platform's refusal to appoint a legal representative in Brazil.  Justice Alexandre de Moraes initiated an investigation into "digital militias," far-right groups that allegedly used X to spread disinformation and incite violence leading to the January 2023 riots in Brasilia. 

Moraes had previously ordered X to suspend accounts spreading misinformation and provide user data. Elon Musk, X's owner, defied these orders and threatened to shut down operations in Brazil. After X ignored a deadline to appoint a representative, Moraes suspended the platform. 

The case raises questions about regulatory sovereignty, free speech versus censorship, and the role of social media in political discourse.

The Indian government has dissolved the Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS), which advised on survey methodology and data analysis, including the census. The dissolution comes amid criticism over the delay in conducting the 2021 census, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The government replaced the SCoS with a new Steering Committee for National Sample Surveys, but experts argue that the lack of a clear roadmap for the census and reliance on outdated data negatively impacts policymaking.  They emphasize the need for a comprehensive census to provide accurate and up-to-date information on critical issues like education, employment, and population distribution.

### [Tackling right-wing resurgence in Germany](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tackling-right-wing-resurgence-in-germany/article68631521.ece)

The recent regional elections in Germany have seen significant gains by both the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW).  The AfD’s victory in Thuringia marks a first for a radical right-wing party in the post-war era, coming close to forming a government. The party's success is attributed to several factors, including internal divisions within the ruling coalition, xenophobia, and opposition to German arms supplies to Ukraine. 

The BSW, a new alliance, has also made significant inroads, overtaking all parties in the ruling coalition.  Tensions are high as the AfD’s victory in Thuringia raises questions about potential alliances with mainstream parties.  Discussions for a government coalition in Thuringia between the CDU and BSW are underway, despite ideological differences and concerns about Wagenknecht’s conditions for support, including the cancellation of plans to station medium-range missiles in Germany and a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.

A Delhi High Court judge threatened to order the Indian government to block Wikipedia if the Wikimedia Foundation doesn't provide user details in a defamation case filed by ANI, a news agency. ANI sued Wikipedia after the platform described the agency as a propagator of government propaganda. Wikipedia stands by its description, citing reliable sources, but the judge's threat highlights the tension between free speech and platform accountability in India.  

This case is not unique; Encyclopedia Wikipedia faces similar legal challenges and pressure from governments worldwide. Some criticize Wikipedia for potential bias, but its editors generally follow policies like neutrality and reliance on verifiable sources.

### [On the challenges to road safety in India | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/road-safety-in-india-challenges/article68623486.ece)

The article "India Status Report on Road Safety 2024" reveals the slow progress India is making in reducing road accident fatalities despite advancements in other sectors. Analysis of data from six states shows disparities in road traffic death rates and highlights the vulnerability of motorcyclists and the high rate of fatal crashes involving trucks. 

The report emphasizes the need for state-level tailored strategies to address unique road safety challenges. It points out the inadequacy of India's national road safety data systems and the lack of a comprehensive crash-level database, preventing effective interventions. 
Road safety measures like traffic calming, markings, and signage are still lacking in many states, and helmet usage remains low, particularly in rural areas.  
The report compares India's road safety performance with developed countries like Sweden, revealing a stark contrast in fatality rates and questioning the effectiveness of simply improving vehicle safety features. It urges the government to prioritize road safety interventions, establish a national crash database, and increase public access to road safety data for better understanding and effective policymaking.

### [Michel Barnier: ‘Monsieur Brexit’ to France’s PM](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/michel-barnier-profile/article68616984.ece)

French President Emmanuel Macron appointed former EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier as the country's new prime minister.  Barnier, a seasoned conservative politician, faces the challenge of uniting a divided National Assembly.  Having served in various ministerial positions in the past, Barnier is known for his methodical approach and consensus-building skills. 

His appointment comes after a period of political instability following inconclusive parliamentary elections where no party secured a majority. Macron's choice of Barnier, who shares some conservative views with the far-right but aligns with Macron on economic policies, is seen as a bid to secure support from diverse political factions.



However, the Left has already rejected Barnier's appointment, alleging a stolen election. Barnier now has the task of navigating the complex political landscape and forming a stable government.

### [What is assistive technology and how is it helping para athletes? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sport/olympics/what-is-assistive-technology-and-how-is-it-helping-para-athletes/article68610013.ece)

India made history at the 2024 Paris Paralympics, surpassing its previous best medal haul with 27 wins. This success is attributed to several factors, including increased athlete participation, the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), and the widespread use of assistive technology.  

Assistive technology plays a crucial role in enabling para-athletes to compete on a level playing field. Examples include release braces for archers, running blades for track athletes, modified wheelchairs for basketball, and shooting stands for para-shooters. These technologies cater to a range of impairments, allowing individuals to participate in various sports.

India's strong performance in events like para archery, para athletics, para badminton, shooting, swimming, and powerlifting highlights the impact of assistive technology. Athletes like Sheetal Devi (archery), Dharambir (club throw), and Avani Lekhara (shooting) are prime examples of how these technologies empower para-athletes to achieve greatness.  

While advancements in assistive technology have come a long way, challenges remain. Access to these technologies is uneven globally, with disparities between high-income and low-income countries. 


The 'Equipped for Equity' campaign addresses this issue by urging governments to prioritize access to assistive technology, ensuring everyone has the opportunity to participate and excel in sports.

### [Can Kerala access funds from the Loss and Damage Fund? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/can-kerala-access-funds-from-the-loss-and-damage-fund-explained/article68611070.ece)

The recent Kerala landslides highlight the urgency of accessing climate finance, particularly for loss and damage, through the UNFCCC's Loss and Damage Fund (LDF). While India has suffered significant economic losses due to climate-related disasters, its focus on mitigation currently hampers its engagement with LDF-related discussions.

Establishing clearer legal and policy frameworks within India to streamline climate finance, particularly for adaptive measures and loss and damage, is crucial. This should prioritize locally led adaptation strategies to ensure effective support for vulnerable communities. India should advocate for decentralized fund disbursement from the LDF, bypassing centralized systems used for other climate finance mechanisms.  The lack of a standardized method for assessing disaster-related damages, especially from slow-onset events, poses a barrier to accessing LDF resources. A structured assessment process is vital to ensure India can effectively tap into this fund and secure the necessary support for post-disaster recovery and resilience-building.

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO) is responsible for a ₹72,000 crore infrastructure project on Great Nicobar. Concerns have been raised about ANIIDCO's capability to handle such a large and complex project.  At the time of its appointment as project proponent, ANIIDCO lacked an environment policy, an environmental cell, and the necessary human resources. 

The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) raised concerns about ANIIDCO's environmental governance system, including the absence of a corporate environment policy.  Despite these concerns, the EAC granted environmental clearance to ANIIDCO.  Further, the process involved potential conflicts of interest, as the managing director of ANIIDCO was also the Commissioner cum Secretary (Environment and Forests) of the islands.

### [Why is Google accused of being an illegal monopoly? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-is-google-accused-of-being-an-illegal-monopoly/article68602619.ece)

A US District Judge ruled that Google misused its dominant position in the search engine market by paying billions of dollars to device manufacturers like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine. This practice, while advantageous for Google, is seen as unfair to competitors as it limits user exposure to alternative search engines. 

The case highlights concerns about Google's market share exceeding 90%, with some arguing it constitutes a monopoly that abuses its power.  However, others contend that a large market share alone doesn't equate to a monopoly, as  competitors can still enter the market and challenge Google's dominance. 

The court proceedings are expected to determine whether Google will be required to stop these payments, give users more control over their default search engine, share user search data with competitors, or even be broken up into smaller companies.

The collapse of a 35-foot statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Rajkot Fort in Sindhudurg district sparked outrage and accusations of corruption against the ruling BJP-led coalition in Maharashtra.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologized for the incident, stating that Shivaji Maharaj is not just a king but a revered figure for him and everyone. 

The Opposition, led by the Maha Vikas Aghadi, alleged that the statue's collapse was due to negligence and corruption during its construction and demanded action against those responsible. Meanwhile, the BJP maintained that the incident occurred due to heavy rain and high winds. A committee investigation is underway to determine the exact cause.  

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, a 17th-century Maratha warrior king, is a revered icon in Maharashtra. His legacy is intertwined with political discourse, with various political parties, including the Shiv Sena, BJP, and Congress, claiming to champion his ideals and memory.

### [On Germany’s electoral architecture | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/on-germanys-electoral-architecture-explained/article68598322.ece)

Germany's constitutional court has approved a plan to reduce the size of the Bundestag, the country's lower house of parliament. The current Bundestag, with 736 members, is the largest among democratically elected assemblies. 

The size increase has been attributed to Germany's complex electoral system, which includes a two-vote system and a 5% threshold for parties to enter parliament.  This has led to a complex distribution of seats, with larger parties often gaining more seats than their share of the vote would warrant. 

The new law, effective from 2025, will cap the Bundestag size at 630 members. This will be achieved by eliminating "overhang seats" and "balance seats,"  which were created to compensate for imbalances in the previous system. The weight given to directly elected candidate seats will also be reduced.

### [Why did the Centre alter its pension plan?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-did-the-centre-alter-its-pension-plan/article68590701.ece)

The Indian government has ushered in a new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for its employees, set to launch on April 1, 2025. The UPS aims to address concerns regarding the National Pension System (NPS), which replaced the older Old Pension Scheme (OPS).  The UPS combines elements of both schemes. A key feature is a guaranteed monthly pension for life, calculated as half the employee's average basic pay from their last 12 months of service, subject to a minimum service of 25 years. 

It also offers a family pension and a lumpsum payout upon retirement. While employees will contribute 10% of their salary to the pension fund, the government's contribution will be 18.5%. This move has been hailed as a step towards providing more stable and predictable pension benefits for government employees.

The Taliban announced a new law in Afghanistan that enforces its interpretation of Islamic law. The law restricts women's rights significantly, including banning them from showing their bodies or faces in public, and silencing their voices.  It also regulates various aspects of life, such as dress, travel, and entertainment. 

The Taliban claims these regulations are based on Islamic principles and aim to promote morality.  

These new laws have been widely condemned by governments and organizations, who see them as a severe setback for women's rights. However, the Taliban insists they will continue to implement them. Despite the backlash, some Afghan women are resisting the restrictions through subtle and overt acts of defiance.

Pavel Durov, founder of the messaging app Telegram, was arrested in Paris on charges related to alleged criminal activity facilitated through the platform. French authorities allege that Telegram's 'hands-off' approach to content moderation enables crimes like drug trafficking, fraud, and dissemination of child pornography. Durov, who has been granted bail, maintains that platforms should not be held responsible for abuses by users. 

This arrest has sparked debate about the balance between free speech rights and law enforcement's access to information. Supporters of Durov argue that his arrest is an assault on fundamental rights, while proponents of the French government's stance emphasize the need to uphold the rule of law. Durov, known for his privacy-focused philosophy and opposition to government censorship, has previously clashed with authorities in Russia and is now facing scrutiny in France.

The Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) is facing its biggest crisis following the release of the Hema Committee report that exposed sexual exploitation within the Malayalam film industry. The report prompted the resignation of its general secretary and the dissolving of the executive committee amid allegations of sexual assault against several prominent members.  

AMMA, founded in 1994 to protect the interests of actors, has been criticized for its handling of past sexual harassment cases, including its reinstatement of actor Dileep after his arrest in connection with the 2017 assault of a woman actor.  The association's resistance to forming a comprehensive internal complaints committee also drew criticism.  


As calls for a safe and equitable work environment in the industry intensify, AMMA is at a turning point, facing pressure to overhaul its structures and address the deeply rooted issues of power and accountability within its ranks.

The upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the first since 2014, are significant as they mark a return to local governance. The Election Commission has announced a three-phase election process, with results expected on October 4th. 

Several political parties, including the BJP, NC, PDP, PC, JKPM and Apni Party, are contesting the 90 Assembly seats. The BJP, aiming to expand its influence, has fielded 45 candidates, while the Congress has joined forces with the NC, forming an alliance.

The PDP, though not part of the INDIA coalition, is also participating and advocating for statehood restoration and dialogue with Pakistan. Other notable players include Sajjad Lone's PC, Ghulam Nabi Azad's DPAP, and Altaf Bukhari's Apni Party, all of whom have been labeled as "BJP proxies" by opposition parties. 

These elections are crucial as they will determine the future direction of Jammu and Kashmir, which was bifurcated into two Union Territories and had its special status revoked in 2019.  The outcome will hold implications not only for the region but also for national politics.

### [On the controversy over lateral entry into the civil services | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/controversy-over-lateral-entry-into-the-civil-services/article68583002.ece)

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) recently withdrew an advertisement for lateral recruitment of Joint Secretaries, Directors, and Deputy Secretaries. This decision followed objections raised regarding the lack of reservations for  various communities in the process. 

The merit system, established by the British in 1858, aims to select government officers through a rigorous process, fostering neutrality and independent advice to the political executive. Lateral recruitment, bringing in specialists from outside government, has seen some prominent examples in the past but raises concerns regarding collaboration with career bureaucrats and potential conflicts of interest. 

The article argues that while lateral entry can bring valuable expertise, it shouldn't overshadow the crucial role of career bureaucrats.  It emphasizes the need to address bureaucratic inefficiencies and political interference while maintaining the autonomy of the civil service. Ensuring a balance between merit and social justice is key to a robust and effective governance system.

### [Analysing the Gender Budget of 2024-25 | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/analysing-the-gender-budget-of-2024-25/article68582974.ece)

The Indian government's Gender Budget Statement (GBS) reached 1% of GDP estimates for 2024-25, marking a significant increase from previous years.  This surge is attributed to the inclusion of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan scheme under Part 'C,' which reports programs with less than 30% provisioning for women, and a boost in Part A, which covers schemes with 100% allocation for women.  

However, inconsistencies in reporting remain. For instance, the PMEGP allocation is reported as 40% for women without explanation, while the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), despite having significant female participation, is reported under Part B.  Experts highlight the need for transparency and explanations in the GBS to ensure accurate accounting and enable effective gender audits.  The ultimate goal is to ensure actual spending for women in all government programs, leading to improved gender outcomes.

Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu emphasized the government's commitment to women's welfare, stating that Himachal Pradesh is the first state to enact this legislation. The Bill also extends the time period for filing a petition to annul a marriage for both men and women. It also  ensures that its provisions take precedence over other laws and practices regarding marriage in the state.

The Supreme Court granted bail to BRS leader K Kavitha in a money laundering case linked to the Delhi excise policy scam. The court criticized the Delhi High Court's decision to deny bail, arguing that Kavitha should benefit from the PMLA's provision granting exemptions to women based on vulnerability. 

The High Court had rejected the bail plea stating that Kavitha, being well-educated and accomplished, did not fit the "vulnerable woman" category. However, the Supreme Court emphasized that the PMLA provision is intended to protect women, regardless of their education or social standing.  Justice B.R. Gavai clarified that the precedent set by the Saumya Chaurasia case did not exclude educated women from this protection, urging courts to exercise discretion judiciously when considering bail for women.

The CBI conducted a second round of polygraph tests on seven individuals connected to the rape and murder of a resident doctor at Kolkata's R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital. The tests were administered on the former principal of the medical college, four doctors who had dinner with the victim, and the main accused, a civic police volunteer.  The inclusion of the former principal, who reportedly provided inconsistent responses during questioning, highlights the ongoing investigation's scrutiny. These polygraph tests are part of a broader legal process following a Calcutta High Court order directing the CBI to investigate the case.   
 The use of such tests raises ethical and legal questions regarding their effectiveness and potential for coercion.  In India, the Supreme Court has ruled that polygraph tests can only be conducted with the informed consent of the accused, recognizing the individual's right against self-incrimination. Despite these safeguards, concerns persist about the potential for false positives and the use of these tests to extract confessions under duress.

The Indian government has introduced a new 'Unified Pension Scheme' (UPS), aiming to provide government employees with 50% of their last drawn salary as a lifelong monthly pension. 

The UPS has drawn mixed reactions, with unions broadly divided along political lines. While some unions like the BMS have welcomed the move, others like CITU and AITUC argue it is a ploy to mislead employees. The scheme is seen as a return to the 'Old Pension Scheme' (OPS), which was replaced by the 'New Pension Scheme' (NPS) by the NDA government in 2004. 

Key features of the UPS include a minimum pension of ₹10,000 per month, periodic dearness relief hikes, and provision for a family pension. Unlike the OPS, the UPS is a partially funded scheme, with both employees and the government contributing towards the pension fund. The scheme has a retrospective effect, impacting those who retired under the NPS. The government estimates an additional annual burden of ₹6,250 crore due to the increased pension contribution.

Hundreds of astronauts have flown to space, revealing trends in how spaceflight affects the human body.  Microgravity causes bones to weaken, potentially leading to kidney stones.  Digestive issues can occur, and about 70% of astronauts on long-duration missions develop spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), which impacts eyesight. 

The heart, muscles, and blood also undergo changes in response to the space environment.  While exercise regimes and routines help mitigate these effects, researchers continue to investigate the long-term impacts of radiation exposure, confined environments, and the unique conditions of space.  

Innovative studies like the 'Twins Study' and the development of space omics tools are shedding light on how the body adapts to space, paving the way for countermeasures and a deeper understanding of human health in extreme environments. As missions become longer and venture farther into space, these findings are crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of future astronauts.

Following the horrific rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, calls for the death penalty have intensified. This incident reignites the debate around the Justice J.S. Verma Committee recommendations, which opposed capital punishment for rape, even in extreme cases. The committee, formed after the 2012 Delhi gang rape, argued that the death penalty was not a deterrent and that reformation should be prioritized.

While the 2013 amendments introduced death penalty for certain aggravated rape cases, the Verma Committee's core stance on capital punishment for rape remained untouched. They did, however, recommend harsher sentences for rape, including life imprisonment, and advocated for the removal of marital rape exemption, a recommendation the government did not adopt. The committee emphasized the need for broader societal changes to empower women and address gender bias.

The report, released after years of delay, confirmed the existence of a "casting couch" and documented incidents of assault and intimidation. It highlighted the industry's control by a powerful "male mafia" who could silence victims through bans and cyberattacks. The report also exposed the exploitation of junior artistes, who faced meagre pay and inadequate facilities. The committee recommended legal action and urged the creation of a tribunal to address these issues.

In 2023, the UPSC advertised lateral recruitment for 45 posts at senior levels, sparking controversy.  This led to criticism as reservation benefits, applicable to government job recruitment, were not considered for these “single post” appointments.  

Lateral entry has been endorsed by NITI Aayog and previously suggested by the Second Administrative Reforms Commission to bring specialized expertise into government service.

### [Why is sanction for prosecution needed?](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-is-sanction-for-prosecution-needed/article68562121.ece)

The Karnataka Governor's approval to investigate Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for alleged land irregularities has sparked debate regarding the legal and constitutional implications of sanctioning prosecution against public servants. 

Sanctioning prosecution for public servants is a mandatory requirement under both the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). While the CrPC generally gives sanction authority to the State or Central government, the PCA allows for broader applications. Historically, the Governor has been seen as the authority to grant sanction in cases involving a Chief Minister, as they possess the power to dismiss them. The Supreme Court has upheld the Governor's discretion in such matters, emphasizing that they should act independently of the Council of Ministers' advice.

Various Indian states have launched direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes providing monthly financial aid to women. Maharashtra's Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana, offering ₹1,500 per month to women with annual family income below ₹2.5 lakh, is one such example.  This initiative comes amid anticipation of state elections.  Other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Delhi, and West Bengal, have implemented similar schemes with varying amounts, eligibility criteria, and focus areas. These programs aim to empower women economically, improve their decision-making power, and enhance their overall well-being. 


Despite the positive impact of these schemes, challenges remain, including low digital and financial literacy among women, limited access to banking services, and restrictive social norms. 


India continues to strive to bridge the gender gap in financial inclusion through such DBT initiatives.

### [What is vaccine-derived polio, and what are the available vaccines against poliovirus? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/what-is-vaccine-derived-polio-and-what-are-the-available-vaccines-against-poliovirus-explained/article68550340.ece)

A two-year-old child in Meghalaya has been diagnosed with vaccine-derived polio (VDPV). This is a rare condition that occurs when the weakened poliovirus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and causes paralysis. 

The child was diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis and officials are on high alert. OPV, though effective, carries a risk of VDPV, particularly with the type 2 strain. The World Health Organization has declared wild poliovirus type 2 eradicated, but cases of  VDPV remain a concern. India had shifted to a bivalent OPV in 2016 to  prevent type 2 VDPV, but outbreaks have continued to increase. A newer, genetically modified type 2 oral polio vaccine with a lower risk of reversion is now being used.

The Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge awarded over £2.7 million in grants to six international research projects focused on developing next-generation insulins.  These projects aim to address limitations of current insulin therapy, such as frequent injections and the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  

Four projects focus on glucose-responsive insulins (GRIs) that release insulin only when blood glucose levels are high, preventing both high and low blood sugar. Other projects involve developing a short-acting insulin with immediate effect and a combination of insulin and glucagon to stabilize blood sugar.  


The research, conducted at universities in the United States, Australia, and China, utilizes various innovative approaches including nanotechnology and studies on cone snail venom to improve insulin delivery and effectiveness.

### [Can blood tests for cancer save more lives? | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/blood-tests-for-cancer-could-save-more-lives/article68547977.ece)

Cancer is a major public health concern in India, with a high incidence and mortality rate. Early detection is crucial for improving survival outcomes. While organised screening programs exist in many developed countries, India lags behind in this area. 

However, advancements in liquid biopsy technology offer hope. Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can detect signals from early-stage cancers, including those currently lacking recommended screening methods.  These tests have shown promise in detecting additional cancer cases that traditional methods might miss.  

While MCED tests are not yet FDA approved, some are available in India as laboratory-developed tests.  They offer a potentially transformative approach to cancer screening, but it is important to be aware of potential challenges like false positives and the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Comprehensive patient support and clear communication with healthcare providers are essential to navigate the complexities of MCED testing.

The UPSC advertisement, withdrawn shortly after issuing, sought to fill 45 posts across 24 ministries through lateral entry - recruiting experts from outside the usual bureaucratic setup.  The posts included joint secretary and director/deputy secretary roles in areas like emerging technologies, cybersecurity, climate change, and education.  The application was open to both private and public sector employees, with appointments made on a contract or deputation basis. The move sparked controversy as the opposition alleged it circumvented reservation policies, raising concerns about equity and social justice. They pointed to the lack of reservation for SC, ST, OBC, and EWS candidates in these lateral entry roles. This  follows criticism faced by the government earlier regarding the alleged reduction of reservation-based posts in other government sectors.

### [A change in India’s power export rules | Explained](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-change-in-indias-power-export-rules-explained/article68544254.ece)

India recently amended its power export rules, allowing exporters to reroute power to the domestic grid if payments are delayed from partner countries. This change comes after reports that Bangladesh, a significant buyer of Indian power, may be facing financial difficulties and delays in payments. Adani Power's Godda plant in India, which supplies all its power to Bangladesh, has stated its commitment to the existing contract despite the amendment. 

Bangladesh relies on imported power, with India’s Godda plant contributing a substantial portion. However, the country faces internal issues like overcapacity and fuel scarcity, leading to underutilization of power plants.  Analysts believe the amendment provides flexibility to Indian exporters and mitigates risks associated with payment delays. Despite concerns, experts suggest the immediate impact of a potential supply stoppage from India would be limited, as Bangladesh has alternative power sources.
