### [PM Modi’s visit to Ukraine, Poland: Central Europe in India](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modis-visit-ukraine-poland-central-europe-india-9524102/)

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine signifies India's growing interest in Central Europe, a region now at the forefront of global geopolitical tensions.  This is the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland since 1979 and to Ukraine since its independence. 

India recognizes the importance of Central Europe and aims to establish long-term partnerships with Poland and Ukraine. Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, India seeks to engage constructively with both nations, acknowledging their strategic significance and historical ties.

### [Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification of SCs, STs is blinkered to historical discrimination of Dalits](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-sc-st-dalits-9523850/)

The article criticizes the Supreme Court's recent verdict on sub-categorization within reservation policies, arguing that it fails to address the root causes of social and economic inequality.  

While seemingly acknowledging the needs of vulnerable groups within SCs and STs, the verdict overlooks the systemic marginalization of Dalits, Adivasis, and OBCs in institutions of power and prestige. The author points out that reservation policies, poorly implemented and hampered by decreasing government jobs, have not effectively addressed this issue. 

Furthermore, the article argues that the Court's emphasis on economic mobility through reservation ignores the persistent social discrimination and violence faced by Dalits. It calls for a broader approach to social justice, encompassing diversity in leadership, entrepreneurship, and technology innovation, to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all, not just an elite few.

### [Who is behind the violence in Bangladesh? It’s unlikely to be the students](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/violence-in-bangladesh-unlikely-students-9523696/)

Following the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, Bangladesh experienced widespread violence and destruction echoing events from the 1971 Liberation War. Targeted attacks focused on members of the Awami League, religious minorities, and secular intellectuals. The destruction of landmarks associated with Bangladesh's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Indian Cultural Centre in Dhaka fueled concerns. 

The events are widely perceived as a Jamaat-e-Islami-led military coup, potentially backed by Pakistan and the US, with China possessing knowledge. The involvement of students is disputed, as their lack of unified structure contradicts the violence's calculated nature.  The international community's response has been muted, raising alarm about the safety of minorities and the future of Bangladesh's democracy, secularism, nationalism, and socialism, as enshrined in its 1972 Constitution.

### [After Wayanad, time to empower common people to claim their rightful inheritance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/wayanad-time-empower-common-people-claim-rightful-inheritance-9523710/)

This article discusses environmental degradation in India, particularly focusing on the Western Ghats. The author, a member of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, highlights the disastrous impact of human activities like quarrying and construction on the fragile ecosystem and local communities. 

The author uses the recent landslide in Wayanad as a stark reminder of the consequences, drawing a parallel to Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and the "meek" bearing the burden of environmental damage.  They advocate for local communities to be empowered and take control of their resources, suggesting several concrete steps such as transferring quarry ownership to women's cooperatives, promoting tribal-run homestays, and challenging the Wildlife Protection Act to allow self-defense against animal attacks. The author expresses hope that the "common people" will shed their meekness and fight for their rightful inheritance of a sustainable and healthy future.

### [Secular Civil Code will unify, not divide Indians](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/secular-civil-code-will-unify-not-divide-indians-9522698/)

Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day speech emphasized the need for a Secular Civil Code (SCC), a long-debated topic in India.  He positioned the SCC as a step towards achieving social justice and equality, aligning with the vision of equality for all citizens as outlined by Dr. Ambedkar.  The proposal aims to unify civil laws across religious lines, impacting areas such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption while preserving religious practices. 

Critics argue that the SCC threatens religious freedom, but proponents counter that true secularism lies in ensuring equal treatment under the law for all. They cite examples of other democracies with uniform civil codes and highlight the potential for the SCC to streamline the legal system, reduce judicial burden, and eliminate discriminatory practices inherent in current personal laws, particularly concerning women's rights.  The government views the SCC as a constitutional duty and a moral imperative, believing it is crucial for building a just and equitable society.

India's diversity presents a governance challenge.  While the nation strives for secularism and equality, Hindutva, a movement promoting a stylized version of Hindu identity, poses a threat to this vision.   

Proponents of Hindutva, overlooking the precarious security of Israel, seek a Hindu-dominated nation, ignoring the reality of India's diverse neighborhood.  

Furthermore, India grapples with deep-rooted caste divisions and a growing economic disparity.  A large youth population seeking decent employment coupled with an aging population requiring care adds to the complexity.  

While economic growth has been touted, it hasn't translated into widespread prosperity, leading to growing dissent among both marginalized communities and sections of the upper classes who feel excluded. 

Addressing the grievances of the working class, ensuring justice and equitable distribution of resources, is crucial for India's future stability and progress.

The brutal murder of a doctor in Kolkata highlights the dangerous politicisation of rape cases. While public outrage and demands for justice are crucial, the case risks becoming yet another weapon in the hands of political parties seeking to score points. This trend, which has permeated West Bengal politics for decades, diminishes the victim's dignity and undermines the pursuit of genuine justice. 

The article argues that episodic protests, often driven by the need for new laws, fail to address the systemic issues within law enforcement and the judiciary. True change requires sustained political pressure for reform, but voting patterns and political agendas prioritize expediency over lasting solutions. The tragic case underscores the pervasive problem of viewing women's bodies as tools for political gain, even in death.

The Kolkata Derby match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan was cancelled due to security concerns.  Instead, fans of both clubs, along with others and Mohun Bagan’s captain, protested the rape and murder of a young trainee doctor. This unexpected unity  highlights the clubs’  shared history rooted in protest. Mohun Bagan was founded after defeating a British team in 1911, while East Bengal was formed due to discrimination against a Bangal player. This coming together signifies the power of collective action and the universality of the fight for justice.

Kamala Harris unexpectedly became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden withdrew from the race. Despite facing challenges in the 2020 primaries, Harris now enjoys momentum, benefiting from Biden's perceived frailty and her youth. 

She possesses several advantages, including her California senatorial experience and strong party support.  Harris has closed the polling gap with Trump, partially fueled by  the party's focus on an "opportunity economy" to address inflation. However, the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict presents a potential obstacle, with some voters expressing dissatisfaction with the US stance.

### [Yogendra Yadav writes: Where are our political thinkers?](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yogendra-yadav-writes-where-are-our-political-thinkers-9522697/)

The article laments the decline of modern Indian political thought, likening it to the "sudden death" of Sanskrit knowledge in the 18th century. 

The author points to the absence of a vibrant political discourse and a dearth of  political visionaries akin to those present in India's post-independence era. Despite the presence of brilliant minds, mainstream political thought has become impoverished, disconnected from political action, and dominated by academic discourse that prioritizes global trends over local realities. This vacuum, argues the author, has contributed to the current state of Indian politics.  Reviving a tradition of engaged, Indian-centric political thought is crucial for the health of Indian democracy.

Jammu and Kashmir Governor Jagmohan dismissed Farooq Abdullah's ministry and appointed G M Shah's ministry after 13 National Conference MLAs withdrew support. 

The CBI arrested four individuals, including two airline officials, for alleged involvement in the hijacking of an Indian Airlines Airbus from Srinagar to Lahore. 

In Andhra Pradesh, the central government faces a dilemma regarding the Governor's decision to install N Bhaskara Rao's ministry, amidst N T Rama Rao's planned demonstration of majority before the President. 

Meanwhile, an Airbus flight returning to Delhi after a bomb hoax was thoroughly checked, revealing no explosives.

### [Express view on SSLV launch: India’s space](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-sslv-launch-indias-space-9522674/)

India made a significant leap in its space exploration capabilities with the successful launch of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV). This smaller, more agile launch vehicle is designed to carry payloads of up to 500 kg, opening up opportunities for universities, startups, and individual innovators in the space sector.

The SSLV's rapid assembly time and  technology transfer plans to private players are expected to fuel a significant expansion of India's space sector.  With the demand for small satellites increasing in sectors like weather forecasting, communications, and disaster management, India aims to leverage this technology to boost its share in the global space economy from 2% to 8% by 2033.

### [Outrage over reform in capital gains tax is overblown. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/capital-gains-tax-reform-outrage-overblown-explained-9522238/)

India's recent Capital Gains Tax changes, while sparking debate, actually align with international norms. The changes, which simplify the tax structure, include uniform holding periods for capital gains recognition and an increased short-term capital gains tax rate.  

The removal of inflation indexation, a contentious point, is in line with most other G20 nations.  While indexation was once justified in high-inflation periods, its removal aims to simplify the system. The Budget also raises the exemption limit for lower and middle-income taxpayers. 

These revisions are intended to discourage speculative trading, promote long-term investments, and create a fairer and more equitable tax system. While adjustments may be challenging in the short term, the long-term goal is a robust and sustainable economic environment.

This article examines the public response to a recent rape and murder case in India, focusing on the need for a critical lens when analyzing public discourse. 

The author argues that focusing solely on punishing the perpetrators ignores the systemic issues that enable rape. It emphasizes the importance of holding institutions accountable for failing to provide safe environments and questioning policies that limit women's rights.

Additionally, the article critiques the societal culture that perpetuates rape-permissive attitudes and victim-blaming. It stresses the need for continuous activism and reminds readers that meaningful change requires ongoing struggle and a willingness to address the complexities of gender-based violence.

This article reflects on India's progress towards "Viksit Bharat" by 2047, drawing comparisons with China's development. While India has made strides in food security and agricultural GDP growth, it lags behind China in terms of agricultural productivity and income. China's early embrace of economic reforms, particularly in agriculture, and policies like land lease markets and income support for farmers, have fueled its remarkable economic growth. The article argues that India needs to learn from China's experience, advocating for bolder policy changes, including incentives for pulse cultivation, enhanced agricultural research and development, and improved irrigation systems. It emphasizes the need to shift from food security to nutrition security, addressing the persistent issue of child stunting.

In Andhra Pradesh, 17 people died in police firings during protests against the dismissal of NTR's ministry.  MLA supporters planned to demonstrate to President Zail Singh, highlighting the unconstitutional nature of the dismissal and demanding the removal of the "puppet government" installed by N Bhaskara Rao.

The Supreme Court of India ruled in July that states have the power to tax mining activities and collect royalties.  Initially, the ruling was set to apply from July 2023.  After a petition from mining companies, the court decided to apply the ruling retroactively to 2004, the date of a previous, albeit flawed, judgement.  

Though the court mitigated the financial impact on companies by requiring payment of principal only and allowing staggered payments, the lengthy judicial process and reversal of previous rulings raise concerns about business confidence. The court emphasized that, unlike with unconstitutional laws, retroactive application is necessary in tax cases to avoid refund obligations. Policymakers now face the challenge of ensuring a stable framework for mineral development while maintaining federal equilibrium.

Prime Minister Modi and Muhammad Yunus's recent conversation highlights the importance of the India-Bangladesh relationship, despite past tensions. Both sides recognize the need to move forward and prioritize mutual security and economic interdependence.  

While concerns remain about how the new regime came to power in Dhaka,  Indian officials and key Bangladeshi parties understand the significance of stronger ties.  Both nations must navigate delicate situations, such as Sheikh Hasina's political activity in India and potential extradition requests, to avoid hindering progress.  

Bangladesh needs internal stability and reconciliation, while India should engage all political forces to understand the evolving dynamics and prevent future instability.  Support for the new government and Yunus's initiatives is crucial for a peaceful future.

Prime Minister Modi's 11th Independence Day speech lacked the impactful new initiatives and direct address to the nation that characterized his earlier ones. This could be attributed to a diminished majority for his party post-election, requiring dependence on allies, or a recognition that progress in sanitation and women's safety remains stagnant despite earlier pronouncements. Despite framing aspirational goals like "Viksit Bharat" and targeting "perverted mentality", the speech lacked a striking new message.  Even when addressing the Uniform Civil Code, a core BJP issue, Modi's approach was subdued, emphasizing secularism, public discourse, and constitutional backing, a departure from his previous bold and assertive moves.

The article discusses the contentious issue of religious conversion in India, arguing that criminalization is not an effective solution.  It examines the efficacy of anti-conversion laws, highlighting their historical context and the lack of data supporting their success. 

The author criticizes the recent UP amendment to anti-conversion laws,  finding its broad and loosely worded definition problematic, and raising concerns about potential community tensions and misuse.

A recent tragic incident in Kolkata, where a resident doctor was murdered, highlights the urgent need for national legislation protecting healthcare workers across India. Despite widespread outcry and a proposed draft Bill, lawmakers have been slow to act, citing concerns about similar protections for other professional communities. 

This delay is concerning as healthcare workers face increasing violence due to the nature of their work, often interacting with the public in vulnerable and emotional situations.  Several states have enacted their own laws, but a lack of uniformity creates loopholes and inconsistencies. 

The author, a doctor in New Delhi, emphasizes the importance of comprehensive legal protection for healthcare workers, not just during pandemics but always, so they can serve the public without fear of harassment or assault.

A shortage of resources and political will has contributed to a significant treatment gap in mental health care.  

While the 2014 National Mental Health Policy and the 2017 Mental Health Act aim to improve the situation, implementation remains a challenge. The article suggests a model similar to the National Aids Control Programme, emphasizing evidence-based strategies, community engagement, and collaborative partnerships to effectively address mental health issues. It calls for a dedicated agency and increased funding to ensure accessible and quality mental health care for all.

### [Disparity among Dalits needs to be acknowledged](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/disparity-among-dalits-needs-to-be-acknowledged-9519753/)

Recent Supreme Court of India ruling  allowing states to sub-classify reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) has sparked debate. While there's consensus against implementing a creamy-layer exclusion for SC/ST reservations, the introduction of sub-classification is met with mixed reactions. Critics argue it will divide the pan-Dalit identity and limit social change, highlighting the limited impact achieved by reservation so far. 

However, proponents argue that such sub-classification is necessary to ensure that the most disadvantaged SC/ST groups benefit from reservation, as historically marginalized communities within these categories often remain excluded from welfare resources.  They believe acknowledging internal disparity within the Dalit community is crucial for fostering genuine unity and inclusivity. The debate reflects a complex interplay between social justice, political representation, and the ongoing struggle for equality within India's marginalized communities.

The article reflects on the state of India a decade after Narendra Modi's rise to power. 

The author acknowledges positive changes like infrastructure development and improved sanitation, but criticizes  Modi's government for a lack of genuine reform, particularly in education and governance. 

The author contends that Modi's focus on  "new" rather than  "quality" institutions has failed to address systemic issues plaguing the education system. The  author also highlights the unresponsiveness and inaccessibility of the government, citing the NEET paper leaks as an example.

Comparing Modi's tenure to that of Narasimha Rao, who brought about economic liberalization, the author argues that the current government's promises of economic reform have remained unfulfilled. 


The author concludes by expressing disappointment with Modi's speech, which lacked compelling achievements and urging for real change.

The SEBI saga involves allegations of improper investments in a business group, with a central question about the source of the funds.  While SEBI initially found no wrongdoing, doubts persisted. A five-member committee, led by Justice Sapre, investigated and found shortcomings in SEBI's  policies and enforcement related to disclosing beneficial ownership of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and defining related party transactions.  

The committee concluded that SEBI's policy on FPI ownership and enforcement were misaligned. Despite this, SEBI continued its investigations. 

The case took a new turn with allegations against SEBI Chairperson Ms Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband of conflict of interest, related to their investments in entities under investigation. While Ms Buch claims she  redeemed her investments and the companies were dormant, the key question is whether she disclosed these past connections and potential conflict of interest to SEBI, the government, the Justice Sapre Committee, and the Supreme Court.  The lack of disclosure and her continued involvement has cast a shadow over the investigations.

The South Asian University, established in 2010 as a regional center for academic excellence, has faced a steady decline due to political interference and a suppression of academic freedom. Despite its legal autonomy, the university has come under increasing pressure from the Indian government, resulting in unjustified suspensions, expulsions, and attempts to stifle dissent. 

Recent incidents, including the resignation of a respected professor over a student's research proposal referencing Noam Chomsky's critique of Prime Minister Modi, highlight the university's fear of criticism and its subservience to the Indian government. This erosion of academic freedom undermines the university's original goals of regional integration and fostering a culture of intellectual exchange.

The incident exposes the gap between idealized notions of freedom and equality and the reality faced by women in a democratic society.  

The crime, coupled with the alleged cover-up by hospital and state authorities, exposes a failing democracy where power structures collude with criminal elements.

### [25 years after it was drafted, why India’s nuclear doctrine still remains relevant](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/25-years-why-indias-nuclear-doctrine-relevant-9518938/)

India's nuclear doctrine, first drafted in 1999, centers around a minimal deterrence posture,  a retaliation-only policy, and a focus on credible deterrence.  These principles have guided India's nuclear force development and remain relevant despite evolving security challenges.

While Pakistan's focus on "full spectrum deterrence" and China's nuclear expansion raise concerns, India's doctrine acknowledges the need for a dynamic nuclear force capable of adapting to strategic changes.

The doctrine's no-first-use policy, often debated, is considered a stabilizing factor, preventing an escalation spiral. Advocating for a first-use strategy without a credible counterstrike capability would be counterproductive. 

Addressing advancements in conventional delivery systems, cyber warfare, and AI remains crucial. These technological developments necessitate a focus on enhancing the survivability of India's nuclear forces. However, they don't necessitate a change in the core doctrine principles.

In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi emphasized his government's commitment to national progress, reiterating the goal of making India the third-largest economy and tackling issues like agriculture, women's safety, and external threats. 

He called for the implementation of a uniform civil code, arguing that laws based on religion divide the country and have no place in a modern society.  Modi's stance aligns with B.R. Ambedkar's views from the Constituent Assembly, who advocated for a secular civil code applicable to all citizens regardless of religion, emphasizing that personal laws should not be based on religious doctrines. 


The article highlights the historical context of the uniform civil code debate, referencing Supreme Court judgments and the arguments made by  Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, emphasizing that a codified civil law is a step towards gender justice and secular progress.

While acknowledging the significant gains made since independence, the author expresses a sense of being trapped in a different kind of servitude, characterized by relentless pressure to excel and the constant pursuit of external validation. 

Despite the opportunities they have been afforded, the author, a beneficiary of affirmative action, grapples with the anxiety and insecurities that come with such a competitive environment. They question whether this frenetic pace of life truly signifies progress and highlight the stark contrast between individual ambition and societal inequalities, referencing instances of systemic failures and injustices that pervade the nation.

### [Seven decades after Independence, the unfulfilled dreams of India’s women leaders](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/seven-decades-after-independence-the-unfulfilled-dreams-of-indias-women-leaders-9518290/)

Over a century ago, Indian women activists began campaigning for economic, political, and social empowerment, recognizing the crucial link between financial independence and women's agency. Their early efforts led to some progress, such as banning night work for women in factories and establishing maternity benefits.  However, significant challenges persist.  

Despite recommendations for secure gender-neutral inheritance laws and recognition of unpaid domestic work, these issues remain largely unaddressed.  Activists continue to call for policy changes, including economic support for homemakers and a nationwide shift towards  replicating state-level financial assistance programs for women. The historical struggle reflects ongoing resistance to gender equality rooted in outdated societal norms. Addressing these issues is crucial for achieving a more equitable future for women in India.

### [Hobbies are more fulfilling than jobs — because they give us permission to fail](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/hobbies-are-more-fulfilling-than-jobs-because-they-give-us-permission-to-fail-9518304/)

A study by Anglia Ruskin University suggests that pursuing creative hobbies can contribute more to well-being than having a job. 

While jobs often carry pressure to perform and meet standards, hobbies offer a space for "permission to fail."  Engaging in activities like painting, knitting, or pottery  allows for self-expression and enjoyment even without achieving mastery. The lack of external pressure and the inherent joy in the process itself can be a significant source of mental well-being, especially during times of economic uncertainty.

### [Express View on the hottest July: Bad weather report](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-the-hottest-july-bad-weather-report-9518293/)

The world just experienced its hottest July ever recorded, highlighting the urgency of climate change action. While El Niño contributes to the warming, the unprecedented temperature difference compared to previous records demands immediate attention.  Climate modelling, which often underestimates regional variations, needs improvement to effectively plan for local climate impacts.  

There's a growing need for hyper-local weather forecasting, especially as cities face extreme weather events.  Expanding meteorological stations and enhancing data-sharing mechanisms between countries can help bridge the knowledge gap. International collaborations and initiatives like the Lima Adaptation Knowledge Initiative are crucial for building resilience against escalating climate risks.

### [How Britain’s anti-immigrant riots backstab UK’s flailing economy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/britain-anti-immigrant-riots-backstab-uks-flailing-economy-9517982/)

Blaming immigrants for the UK's economic woes is a tactic employed by the far right to deflect attention from deeper issues. Following Brexit, a shortage of workers led to an influx of non-EU immigrants who filled crucial roles in various sectors, including healthcare and construction. While the UK economy struggles with inflation and stagnant wages, the real problems stem from wider inequality and the failure to invest in domestic workers. Targeting immigrants, particularly Muslims and those from Asia and Africa, diverts blame from the government's own policies and the shortcomings of a free-market system. 
 
 Ironically, immigrants, despite facing prejudice, are essential to supporting vital public services like healthcare and potentially housing, which are struggling due to underfunding and mismanagement. This scapegoating tactic ultimately harms the working class, regardless of their background,  and ignores the complex realities behind the country's economic difficulties.

### [Authorities have failed them. Arm women doctors with stun-guns](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/kolkata-rape-murder-rape-arm-women-doctors-stun-guns-9517943/)

The brutal rape and murder of a trainee doctor in R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata has sparked nationwide outrage. The incident, which reportedly involved gang-rape, has prompted the Kolkata High Court to transfer the case to the CBI.  

This tragedy echoes similar cases in the past, such as the rape of Aruna Shanbaug and the Delhi gang rape, highlighting the urgent need for better security for women, especially in hospitals.  The incident has also drawn attention to the lack of basic facilities like safe restrooms for female doctors in the hospital. 

Doctors are demanding justice for the victim and better working conditions.  The government is yet to pass the Central Protection Act, proposed to address violence against medical professionals, and authorities are being urged to consider arming women doctors with self-defense tools and deploying security personnel in hospitals, particularly during night shifts.

### [The limits of censorship: Understanding the withdrawal of draft Broadcasting Bill](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/limits-of-censorship-understanding-withdrawal-of-draft-broadcasting-bill-9517688/)

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting withdrew the second draft of its controversial Broadcasting Bill after facing criticism.  The government now invites public feedback on the original draft.  

Analysts believe the draft, which aimed to regulate online content creators, was intended to suppress dissenting voices and criticism online. Provisions in the bill could have subjected creators to fines and criminal charges for political satire or socio-cultural critiques. The withdrawal offers temporary relief, but concerns remain about the government's intent to control online speech.  

The author argues that attempts to regulate digital content are ineffective and ultimately futile,  as platforms and creators transcend national borders. True engagement with citizens' grievances, such as unemployment and social inequalities,  would be a more effective approach.

### [How state governments have undermined right to education](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/state-governments-undermined-right-to-education-9517293/)

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, passed in 2010, promised equitable access to elementary education for all Indian children. While the Act was heralded as a landmark achievement, its implementation has been fraught with challenges. 

The Maharashtra government's attempt to circumvent the RTE provision mandating private schools to reserve seats for economically weaker sections (EWS) highlights the ongoing resistance to its full implementation. The government's argument that resources shouldn't be duplicated and the RTE isn't an "absolute" right reveals a lack of commitment to the law.  This stance is echoed in other states, undermining the RTE's vision of a socially inclusive education system. The  Bombay High Court's recent verdict upholding the RTE's sanctity offers a glimmer of hope, but the journey towards universal access to quality education remains long and arduous.

PR Sreejesh, a pivotal figure in India's recent hockey resurgence, concluded his illustrious career after 329 international matches. Originally from a farming family in football-centric Kerala, Sreejesh's journey to becoming a goalkeeper was serendipitous, stemming from his aversion to morning runs. He transcended the traditional Indian hockey outlook, elevating the goalkeeper position to one of reverence.  Known for his exceptional reflexes, composure and strategic acumen during shootouts, Sreejesh earned the moniker "The Wall." 

His impact extends beyond the field as he now leads junior hockey, imparting his experience to the next generation. India will never have another goalkeeper wearing the iconic No. 16 jersey, a testament to his unparalleled contributions to the sport.

### [Derek O’Brien writes: In Parliament, Opposition is feeling a new ‘josh’](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/parliament-opposition-9516568/)

The recent parliamentary sessions saw an energized Opposition, buoyed by several factors. The shortened duration of the sessions and the government's reluctance to discuss sensitive ministries like Home Affairs and Defence sparked concerns about its approach. 

The revival of the Leader of the Opposition post, held by Rahul Gandhi, significantly boosted the INDIA alliance's presence and standing.  

Effective performances by leaders like Akhilesh Yadav and Abhishek Banerjee, highlighting issues like exam leaks and demonetization, further strengthened the Opposition's position.  

Broader support from popular and former chief ministers across states, and the Sonia Gandhi effect in the Rajya Sabha, added to the Opposition's momentum and unity.  The new BJP parliamentary team, while relatively fresh, faced a revitalized and cohesive Opposition force.

The banking sector is facing its worst deposit crunch in two decades due to a widening gap between deposit growth and credit growth.  This decline in core deposits, which provide stable funding, puts pressure on bank profits and increases their exposure to interest rate risks.  

The resulting liquidity squeeze could limit bank lending, particularly to smaller entities and last-mile lending via NBFCs and microfinance institutions. This, in turn, could hinder investment and consumption. 

Factors contributing to the deposit crunch include rising competition, technological advancements, and a shift in investor preferences towards higher-yielding asset classes. 


 To address this, banks need to offer more competitive alternatives to savers and manage costs, while policymakers need to focus on deepening the bond markets.

Prime Minister Modi's I-Day speech focused on "Viksit Bharat at 2047," emphasizing India's potential and calling for a "big leap." While reiterating the government's focus on people's aspirations, the speech also acknowledged the need to listen to the public's vision for a developed India. 

A significant departure was the renewed emphasis on the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), presented not as a BJP ideological agenda but as a constitutional and judicial mandate, requiring a nationwide debate.  Furthermore, Modi's use of the term "secular" for the desired UCC and his commitment to include 1 lakh young, unconnected individuals in politics mark a significant shift towards inclusivity and expansiveness in governance.

This article analyzes Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day speech, focusing on his portrayal of national unity. The author argues that the speech relies on a problematic narrative of "contradictions" within Indian society that need resolution for progress. This, the author suggests, undermines the legacy of anti-colonial nationalism, which embraced diversity. 

The author then criticizes this approach in the context of globalization, highlighting the contradiction between celebrating Indian-origin global leaders and simultaneously demanding homogeneity at home. The article concludes by lamenting the lack of inclusive songs like those from the 1959 film "Didi," which celebrated diversity as a strength rather than a weakness, and urges a more nuanced understanding of national unity.

This open letter urges cricket broadcasters to stop using language like "suicidal" or "hara-kiri" to describe on-field errors. The author, citing the tragic deaths of numerous cricketers by suicide and the prevalence of mental health challenges within the sport, argues that such language trivializes a serious public health issue. 

Drawing parallels to the positive shift towards gender-neutral language in cricket, the letter calls for a globally enforced language policy and mandatory training for broadcasters to prevent the harmful use of suicide-related metaphors. It emphasizes the impact of media representation on public attitudes towards suicide and urges broadcasters to set an example for other sports and society at large.

It argues that while expanding social justice is welcome, addressing the root causes of inequality is crucial. The author emphasizes the need for a comprehensive caste census to understand the socioeconomic disparities within these groups. 

They point out that the underrepresentation of certain sub-castes within SCs stems from historical disadvantage and lack of political empowerment, rather than discrimination from "better-off" SCs.

The Supreme Court's recent verdict on caste classification, while intended to expand benefits for marginalized communities, raises concerns about its potential to hinder democratic progress. 

The author argues that despite legal provisions ensuring equality, the hierarchy of Indian society persists, leading to continued exclusion and discrimination against Dalits and Adivasis. The verdict's loopholes and the 50 percent cap on reservations limit its effectiveness in addressing these issues. 

The article calls for a more comprehensive approach that includes expanding reservation quotas, removing the cap, and addressing the lack of implementation in existing policies. A caste census is suggested to accurately gauge the needs of various social groups and inform policy-making. Ultimately, the author emphasizes the need to move towards social justice by eradicating caste-based discrimination and ensuring equitable opportunity for all.

Bangladesh, once a model for economic growth, is experiencing a profound crisis due to "jobless growth." Despite a steady rise in GDP, employment has remained stagnant, leading to widespread frustration and unrest among the youth. The recent violent protests, spurred by a seemingly minor quota issue, highlight the deep-rooted discontent caused by limited economic opportunities and a lack of social mobility.  History shows that unchecked "jobless growth" can destabilize nations, as it has in other countries like Egypt and Tunisia. Bangladesh's story serves as a stark warning for other nations facing similar challenges, particularly India, where the government's focus on economic growth has come at the expense of inclusive development and job creation. The mounting social anxieties and disillusionment among Bangladesh's youth demand urgent attention and a paradigm shift towards policies that prioritize equitable growth and societal well-being.

The Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for reservation has sparked both silence and criticism. This reflects a broader unease in the "post-Mandal moment."  The ruling itself,  along with previous judgments, highlights the complex issues surrounding caste-based affirmative action.

Mandal politics, characterized by its focus on reservations, has evolved since the Mandal Commission Report.  While initially grounded in "anti-caste" principles, the emphasis shifted towards securing numerical representation. This reductionist approach overshadowed the nuanced realities of social justice.

The ruling raises crucial questions about the effectiveness and future of reservation policies. It demands a reconsideration of caste blocs, the potential for internal divisions within these groups, and the need to address evolving power asymmetries.

Navigating this post-Mandal moment necessitates a fresh political discourse that acknowledges the complexities of social justice, embraces inclusivity, and transcends the limitations of a solely numerical approach to equal opportunity.

The KLEMS database, used to support claims of strong job creation in India, relies on projected population figures and worker-population ratios derived from surveys like the EUS and PLFS. 

However, the methodology has limitations. Population projections used are based on declining fertility rates and uniform growth assumptions across rural and urban segments, potentially overestimating employment.  

Additionally, data from the Employment and Unemployment Surveys (EUS) and Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS) don't capture the quality of work, as they include individuals with subsidiary or tenuous employment connections. 

Comparisons with data from the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) further raise questions about the accuracy of employment figures in the KLEMS database.

Following the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus has stepped in as Bangladesh’s interim leader facing the immense challenge of unifying a deeply divided nation and restoring its democratic foundations.  

The recent upheaval has brought to light serious concerns about the breakdown of law and order, particularly targeting Bangladesh’s Hindu minority who have suffered attacks, deaths, and property damage. While Yunus has called for peace, ensuring the safety and security of minorities and restoring order must be his top priorities.  The protests, initially sparked on campuses, have exposed the intertwining of political and communal tensions.  The task before Yunus is to foster reconciliation and inclusivity, urging all political parties, including the Awami League, to collaborate in healing the nation’s wounds.

The high cost of coaching institutes, the influx of aspirants, and the social pressure to be part of the ORN ecosystem are discussed. The author questions the effectiveness of these institutions and the validity of the "guaranteed selection" claims made by some.

The author urges aspirants to rely on genuine resources, trust in their own abilities, and avoid falling prey to the hype and unrealistic expectations perpetuated by the coaching industry.

### [In his centenary year, making sense of Guru Dutt in the classroom](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/guru-dutt-centenary-year-classroom-9511598/)

The author uses Guru Dutt's film "Pyaasa" and Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" to illustrate the challenges faced by poets in a materialistic world.  Just as the prisoners in Plato's cave are confined to shadows and unaware of true reality, poets often struggle to have their work recognized and appreciated.  

Dutt's film depicts a poet, Vijay, whose talent is ignored by society and who ultimately finds solace in death.  The author draws parallels between Vijay's plight and the Indian nation's struggles with materialism and the devaluation of art. Ultimately, the author suggests that poets must strive to illuminate truth and challenge societal norms, even if their message is initially rejected.

### [To understand what’s going on in Bangladesh, look at its past, army and society](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/to-understand-whats-going-on-in-bangladesh-look-at-its-past-army-and-society-9511108/)

The recent instability in Bangladesh cannot be attributed solely to the deposed Prime Minister's autocratic rule. Deeper fault lines within Bangladeshi society, stemming from historical conflicts, political divisions, and a struggle between secularism and Islamic resurgence, contribute significantly to the nation's volatility.

Bangladesh's history is marked by divisions generated during its liberation war, with different factions interpreting India's role and  perceiving its involvement as having come with a price. This perception of Indian hegemony fuels a narrative that blames India for the country's problems, further complicating its relations with its neighbor.

Additionally, Bangladesh's fragile civil-military relations and the military's involvement in commercial activities contribute to political instability. The army's politicisation and its extensive role in civilian matters create a breeding ground for unrest and undermine democratic institutions.  These internal contradictions offer a more comprehensive understanding of the ongoing turmoil in Bangladesh than simply focusing on recent events.

India's government recently waived clinical trials for specific categories of drugs already approved in developed nations. This aims to accelerate access to cutting-edge therapies like those for Alzheimer's, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, potentially benefiting patients and reducing the time it takes for these treatments to reach the market. 

While pharmaceutical companies stand to save costs, the government must ensure affordability for patients. The government plans to leverage this move to stimulate indigenous research through patient data access and encourage collaboration with international labs.  However, investment in domestic pharmaceutical research and development needs a boost to foster innovation and competitiveness in the Indian market.

This landmark judgment, which released Manish Sisodia from jail after seventeen months of detention, applies to all prisoners facing prolonged incarceration without trial. 

The Court emphasized that while Section 45 of the PMLA places the burden of proving innocence on the accused, this does not preclude bail for those suffering unjust pre-trial detention.  

The judgment criticized both the prosecution and lower courts for failing to recognize the principle that "bail is the rule, jail an exception."  The Supreme Court urged trial and high courts to uphold their legal and constitutional duty to protect individual liberty.

The Waqf Amendment Bill, 2024, has sparked concern within a segment of the Muslim community.  It's important to note that waqf law amendments are not unprecedented, with previous revisions occurring in 1913, 1930, 1995, and 2013. Many of the current proposals were recommended decades ago by reports from the Sachar Committee and a joint parliamentary committee. The need for reform has been voiced within the Muslim community itself, with grievances regarding encroachment, mismanagement, and delays in waqf property processes. 

The proposed reforms aim to improve waqf administration, enhance transparency, and leverage technology for efficient management of these substantial public assets.  Waqfs, although primarily Muslim institutions, hold immense socio-economic potential for the nation.  It is crucial for the debate surrounding these reforms to be grounded in reason, objectivity, and a focus on the shared benefits these institutions can provide.

The article discusses the historical precedent of the US ruling against Google's monopolistic practices, drawing parallels to a similar ruling against Microsoft in 2001.  

Despite legal challenges, both Microsoft and Google have maintained a dominant position in their respective markets. The author argues that, similar to Microsoft's approach of allowing piracy in emerging markets, Google's widespread user base, ingrained in daily digital practices, makes it difficult to dislodge. The author suggests that Google's accessibility in low-literacy and emerging markets makes it a cultural staple, and that future competition may come from Generative AI rather than alternative search engines.  Ultimately, the article critiques the slow pace of legal systems in addressing the dynamic nature of digital platforms.

### [Vandita Mishra writes: Ahead of Independence Day](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/independence-day-2024-india-bangladesh-9508345/)

India celebrates its Independence Day against the backdrop of democratic backsliding in neighboring Bangladesh. The recent elections in India have reduced the ruling party's majority, providing a new impetus for both the government and the opposition to demonstrate accountability and humility.  This shift towards a less deferential political landscape presents challenges for the government, accustomed to operating with unchecked authority. 

The opposition is asserting its voice,  and the government seems to be responding with a mix of token gestures and hard-line tactics. While sending a controversial bill to a parliamentary committee could signal a willingness to engage,  accusations of "flood jihad" against a minority university raise concerns about intolerance.  

The Supreme Court's bail order for a senior AAP leader also highlights a pushback against potentially misused legal mechanisms.  As India marks its Independence Day, the fight for freedom and institutional checks and balances remains an ongoing endeavor.

The Supreme Court's decision allowing sub-classification within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked controversy within the Dalit community. Some dominant SC groups, who previously advocated for proportional representation based solely on population size, are now opposing sub-classification, arguing it undermines unity. Critics point out that such claims are disingenuous, as historical and present inequalities within the SC community necessitate recognizing the needs of marginalized groups like Mahadalits. 

This decision, they argue, highlights the hypocrisy of self-proclaimed Dalit leaders who fail to adequately represent all segments of the community. The author contends that sub-classification is essential to ensure meaningful participation and empower historically disadvantaged Dalit groups, ultimately strengthening the overall Dalit community.

The author cites Congress leader D P Mishra's autobiography to support claims of Nehru's  prejudice against the RSS and highlights its patriotic role during the 1962 war with China. 

The article further argues that Sardar Patel saw the RSS as patriotic, unlike Khera's portrayal, and points to the acceptance of funds from various sources, including China, by the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation as a counterpoint to Khera's allegations.

They use the example of German fans who, while supporting their team, also displayed a nuanced understanding of the game. The author suggests that India needs to move beyond idolising athletes and adopt a more analytical approach, celebrating sports for its inherent value and the human skills it cultivates.  This shift in mindset, coupled with the athletes' focus on process and consistency, could pave the way for India to become a true sporting powerhouse.

### [Prabhat Patnaik writes on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: A communist first](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/prabhat-patnaik-writes-on-buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-a-communist-first-9506157/)

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's political journey  was deeply influenced by the vibrant communist movement in Bengal. His early association with the CP(M) and its commitment to land reforms drew him to the party. He played a pivotal role in West Bengal's Left Front government, implementing significant social and economic reforms. Measures like Operation Barga, land distribution, and panchayat revival contributed to the state's progress. 

While the Left Front achieved success in the initial years, Buddha's later decision to attract conventional industrialists led to a disconnect with the peasantry, ultimately contributing to the party's decline. Despite this, he played a crucial role in shaping autonomous councils within the state, a model relevant to contemporary statehood demands. 
 
Beyond politics, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stood out for his simple living and dedication to the cause of the working class.

### [SC/ST Sub-quota red lines and red herrings](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-st-sub-quota-red-lines-and-red-herrings-9505474/)

The Supreme Court judgment on sub-classifying reserved categories within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has sparked debate.  Critics wrongly assume the verdict dilutes reservation, but it actually strengthens its intent by focusing on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities.  

Legal concerns regarding the court overstepping its bounds are unfounded, as the court merely clarified the scope of Article 341 allowing for sub-classification.  

Empirical data from the Census of India demonstrates significant variations in educational attainment within SC communities, highlighting the need for sub-classification. Political concerns about fracturing Dalit unity are misplaced as the communities are already diverse.  

However, genuine apprehensions remain regarding potential misuse of sub-classification for political advantage and the application of the "creamy layer" doctrine, which requires further clarification. A separate examination of reservation for Scheduled Tribes is also necessary.  

Moving forward, the focus should be on enhancing overall reservation, removing the 50% ceiling and strengthening the social justice apparatus beyond just public sector jobs.

### [Ram Madhav writes: In Bangladesh, it’s time for healing](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-in-bangladesh-its-time-for-healing-9505462/)

Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's long-serving Prime Minister, now faces a challenging situation amidst widespread public unrest. While her tenure saw significant economic growth and progress, it also witnessed growing economic inequality and dissatisfaction, particularly among the youth. 

The recent reinstatement of quotas in government jobs, a long-standing contentious issue, ignited protests that quickly escalated, leading to clashes with security forces and casualties. The government's response, seen as heavy-handed and dismissive, further fueled the discontent.

The appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, a respected figure, as head of an interim government signifies an attempt to restore order and unity. 

The situation raises concerns about the stability of Bangladesh, the significance of inclusivity in development, and the need for responsive governance to address the aspirations of its citizens, especially the youth.

The Supreme Court granted bail to Manish Sisodia, Delhi’s former deputy Chief Minister, after nearly a year and a half in custody without a conviction. The judgment  highlights three key points: the principle of bail being the norm, not the exception; the need to respect the right to a speedy trial; and the importance of considering delay in incarceration when granting bail. 

The court recognized that trial courts and high courts often overlook the "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" principle, leading to  a backlog of bail petitions. It also emphasized the constitutional right to liberty and the need to set timeframes for trials to prevent prolonged pre-trial detention.  Finally, the judgment advocates  reading the right to bail in cases of significant delay and long imprisonment into relevant sections of  the Criminal Procedure Code and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

### [SC verdict on subclassification of caste-based reservation will worsen reality of the Dalit community. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-verdict-on-subclassification-of-caste-based-reservation-will-worsen-reality-of-the-dalit-community-heres-why-9505463/)

The Supreme Court's decision to allow sub-classification within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and to remove the "creamy layer" from reservation benefits is deeply problematic. The judgment ignores the vast social and economic disparities faced by Dalits, many of whom lack the resources to even compete for reserved positions. 

The existing vacancies for SC/ST quotas, often attributed to a lack of suitable candidates, highlight the inadequacy of addressing the issue through sub-classification.  Comparing OBCs and SCs, as the judgment seemingly does, is inappropriate given their vastly different social and economic standings. 

The  verdict fails to acknowledge the enduring social stigma faced by Dalits, regardless of economic status, and risks fragmenting the community by creating new hierarchies.  By allowing states to modify the notification defining SC/STs, the judgment potentially undermines the constitutional mandate of protecting these communities.

The article emphasizes the importance of adopting a pragmatic and collaborative approach in dealing with Bangladesh, focusing on economic cooperation, dispute resolution and  building support among diverse stakeholders. It concludes that despite the current turbulence, the India-Bangladesh relationship is resilient and can withstand the challenges with patient diplomacy and empathy for the aspirations of the Bangladeshi people.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained its policy rate and stance, acknowledging market alignment with its current decision while recognizing uncertainty regarding future actions.  

High food inflation, driven by factors like cereal, pulse, and vegetable price spikes, remains a concern for the RBI as it influences household inflationary expectations. Despite core inflation being below target, food inflation's impact on overall CPI inflation, currently around 5%, necessitates careful consideration. The RBI projects average inflation at 4.5% for FY25. 


Growth projections for FY25 remain at 7.2%, supported by healthy high-frequency indicators. However, consumption demand and private investment recovery are areas of concern. The RBI is also closely monitoring bank deposit growth, which is lagging behind credit growth, posing potential liquidity risks.

Weight management in sports, particularly wrestling, often involves strategic weight cutting. Athletes aim to compete in lighter weight categories to gain an advantage. This can involve rapid weight loss through intense workouts, fluid restriction, and fasting days before competitions. While effective for short-term weight reduction, this practice is detrimental to athletes' health and can lead to injuries, stress, and eating disorders.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), launched in 2018, aimed to provide public health insurance to 500 million Indians, addressing gaps in the previous RSBY scheme.  

Analysis of the 2022-23 Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data shows that while coverage has increased for the poorest two quintiles, it remains below 30%. 

Despite an increase in utilization by covered individuals, overall healthcare utilization under the scheme remains low. The HCES data also reveals a shift in the burden of OOPE for inpatient services from lower to higher income groups, indicating a positive impact of PM-JAY on lower-income groups. 

However, despite this, individuals across all income quintiles still incur significant out-of-pocket expenses for inpatient care. The data suggests that progress towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India is slow, with challenges in both coverage and financial protection for the most vulnerable populations.

The analysis reveals a significant decrease in poverty in India since 2011-12. However, a focus is placed on the vulnerability of the bottom 50% of households to medical shocks, particularly hospitalisation. The study shows that while the proportion of households experiencing hospitalisation has increased, the share of household expenditure dedicated to health expenses, including hospitalisation, has decreased.  

Crucially, there has been a notable reduction in the likelihood of households experiencing a decline in their overall consumption status due to hospitalisation, highlighting increased affordability and improved healthcare accessibility for the poorest half of the population, particularly in rural areas. This trend is attributed to public health policies like the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.

The Union Budget 2024-25 proposed a review of the Income Tax Act, 1961, aiming for simplification and reduction of tax disputes. 

One key change was the simplification of capital gains taxation, proposing a 12.5% tax rate on long-term gains across all asset classes, while removing the indexation benefit for property, gold, and unlisted assets.

Following criticism, the government has granted taxpayers the option to choose either the 20% tax rate with indexation benefits or the 12.5% rate without indexation for property purchased before July 23, 2024.


The government is also looking to revise the assessment process, limiting tax reopening beyond three years unless "escaped income" exceeds Rs 50 lakh.

The Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2023 raises concerns about government overreach into Muslim religious and charitable properties.  The bill proposes increased government control over Waqf administration, management, and creation, potentially violating Article 26 of the Constitution which protects religious denomination properties.  

The author argues that Waqf properties are private and self-acquired by Muslims, and government interference is unwarranted. Concerns are raised about the bill empowering district collectors to determine Waqf property status, potentially leading to the seizure of Muslim-owned land.  Moreover, the elimination of “waqf by user” could result in the loss of existing Waqf properties due to non-usage.  

The author concludes that these amendments are discriminatory and threaten the rights of Muslims in India, particularly their religious freedom and property ownership guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.

Mass protests in Bangladesh, initially sparked by student opposition to job quotas, escalated to demands for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, leading to her departure and the formation of an interim government.

The protests highlighted Bangladesh's recurring cycles of political violence and inter-party conflict, rooted in ideological divides and a history of military intervention.

The inclusion of opposition parties in the interim government is crucial for its legitimacy and effectiveness.  The government's relationship with India, Bangladesh's significant development partner, will also be pivotal.

### [How a wildlife sanctuary in the Great Nicobar Island was made to vanish](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/wildlife-sanctuary-great-nicobar-island-9499941/)

The article critiques the approval of a large port project in Great Nicobar Island's Galathea Bay, highlighting a pattern of environmental disregard and legal maneuvering. 

CRZ-1A designates ecologically sensitive coastal areas as protected zones, barring large-scale construction. Yet, the project site, crucial for nesting sea turtles and harboring coral reefs and mangroves, was de-notified in 2021. The environmental clearance granted despite this stands questioned, with scientific records confirming the area's CRZ-1A status. The article alleges a biased "ground-truthing" survey manipulated to declare the area non-CRZ-1A, enabling the project's construction. The author condemns the decision, viewing it as a betrayal of ecological integrity and legal propriety.

The article examines whether India's constitutional changes in Kashmir five years ago have rendered the Kashmir issue irrelevant to relations with Pakistan. It argues that while the changes have significantly reduced the global salience of the issue and Pakistan's ability to internationalize it, the issue has not disappeared entirely. 

Though Delhi has made political gains in Kashmir and strengthened ties with the West, Pakistan's army remains a potent factor, capable of creating cross-border terrorism and stirring internal trouble. India faces the challenge of managing these ongoing threats while simultaneously pursuing internal reconciliation in Kashmir and engaging with diverse elements within Pakistani society.  The article concludes that while progress has been made, complacency is not an option for India.

### [Boxing with binaries: The Imane Khelif story](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/boxing-with-binaries-the-imane-khelif-story-9499418/)

The article discusses the history and issues surrounding sex testing in sports. 

Beginning with the case of Maria Jose Martinez-Patino, who faced trauma due to compulsory chromosome testing, the article highlights the flawed system that assumes a binary understanding of sex. It examines how the focus shifted from chromosome testing to testosterone levels, but the core problem of forcing athletes into rigid categories persists.

The author argues against this binary approach, citing scientific evidence of sex variations and the case of Dutee Chand, a sprinter who challenged gender-based testosterone regulations.  Ultimately, the article calls for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of sex in sports, recognizing the spectrum of biological possibilities rather than adhering to rigid definitions.

### [From Uttarakhand to Wayanad: Balancing realpolitik with green transition](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-uttarakhand-to-wayanad-balancing-realpolitik-with-green-transition-9499417/)

India's green energy transition presents a complex picture. While the central government has made significant strides in setting ambitious targets and fostering collaboration amongst ministries, progress varies across states due to differing policy environments, financial constraints, and implementation capacity. 

A key challenge lies in balancing national interest with the ethical imperative of sustainable development.  The dominance of China in the renewable energy market creates a dilemma, as importing cheap Chinese products would accelerate India's transition but raises national security concerns.  

Furthermore, balancing economic growth with the environmental costs of climate change requires a global shift in perspective, moving beyond self-serving nationalisms towards a cooperative framework that prioritizes humanity and collective responsibility.

In Sri Lanka, clashes between Tamil separatists and security forces resulted in the deaths of an undisclosed number of guerrillas and at least four policemen.  The incidents occurred in Oddusuddan after separatists stormed a police station and raided its armoury.  In India, the opposition walked out of parliament to protest against two security bills deemed "draconian" by critics. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expressed openness to discussing the Akali demands with tribunals, but emphasized her refusal to accept the Anandpur Sahib resolution. 

The government faced scrutiny over the Madras airport explosion that killed 29 and injured 38, following reports that authorities received a bomb threat prior to the incident.

Isaac Asimov's Foundation series explores the potential collapse of an empire and the establishment of a backup repository for human knowledge.  Inspired by this, scientists propose a "lunar biorepository" to safeguard endangered species' genetic material against various global threats. 

While technological advancements like this may seem like science fiction coming to life, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications.  Ensuring a backup for biodiversity mustn't overshadow the primary responsibility to protect Earth's existing ecosystems.  Asimov likely would have emphasized using scientific advancements for the benefit of all, not just a select few.

The 2024 IOC guidelines promote inclusivity in sports, emphasizing respect for all athletes regardless of gender identity or sex variations.  However, athletes like Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who face scrutiny due to their gender presentation and past gender testing controversies, have experienced discrimination and disrespect, including from public figures. 

This highlights the persistent issue of conflating biological sex and gender identity in women's sports. The debate often stems from  misinformation and prejudice, rather than scientific evidence. For athletes like Khelif,  these controversies impact their dignity, acceptance, and recognition in the sporting world.  The emphasis on chromosomes and gender identity should not overshadow the importance of fair play, sportsmanship, and respecting athletes' achievements.

A surge in violence in the Middle East, marked by the killings of top leaders of Iran-backed groups and retaliatory actions, threatens to escalate into a wider conflict. 

Despite significant military efforts from both Israel and the US, and Iran's strategic success in fostering proxy groups, the conflict shows no signs of producing any meaningful political outcomes. The violence fuels domestic divisions in both Israel, where public support for the war is waning, and Iran, where internal protests simmer alongside regional aggression. The cycle of violence lacks any clear political purpose, raising concerns about its potentially devastating and unsustainable nature.

### [From Bangladesh’s students, a message: A fighting chance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-protests-students-message-fighting-chance-9498611/)

The recent political changes in Bangladesh present both opportunities and risks.  India's vital interests in the country, such as preventing it from becoming a base for anti-India groups and ensuring safety for its Hindu population, must be balanced with respect for Bangladesh's autonomy. 
 
Previous Indian support for Sheikh Hasina's authoritarian rule has been criticized for overlooking the realities of democratic progress. Simplifying the situation by framing it solely as a religious or foreign conspiracy disrespects the agency and complexities of Bangladeshi society. 
 
Bangladesh faces two key challenges: its evolving national identity and the institutionalization of its party system. While student movements have historically played a vital role in pushing for democracy, ensuring a truly democratic transition requires free and fair elections and the development of a more inclusive and accountable party system. 
 
Ultimately, the success of Bangladesh's democratic path hinges on its ability to address these challenges and chart its own future, free from undue external influence.

The murder of three girls in Southport sparked riots across several UK towns, with far-right groups targeting mosques, hotels housing asylum seekers, and other public buildings. This violence, which injured dozens of police officers, highlights the growing influence of far-right extremism and the spread of misinformation online. While many locals condemned the violence, the unrest underscores the need for the government to address the root causes, including online radicalization, the use of inflammatory rhetoric by politicians, and public anxieties surrounding immigration.  The Labour government faces a significant challenge in tackling these issues and restoring public confidence.

The recently circulated draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024, seeks to extend regulations currently governing traditional media to the internet. This expansive bill aims to encompass digital news broadcasters, influencers, and political commentators, potentially leading to restrictions on online speech.

Critics argue that the bill's broad definition of "broadcaster" and the stringent requirements it imposes, including pre-certification of content and government oversight, could stifle creative independence and democratic discourse. The bill also raises concerns about extra-territorial application, potentially affecting global online voices with a presence in India. 

The draft bill necessitates thorough deliberation and stakeholder consultation before implementation to safeguard free speech and the future of online expression in India.

The authoritarian rule of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh has ended following mass protests triggered by economic hardship and government misconduct. Hasina has resigned and may seek refuge in India.  India should acknowledge the Bangladeshi people's right to self-determination while cautiously navigating the situation.  

Drawing parallels with Nepal's 2006 political transition, India should support the expression of popular will in Bangladesh.  While acknowledging the significant progress in India-Bangladesh relations under Hasina's leadership, India must avoid portraying the current change as anti-India and focus on preserving the economic and people-to-people ties that have flourished in recent years. 

The uncertainty surrounding the interim government and  potential influence from opposing political factions necessitates a measured response from India.

The US Federal Reserve's potentially dovish stance, alongside concerns over the US labor market, triggered significant global market volatility.  Weaker-than-expected US jobs data fueled fears of a recession and prompted investors to re-evaluate risks, leading to sharp declines in the Dow Jones, Indian indices like Sensex, and other Asian and European markets. 

The fall in Indian markets, exacerbated by concerns about valuations in certain segments,  was compounded by anxieties over the upcoming RBI monetary policy meeting and subsequent economic data releases. This global downturn reflects broader market uncertainty stemming from factors like the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike and geopolitical tensions.

Recent riots in the UK, sparked by a stabbing incident,  have been fueled by far-right groups exploiting the tragedy. Despite the police ruling out terrorism, misinformation spread online falsely linking the perpetrator to Islam, leading to attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses. 

These riots are seen as a challenge to the newly elected Labour government, building upon years of rising Islamophobia and anti-immigration sentiment under Conservative rule. The violence reflects a broader trend, highlighting the fragility of social cohesion and the exploitation of societal tensions for political gain.  The Labour government has condemned the violence and pledged a strong response, while civil society groups work to counter hate and promote unity.

Sheikh Hasina's recent resignation and departure from Bangladesh follow widespread unrest fueled by years of mounting discontent. Despite the Awami League's electoral victory, concerns over rigged elections and Hasina's authoritarian tactics, including crackdowns on dissent and alleged manipulations of the development narrative, escalated public anger.  A nationwide student protest against controversial job quotas for descendants of freedom fighters transformed into a major crisis culminating in a harsh government response, resulting in numerous casualties. This tragedy marked a turning point, forcing Hasina to relinquish power. Her downfall serves as a reminder that prioritizing dominance over inclusive governance is ultimately unsustainable.

Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, resigned after 15 years in power. Her tenure, marked by significant economic progress, was also characterized by growing authoritarianism, suppressed civil liberties, and rampant corruption. Peaceful student demonstrations initially demanding quota reform in civil service jobs escalated into a nationwide movement against Hasina's increasingly oppressive rule.

Triggering her downfall, the government’s forceful response to the student protests, including the use of police and "shoot-on-sight" orders, backfired and galvanized public discontent. The government's suppression of dissent, coupled with escalating economic inequalities and persistent corruption, created a climate of frustration that ultimately led to Hasina's resignation.

The Indian stock market experienced a significant drop, driven by concerns about the US economy.  Valuations in India have been rising rapidly, defying logic and exceeding levels seen in the last bull market in 2007.  

While bulls have offered explanations for the continuous upward movement, many believe it is fueled by fear of missing out, greed, and sentiment rather than strong fundamentals. 

Experts point to examples like Whirlpool, Asian Paints, and HUL, where high valuations contrast with mediocre growth and  challenging operating environments. 

Despite worries about valuations and the potential for a correction, the market has often rebounded from minor dips.  It remains to be seen how long the current bull run will last and whether investors will adopt a more realistic view of growth prospects.

This article explores the factors contributing to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.  

It highlights Pakistan's military's role in fueling terrorism by using religious rhetoric and exploiting Cold War geopolitics. The article argues that radical Islam, while not deeply rooted in the Valley's unique syncretic traditions, has been used as a tool by external forces. The fraught federal relationship between Delhi and J&K, particularly due to Article 370, has also been a breeding ground for separatist politics.  The abrogation of Article 370, while necessary, is seen as only a first step towards lasting peace.

The economic situation in Kashmi, marked by unemployment and limited access to power, has led to social unrest, mirroring situations in other parts of India.  

Change in J&K's political narrative has shifted from diverse viewpoints to one dominated by the BJP's agenda. The Valley-centric parties struggle to regain relevance as their core ideology has been dismantled. The writer suggests the need for the political leadership in Kashmir to adapt and advocate for a pluralistic and progressive state focused on social welfare.

### [Vandita Mishra writes: The court and social justice](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-reservation-social-justice-9494924/)

The Supreme Court recently allowed sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) for reservation purposes. This decision, which extends the existing principle for Other Backward Classes (OBCs), allows states to create internal differentiations within SCs/STs to refine affirmative action policies. 

The Court stipulated conditions for this sub-classification, requiring states to demonstrate empirical evidence and rationales that promote equality, placing the onus on them to justify their decisions. While welcomed by some as a way to address disparities within these groups, the verdict has also sparked criticism and concerns about potential misuse and political manipulation.

Effective implementation will require comprehensive caste censuses at the national or state levels to accurately identify the most disadvantaged groups.

The author points to instances of poor governance, citing examples like the Wayanad tragedy, Uttarakhand floods, Delhi's waterlogging, and the tragic death of students in a Delhi coaching center, blaming a lack of planning and accountability. The argument extends to the need for affordable housing and a functioning drainage system as basic necessities for development.  The author believes that the government's reliance on free food grain distribution as a solution to poverty further highlights the inadequacy of its approach. Ultimately, the article concludes that 'Viksit Bharat' remains a distant dream unless the government addresses the root causes of its shortcomings.

### [In the reluctant defence of cats and ‘cat women’](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-the-reluctant-defence-of-cats-and-cat-women-9493405/)

Following an unfortunate comment by Republican candidate J.D. Vance about Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris, the article discusses the societal stereotypes women in politics face.

Vance described Harris and other Democratic leaders as "miserable" childless women who are unhappy with their choices. The author argues that these comments, along with those from other Republicans, reveal a disdain for female agency and women who choose not to be mothers. 

The article also critiques the stereotyping of women with cats, suggesting this reflects a broader misogyny and a lack of understanding of women's diverse life experiences and choices. Ultimately, the author argues that judging women based on societal norms rather than individual fulfillment is a prejudiced and ultimately unhelpful perspective.

Protests in Kenya erupted following the government's imposition of a tax on social media income, a move perceived as targeting the country's young, digitally active population, particularly Gen Z.  The demonstrations highlight the economic struggles of young Kenyans, many of whom are unemployed despite higher education. These protests have expanded to encompass broader concerns about government corruption and the concentration of wealth among a select few. The government's response has been mixed,  dissolving and reconstituting the cabinet under the guise of reform. The protests have resonated throughout the region, prompting comparisons with neighboring Tanzania, which has adopted a socialist economic model.

Nirmala Sitharaman, India's Finance Minister, presented the 2024-25 Budget which centered on claims of increased expenditure, particularly in the agriculture sector.  However, critics pointed out that the FM's figures didn't account for inflation, and that unspent funds from the previous year remained unaccounted for. 

Sitharaman highlighted  government reports suggesting low unemployment rates, but these were contradicted by other data sources.  The overwhelming number of applicants vying for a limited number of jobs questioned the veracity of the low unemployment claims.

The FM also defended her government's economic policies by referencing past high inflation rates during the UPA government, a comparison deemed irrelevant by critics who focused on the current high inflation rates impacting consumers directly. The Budget's proposal to combat inflation was seen as lacking by many,  and the overall response to the Budget was lukewarm.

### [The unsettling question of gender & the Games](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-unsettling-question-of-gender-the-games-9493406/)

The 1936 Berlin Olympics saw the first ever gender tests in athletic competition sparked by controversy surrounding Czechoslovakian track star Zdenek Koubek's transition. After publicly announcing her desire to become a man,  pressure mounted from figures like Wilhelm Knoll, head of the International Federation of Sports Medicine, who advocated for  gender checks to prevent unfair advantage.

These concerns, fueled by anecdotal evidence and suspicion, led to the implementation of a vague rule authorizing medical inspections of female athletes if a protest was lodged. The infamous case of American sprinter Helen Stephens, tested and cleared, highlighted the growing scrutiny. 

Another prominent case involved German high jumper Dora Ratjen, who was allegedly a male assigned female at birth. Her impressive performance raised suspicions, leading to her arrest and the revocation of her records. Her story further fueled the debate and solidified the need for gender verification in competitive sport, despite the ethical complexities involved.

Key highlights include abolishing the angel tax to stimulate the startup ecosystem and aligning tax rates for foreign companies.  The Budget prioritizes job creation through EPFO-linked schemes and addresses concerns regarding employment displacement due to AI.

A new 'Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme' aims to resolve pending tax disputes, while simplifying GST litigation with an amnesty scheme, increased appeal limits, and a uniform look-back period. Additionally, the government intends to review the customs duty structure.  Capital gains tax simplicity was introduced, but concerns arose regarding the removal of indexation benefits. The Budget emphasizes consolidating a tax base and compliance culture for achieving "Viksit Bharat."

Devastating landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district have claimed hundreds of lives and left many missing. The tragedy highlights the disparity in Indian society and the vulnerability of marginalized communities living in ecologically sensitive areas. 

Past landslides in the region point to the dangers of deforestation and the exploitation of land for tea plantations, driven by economic interests.  Authorities are criticized for neglecting the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel's (WGEEP) recommendations, which emphasize the need for sustainable development and protection of natural resources.  

The WGEEP's proposals, including graded regulations based on ecological sensitivity, remain unimplemented despite the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. This negligence has severely impacted the region, underscoring the urgent need for action to protect the environment and empower local communities.

### [State’s government, Centre’s rule](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/state-government-centre-rule-9492179/)

The death of three UPSC aspirants in a flooded coaching center in Delhi highlights  serious issues with building safety and preparedness for heavy rains. A subsequent video exposed a discrepancy between Delhi government officials' claims and the reality of unfinished desilting work. This incident brought to light a wider clash of power between the AAP-led Delhi government and the BJP-led Centre, marked by the Centre allegedly using the Lieutenant Governor to undermine the elected government and weaponize the bureaucracy.  

Instances include the dissolution of the Delhi government's policy think tank, the removal of professionals engaged by the government, and the stoppage of salaries for contractual staff of the Delhi Commission for Women. This, along with the Centre's passing of a law contradicting a Supreme Court ruling on the powers of the Delhi government,  has created a tense standoff, with the AAP challenging the law's constitutionality.

The article critiques Rahul Gandhi's approach to Opposition politics, arguing it lacks maturity and balance.  

It compares Gandhi's tactics to the "politics of enemies," a strategy that relies on demonizing opponents and dominating discourse through repetition, often cloaked in the guise of defending democracy. 

The author draws on historical examples of past Opposition leaders who conducted themselves with decorum and highlighted moments of bipartisan cooperation. It suggests Gandhi should focus on issues like social justice, citing the legacies of leaders like Ambedkar and Lohia.  

The article concludes by referencing Rajiv Gandhi's statement on caste during the Mandal Commission debate, urging Rahul Gandhi to consider his father's stance on balancing social needs with national goals.

The lifting of the ban on government servants joining the RSS raises concerns about the formalization of a Hindu state. The author argues that while the ban's removal might not have a significant impact substantively, it underscores the devolution of the Indian state apparatus toward a Hindu identity. 

The juxtaposition of the RSS ideology, which advocates for a state based on dharma and a cultural revival, with the Constitution's commitment to secularism and inclusivity is highlighted. The author contends that the RSS's approach to history, nationalism, and governance conflicts with the principles enshrined in the Constitution.

Furthermore, the author draws a contrast between the RSS's ideology and the Gandhi-Nehru paradigm, which sought a nuanced interpretation of tradition, a self-critical modernity, and inclusion of all citizens regardless of caste or creed.  They argue that the RSS's ideology poses a significant challenge to constitutional democracy in India.

The recent devastating landslide in Wayanad, Kerala, which claimed hundreds of lives, has highlighted the dire consequences of unchecked development driven by tourism and quarrying.  

While heavy rains triggered the landslide, experts suggest that the fragility of the region’s topology was significantly exacerbated by these activities. Despite  warnings from the Gadgil Committee in 2011 that recommended restrictions on development in the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats, construction and tourism-related activities have continued unabated.  

The incident has raised concerns about the environmental impact of infrastructure development in landslide-prone areas, particularly in the Western Ghats. The need for sustainable land management practices, such as reforestation, controlled deforestation and sustainable agriculture, is emphasized to mitigate the effects of heavy rains and safeguard the region's fragile ecosystem.

### [Growing rice by direct seeding: Laying a new field](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/growing-rice-by-direct-seeding-laying-a-new-field-9491720/)

Private investment in agricultural technology in India has slowed significantly in recent years due to low farm prices and a shift towards organic farming that hinders the development of new GM crops. This trend is concerning, as private sector innovation played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural practices in the two decades following liberalization.

A recent joint venture between RiceTec and Mahyco, focused on developing climate-smart technologies for rice and wheat, offers a glimmer of hope. Their approach utilizes mutated genes for herbicide tolerance, enabling direct seeding in rice and zero tillage in wheat, thereby reducing water use, labor, and fuel costs while minimizing stubble burning.

The fact that public sector institutions have also developed similar herbicide-tolerant rice varieties demonstrates the potential for progress without reliance on foreign genes. The government should encourage this innovative approach, recognizing its potential to benefit farmers and India’s food security.

The 2014 NALSA judgment declared transgender persons' right to self-define their gender identity, prohibiting forced medical procedures for legal recognition. However, despite this, many transgender individuals still face hurdles in changing their official documents and affirming their identity.  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019 mandates medical intervention proof for legal gender change, creating a contradiction with the NALSA judgment and causing difficulties in implementation.  Delays in certificate processing and inadequate provision of support services further marginalize the transgender community.  


A 2015 study showed that legal recognition of gender identity significantly reduces psychological distress and suicidal thoughts among transgender individuals, highlighting the urgency of ensuring their rights.

### [With Supreme Court verdict on Scheduled Caste sub-categorisation, the last person among the marginalised has hope](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-scheduled-caste-sub-categorisation-marginalised-hope-9491343/)

The Supreme Court of India's ruling in State of Punjab vs Davinder Singh opens the door to sub-classification within Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), empowering the most marginalized communities. This decision acknowledges the internal heterogeneity within SCs and STs, recognizing that some subgroups have benefited more from reservation policies while others remain excluded. The Court's verdict aims to ensure that benefits reach the "invisible Dalits," who often lack the capacity to aspire or compete for resources. 

Effective implementation requires data to identify these marginalized communities.  States and the government must ensure that benefits not only reach historically more visible groups within these categories but also those who remain 'invisible' and lack political representation.  Capacity building programs are crucial to empower these communities to access and utilize state-provided opportunities, bridging the gap in social and economic mobility.

Recent assassinations of key figures in Hezbollah and Hamas have heightened tensions in the Middle East.  Linked to recent attacks on Israeli soil, the killings are seen by some as an attempt by Israel to undermine its adversaries' resolve before potential negotiations.  However, these actions are likely to strengthen Iran and its allies' resolve, particularly after past incidents where Israel's deterrence was challenged.   The ongoing conflict in Gaza, now ten months old, has failed to achieve its stated objectives and has led to significant political isolation for Israel. Meanwhile, international efforts push for a two-state solution to the conflict, with recent Palestinian reconciliation talks providing a glimmer of hope.  The situation remains volatile, and the risk of further escalation is high.

The newly built Parliament complex has reduced spaces for media interaction with politicians.  

While there are designated areas like a press gallery, a media lounge, and a briefing room, these are often limited and lack the informal spaces that existed in the old Parliament building.  The iconic Central Hall, once a hub for off-the-record conversations and insightful interactions between journalists and politicians, is no longer accessible to the media. The absence of such open spaces hinders the free flow of information and dialogue, crucial elements of a vibrant democracy.  The new Parliament's design has created a more structured and controlled environment for media engagement, potentially limiting the opportunities for spontaneous conversation and fostering transparency.

The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady in its July meeting but signaled a potential pivot towards easing policy in September if inflation remains in line with expectations. This decision follows similar moves by other developed economies like the ECB, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England, who have already begun reducing interest rates. The Fed's statement showed "some further progress" towards the 2% inflation target, and the committee indicated a shift in focus from solely tackling inflation to considering both inflation and employment risks.

The Supreme Court has ruled that sub-classification among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation purposes is constitutional. 

This landmark decision overturns a 2004 verdict and allows for preferential measures targeted at the most disadvantaged castes within SCs/STs, aiming to ensure a more substantive form of equality.  
While acknowledging the potential challenges, the court emphasizes that sub-classification should be understood as a tool to enhance equality, not replace it. The verdict recognizes the diverse levels of backwardness within SCs, citing historical and empirical evidence to support its decision.

It now remains to be seen how states will implement this ruling and address the practical questions surrounding sub-classification criteria and policy design.  The court's intent is to ensure that the benefits of reservation reach those who need it most, but successful implementation hinges on avoiding political misinterpretations and prioritizing the core goal of addressing inequality within SC communities.

The Supreme Court has allowed state governments to sub-divide the reservation quota for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), marking a significant development in India's policies of social justice. This overturns a previous ruling that prohibited such sub-classifications. The court acknowledged the varying degrees of disadvantage within these categories, emphasizing the need for tailored affirmative action.  The judgment also opens the door to identifying and excluding a "creamy layer" within SC and ST communities from reservation benefits, a practice previously limited to Other Backward Classes (OBCs). While implementation details remain to be seen, this ruling aims to address historical inequalities and strengthen efforts to uplift the most disadvantaged sections within these communities.

The Supreme Court's recent verdict in Davinder Singh case allows states to sub-classify Scheduled Castes and Tribes, potentially leading to varied reservation percentages within these groups. While the majority judges reason this aligns with the Constitution and empirical heterogeneity within SC/STs, Justice Trivedi dissents, arguing the decision overturns an earlier nine-judge bench ruling and paves the way for excluding the "creamy layer" from reservations.  

The judgment reintroduces the emphasis on "inadequacy of representation" as a criterion for backwardness, shifting focus from historical and social factors like "untouchability". It also raises concerns about potential misuse by states and could fuel  demand for a caste census.

The competition has become fierce,  with thousands of aspirants dedicating years of their youth to crack the exam. The low success rate leaves many feeling disappointed and disillusioned by the age of 32. The rise of  unregulated coaching centres exacerbates the issue, as they entice students with the promise of success without adequately assessing their abilities.  

The unregulated nature of these institutions makes it challenging for the government to intervene, leading to students wasting valuable time and resources. It is crucial to address this situation to ensure a more equitable and efficient system for aspiring civil servants.

This secretive approach mirrors a broader pattern of legislative practices by the BJP government, characterized by a lack of transparency, public consultation, and parliamentary debate.

The Indian government's recent memorandum outlines new guidelines for procurement contracts, shifting away from arbitration towards litigation. While this move aims to promote mediation, it is expected to overburden the already strained legal system, increase litigation costs and delay case resolutions.  

The decision is seen as a setback for India's arbitration hub aspirations, as it contradicts previous reforms and creates confusion for international firms. It also undermines trust in Indian arbitrators and risks driving domestic parties towards foreign arbitration seats.  

However, the potential for increased commercial court litigation could lead to the development of stronger jurisprudence in areas such as damages and indemnities. This shift could ultimately strengthen India's legal ecosystem if accompanied by government investment in infrastructure and training for judges and lawyers. Despite a bleak outlook for arbitration in the near future, there is hope for long-term improvement in India's commercial legal landscape.

### [Israel’s hard militarism has consequences for the whole region](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/israels-hard-militarism-has-consequences-for-the-whole-region-9487638/)

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a key Hamas negotiator, by Israel raises serious questions about the possibility of peace in the Middle East.  

Israel's hardline stance, marked by airstrikes and the killing of perceived enemies, fuels instability and increases the risk of regional war. The assassination, which took place on Iranian soil, demonstrates the depth of Israel's reach and threatens Iran's image and security.  

Without peace and stability, economic projects like the India-Middle-East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) are jeopardized. India, with its considerable economic interests and commitment to peace in the region, should continue to encourage dialogue and negotiations between Israel and Palestine.  

Meanwhile, the internal situation in Israel is also cause for concern, with right-wing groups protesting against alleged abuse of Palestinians and undermining the rule of law.

### [Before the landslide: A Wayanad story](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/before-the-landslide-a-wayanad-story-9487626/)

Kerala, a state known for its resilience, faces an annual onslaught of monsoon floods and landslides. Since 2018, the state has experienced five severe landslides, claiming 160 lives.  The 2024 landslides in Wayanad are particularly devastating, wiping out two entire villages. 

The recurring disasters highlight the urgency of implementing the recommendations from the Madhav Gadgil Committee (2011) and the K Kasturirangan-led High Level Working Group (2013). These reports emphasized the need to demarcate ecologically sensitive areas and impose restrictions on construction and development activities. However, public pressure and resistance from stakeholders, including farmers and the political class, led to the government rejecting these recommendations.

The tragedy in Wayanad underscores the need to integrate environmental conservation with development, ensuring the participation of local communities. Future disaster preparedness must prioritize infrastructure, political will, and policies that address the needs of Keralites.
